Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Big Lots due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Big Lots Posts Narrower than Expected Q3 Loss Big Lots posted adjusted net loss of 18 cents a share in third quarter fiscal 2019  which was narrower the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents  The bottom line came within management s guidance range of a loss of 15 25 cents  However  the quarterly loss was wider than a loss of 16 cents reported in the prior year quarter Net sales grew 1 6  to  1 168 million and came marginally ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 161 million  The top line increased on account of sales growth in high volume new stores coupled with higher store count  Notably  furniture was the top performing category registering a mid single digit comps growth in the quarter Comps decreased slightly by 0 1  against the company s expectations of flat comps for the third quarter  Although sales were sluggish in August  the company saw some sequential improvement in sales trends during September and October Gross profit increased 0 9  year over year to  463 4 million  while gross margin contracted 20 basis points  bps  to 39 7   The downside was caused by higher markdown rate and promotional expenses which was partially offset by favorable merchandise mix  The company forecasts gross margin for the fourth quarter to remain under pressure due to higher promotion expenses and adverse impact of tariffs  In the reported quarter  adjusted S A expenses came in at  433 2 million  up 5 3  year over year  However  the metric  as a percentage of net sales  remained unchanged in the same period last year Adjusted operating loss came in at  4 5 million  compared with the prior year quarter s operating income of  2 8 million Other Financial DetailsThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  62 million  Inventories increased 4  to  1 117 million  Long term debt totaled  501 million  up from  488 million in the prior year period  Total shareholders  equity was  762 3 million Management stated that increases in inventory were due to planned year over year sales increases and inventory builds in certain merchandise categories  including Furniture and Soft Home  However  the company forecasts inventory at the end of fourth quarter to be to be down slightly year over year Year to date  the company has returned about  87 million to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividend GuidanceBig Lots  anticipates comps to be positive in the fourth quarter  Also  management expects sales growth similar to what was witnessed in the third quarter  Based on these expectations  Big Lots envisions fourth quarter earnings per share between  2 40 and 2 55 compared with an earnings of  2 68 delivered in the year ago period For fiscal 2019  the company continues to expect adjusted earnings of  3 70  3 85 per share  However  the guided range is still below the prior year s reported figure of  4 04

123715,345230,BIG,Bull Of The Day  Tempur Sealy International  Inc   TPX ,opinion,"Tempur Sealy s  TPX  shares have soared over 80  during the last year to crush its industry s average and the S P 500  The mattress powerhouse returned to sales growth in 2018 and its expansion looks poised to continue as it proves it s ready to fight off challenges from digital upstarts through its own direct to consumer expansion and more 
The Pitch
Tempur Sealy is one of the world s largest bedding companies that offers everything from mattresses to pillows  under different brands  which include Tempur  Tempur Pedic  Sealy  Cocoon by Sealy  and Stearns   Foster  The company  which makes over 80  of its revenue in North America  has ramped up its digital and direct to consumer business in the Amazon  AMZN  age to help better compete against online based newcomers such as Casper 
Tempur Sealy topped our Q3 earnings and revenues estimates  with adjusted earnings up 28  and sales up 12 5   Both TPX s top and bottom line expansions marked the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for the firm  after it saw a downturn between the second quarter of 2017 and Q1 2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 
More specifically  direct channel sales soared 62  to account for roughly 14  of quarterly revenue  up from around 9  during the third quarter of 2018  This strength helped TPX s gross margin come in at 43 9   up from 41 1    In fact  during the third quarter we recognized the highest gross profit in the company s history  greater than what was generated previously across a larger presence   CEO Scott Thompson said in prepared Q3 remarks 
 Our double digit growth in operating income and adjusted EBITDA allows us to continue investing in our plants  products and people  while repurchasing our stock and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing our financial leverage  
Investors should note that Tempur Sealy recently began new partnerships with Big Lots  NYSE BIG   BIG  and Mattress Firm  The company also opened its 50th Tempur Pedic retail store in Q3 and management reaffirmed that it could open as many as 150 in the long run 
And one of the firm s newer offerings  the TEMPUR LUXEbreeze  recently landed on Popular Science s  awards list in 2019  The offering helps create a cooler sleeping surface  which could be a hit since the firm claims that  sleeping hot is the number one unmet consumer challenge in the sleep industry    with more than 60  of Americans struggling with this problem  
Other Fundamentals 
 
 
 
 
TPX stock is up 82  in the past year to destroy its Retail Home Furnishings Market s 24  average climb  This group includes the likes of RH  RH   Ethan Allen Interiors Inc   ETH   and others 
TPX shares are also up 15  in the last three months  but have cooled off recently  which could give the stock some room to run  TPX stock closed regular trading Wednesday at roughly  85 per share  This came in around 8  below its 52 week intraday highs of over  92 
Tempur Sealy s valuation has become a little stretched on the back of its climb  Still  TPX stock is trading below its three year highs in terms of forward 12 months sales and earnings  In fact  TPX is trading at 15 1X forward earnings  which matches its three year median and marks a discount against its 52 week median of 16 2X 
TPX currently holds  B  grades for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system and rests in the top 9  of our more than 250 Zacks industries  The firm has also returned value to shareholders through buybacks 
Outlook 
Looking ahead  our current Zacks estimates call for Tempur Sealy s fourth quarter sales to jump 14   with Q1 2020 projected to surge 17 2   These would both top Q3 s 12 5  sales expansion 
The company s full year fiscal 2019 sales are projected to pop 11 5  to hit  3 01 billion  Better still  TPX s fiscal 2020 revenues are expected to climb 16  above our current year estimate to reach  3 49 billion  Both of these figures would crush 2018 s marginal top line expansion and mark the company s strongest sales growth since 2014 
On the bottom end of the income statement  Tempur Sealy s adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to climb over 31  to  1 18 per share  with Q1 2020 set to soar 63  higher  Meanwhile  its full year EPS figure is expected to soar 28 4   And 2020 s earnings are then projected to surge another 46  to  5 55 a share 
Bottom Line
Tempur Sealy has topped our quarterly earnings estimates by roughly 15  in the trailing three periods  Plus  its 2019 and 2020 earnings outlook has climbed significantly since it reported its Q3 results in late October 
Overall  TPX s recent positive earnings revision trends help it earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  standing  The company s ability to successfully adapt to the direct to consumer age appears ready to help Tempur Sealy continue to thrive in a business segment that won t ever go out of style 
Tempur Pedic landed at No  1 in terms of customer satisfaction for the retail mattress segment in the J D  Power 2019 Mattress Satisfaction Report  And consumers are clearly willing to pay for quality when it comes to where they rest their heads at night  This means that investors might not want to sleep on Tempur Sealy stock 
The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  24 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  77 6 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2020-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bull-of-the-day-tempur-sealy-international-inc-tpx-200497500,200497500
123718,345233,BIG,Can Big Lots  BIG  Be A Worthy Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Big Lots  Inc    NYSE BIG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Big Lots has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 36  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 33  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Big Lots  current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 12 86 over the past five years The stock s PE however compares quite favorably with the Retail Wholesale Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 84  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile Big Lots has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 7 68  which is slightly higher than the current level  So  so it is fair to expect a increase in the stock price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Big Lots has a P S ratio of just 0 21  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 54x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Big Lots currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Big Lots a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Big Lots might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of C  This gives BIG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  While the current quarter estimate has seen one upward and three downward movements  the current year estimate has also seen one upward and three downward movements over the past two months This has had a negative effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus has decreased 1 6  over the past two months  the current year estimate has remained stable  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Big Lots  Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite such bearish analyst sentiments  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBig Lots is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 22  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ,2020-01-09,Zacks Investment

123722,345237,BIG,BIG Vs  TJX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Retail   Discount Stores sector might want to consider either Big Lots  NYSE BIG  or TJX  TJX   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Big Lots and TJX are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BIG has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
BIG currently has a forward P E ratio of 7 04  while TJX has a forward P E of 23 73  We also note that BIG has a PEG ratio of 0 98  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  TJX currently has a PEG ratio of 2 23 
Another notable valuation metric for BIG is its P B ratio of 1 37  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  TJX has a P B of 13 56 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to BIG s Value grade of B and TJX s Value grade of C 
BIG sticks out from TJX in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that BIG is the better option right now ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-vs-tjx-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200501530,200501530
123724,345239,BIG,Big Lots  BIG  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Big Lots  NYSE BIG  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Big Lots basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Big Lots  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Big Lots
For the fiscal year ending January   2020  this discount retailer is expected to earn  3 81 per share  which is a change of  5 7  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Big Lots  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line

123769,345284,BIG,Mnuchin Sells Tax Cut Coast to Coast as Public Doubts Mount,news," Bloomberg     Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is mounting a cross country roadshow to persuade businesses and the Republican faithful to put their weight behind a proposed tax overhaul from the Trump administration that so far lacks broad public support 
His tour has included stops in California  New Jersey and Ohio to speak to mostly friendly audiences of companies that stand to benefit from the tax bill  On Tuesday he delivered his earnest  scripted case for the legislation to managers of Ohio retail companies  an industry that expects its taxes to be slashed under the plan 
 I appreciate your help with this   said Jack Seibert  owner of a suburban Columbus jewelry store with six employees  He was the first of two pre selected questioners  and asked the Treasury secretary about the impact on small business 
Yet outside those hand picked groups  the Trump tax plan faces skepticism  if not outright opposition  About 52 percent of American voters disapprove of the proposals compared to 25 percent who favor them  while 59 percent say the bills favor the rich over the middle class  according to a nationwide Quinnipiac Poll taken Nov  7 13 and published Wednesday 
The final product is a moving target  with the Senate tax writing committee still working on its draft 
Johnson Opposition
Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said Wednesday he would vote against the Senate s tax plan as it s currently written  and two other Republican senators  Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska  voiced reservations about parts of it  Republicans can t lose more than two of their own votes in the Senate  if all Democrats oppose the legislation 
The House  meanwhile  is scheduled to vote on its tax overhaul bill Thursday  While it also provides deep rate cuts for corporations and many closely held businesses  the bill differs from the Senate plan in substantive ways  GOP leaders in both chambers will have to work out those differences before any tax overhaul can become law  President Donald Trump is scheduled to go to the House on Thursday to rally Republican members before the vote  which is expected to take place after 1 30 p m  New York time 
Tax Debate Update  House to Vote Thursday Afternoon
Mnuchin  a 54 year old former private equity manager who is new to politics  is seeking to simultaneously mobilize natural constituencies for Congress s rapidly evolving tax overhaul effort and confront damaging perceptions that its benefits largely won t accrue to the middle class  He s visited both red and blue states    New Jersey  Ohio and California    but his audiences have been friendly 
 1 000 Cut
 For a family making about  75 000 for a family of four  that will be over a  1 000 tax cut  which is quite significant   Mnuchin said in Ohio  where the median income is just over  50 000 
Left unsaid  Congress s official scorekeeper for tax legislation found last week that the Senate plan    at the time    would have meant an average tax cut of  58 000 for households earning  1 million or more a year  The plan has been revised since  to provide more middle class benefits upfront  but then wipe those changes off the books after 2026 
 The corporate cut  we expect  will be passed on in terms of wages and growth  and ultimately help middle class consumers  who since the recovery has not seen a bump in their paycheck  Mnuchin said 
Economists disagree about how much a corporate tax cut would spur wage growth  But Mnuchin points out that while the recovery from the financial crisis has been great for rich people  many other Americans have seen their incomes stagnate 
The data backs that up  Weekly earnings for full time wage and salary workers in the lower rungs of the earnings distribution have been crawling along since the 2007 09 downturn  even while the top 10 percent of earners saw their pay slowly pick up

Mnuchin  whose use of military aircraft for travel stirred controversy earlier this year  is sticking to commercial flights on this speaking tour  Everywhere he travels  often with chief of staff Eli Miller by his side  he promises businesses and voters that the president will sign legislation that will boost growth and reduce their tax forms to the size of a postcard in December 
In Columbus  Mnuchin spoke to retailers  such as L Brands  NYSE LB   Big Lots  NYSE BIG  and Abercrombie   Fitch who all have headquarters in central Ohio  The retail industry is celebrating Trump s pledge to cut corporate taxes  albeit nervously in fear that it gets delayed or doesn t happen 
 Anything that delays that or creates any uncertainty about what might happen in the future or puts it at risk is very problematic in terms of getting all the benefits that we want from all the effort   said Matthew Shay  head of the National Retail Federation 
For that reason  Mnuchin said  what s not up for debate is whether relief for corporations will be permanent  particularly provisions that would move the U S  code toward a so called territorial system that would focus on corporations  domestic economic activity 
 What s absolutely critical is that when you go from a worldwide system to a territorial system  that conversion is permanent   he told Bloomberg News   You can t go back and say that at the end of 10 years  we re going to go back to a worldwide system  
No Automakers
Missing from the audience in Columbus  and later during a business round table  were international automakers  a keystone to the local economy with operations in nine other states across the U S   including Texas and California  While the group supports the broader concept of new tax legislation  it is less sanguine about Trump s tax plan 
 We have been concerned with some of the provisions designed to address base erosion   said John Bozzella  CEO of Global Automakers  whose members include Honda and Toyota  The group is working with both houses of Congress to change provisions that it thinks targets international carmakers  creating an uneven playing field 
Earlier in the week  Mnuchin spoke to a group of 100 people invited by the White House in a fire hall in Bayville  New Jersey  He and Ivanka Trump  the president s daughter and an adviser  extolled the benefits of the tax package in a county where all but one of 33 towns chose Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton last year by a margin of 2 to 1 
It is  however  a state where some people would be particularly hard hit by one provision  A repeal of some  if not all  federal deductions for individuals  state and local taxes 
Small Business Focus
On his tour  Mnuchin is reaching out to small business owners  Seibert  the jewelry store owner who questioned the Treasury secretary in Columbus  said afterward he was satisfied with the secretary s pitch that small  to medium size companies would benefit 
Seibert said he would welcome being able to immediately expense purchases of tools and supplies  and he s banking on tax simplification because it now costs him about  2 000 to have his taxes prepared 
 If it s a post card sized tax return  I would welcome that    as I think would any small business owner and any American   Seibert said ",2017-11-16,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/mnuchin-sells-tax-cut-coasttocoast-as-public-doubts-mount-871856,871856

123814,345329,BIG,Earnings Preview  Big Lots  BIG  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Big Lots  NYSE BIG  reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  32 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 25 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Big Lots 
For Big Lots  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Big Lots will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Big Lots would post earnings of  0 69 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 92  delivering a surprise of  33 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Big Lots doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-big-lots-big-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200458080,200458080

This discount retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 24 93  
For the most recent quarter  Big Lots was expected to post earnings of  0 69 per share  but it reported  0 92 per share instead  representing a surprise of 33 33   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 30 per share  while it actually produced  2 68 per share  a surprise of 16 52  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Big Lots lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Big Lots has an Earnings ESP of  2 93  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on August 30  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss

123822,345337,BIG,U S  stock futures inch forward ahead of non farm payrolls ,news,"Investing com   Trading was muted stateside on Friday as investors decided to wait for the publication of the U S February employment report at 13 30GMT or 8 00AM ET to gleam clues on its possible effect on Federal Reserve  Fed  monetary policy moves 
After Wall Street managed to finish Thursday s session in the black  investors remained slightly bullish on Friday as the blue chip Dow futures rose 27 points  or 0 16   by 12 03GMT  or 7 03AM ET  the S P 500 futures edged up 3 points  or 0 17   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures gained 12 points  or 0 28  
Consensus forecast the world s largest economy to have created 190 000 non farm payrolls last month with the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 4 9   less than half the peak reached post crisis 
After a two and a half year run in employment creation  investors seemed to hope that the data will show a continuation of the improvement in the U S  economy while not being strong enough to bring forward Fed plans to continue the tightening cycle on American monetary policy 
Markets expected no move to be made at the March 15 16 policy meeting  but the jobs report will be the last piece of major economic data for the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  to digest before signaling the future path of interest rates 
The next policy meeting will be particularly key as it will be accompanied by updated economic projections along with a posterior press conference by Fed Chair Janet Yellen 
Along the same lines  as the U S  stock futures  the dollar was little changed against the other major currencies on Friday  At 12 05AM GMT or 7 05AM ET  EUR USD rose 0 26  to 1 0985  GBP USD down 0 16  at 1 4153  and USD JPY held steady at 113 68 
Contrary to the greenback and stock futures  gold benefitted from investor sentiment and rose around 1  in Friday s session to hit a 13 month high 
Meanwhile  crude also rose as official U S  data revealed that oil production hit its lowest level since November 2014  Crude oil futures for April delivery gained 0 35  to  34 69 by 12 07AM GMT or 7 07AM ET  while Brent oil traded up 0 51  to  37 26 
The business front on Wall Street is relatively quiet with only a handful of earnings reports  So far on Friday   Staples Inc   NASDAQ SPLS missed consensus with its quarterly earnings per share  EPS   while Big Lots  NYSE BIG  beat the street with its own EPS ",2016-03-04,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-stock-futures-inch-forward-ahead-of-non-farm-payrolls-387975,387975
123823,345338,BIG,Wall Street moves toward its first 3 week winning streak of the year,news,"Investing com   U S  stocks extended gains despite a negative open after a better than expected non farm payrolls  NFP  number from a monthly jobs report that only had one questionable caveat and investors eyed yet another strong rally of more than 2  in crude 
At 16 15GMT or 11 15AM ET  the Dow 30 rose 55 points or 0 32   while the S P 500 advanced 10 points or 0 51  and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite gained 20 points or 0 43   In this context  Wall Street is on track to tally up its first three week winning streak for the year 
The major news for Friday s session  and arguably for the week stateside  was the February employment report  The U S  economy created 242 000 jobs last month  blowing the consensus estimate of 190 000 out of the water 
The unemployment rate remained stable as expected at 4 9   an 8 year low 
The only negative data point was that average hourly earnings unexpectedly slipped 0 1   when analysts had forecast a 0 2  rise  This was the first contraction since January 2014 
Yet even so  economists pointed out that this data was most likely skewed to the downside due to a calendar effect of the survey being taken before workers who get paid bi monthly on the 15th of the month received their paycheck 
Nevertheless  the consensus of experts seemed to be that the data would have little effect on the Federal Reserve monetary policy  neither bringing forward rate hikes nor pushing them back  Markets do not count on a rate hike at the next Fed meeting on March 15 and 16 
Additionally  the Atlanta Fed increased its U S  Q1 GDP growth estimate to 2 2  from the prior 1 9  forecast published on March 1  precisely due to the report 
In other economic news  the U S  trade deficit widened more than expected in January to  45 7 billion  Both the strong dollar and a weak global demand served to push exports to a more than a five and a half year low  providing negative implications for growth in the U S  economy during the first quarter 
The dollar initially extended gains after the release of the jobs report  but later lost favor  The U S  Dollar Index  that compares the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies  traded down 0 39  to 97 23  EUR USD gained 0 52  to 1 1013  USD JPY rose 0 18  to 113 89  and GBP USD advanced 0 33  to 1 4223 
Commodities seemed particularly attractive to investors with U S  crude oil futures rising  0 84  or 2 43   to trade at  35 41 a barrel by 16 21GMT  or 11 21AM ET  and brent oil gaining  0 95 or 2 56  to  38 02  Gold futures marked their highest level in more than a year and was trading up 1 17  to  1 272 90 
Among market movers from earnings   Staples Inc   NASDAQ SPLS  slumped 1  after missing consensus with its quarterly earnings per share  EPS   while Big Lots  NYSE BIG  jumped close to 4  thanks to beating the street with its own EPS

The blue chip Dow futures edged forward 18 points  or 0 10   by 10 54AM GMT  or 6 54AM ET  the S P 500 futures rose 2 points  or 0 11   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 10 points  or 0 23  
Market participants were anxious to see if the generally dovish Yellen would echo the recent hawkish tone taken by fellow Fed officials and give any indications of her stance on timing for the continuation of monetary policy tightening 
Yellen  set to receive an award from the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University  will take part in conversations with former Fed chief Ben Bernanke and Harvard professor Gregory Mankiw 
Paradoxically  there is a timing issue with the event  While the Fed calendar listed the kickoff as 17 15GMT  or 13 15ET  the institution hosting the event had the conversation on the agenda for 16 30GMT  or 12 30ET 
Prior to the session s main event  the second estimate for the first quarter gross domestic product  GDP  will be released at 12 30GMT or 8 30AM ET  Expectations are for growth in the U S  economy in the first three months of the year to be revised up to 0 9   from the meager first reading of just 0 5  
At 14 00GMT  or 10 00AM ET  the University of Michigan will post the first revision to its consumer sentiment index for May with consensus looking for a slight downward revision from 95 8 to 95 4 
Meanwhile  oil prices retreated on Friday  moving away from the  50 psychological level as traders feared that the higher prices could reactivate crude production  contributing to the supply glut 
The stronger US Dollar Index  moving back towards a two month peak  also put pressure on black gold as it makes the commodity more expensive for those buyers using other currencies 
Additionally  investors looked ahead to the Baker Hughes  data on U S  oil rig count  which remained unchanged last week after eight straight weeks of declines

Fed fund futures  while waiting for the event later Friday  were pricing the odds of a June hike at 24   while the probability for tightening to happen in July was 55  
The economic data reports released on Friday gave Yellen and the rest of the Fed some data to chew over in the long list of things to consider in the run up to the June 15 meeting 
In a promising sign  the U S  economy grew more than originally thought in the first quarter  according the second estimate of gross domestic product that was released today  However  the revision fell short of consensus expectations 
American consumers showed optimism in May  although the Michigan consumer sentiment was revised down further than expected 
Also of note for the Fed in the report  the inflation expectations for the next 12 months dropped to 2 4   from the prior month s 2 8  reading  That was also the lowest level since 2010 and could take pressure off the Fed for tightening given the downward trend 
Despite the worse than expected data readings  the US Dollar Index pushed higher against the other major currencies on Friday  simultaneously putting pressure on oil prices as it makes crude more expensive for those buyers using other currencies 
Even though black gold managed to break through the  50 psychological level earlier this week  traders opted to take profits on fears that these levels of prices could serve to reactivate crude production in the U S   contributing to the supply glut 
In this regard  investors looked ahead to the Baker Hughes  data on U S  oil rig count  which remained unchanged last week after eight straight weeks of declines

123833,345348,BIG,Why Big Lots  BIG  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Big Lots  NYSE BIG   This company  which is in the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this discount retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 32 92   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Big Lots came out with earnings of  0 53 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 40 per share  representing a surprise of 32 50   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 69 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 92 per share  delivering a surprise of 33 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Big Lots  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Big Lots has an Earnings ESP of  3 85  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-11-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-big-lots-big-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200486788,200486788

123862,345377,BIG,Should Value Investors Consider Big Lots  BIG  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Big Lots  Inc    NYSE BIG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Big Lots has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 48  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 45  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Big Lots  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 23  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Big Lots has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 68  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Big Lots has a P S ratio of about 0 20  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 33 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  BIG is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Big Lots currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Big Lots a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Big Lots is just 0 83  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 08  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio comes in at 3 61  which is lower than the industry average of 16 52  Clearly  BIG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall    Though Big Lots might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of G and a Momentum Score of A  This gives BIG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower while the full year 2020 estimate has seen three upward revision compared to three downward in the same time period       This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has increased by 2 7  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has inched up by 1 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Big Lots  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Big Lots is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 9  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Big Lots has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Burlington Stores has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that BIG has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
BIG currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 14  while BURL has a forward P E of 24 11  We also note that BIG has a PEG ratio of 1 34  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  BURL currently has a PEG ratio of 1 42 
Another notable valuation metric for BIG is its P B ratio of 2 15  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  BURL has a P B of 35 28 
Based on these metrics and many more  BIG holds a Value grade of A  while BURL has a Value grade of C

Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large 
In addition to the Zacks Rank  investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system  Of course  value investors will be most interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with  A  grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment 
Big Lots  NYSE BIG  is a stock many investors are watching right now  BIG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as an A grade for Value  The stock has a Forward P E ratio of 9 88  This compares to its industry s average Forward P E of 20 71  Over the past year  BIG s Forward P E has been as high as 10 59 and as low as 6 27  with a median of 8 86 
Investors should also note that BIG holds a PEG ratio of 1 31  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  BIG s industry has an average PEG of 2 08 right now  Over the last 12 months  BIG s PEG has been as high as 1 40 and as low as 0 58  with a median of 0 83

123889,345404,BIG,Big Lots  BIG  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Big Lots  NYSE BIG  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Big Lots basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Big Lots  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Big Lots
For the fiscal year ending January   2020  this discount retailer is expected to earn  3 68 per share  which is a change of  8 9  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Big Lots  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 5  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Big Lots to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-05-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-lots-big-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200424867,200424867

Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the  Value  category  When paired with a high Zacks Rank   A  grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today

123892,345407,BIG,Earnings Preview  Big Lots  BIG  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Big Lots  NYSE BIG  reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 29 billion  up 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 15  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Big Lots 
For Big Lots  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Big Lots will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Big Lots would post earnings of  2 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 68  delivering a surprise of  16 52  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Big Lots doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-big-lots-big-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200424904,200424904

123943,345458,BIG,Big Lots Options Traders Brace For A Monster Earnings Move,opinion,"Shares of Big Lots  Inc   NYSE BIG  are down 1 8  at  48 20  at last check  as discount retailers swoon in sympathy with Dollar Tree  NASDAQ DLTR  and Dollar General  DG   Big Lots is slated to unveil its own second quarter earnings report before the market opens tomorrow  Aug  31  Below we will take a look at how BIG stock has been performing on the charts  and dive into what the options market has priced in for the shares  post earnings moves 
Big Lots stock has rebounded nearly 28  since its June 1 two year low of  36 20  However  the shares have struggled to overtake the  48  50 region    where they landed after a post earnings bear gap in March  This area is also now the home to BIG s 200 day moving average 

Looking at the stock s earnings history  BIG has closed lower the day after the company reported in five of the last eight quarters  including the last four in a row  Over the past two years  the shares have averaged a 3 8  move the day after earnings  regardless of direction  This time around  the options market is pricing in a 10 1  move for Friday s trading    more than double the norm 
Digging deeper  it looks like recent options buyers are betting on Big Lots to break its streak of negative earnings reactions  Data from the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX  shows BIG with a 10 day call put volume ratio of 9 87  suggesting nearly 10 calls have been bought to open for every put in the past two weeks  What s more  this ratio ranks in the 96th percentile of its annual range  suggesting a much healthier than usual appetite for bullish bets over bearish of late 
As such  BIG s Schaeffer s put call open interest ratio  SOIR  of 0 46 ranks in the 14th percentile of its annual range  This indicates that near term call open interest more than doubles put interest right now  and that short term traders have rarely been more call biased in the past year 
However  some of the recent call buying    particularly at out of the money strikes    could be attributable to BIG shorts seeking an options hedge before earnings  Short interest accounts for 24  of the stock s total available float  At BIG s average pace of trading  it would take shorts nearly two full weeks to buy back their bearish bets ",2018-08-31,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-lots-options-traders-brace-for-a-monster-earnings-move-200341598,200341598
123944,345459,BIG,Analysts Estimate Big Lots  BIG  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Big Lots  NYSE BIG  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This discount retailer is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 00 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  100  
Revenues are expected to be  1 14 billion  up 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Big Lots 
For Big Lots  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  599 79  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Big Lots will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Big Lots would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  11 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Big Lots doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-big-lots-big-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200364052,200364052
123945,345460,BIG,Big Lots  BIG  Reports Q3 Loss  Tops Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Big Lots  NYSE BIG  came out with a quarterly loss of  0 16 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 01  This compares to earnings of  0 06 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  1 500   A quarter ago  it was expected that this discount retailer would post earnings of  0 67 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 59  delivering a surprise of  11 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Big Lots  which belongs to the Zacks Retail   Discount Stores industry  posted revenues of  1 15 billion for the quarter ended October 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 90   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 11 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Big Lots shares have lost about 28 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 8  
What s Next for Big Lots 
While Big Lots has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Big Lots was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 93 on  1 60 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  4 44 on  5 23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

124014,345529,BIG,Here s Why Big Lots  BIG  Could Be A Great Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Big Lots  Inc    NYSE BIG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Big Lots has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 55  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 50  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Big Lots  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 14 40 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a great entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail   Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 30 66  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Big Lots has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 35  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Big Lots stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Big Lots has a P S ratio of about 0 46  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 52 right now  making the stock undervalued from this aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Big Lots currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Big Lots a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Big Lots is just 0 84  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 60  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 19  which is far better than the industry average of 16 47  Clearly  BIG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Big Lots might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of B  This gives BIG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter and full year have both seem four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no downward revisions This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Big Lots  Inc  Price and Consensus    Given this bullish trend  the stock sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which is why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBig Lots is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  this Zacks Rank  2 company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank  among top 10  of more than 250 industries   hinting at favorable broader factors  In fact  over the past year  the industry has surpassed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun

124015,345530,BIG,Is Big Lots  BIG  Set To Beat Earnings Estimates ,opinion,"Market volatility is not behind us  and neither is fourth quarter earnings season  Therefore  investors should still be on the lookout for stocks that are poised to top Q4 earnings estimates 
Last week  retail industry investors locked in on Walmart s   NYSE WMT   holiday quarter earnings results to see if the company could keep up its torrid e commerce growth  The big box retail giant s online sales slowed as competition from Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   intensifies  scaring off some investors  But there is still time to look for retailers that are set to surge after their earnings reports  
One such stock is Big Lots   NYSE BIG    This off price retail company is projected to see its revenues hit  1 65 billion  which would mark a 4 41  year over year jump  Big Lots is also expected to see its Q4 earnings reach  2 42 per share 
Investors will be glad to know that Big Lots is projected to expand its bottom line by over 7   But  investors also need to know if they should expect Big Lots to actually top this solid EPS estimate 
Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat  Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Big Lots is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and rocks a  B  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  Paired with its Earnings ESP of 0 87   which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of Big Lots Q4 results  investors should consider BIG as one that could top earnings estimates 
Investors should also note that Big Lots has topped or matched earnings estimates for three straight years 
Big Lots is set to report its Q4 and fiscal 2017 earnings results on Friday  March 2

Corp    NASDAQ ON  Screen of the Week by Zacks Investment Research These 5 Stocks Flaunt Impressive Interest Coverage RatioYou can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio   the Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks

124122,345637,BIG,5 Low Leverage Stocks That Will Boost Your Portfolio ,opinion,In the complex world of investment  understanding the amount of financial leverage a company bears is crucial  With capital being one of the basic factors of production  companies   especially those facing a dearth of resources   need exogenous funds to finance their corporate expenses  run operations smoothly as well as expand the realm of their business  Among equity and debt   the two most common options used to boost a company s future earnings   debt is the more popular one  This is perhaps due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing This is because when a company resorts to debt financing  it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a specific time period  However  in case of equity financing  a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but also has a direct claim on the company s future profits Yet  debt financing has its share of drawbacks  The problem arises when leverage  referred to as the amount of debt a company bears  becomes exorbitant  A high degree of financial leverage means high interest payments  which affect the company s bottom line Of course  this does not mean that corporations should totally avoid debt financing  In fact  it has been an inherent instrument for corporations to grow their earnings Nevertheless  to be on the safe side  investors try to avoid stocks that bear large debt loads  Empirically  several leverage ratios have been constructed to measure the exact amount of debt risk a company bears in order to safeguard investors from debt traps Debt to equity ratio is one such measure  perhaps the most popular one  which has been used to evaluate a company s credit worthiness  for potential equity investments Analyzing Debt to EquityDebt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears  A company with a lower debt to equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity With the Q3 reporting season drawing to a close  companies recording higher earnings growth will attract investors  However  blindly pursuing high earnings yielding stocks  which have a high debt to equity ratio  might drain all your money before you know The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned discussion  to ensure safe returns it is wise for investors to choose stocks bearing low debt to equity ratio However  an investment strategy based solely on debt to equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome  To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns  we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors Here are the other parameters Debt Equity less than X Industry Median  Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers Current Price greater than or equal to 10  The stocks must be trading at a minimum of  10 or above Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change in EPS F 0  F  1  greater than X Industry Median  Earnings growth adds to optimism  leading to a stock s price appreciation Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than 5  This shows earnings growth expectation Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 have a proven history of success Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt to equity ratio  here are five of the 17 stocks that made it through the screen Big Lots  Inc    NYSE BIG    It is a broad line

124148,345663,BIG,5 Broker Favorite Stocks To Keep An Eye On,opinion,Proper guidance is often the difference between success and failure in life  The same holds true for the investing world as well  The need for proper guidance from brokers is all the more required now as the Q3 earnings season is underway and investors will target stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the current reporting cycle  This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation The task of designing one s portfolio with outperformers is by no means an easy one  This is because  a deluge of stocks flood the market at any given point in time  In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   for an investor  Proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers  who are deemed experts  equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far the field of investing is concerned Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Be Guided by Broker Advice Brokers  not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents  but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Naturally  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio  The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa One of the well accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions  For instance  in the face of extremely low oil prices  analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates  Naturally  adding such stocks to one s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy  Similarly  analysts might trim estimates and downgrade a stock following adverse events like lackluster earnings or pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Unsurprisingly  investors look to offload such stocks from their portfolio on the basis of broker advice To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has also been included  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line  thereby making the strategy foolproof Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top

estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter To ensure that the strategy is a winning one  covering all bases  we have added the following screening parameters Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio the better  Companies meeting this criterion are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio Price greater than 5  A stock trading below

124149,345664,BIG,Solid Start To Q3 Dispels Ghosts Of  87 Crash  5 Must Buys,opinion,"When things go wrong on Wall Street  all of us remember  One such event was Oct  19  1987  when the stock market collapsed following a deluge of sell orders  Many blamed program trading strategies for the indiscriminate sale of stocks on overvaluation concerns 
U S  stocks  at present  are trading at an all time high and enjoying a bull run that began almost nine years ago  Nevertheless  some investors were concerned that such lofty valuations may mean that a correction is overdue  signaling at an impending crash again 
The Dow Jones and the S P 500  however  overcame such selling pressure and eked out records on Oct  19  2017  which marked the 30th anniversary of the  87 crash  Political tensions in Europe and lackluster economic reports out of China also failed to dampen investors  sentiments 
So what helped the broader market fight the ghost of  87  Robust third quarter earnings results provided a fillip to the equity market  with American corporations showing signs of strength on the back of an improving economy  Furthermore  the White House s intention to slash corporate taxes is also providing much needed windfall to such companies  
Banking on such positive trends  investing in sound stocks that can make the most of the third quarter earnings season seems judicious  Here  we should bear in mind that better than expected earnings performances generally lead to a rally in the share price  which enthralls almost everyone right from the top brass to research analysts 
The Crash of 1987
Panic swept trading floors on Oct  19  1987  when the Dow Jones plummeted a then record 508 points   reflecting a 22  decline  By comparison  the notorious Black Tuesday crash of October 24  1929  which preceded the Great Depression  saw stocks plunge by only 13    
A weak dollar  inflation  trade deficit  and conflict in the Middle East were cited as some of the reasons that had led to the crash 
However  the most popular explanation for the  87 crash was selling by program traders  In program trading  computers automatically perform rapid stock executions based on the price of related securities  Thus  the selloff took place as the market was pricey and investors were over bullish 
With U S  stocks currently hovering at record high territories  similarly steep losses were being predicted  However  robust earnings kept the market from retreating too far  Even though the Dow Jones was down more than 100 points at one point on Oct  19  2017  the blue chip index rose 5 49 points to close at 23 163 04  The S P 500 also edged up 0 84 point to 2 562 10 
Robust Start to Q3 Earnings 
Among the 52 S P 500 members that have reported so far  earnings are up 13 3  from the same period last year on 6 9  higher revenues  with 76 9  of companies beating EPS estimates and 73 1  surpassing revenue estimates 
Total third quarter earnings are expected to be up 3  from the same period last year on 4 9  higher revenues  Such positive results will follow double digit growth in both the first and second quarter for the S P 500 companies  read more  Positive Start to the Q3 Earnings Season  
Economy in Great Shape
A key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States scaled a 13 year high in September  while non manufacturing activity rallied to a 12 year high  According to the Institute of Supply Management  ISM   the manufacturing index climbed to 60 8  in September from 58 8  in August  The non manufacturing gauge was at 59 8  last month  as compared with 55 3  in the prior month  read more  U S  Manufacturing Activity Hits 13 Year High  Top 5 Winners      
Meanwhile  the September jobs report showed the first monthly decline in payrolls in seven years  Investors  however  mostly ignored the surprise contraction  which was led by unprecedented events such as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma 
Let s not forget that even during such trying times  the unemployment rate remained at a 16 year low and hourly pay increased 2 9  in the last 12 months  up from 2 7  in the prior month and also in line with a post recession high 
Additionally  U S  GDP expanded 3 1  in the second quarter  which is close to the range expected by President Trump and some other Republicans  It is also up slightly from a previously reported 3   An uptick in consumer outlays and business investments drove the upside 
Senate Passes Budget Blueprint
Trump s initiative to overhaul the U S  tax code overcame a critical bottleneck  when the Senate approved a budget blueprint for fiscal 2018  This has paved the way for the Republicans to pursue the much awaited tax cut reform without Democratic support 
The far reaching plan will trim taxes for corporations  Lowering the domestic tax rate could result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash  Bringing back cash held overseas will let these companies carry out share buybacks  pay dividends and get involved in M A activities

124150,345665,BIG,Zacks com Highlights  Dean Foods  Big Lots  AMC Entertainment Holdings  Commercial Metals And Delek US Holdings,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Oct 23  2017   Stocks in this week s article include  Dean Foods Company  Big Lots  NYSE BIG   AMC Entertainment Holdings  Inc   Commercial Metals Company and Delek US Holdings  Inc Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research  5 Broker Favorite Stocks to Keep an Eye OnProper guidance is often the difference between success and failure in life  The same holds true for the investing world as well  The need for proper guidance from brokers is all the more required now as the Q3 earnings season is underway and investors will target stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the current reporting cycle  This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation The task of designing one s portfolio with outperformers is by no means an easy one  This is because  a deluge of stocks flood the market at any given point in time  In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   for an investor  Proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers  who are deemed experts  equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far the field of investing is concerned Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Be Guided by Broker AdviceBrokers  not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents  but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Naturally  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio  The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa One of the well accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions  For instance  in the face of extremely low oil prices  analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates  Naturally  adding such stocks to one s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy  Similarly  analysts might trim estimates and downgrade a stock following adverse events like lackluster earnings or pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Unsurprisingly  investors look to offload such stocks from their portfolio on the basis of broker advice To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has also been included  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line  thereby making the strategy foolproof Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks   change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10  This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter To ensure that the strategy is a winning one  covering all bases  we have added the following screening parameters Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio the better  Companies meeting this criterion are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio Price greater than 5  A stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors Average Daily Volume greater than 100 000 shares over the last 20 trading days  Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily

124155,345670,BIG,5 Of The Best Retail Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"It has been quite challenging for retailers over the past several years  with many facing store closures  Growth in e commerce significantly changed the way consumers shop  while natural calamities like hurricanes impacted many retailers more recently 
Even though retailers mostly flopped this year  things are starting to turn around  Many retailers are poised to open new stores as September sales rose at the highest rate since 2015  And with the holiday shopping season around the corner  sales are expected to improve 
Meanwhile  consumer confidence crushed expectations and scaled to its highest level in October since 2004  As American consumers are gaining confidence in the economy  things are looking up for retailers  Thus  let us keep an eye on retail stocks that are likely to make the most of the third quarter earnings season 
Is the Retail Death Overhyped 
Investors have been concerned about a sizeable number of bankruptcies and store closures in the retail space over the last several years  Sporting goods  clothing  and electronics retailers  in particular  closed stores to curtail expenses and subsequently drive profits  There has also been a significant decline in comparable store sales  mostly due to a rise in online deals  
However  of late  companies closing stores are often referred to as attention seeking  as a large number of stores are actually being opened  As per IHL Group  the total net increase of stores planned for 2017  including retail and restaurants  is 4 080  Core retail stores  which excludes restaurants  are anticipated to see a net gain of 1 326 this year 
The store openings are mainly driven by a broad based gain in retail sales last month  including those that have been the hardest hit by bankruptcies and store closures over the past year  Overall U S  retail sales climbed 1 6  in September from August  marking the highest increase since March 2015  Retail sales received a sizeable boost from automobiles  gasoline stations  and building materials  Excluding such categories and foodservices  retail sales were up 0 4  
Holidays Right Around the Corner
Retail sales are expected to gain further traction this year thanks to the upcoming holiday shopping season  Both Black Friday and Cyber Monday  historically  have seen retail sales move north  According to Adobe Digital Insights  consumers had spent a solid  3 34 billion on Black Friday and  3 45 billion on Cyber Monday 
Respondents surveyed said that Wal Mart Stores Inc   NYSE WMT   is the most sought after destination for the upcoming Black Friday weekend  while Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   is the top destination for the Cyber Monday holiday 
In fact  this year  holiday retail sales for the upcoming two months are expected to grow  According to the National Retail Federation  retail sales in November and December are projected to increase between 3 6  and 4  over last year  with an estimated total of  678 75 billion to  682 billion 
Consumers Gain Confidence
Another thing investors should consider is the renewed faith that Americans have in the economy  According to the University of Michigan  the U S  Consumer Sentiment Index touched 101 1 this month  up from 95 1 last month  Such a record consumer confidence number is a significant reading since it has been historically good at predicting consumer spending for the next three to six months  The more confidence households generate  the more will they spend and  in turn  boost the revenues of retailers 
Household optimism was largely driven by falling gas prices and underlying strength in the labor market  A clearer view of last month s labor market data  in the meanwhile  showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside  the U S  employment scenario is continuing to tighten 
The unemployment rate declined to 4 2  last month  the lowest since February 2001  while wages increased 0 5  to an average of  26 55 an hour  per the Labor Department data  In fact  in the last 12 months  hourly pay increased 2 9   up from 2 7  in the prior month and in line with a post recession high

124182,345697,BIG,5 Stocks In The Limelight On Recent Analyst Upgrades,opinion,With the Q3 earnings season round the corner for most of the sectors  investors will be eager to add stocks that have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the quarter  This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation Investors  after all  while putting their hard earned money in the stock market  are governed by the sole objective of generating handsome returns from their portfolio  No one wants to see his her hard earned money go down the drain However  the task of designing one s portfolio with potential outperformers is anything but an easy one  In fact  equity market tricks are not easy to master with a plethora of stocks flooding the space at any point of time  The task becomes even more difficult when one tries to select a winning portfolio without proper guidance  With the time constraint confronting us these days  it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by the experts in the field Broker Advice to the RescueThe concerned experts are brokers  Brokers  irrespective of their types  sell side  buy side or independent  undertake thorough research of the stocks covered by them They have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors   To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations   Consequently  the opinion of brokers should act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Winning PointerThe action of brokers is by no means arbitrary and is instead guided by sound logic  Thus  the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock For example  an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  a stock may fall out of analysts  favor due to adverse events like pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Trimming of earnings estimates by brokers often leads to stock price depreciation  Naturally  investors would look to dump such stocks on the basis of broker advice One of the well accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions  For instance  in the face of extremely low oil prices  analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates   Naturally  adding such stocks to one s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy Making the Most of Broker OpinionsBy following broker actions  one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks  Keeping this in mind  we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has been included  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line  making the strategy foolproof Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks   change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10  This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter To ensure that the strategy is a winning one  covering all bases  we have added the following screening parameters Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio the better  companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio Price greater than 5  A stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors Average Daily Volume greater than

124186,345701,BIG,Dollar Tree Up 32  In 3 Months  Solid Comps The Sole Factor ,opinion,Dollar Tree  Inc    NASDAQ DLTR   seems to be on a roll  With a splendid comparable store sales  comps  performance backed by solid strategic initiatives  the company has been constantly adding new leaves to its growth story  The reflection of the same is quite evident from the stock s impressive performance  Notably  the company has gained 32 2  in the past three months  thanks to its upbeat second quarter fiscal 2017 results and an encouraging view  Moreover  this department store retailer surged 14 5  year to date  against the  s 1 2  drop  While a challenging retail landscape and reduction in SNAP benefits could act as deterrents  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s growth efforts are likely to keep it going  Nevertheless  let s delve deeper into Dollar Tree s growth drivers Superb Comps RecordDollar Tree has been witnessing remarkable comps growth  backed by its competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans  including remodeling and relocations  Incidentally  the company s second quarter fiscal 2017 marked 38th straight quarter of comps growth  The second quarter comps growth was backed by improved transaction count  as well as average ticket  Moreover  the company anticipates comps growth in a low single digit range for the third quarter and fiscal 2017  thus reflecting further growth potential  Focus on Store Expansion Bodes WellDollar Tree is progressing well with its growth initiatives  which include store expansion strategies  enhancement of store productivity  creating new store formats  tapping of new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve patrons better  Also  we remain confident that the company will continue to implement strategies such as increasing consumables mix  rolling out freezers coolers at stores along with multi price point expansion to boost top line performance Family Dollar s Integration Boosts ResultsThe mega merger of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar has been benefiting the former ever since the deal was concluded in July 2015  Notably  sales from the Family Dollar banner represented more than 50  of the company s consolidated sales in the second quarter  Further  Dollar Tree is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers  While increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re banner process are expected to weigh on the company s results for some time  it expects to generate annual run rate synergies worth  300 million by the end of the third year of this buyout Outlook Fuels EstimatesAll these factors  along with contributions from the company s online business Dollar Tree Direct  helped it post robust financial numbers in the second quarter  Evidently  both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Also  management raised its outlook for fiscal 2017  reflecting confidence in the second half performance Dollar Tree  Inc  Price and Consensus     The company now forecasts net sales for fiscal 2017  which will contain an additional week  in the band of  22 07  22 28 billion  compared with the old projection of  21 95  22 25 billion  Earnings per share is expected in the range of  4 44  4 60  compared with the previous forecast of  4 17  4 43  Well  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2017 has gone up by 4 cents and 21 cents to 89 cents and  4 66 respectively  in two months Possible DeterrentsPresident Trump is suggesting on reducing food stamps program by  193 billion  which is approximately 25  of the budget for the program  Cut in SNAP benefit may hamper Dollar Tree performance as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict spending to low margin products  Thus  reduction in SNAP benefit could pose hurdles to the company Also  management stated that it expects store payroll expenses to remain pressurized on account of the elevating minimum wages  We believe that this could raise the SG A costs and hurt the operating margin  Additionally  stiff competition from other industry players and the growing online dominance of Amazon com Inc    NASDAQ AMZN   pose a threat to Dollar Tree However  we expect Dollar Tree s growth endeavors to tide over the obstacles and help the company keep up its solid show on the bourses Looking for More Promising Bets  Check These Trending PicksBurlington Stores Inc    NYSE BURL   has an impressive earnings surprise history and a

124205,345720,BIG,Back to College Shopping To Hit All Time High  Top 5 Gainers,opinion,As summer vacation is coming to a close  it s time for students to head back to colleges and schools  This time around  however  back to college and back to school spending is expected to reach record high levels as more students are expected to join institutions  and most notably  consumers are regaining confidence  The increased confidence can be attributed to an improving economy and healthy labor market As spending levels are poised to scale record highs  retailers have been witnessing an uptick in sales  Retail stocks are already moving north in a relief rally as second quarter earnings came in better than expected  Given such bullish trends  investing in sound retail stocks seems to be prudent Back to College Season  A Big Event on the HorizonAccording to the National Retail Federation s  NRF  annual survey  back to college spending is expected to surpass  54 billion  This figure had bottomed out in 2015  declining 19  from the peak reached in 2012  But since then  spending has increased 25  Deciding to send your child to college will be one of the most expensive financial decisions a family will make  and back to college costs  think dorm room necessities and textbooks  for instance  add up  Families are expected to spend an average of  969 88 this year  compared with  888 72 last year College students expect to spend mostly on electronics  with costs poised to hit  12 8 billion  Back to college spending will also impact a wide variety of other industries  including clothing and snacks and food items  while online  discount  and department stores are pegged to be top shopping destinations for families Overall  back to school spending is expected to rise to its second highest level on record  Families with children in elementary through high school plan to spend a total of  29 5 billion  up from  27 3 billion last year  Parents are expected to spend an average of  204 33   238 89   130 38 and  114 12 on electronics  apparel  shoes and school supplies  respectively  In fact  it is shoes and school supplies that are expected to see the highest increase And this year  the combined back to college and back to school spending is anticipated to touch  83 6 billion  This will be the second biggest haul after  83 8 billion  Spending is likely to rise on pent up demand following the prolonged recession when parents curtailed purchases What s Behind the Upbeat Projections College enrollments have jumped this year  as students are more likely to live in off campus housing  according to Katherine Cullen  director of retail and consumer research at NRF  This  in turn  will drive spending on home goods across several categories like snacks and beverages  Retail stocking stuffers  from Ramen noodles to futons  are well positioned to lure these shoppers Electronics also constitute a large portion of students  budget  as laptops are popular among 35  of this age group  while 40  plan to buy a tablet  Needless to say  apparel  footwear and classic school supplies continue to be popular among back to school candidates Not only are more young adults enrolling in colleges  thus boosting spending levels  but greater consumer confidence is also playing a significant role  And the more confident consumers are  the more they spend  As per a survey by The University of Michigan  the consumer sentiment index rose to 97 6 in August  the highest since January Consumer sentiment returned to peak levels on a more positive outlook for the overall economy  Americans spent more in the spring driving the U S  economy beyond the  19 trillion mark for the first time  Real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2 6  in the second quarter and almost doubled the downwardly revised 1 2  pace of growth in the first quarter Consumer sentiment was also driven by the strongest labor market in years  The United States added 16 6 million jobs since 2010  driving the unemployment rate down to nearly a 16 year low of 4 4   In fact  the U S  job market roared back to life in June  with a better than expected 222 000 job additions  Payroll in May and April was revised higher to 152 000 and 207 000  respectively Gad Levanon  chief economist North America  for the Conference Board said that  the strong job growth in June and the upward revisions for May and April suggest that the concerns about a major slowdown in job growth were premature   Employment gains have averaged 180 000 a month this year and several economists believe that the economy might need to add only 100 000 jobs on a regular basis to maintain growth levels 5 Retail Stocks to Rally on Back to College Shopping SpreeBack to college spending is expected

124210,345725,BIG,Top Analyst Reports For Honeywell  Accenture   PetroChina ,opinion,"Wednesday  August 30  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Honeywell  HON   Accenture  ACN  and PetroChina  PTR   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Honeywell s shares have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the year to date period  gaining  20 6  vs  a  1 6  decline  The Zacks analyst likes the company s diversified business portfolio and balanced organic and inorganic model  A diligent focus on working capital management  free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positives 
With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity  Honeywell remains focused on increasing its presence in high growth regions  However  adverse foreign currency translations  high R D expenses to fend off competition and volatility in commodity prices are likely to peg back its growth momentum to some extent  In addition  Honeywell has yet to witness signs of stabilization in some of its major end markets and expects a tepid demand pattern for its business jets and mobile scanners in 2017 
 You can 
Shares of Accenture have outperformed the Zacks Consulting industry over the last one year  gaining  15 1  vs   14   The Zacks analyst likes Accenture s latest product additions in the analytics application space  given the increasing demand for digital solutions  Moreover  Accenture s strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging 
The acquisitions have enabled Accenture to enter new markets  diversify and broaden its product portfolio  and maintain its leading position  Nonetheless  Accenture s recent announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of  1 4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across U S  cities may dent its bottom line results  Furthermore  increasing competition from peers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent 
 You can  
ADRs of PetroChina have declined  15 1  over the last six months  underperforming the Zacks International Integrated Energy industry  which has inched up  0 2  over the same period  But with higher oil prices helping the state run giant report a jump in first half profits  the stock might return to favor  The energy titan s biggest unit   exploration and production   swung to profitability as oil price soared 50  
PetroChina also experienced strong natural gas demand  while operational optimization helped control costs  However  the Zacks analyst is concerned over China s decision to cut natural gas prices for industrial users that reduced margins in the company s gas wholesale business  Limited international operations and an ambitious investment program gives investors more reason to steer clear of the stock

124215,345730,BIG,5 Broker Friendly Stocks To Counter Market Uncertainties,opinion,The U S  equity market has been subdued due to domestic as well as international factors  Concerns pertaining to

the lookout for stocks that would fetch them handsome returns  They are  after all  spending their hard earned money in the stock market and would not want the amount to go down the drains  Maintaining a well diversified portfolio  selecting stocks from different industries  is a tried and tested strategy to tackle the uncertainties and get handsome returns The task is  however  easier

arriving at their investment decision  buy  sell or hold    The experts in the field of investing are brokers  Why Broker Advice is Crucial Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Since brokers arrive at their recommendation  Buy  Sell or Hold  on a stock after thoroughly analyzing the minute details associated with the company  it is natural for investors to be guided by estimate revisions while arriving at investment decisions  Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario   Similarly  a stock may fall out of analysts  favor due to adverse events like pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Trimming of earnings estimates by brokers often leads to stock price depreciation  Naturally  investors tend to dump such stocks on the basis of broker advice Designing a Winning PortfolioTo take care of the performance with

124223,345738,BIG,These 5 Stocks Flaunt Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision  A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio   the Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of

124247,345762,BIG,Kohl s To Expand Stores   E Commerce  Plans Rightsizing,opinion,"Kohl s Corporation   NYSE KSS   has recently announced plans to expand the capabilities of its e Commerce network and also invest in store base by opening four new small format stores  The company is also focused on optimizing and rightsizing store space across a number of Kohl s outlets 
Store and Facility Development Plans 
Kohl s plans to commence shipping operations of it s recently opened fifth e Commerce fulfillment center in Plainfield  IN by the end of this month  The centre would mainly cater to filing  processing and shipping of orders from its website  Kohls com  The 937 000 square feet facility is well equipped with advanced technology for maximizing throughput and productivity 
Additionally  the company plans to launch four small format stores in October 2017  adding to its existing fleet of eight small format stores that were opened in 2016  The new stores would be located at North Smithfield  RI  Blue Ash  OH  East Windsor  NJ and Montebello  CA  The new stores would be close to 35 000 square feet in size 
Owing to their small size  these stores will be flexible and can easily be adapted for localized merchandise  Moreover  these stores will have kiosks for online shopping from Kohl s website and would also serve as pick up locations for online purchases 
Kohl s store development plans also incorporate optimizing and rightsizing store space to better serve customers and also operate in a more efficient manner  The company has plans to lessen operations in half of its stores by the end of 2017  This would require the stores to balance its inventory and adjust fixtures 
In this respect  the company has already optimized store space in close to 300 stores to include new layouts  making them operationally smaller  Rightsizing initiatives also include opening a single level 55 000 square feet store in Greenfield  WI  relocating the same from its existing two level 85 000 square feet store located nearby at Southridge Mall 
Initiatives to Improve Sales 
Kohl s has also been undertaking a number of initiatives to attract more shoppers to its stores and improve sales  Lately  the company has started offering famous brands from outside the United States and cutting down on the number of in house clothing brands it sells  Kohl s has started selling Under Armour products  as well as Clarks shoes and is looking for other brands to add to its store aisles 
The company also plans to continue its best selling private label brands such as Sonoma  Croft   Barrow and Apt  9 that had delivered strong sales in the recently reported second quarter fiscal 2017 results  Kohl s has also been undertaking several initiatives to reduce its inventory and improve merchandise margins that benefited the company s second quarter earnings 
Lower Comps Posing Concern 
Despite such efforts to boost sales and store traffic  the company s comps have been declining over the past few quarters  Lower spending on apparel and accessories  competition from discount retailers and cautious consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores  This signals that its turnaround initiative named  Greatness Agenda   which began in 2014  is failing to deliver results 
The initiative was designed to increase transactions per store and sales  Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015  the quarterly growth rates moderated gradually  thus posing a concern  Moreover  comps have now declined consecutively in the last six quarters  including the recently reported second quarter fiscal 2017 results 
These headwinds are well reflected in the company s share price performance  The stock has declined 15 1  in the past year  in comparison to the broader  sector  which grew 10 6  

Given the industry wide challenges impacting Kohl s comps growth  investors need to wait and see whether its ongoing store expansion and rightsizing efforts prove to be effective 
Kohl s currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

124297,345812,BIG,Is Wal Mart  WMT  Poised For A Beat This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Retail giant Wal Mart Stores Inc    NYSE WMT    is set to report second quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Aug 17  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether the company will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to be reported quarter  In fact  the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average of 2 98  
Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model shows that Wal Mart is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks Earnings ESP   which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  0 94  This is because the Most Accurate estimate is  1 07  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  1 08 per share  This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Wal Mart currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Wal Mart s Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  0 94  makes us optimistic about a possible earnings beat 
Which Way are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review inched up 0 9  over the last seven days and is currently pegged at  1 07 per share  down 0 47  from the year ago quarter  For fiscal 2017  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the last seven days and is pegged at  4 36 per share  up 0 99  from the prior year quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  122 80 billion and  495 57 billion for the second quarter and fiscal 2018  up 1 61  and 2 00  from the year ago period Wal Mart Stores  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors Influencing the Quarter
Wal Mart has been striving to understand the evolving needs of customers to regain their confidence and boost sales  It has delivered positive comps in the U S  in the last 11 quarters  Moreover  traffic improved for the 10th consecutive quarter on the back of the company s efforts to modernize stores for higher footfall and improvement in consumer spending  The company continues to expect positive comps year over year at Wal Mart U S  in fiscal 2018  For the 13 week period ending Jul 28  Wal Mart expects U S  comp sales growth in the range of 1 5 2 0   Sam s Club comp sales  without the impact of fuel sales  are expected to increase 1 1 5   The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of  1 00  1 08 per share 
Wal Mart is also making huge investments in e Commerce initiatives  including acquisitions  The company s acquisition of four e Commerce businesses since the Jet com acquisition  in Sep 2016  is in line with the Wal Mart s efforts to grow its online activities  Most recently  the brick and mortar retail giant is reportedly in talks to acquire online cosmetics startup Birchbox  continuing the company s hunger to build an impressive digital brand portfolio to take on Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ AMZN    If the deal materializes  it would mark the retailer s fifth e Commerce acquisition since Jet com  Apart from acquisitions  the Bentonville  AR based company is also offering free two day shipping  same day store Pickup and online grocery pickup services at multiple locations across the country 
While Wal Mart posted positive earnings streak for the seventh consecutive quarter  unfavorable currency  decline in international revenues  stiff competition from both brick and mortar and online retailers and huge investments in e Commerce activities leading to margin pressure 
We also note that Wal Mart s stock price history reveals that the company has been performing well  driven by positive initiatives taken by the company to boost sales  In fact  over the last six months  shares of this retail giant have moved up 17 1   higher than the   which showcased growth of 11 6   In fact  the company has also outpaced the broader  sector s growth of 9 7  over the same time frame 

Stocks with Favorable Combination
Stocks in the broader retail sector carrying both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank  and therefore also worth considering are 
Big Lots  Inc    NYSE BIG   has an Earnings ESP of  6 56  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

to report  the season is expected to end on a high  displaying significant earnings growth  A sizable number of companies have reported better than expected earnings this earnings season Generally  an earnings beat leads to stock price appreciation  Investors like to add outperformers as they strive to design a portfolio of stocks that will fetch them handsome returns However  the task is easier said than done  This is because the investing world is fraught with uncertainties and stock prices are sensitive to recent developments  Additionally  the same group of stocks may not work under all circumstances For example  airline stocks may benefit from declining oil prices but may fall out of favor in the event of oil prices moving up  One of the well accepted strategies to brave market uncertainties is to maintain a well diversified  i e  include stocks from different industries  portfolio Therefore  selecting the right stocks involves a lot of research and cannot be done arbitrarily  With time at a premium these days  it is next to impossible for investors to go through the extensive process  Given this backdrop  it is in the best interest of investors to seek guidance from  experts in the field   The concerned experts are brokers Such investment specialists attend conference calls  company presentations and also interact with management  Brokers revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned stock  Naturally  their stock related actions  upgrade or downgrade  serve as an invaluable guide as far as fixing target price of stock s  is concerned as they have a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa The above write up clearly suggests that by following broker actions  one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks  Keeping this in mind  we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation

However  we are concerned about the company s sales and comparable store sales performance  We noticed that Foot Locker s total sales and comparable store sales witnessed a marginal increase of 0 7  and 0 5   respectively  in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  which are in sharp contrast to the company s performance in fiscal 2016 
During the first  second  third and fourth quarters of last fiscal total sales increased 3 7   5   5 1  and 5 3   respectively  Maintaining the same chronological order comps rose 2 9   4 7   4 7  and 5   respectively  Management now projects low single digit growth in comparable sales with a relatively flat earnings year over year for the second quarter Foot Locker  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   What the Zacks Model Unveils 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Foot Locker is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen 
Foot Locker has an Earnings ESP of  3 33  as the Most Accurate estimate is at 87 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 90 cents  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with the negative Earnings ESP  makes surprise prediction difficult  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

Rating UpgradesThe Q2 reporting cycle  which is almost over  has unveiled an extremely rosy picture  With only a handful of companies left to report  the season is expected to end on a high  displaying significant earnings growth  A sizable number of companies have reported better than expected earnings this earnings season Generally  an earnings beat leads to stock price appreciation  Investors like to add outperformers as they strive to design a portfolio of stocks that will fetch them handsome returns However  the task is easier said than done  This is because the investing world is fraught with uncertainties and stock prices are sensitive to recent developments  Additionally  the same group of stocks may not work under all circumstances For example  airline stocks may benefit from declining oil prices but may fall out of favor in the event of oil prices moving up  One of the well accepted strategies to brave market uncertainties is to maintain a well diversified  i e  include stocks from different industries  portfolio Therefore  selecting the right stocks involves a lot of research and cannot be done arbitrarily  With time at a premium these days  it is next to impossible for investors to go through the extensive process  Given this backdrop  it is in the best interest of investors to seek guidance from  experts in the field   The concerned experts are brokers Such investment specialists attend conference calls  company presentations and also interact with management  Brokers revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned stock  Naturally  their stock related actions  upgrade or downgrade  serve as an invaluable guide as far as fixing target price of stock s  is concerned as they have a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa The above write up clearly suggests that by following broker actions  one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks  Keeping this in mind  we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has been included  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line  making the strategy foolproof Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75

Medtronic PLC Price and EPS Surprise
    What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings We look forward to another quarter of solid growth on successful execution of its three growth strategies  therapy innovation  globalization and economic value for Medtronic  Combined with the demographics of an aging population  these positives have started to open up opportunities for Medtronic  which should get reflected in the first quarter as well Within therapy innovation  there have been multiple developments  Under the Cardiac and vascular group  new therapies are helping the company gain traction in the rapidly growing MedTech markets such as left ventricular assist device  LVAD   transcatheter aortic valve replacement  TAVR   drug coated balloons  atrial fibrillation ablation and insertable diagnostics Within cardiac rhythm implantables  the company is fast capturing market share on its differentiated 3T MRI technology  Within TAVR  we expect Medtronic to register strong growth in the quarter on the back of the FDA approval for the extended use of its self expanding CoreValve Evolut TAVR platform in July 2017  With this approval  patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis and at an intermediate risk for open heart surgery will be eligible for treatment using the technology In coronary  Medtronic has been seeing weak Drug Eluting stent  DES  performance  particularly in the United States  Per management  the FDA approval of the Resolute Onyx DES in May 2017 put a check on the decline in U S  DES sales by fiscal 2018  Also  Medtronic has started selling Resolute Onyx DES in the high growth Japan market from Jul 10  as per a Cardiovascular Business report released on Jul 7  These developments buoy optimism and strengthen our belief for strong quarterly performance by the company in first quarter fiscal 2018 Over the recent past  the company has been witnessing soft sequential performance in its diabetes business owing to the anticipated full launch of the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system  In June 2017  Medtronic announced the U S  launch of the MiniMed 670G system for type 1 diabetes  This should reflect in the company s top line from the first quarter fiscal 2018 In June 2017  Medtronic announced a new outcomes based agreement with Aetna  NYSE AET  for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients currently on multiple daily insulin injections  This development may also start contributing to the company s diabetes business in near term Also  within the brain therapy space  under the Restorative Therapies Group business  the company saw encouraging developments  Medtronic announced the receipt of Health Canada licence for SureTune 3 software for deep brain stimulation  DBS  in June 2017  The latest innovations in the SureTune technology allow for more precise  efficient treatment while also improving patient management with centralized data storage for easy reference  The company received CE Mark for its SureTune software for deep brain stimulation in the same month The company s estimate revision trend for the fiscal first quarter has also been positive  In the past seven days  one analyst moved north  with no movement in the opposite direction  However  the magnitude of the estimate revision trend with earnings estimates remained at  1 08 over the same time frame Medtronic has provided its initial fiscal 2018 revenues and EPS guidance  The company expects full year revenue growth in the range of 4  to 5  at CER  Foreign currency fluctuation is expected to have a positive  75 million to  175 million impact in the fiscal  Fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow 9  to 10  at CER  Currency translation will negatively impact full year earnings by approximately 5 cents to 10 cents  including the 3 cents to 5 cents impact in the first quarter fiscal 2018 With Medtronic gaining a significant portion of its sales from the international market  currency fluctuations are a major concern  This has been a dampener for the company over the last few quarters  Considering this  for first quarter fiscal 2018  Medtronic anticipates currency headwind to affect revenues by  10 million to  60 million  Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter Big Lots  Inc

4 Stocks Flaunting Low Price to Cash Flow Ratio

 It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price     Warren Buffett   The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth 

	Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward 

	There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better 

Why Price to Cash Flow 

	You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company 

	Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same 

	A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors 

	However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a    of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap 

The Bargain Hunting Strategy

	Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks 

P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median  

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers 

P B less than or equal to X Industry Median   A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain 

P S less than or equal to X Industry Median   The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is 

PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

Value Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening 

Vishay Intertechnology  Inc    NYSE       manufactures and supplies discrete semiconductors and passive components  The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 15 2  for 3 5 years and flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  You can see     

Citizens Financial Group  Inc    NYSE       operates as the bank holding company for Citizens Bank  N A  and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania which provide retail and commercial banking products and services  The company  which carries a Zacks Rank  2  delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9 1  in the trailing four quarters and has 18 2  expected EPS growth rate for 3 5 years 

CEMEX  S A B  de C V    NYSE        which produces  markets  and distributes cement  ready mix concrete  aggregates  clinker  and other construction materials  has an expected EPS growth rate of 18 6  for 3 5 years  Currently  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  2

124338,345853,BIG,Can Fossil Group  FOSL  Pull A Surprise In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Fossil Group  Inc    NASDAQ FOSL   is slated to report second quarter 2017 results on Aug 8  after market closes  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this designer and manufacturer of clothing and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  The company has an average earnings surprise of 4 8  over the trailing four quarters  However  it reported a negative surprise of 66 7  in its first quarter results this year Let s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not show that Fossil is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Fossil has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 28 cents  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult Fossil Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Which Way are Estimates Treading Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has been stable over the last 30 days while the same for 2017 has increased by 3 cents We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 28 cents depicts a massive decline from the earnings of 12 cents reported in the prior year quarter  The company projects adjusted loss in the band of 23 40 cents per share for the to be reported quarter  Further estimated earnings of 93 cents for fiscal 2017 depict a decline of 11 cents from the year ago period Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  619 5 million for the said quarter  down 9 6  from the year ago quarter  Also  revenues for 2017 are projected to decline 4 6  to  2 9 billion Factors Influencing the Quarter Fossil has been witnessing decline in its multi brand licensed watch portfolio  majorly due to two factors  First  tech enabled watches are significantly impacting the sales of traditional watches  Second  the success of the Michael Kors brand is overshadowing other brands  performance  Moreover  in Jan 2016  Burberry announced that it is exiting the watch business and does not intend to renew its license agreement upon its expiration at the end of 2017  Further  sales of leathers have persistently been weak as customer response to the assortment continues to put pressure on results  Decline in traditional watches and weak leather business also hurt sales in the Americas  Europe and Asia regions during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 In the U S   the company is witnessing sluggish comps since the past few quarters due to weak traffic  In addition  Fossil has been witnessing lower margins in the retail channel  primarily due to increased promotions to drive sales and unfavorable currency fluctuations  As a result of such headwinds  sales have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 straight quarters The headwinds are also well reflected in the share price performance of the company  While the stock has plunged 56 5  over the past six months  the  declined 19 5  Nevertheless  Fossil has been exploring the potentials of wearable technology  owing to its rising demand  In fact  wearable represented 7  of the first quarter 2017 sales across product categories amongst which over 75  of the sales came from smart watches  In this context  innovations and product launches undertaken by Fossil for the Skagen brand is expected to provide an increased digital presence along with solid returns on investment   The company also continues to focus on a restructuring program named New World Fossil  which aims at improving the financial performance of the Fossil brand and build an improved operating platform to drive long term shareholder value Though Fossil s connected wearables and smart watches are expected to gain momentum  the Watches category is likely to remain sluggish due to general weakness therein Do Retail

opening bell  This leading off price retailer s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ten straight quarters  with a trailing four quarter average beat of 4 1  With this in mind  let s now look into some factors that are likely to impact second quarter results Which Way are Estimates Treading A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter as well as for 2018 has been stable over the past 30 days at 84 cents and  3 88  respectively  Further  estimated earnings for fiscal 2018 depict a year on year growth of 9 9    The same for the second quarter depict a growth of 2 4  from the prior year period  Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  8 32 billion for the said quarter  depicting a 5 6  growth from the prior year period  Also  revenues for fiscal 2018 are expected to increase 7 3  to  35 59 billion  What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not show that TJX Companies is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  as well as a positive  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  TJX Companies has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 84 cents  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult TJX Companies  Inc   The  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Factors Influencing the Quarter TJX Companies expects pre tax margins to remain under pressure for the next few quarters due to an increase in employee payroll  The company announced a wage hike of all full  and part time hourly U S  store associates during the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 conference call  which is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2018 earnings  Further  the company expects incremental investments  additional supply chain costs and pension costs to dent margins in the coming quarters              Margins of the company are also seen to be facing the crunches of rising product costs  TJX Companies  being an off price retailer  cannot increase the price of its products  which leads to lower margins  Moreover  lack of exposure in the emerging markets as well as currency related headwinds continue to pose as challenges for the company Such aspects have been bearing brunt on the company s share price performance  Over the past six months  shares of TJX Companies have declined 7 2   comparing unfavorably with the  sector s growth of 12 9  Nevertheless  we are optimistic about TJX Companies  business expansion initiatives  which include aggressive store opening strategies  The company has been opening stores regularly and expanding rapidly across the U S   Europe and Canada  Dedicated marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums have been boosting traffic at its stores  Notably  TJX Companies has delivered positive comparable store sales growth in the past 32 quarters  The company has been undertaking numerous initiatives to boost online sales  We expect that the company s strategic efforts would aid lifting up its performance in the forthcoming periods Do

Costco Wholesale Corp   NASDAQ COST  178  reported fiscal Q3 earnings per share  EPS  of  1 59  or  1 40 ex items  compared to the  1 31 FactSet estimate  as revenues increased 8 0  year over year  y y  to  28 9 billion  above the projected  28 6 billion  Q3 same store sales rose 5 0  y y  north of the expected 4 7  increase  Shares were nicely higher

Orders for the volatile component of transportation weighed on the headline figure as a slight gain in autos and a solid rise in defense aircraft and parts were more than offset by a drop in nondefense aircraft and parts  Weakness was also seen in demand for machinery  electrical equipment and appliances  and fabricated metals  However  a bright spot was a solid gain in orders for computers and electronic products 
The data  notably the back to back flat readings for the proxy for business spending in the durable goods report  may have fostered concerns about whether Q1 s soft patch was transitory as recent history and the Fed have suggested 
The second look  of three  at Q1 Gross Domestic Product  the broadest measure of economic output  showed a quarter over quarter  q q  annualized rate of growth of 1 2   up from the first release s 0 7  gain  Forecasts called for an adjusted 0 9  pace of expansion  Q4 GDP grew by an unrevised 2 1  rate  Personal consumption came in at a 0 6  gain for Q1  up from the preliminary estimate of a 0 3  increase  and compared to the expectations of a 0 4  increase  Personal consumption grew by an unrevised 3 5  in Q4

Europe and Asia mixed amid political uncertainty and continued energy weakness 
European equities finished mixed  with oil   gas issues remaining a drag on the markets as crude oil prices tumbled yesterday amid apparent disappointment from the highly anticipated extension of production cuts by OPEC 
Political and geopolitical uncertainty lingered to hamper conviction  with polls showing U K  Prime Minister Theresa May losing ground ahead of next month s election as Brexit negotiations continue  However  the British pound fell to help buoy the U K  markets  Also  the markets eyed U S  President Trump s first international trip as he wraps up in Europe with G 7 leaders gathering in Italy  The euro declined versus the U S  dollar and bond yields in the region lost ground 
In light economic news  Italian economic  manufacturing and consumer sentiment reports all declined for May 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed with the energy sector getting pressured as oil prices tumbled yesterday in reaction to the highly expected extension of production cuts by OPEC 
Japanese equities declined  with the yen gaining ground late in the session  while a read on the nation s core consumer price inflation came a bit cooler than expected  Chinese shares took a breather after a strong weekly advance and stocks in Hong Kong finished flat  Australian securities fell amid a drop in oil and gas issues and weakness out of the basic materials sector  However  South Korean and Indian equities hit record highs for a second session 
Stocks string together gains to post weekly rally
U S  stocks posted a six session winning streak before Friday s pause  extending a rebound from last week s selloff and spike in volatility on Wednesday that stemmed from a flare up in domestic political concerns that called pro growth policy pledges into question  President Trump embarked on his first trip overseas  which appeared to take some of the focus off domestic political issues  likely helping foster the rebound  Also  he struck some defense and aerospace deals in Saudi Arabia to boost the stocks in the sector 
Technology stocks continued to rally  while some relative upside surprises by retailers  headlined by Best Buy Co  Inc   NYSE BBY  60   boosted the consumer discretionary sector  The Fed s May meeting minutes seemed to foster a dovish takeaway to help ease concerns about the pace of future rate hikes after June s highly anticipated move  However  the energy sector took a hit as crude oil prices gave back a rally that led up to this week s widely expected OPEC extension of production cuts that looked to disappoint the markets 
The divergence between hard and soft economic data also festered  with new and existing home sales both falling more than expected in April to exacerbate concerns about the impact of demand easily outstripping supply  Treasury yields nudged higher  along with the U S  dollar 
Although next week s economic calendar will be truncated by Monday s holiday  the docket will bring plenty of data to digest ahead of the Fed s monetary policy meeting later in June  Personal income and spending  and Consumer Confidence will get the ball rolling  followed by the Fed s Beige Book  the ISM Manufacturing Index and monthly auto sales  The week will culminate with Friday s key May nonfarm payroll report 
U S  markets were roiled by so called  unprecedented  political issues but bounced back quickly  Investing based on political winds is not likely to be a successful strategy and we urge focus on economic and earnings fundamentals  The U S  economy is bouncing back from the weak first quarter while the labor market continues to tighten  A June rate hike by the Federal Reserve remains on the table for now  Global growth has picked up  but the recent slowdown and inversion of the yield curve in China are causing some concerns 
Next week s international economic reports worth noting include  Australia building approvals and retail sales  China industrial profits and Manufacturing and non Manufacturing PMIs  India Q1 GDP  Japan household spending  retail sales  and industrial production  Eurozone consumer price inflation and consumer confidence  along with German retail sales and unemployment change  U K  Markit s PMI Manufacturing Index ",2017-05-28,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-finish-flat-ahead-of-holiday-weekend-200191786,200191786

124377,345892,BIG,Does Big Lots  BIG  Look To Be A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Big Lots  Inc    NYSE BIG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Big Lots has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 72  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 32  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Big Lots s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail Discount and Variety industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 79  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Big Lots has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 03  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Big Lots stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Big Lots has a P S ratio of about 0 44  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Big Lots currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Big Lots a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Big Lots is just 0 89  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 72  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  BIG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Big Lots might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives BIG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen eight estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower and the full year estimate has also seen eight upward and no downward movement in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 7  in the past two months and the full year estimate has grown by 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Big Lots  Inc  Price and Consensus   Even though Big Lotshas a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBig Lots is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  its strong industry rank  Top 37  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past three years  the Zacks Retail  Discount   Variety industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Big Lots sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020

Recent Analyst Upgrades Make These 5 Stocks Attractive 

	Investors strive to design a portfolio of stocks that will fetch them handsome returns  However  the task is easier said than done because selecting the right stocks at any point of time is no mean feat  Given the time constraint that we all face  it is quite impossible for individual investors to have thorough knowledge about all stocks 

	In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack   The proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers  who are deemed to experts  equipped with vast knowledge and know how as far the field of investing is concerned 

	Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors 

Earnings Estimate Revisions   A Proper Guide

	Broker ratings are backed by sound logic and are by no means arbitrary  Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Naturally  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio 

	Since brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock 

	Naturally  when investors see brokers revising their estimates or recommendation on a stock  they often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade 

	Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario 

Don t Leave out the Top Line

	While we have already talked about the bottom line  the top line  revenue portion  cannot be ignored  Actually  according to many market watchers a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  This holds true especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric

5 Low P CF Stocks to Add More Value in Your Investment 

	Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics 

	This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company 

	Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same 

	Positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves 

	However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a    of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap 

The Bargain Hunting Strategy

	Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks 

P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median  

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median   This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers 

P B less than or equal to X Industry Median   A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain 

P S less than or equal to X Industry Median   The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is 

PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

Value Score of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening 

Citizens Financial Group  Inc    NYSE       operates as the bank holding company for Citizens Bank  N A  and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania which provide retail and commercial banking products and services  The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9 1  over the trailing four quarters and has 19 1  expected EPS growth rate for 3 5 years  It flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

124406,345921,BIG,5 Low Price to Book Stocks That Make Solid Bets,opinion,The use of ratios to determine value stocks is not a new concept for investors  The most popular valuation metrics used to evaluate companies are Price to earnings  P E  or Price to Sales  P S  ratio  While P E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price  P S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company However  we should not forget price to book ratio  which though underrated  is also a great valuation metric  The price to book ratio or P B Ratio is determined by comparing a stock s market price to its book value It is an easy to use metric for identifying low priced stocks with high growth prospects It is calculated as given below P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equity Defining Book ValueThere are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this would equate to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine the book value What is P B RatioBy comparing book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s share price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without its limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditures or high debt companies or service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the P B is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should also analyze other ratios like P E  P S  and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has a bright earnings growth prospect Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000   A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily

5 Low Price to Sales Stocks to Pocket Big Returns

	While Price to Earnings is the first thing to cross one s mind while using valuation metrics  Price to Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits 
	Though a loss making company with a negative Price to Earnings ratio falls out of investors  favor  its Price to Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued 
	A stock s Price to Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company 
	If the Price to Sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So it goes without saying that a stock with Price to Sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth 
	Thus  a stock with a lower Price to Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price to Sales ratio 
	Price to Sales is often preferred over Price to Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable 
	However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price to Sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price to Sales ratio 
	In any case  the Price to Sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book  Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry   The lower the Price to Sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry   The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry   This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry   A company with less debt should have a stable Price to Sales ratio Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 offer the best opportunities in the value investing space 
	Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screening KT Corporation  NYSE       is a telecommunications service provider in Korea  It offers mobile voice and data telecommunication services  fixed line telephone services  and Internet phone services  It also provides broadband Internet access services and other Internet related services  This Zacks Rank  2 company has a Value score of  A  Big Lots Inc    NYSE       is a broad line closeout retailer in the United States  The company offers products under various merchandising categories  which include Food  Consumables  Furniture  Seasonal  Soft Home  Hard Home  and Electronics   Accessories  It has a 3 5 year EPS growth rate of 13 5   The stock currently has a Value score of  A  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see     SK Telecom Co  Ltd   NYSE       is a provider of wireless telecommunications services in South Korea  The company offers wireless voice transmission services  cellular global roaming services  and interconnection services to connect its networks to fixed line and other wireless networks  This Zacks Rank  1 company s 3 5 year EPS growth rate is pegged at 0 05   The stock has a Value score of  A  Citizens Financial Group Inc    NYSE       is a bank holding company for Citizens Bank  N A  and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania that provide retail and commercial banking products and services in the U S  This Zacks Rank  1 company s 3 5 year EPS growth rate is pegged at 19 1   The stock has a Value score of  B

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks Riding High on Recent Broker Upgrades 

Proper guidance is the key to success in life  The same holds true for the investing world  With a deluge of stocks flooding the market  it is impossible for investors to arrive at winning stocks  Investors  after all  are putting their hard earned money into stocks and consequently their sole objective is to generate handsome returns out of their portfolio 

To attain this  it is prudent to design a portfolio in line with the advice rendered by the experts in the field of investing  These experts are brokers who are equipped with vast knowledge in the matter 

Why Should You Trust Broker Advice 

There are generally three types of brokers   sell side  buy side and independent  Of all the types  sell side analysts are most prevalent in the investment world  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough analysis  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds  and others while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors  The bottom line is that brokers  irrespective of their types  engage in extensive research on stocks in their portfolios before arriving at their recommendation  s   Buy  Sell or Hold  

Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Given their vast knowledge in the field  it is prudent for investors to be guided by estimate revisions while taking investment decisions  The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock  In fact  a rating upgrade normally leads to stock price appreciation and vice versa 

One of the well accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns irrespective of the market conditions  For instance  in the face of extremely low oil prices  analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and consequently raise estimates  Naturally  adding such stocks to one s portfolio in such a scenario might prove to be a winning strategy  Similarly  analysts might trim estimates and downgrade a stock following adverse events like lackluster earnings or pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Unsurprisingly  investors would look to offload such stocks from their portfolio  on the basis of broker advice 

To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks 

Consider the Top Line as Well

However  designing a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to result in a winning strategy  Actually  according to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric 

Screening Criteria

   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75   This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks 

  change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10   This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter 

To ensure that the strategy is a winning one  covering all bases  we have added the following screening parameters 

Price to Sales   Bot 10   The lower the ratio the better  Companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio 

Price greater than 5   A stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors 

Average Daily Volume greater than 100 000 shares over the last 20 trading days   Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded 

Market value    mil    Top  3000   This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization 

Com ADR Canadian  Com   This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks

4 Stocks with Low Price to Cash Flow Ratio to Buy Now

 It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price     Warren Buffett  The strategy is quite simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth 

	Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but are fundamentally sound  So chances are that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward 

	There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better 

Why Price to Cash Flow 

	You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company 

	Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is much reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same 

	A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors 

	However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap 

The Bargain Hunting Strategy

	Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks 

P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median  

Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000    A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 

P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers 

P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain 

P S less than or equal to X Industry Median    The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is 

PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 

Value Score of less than or equal to B    Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening 

Vishay Intertechnology Inc     NYSE       a manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors and passive components  has an expected EPS growth rate of 17 6  for 3 5 years  The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 19 3  over the trailing four quarters and flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

	Retailers are set to benefit from this encouraging backdrop  without any doubt  Thus  selecting potential stocks from this space may prove to be a good investment proposition ahead of Halloween 

Halloween Spending Isn t Scary Anymore

	The NRF currently expects Americans to spend  8 4 billion or  82 93 per person for Halloween this year  significantly higher than the year ago level of  74 34 a person  Shoppers are expected to spend about  3 1 billion on costumes   2 5 billion on candy   2 4 billion on decorations and  390 million on greeting cards 

	Senior director of media relations at the NRF  Ana Serafin Smith  said   I think consumers are a lot more comfortable with the state of the economy    People are willing to spend a little extra to have fun and feel good about the future  

Treats All the Way

	Along with Halloween  the NRF also expects this year s holiday season to end with a blast  It expects holiday season sales  excluding autos  gas and restaurant sales  to be up 3 6  to  655 8 billion  with a 7  10  surge in online sales to around  117 billion  If the total sales surge is as expected  then it will easily surpass the 10 year average pace of 2 5   It will be also higher than last year s increase of 3 2   Moreover  PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  forecasts that average spending this holiday season will surge 10  to  1 121 per person 

	Matthew Shay  NRF President and CEO said   All of the fundamentals are in a good place  giving strength to consumers and leading us to believe that this will be a very positive holiday season   The economy is indeed gaining momentum lately  and everything from consumer confidence to retail sales signal this  While retail sales rose at the fastest pace in the last three months of 0 6  in September  Consumer Confidence Index rose to a nine year high last month  Other economic data including last month s ISM Manufacturing Index  ISM Services Index and industrial production were also encouraging

	Bet on These 5 Broker Favorites for Big Returns

 Rule No 1  Never lose money  Rule No  2  Never forget rule No 1     Warren Buffett  founder and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  and commonly regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time 

Investors intend to follow basic rules of investing as they put their hard earned money into a stock  However  the plethora of stocks flooding the market makes it a daunting task for individual investors 

Selecting the right stocks involves a lot of research and cannot be done arbitrarily  With time at a premium these days  it is next to impossible for investors to go through the extensive process  Given this backdrop  it is in the best interest of investors to seek guidance from  experts in the field  as they endeavor to build a winning portfolio to generate handsome returns  The concerned experts are brokers 

Broker Advice  An Invaluable Pointer

Generally  three types of brokers  sell side  buy side and independent  are present in the investment world  with sell side analysts being most common  They are employed by various brokerage firms to provide unbiased opinion to investors on the stocks under their coverage after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors  Brokers  irrespective of their types  do intense research on stocks in their coverage before coming up with recommendations 

Brokers analysts attend company conference calls presentations and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors about their course of action  buy  sell or hold a stock   In view of their expertise and profound understanding of stocks and the surroundings of the investing world  it is a no brainer that investors should pay heed to broker advice to generate garner the maximum from their portfolios 

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Since brokers follow the stocks in their coverage closely  they revise their earnings estimates on a stock after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Their action is certainly not arbitrary or illogical  Thus  the estimate revisions serve as an important guide regarding the price of a stock 

For example  an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings results often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy  To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks 

Value the Top line

To design a winning strategy it is not wise to consider only the bottom line only  In fact  according to some market watchers  a top line outperformance is more creditable for a stock than a mere earnings beat  under some circumstances  Therefore  to make our strategy full proof  one needs to address top line concerns as well  We have considered the price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric  for screening stocks 

Screening Criteria

   Up Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks 

  change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10   This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter 

Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio  the better  Companies meeting this criterion are in the bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks 

Price greater than 5  A stock trading below  5 will not likely be of significant interest to most investors 

Average Daily Volume greater than 100 000 shares over the last 20 trading days   Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded 

Market value    mil    Top  3000  This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization 

Here are 5 of the 10 stocks that passed the screen

124516,346031,BIG,4 Low Price to Cash Flow Stocks For Assured Returns,opinion,Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks  But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you know the trick When it comes to the investment market  experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches  In value investing  investors choose stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  the chance of outperformance is high when the market trends up There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest considering Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  as one of the key metrics  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric  when the most widely used metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  what makes P CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly reflecting the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves What s the Optimum Strategy However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book  price to earnings and price to sales ratios  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening Vishay Intertechnology Inc    NYSE VSH    the manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors and passive components  carries a Zacks Rank  1  The company  which has an expected EPS growth rate of 17 6  for 3 5 years  delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 19 3  over the trailing four quarters Korea Electric Power Corp    NYSE KEP    an integrated electric utility

5 Stocks That Brokers Love Right Now

	In the words of hedge fund manager Seth Klarman   Most investors are oriented toward return  how much they can make and pay little attention to risk  how much they can lose  

	One of the well accepted winning strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio that would lead to handsome returns at all times  braving market uncertainties  However  with stocks flooding the market  investors might well falter in their attempts to design an optimum portfolio of stocks aimed at generating handsome returns in the absence of proper expert advice  This guidance comes from brokers whose ratings on a stock are backed by well assessed logic 

Broker Ratings  Winning Indicators

	Brokers indulge in extensive research on the stocks in their coverage  scrutinizing the company s publicly available documents  attending conference calls and often communicating directly with the top management  Naturally  brokers  irrespective of their type  sell side  buy side or independent   are armed with more detailed information on companies compared to individual investors 

	Thus  it is obvious that investors will pay heed to such well researched information to garner maximum returns from their portfolio  If investors notice an upgrade in broker recommendation on a particular stock  they are inclined to believe that there is a strong reason for it  For instance  a company might have raised its earnings guidance based on some positive factors that in turn prompted brokers  optimism on it 

Estimate Revisions  A Pointer to Price Movement

	With brokers expected to impart expert knowledge  equipped with profound understanding of stocks  it is natural that rating actions by these specialists serve as a valuable piece of advice for investors 

	Upward estimate revisions generally lead to a rise in prices  Notably  estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario  Similarly  a stock may fall out of analysts  favor due to adverse events like lackluster earnings performance or pipeline failure  for a biotech player   Trimming of earnings estimates by brokers often leads to stock price depreciation 

Designing a Winning Portfolio

	We have designed a screener to arrive at stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks  However  considering only these factors does not make our strategy foolproof as the top line has not been accounted for 

	Actually  according to many market watchers  a top line beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included the price sales ratio in our screener which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric 

Screening Criteria

   Up Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks 

  change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10   This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter 

Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio the better  companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio 

Price greater than 5  A stock trading below  5 will not likely be of significant interest to most investors 

Average Daily Volume greater than 100 000 shares over the last 20 trading days   Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded 

Market value    mil    Top  3000  This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization 

Com ADR Canadian  Com   This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks 

	Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen 

	Based in Columbus  OH and founded in 1967  Big Lots  Inc      is a broad line closeout retailer in the United States  The company offers products under various merchandising categories  which include Food  Consumables  Furniture  Seasonal  Soft Home  Hard Home  and Electronics   Accessories The company has an impressive track with respect to earnings  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters by an average of 8 02   The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

124556,346071,BIG,Dollar Tree Vs Dollar General  Which Is A Better Pick  ,opinion,A smart strategy suggests investors to exit underperforming stocks and instead  invest in the right stocks at the opportune moment  That said  let s shift our attention to two major discount chains    Dollar Tree  Inc    NASDAQ DLTR   and Dollar General Corporation   NYSE DG      which have been having a head to head for a while now Notably  in a bid to take over Family Dollar  Dollar Tree defeated Dollar General and closed the buyout in Jul 2015  Now the question is whether Dollar Tree still has an edge over Dollar General  Well  to gauge which stock is a better investment pick  we need to analyze various aspects Tree Vs GeneralStarting with stock price movement  we note that Dollar Tree has seen its shares rise 6 7  on a year to date basis  faring better than Dollar General s 0 1  slip  However  both the stocks witnessed a major slump in the past one month on account oflower than expected second quarter fiscal 2016 results  owing to pressure on food prices and a tough retail environment Further  sources revealed that the 14 4  and 22 1  respective decline in Dollar Tree s and Dollar General s stock price was a result of their rival supermarket bigwig   Wal Mart Stores Inc  s   NYSE WMT   better than expected second quarter performance  Analysts further stated that Wal Mart witnessed one of its strongest comparable store sales  comps  growth in the quarter  as it reduced prices of some major traffic drivers  thus helping the pressurized consumers and shifting their focus away from the dollar stores Moving back to Dollar Tree and Dollar General  let s take a look at their overall performance in the last quarter  along with their performance history Earnings Surprise History   EstimatesThough Dollar Tree and Dollar General missed earnings and sales estimates in the last reported quarter  the top and bottom lines improved year over year  with comps and margins also trending upwards  Notably  Dollar Tree has been posting positive comps for 34 straight quarters  whereas Dollar General has seen its comps rise over the past 26 years  thus highlighting its spectacular record A look at the companies earnings history reveals that Dollar Tree has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once in the trailing four quarters  while Dollar General has missed the same only once  Nonetheless  both the companies have been witnessing a downtrend in their earnings estimates for fiscal 2016  over the past 30 days  While estimates for Dollar Tree have slipped 1 9  to  3 69  that for Dollar General has scaled down by 2 8  to  4 51  since the earnings release  Well  it seems that both these stocks are fighting exactly even in the Retail  Discount space Let s now turn our attention to their fundamentals and growth strategies  which have been driving these bellwethers forward Fundamentals   Growth StrategiesDollar Tree operates discount variety stores  offering merchandise at a fixed price of  1 00  The company  which also operates online  has stores across 48 U S  states  the District of Columbia and Canada   underscoring its solid geographical reach  Moreover  integration of Family Dollar has expanded its presence and the company is on track to become a mega U S  discount retailer that can counter competition single handedly in the dollar discount store segment  Dollar General  however  is not far behind  The company trades in low priced merchandise  typically priced at  10 or less  and has over 13 000 stores across 43 states  Moreover  the company s current market cap of  19 9 billion stands firm against Dollar Tree s  19 3 billion On the one hand  Dollar Tree is progressing well with Family Dollar s integration and its growth initiatives  which include store expansion strategies  enhancement of store productivity  creating new store formats  tapping into new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve its patrons better  Further  we remain confident of the company s strategies of increasing consumables mix  rolling out freezers coolers at stores along with multi price point expansion to boost top line performance  Also  in order to improve operating margin  the company is focusing supply chain efficiency and aggressive cost cuts Well  Dollar General is also firing on all cylinders as the company s commitment toward better price management  cost containment  private label offering  store expansion  effective inventory management  merchandise and operational initiatives are likely to drive sales and margins  Moreover  in order to drive traffic  Dollar General is focusing on both consumables and discretionary categories  and items ranging between  1 and  5  The rollout of tobacco has been a key factor in driving traffic  In addition  Dollar General is expanding its cooler facilities to enhance the sale of perishable items  and is also rolling out the DG digital coupon program So  as of now  Dollar Tree and Dollar General seem to be on par with each other  Comparing their long term growth rates  Dollar Tree stands to have a long term earnings growth rate of 17 1   against Dollar General s 14 3   Dollar General is ready to forge ahead   as its P E of 15 7x fares better than the industry average of 20 8x  while on the other hand  Dollar Tree is trading at a premium with P E of 22 1x  thus having a very limited upside potential   Nonetheless  both the companies have a  of  A   keeping the outcome uncertain Final TakeWhile still too close to call  Dollar Tree s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  fares better than Dollar General s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   thus giving investors reasons enough to hold on to it   Investors can also count on Big Lots Inc    NYSE BIG    which sports a Zacks Rank

The company further said that it will hire both part time and full time workers  The hiring also includes permanent positions like store managers  assistant store managers  lead sales associates as well as store associates  Notably  the company has hired nearly 42 000 employees since 2008

Comparable store sales also came below management s expectations on account of deflation in retail food price across perishable items  fall in both Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  SNAP  participation rates and benefit levels  unseasonably mild spring weather and stiff competition  Dollar General informed that price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits adversely impacted comparable store sales by about 60 to 70 basis points

124617,346132,BIG,Will Under Armour  UA  Q2 Earnings Disappoint Investors ,opinion,"Under Armour  Inc    NYSE UA    the developer  marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel  footwear  and accessories  is slated to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 26  The big question facing investors is whether the company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported 
In the trailing four quarters  the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 34 4   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings Beat
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Under Armour is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as Under Armour s Earnings ESP is  50 00  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 1 cent  whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 2 cents   
Also  Under Armour carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Under Armour trimmed its 2016 outlook after one of its major customers  The Sports Authority  faced bankruptcy as it has been burdened with more than  1 billion of debt  For the second quarter  Under Armour expects impairment charge of nearly  23 million related to The Sports Authority  Previously  the company had estimated sales of  163 million from the sports retailer for 2016  However  now that it has filed for bankruptcy 
Under Armour is likely to recognize only  43 million of the sales  The company now expects net revenues for 2016 to be nearly  4 925 billion  as against the previous estimate of about  5 billion 
However  Under Armour s sustained focus on brand development  expansion of its DTC business  product innovation and foray into the technology based fitness business bode well  as it registered revenue growth of over 20  for the past 24 straight quarters  For the second quarter  the company continues to project revenue growth in the high 20  range UNDER ARMOUR A Price and EPS Surprise

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Bet on These 5 Stocks with Recent Broker Rating Upgrades 

The saying  Strike while the iron is hot  is appropriate in all walks of life and the investing corner is no exception  Investors  after all are putting their hard earned money into a stock  Naturally  they won t want the money to go down the drain and will want to make handsome returns out of their portfolio of stocks 

One of the well accepted winning strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio that would lead to handsome returns at all times 

With time at a premium these days  it is next to impossible for investors to keep track of market movements to identify opportune moment s  for buying or offloading a particular stock to maximize returns  Therefore  one needs guidance from proper channels  backed by sound logic and not out of the blue 

Broker Ratings  A Valuable Guide

Investors more often than not fall back on opinions of broker s  analysts following a particular stock while arriving at their investment decision  buy  sell or hold   Generally  three types of brokers  sell side  buy side and independent  are present in the investment world  with sell side analysts being most common  They are employed by various brokerage firms to provide unbiased opinion to investors on the stocks under their coverage after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors 

Analysts attend company conference calls presentations and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors about their course of action  Naturally  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio 

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Since brokers follow the stocks in their coverage minutely  they revise their earnings estimates on a stock after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Their action is certainly not arbitrary or illogical  The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock 

Upward estimate revisions generally lead to prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings results often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy  To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks 

What About Top Line 

While we have talked about the bottom line in detail  the top line  revenue portion  cannot be ignored  Actually  according to many market watchers a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric

124654,346169,BIG,Will Stiff Competition Drag Whole Foods Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Whole Foods Market  Inc   NASDAQ WFM    one of the leading natural and organic foods supermarkets  is slated to report its third quarter fiscal 2014 results on Jul 30  In the last quarter  it delivered a negative surprise of 7 32   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Whole Foods has been grappling with increasing competition and aggressive pricing that are weighing on the company s performance as more and more companies are entering as well as expanding their presence in the Organic   Natural food business 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whole Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Whole Foods is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 39 cents 
Zacks Rank  Whole Foods has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  which lowers the predictive power of ESP  We caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks that Warrant a Look

124656,346171,BIG,Some Thrift Space Exposures For When Things Take A Turn For The Worse ,opinion,"We re a little over six years from the Great Recession  and a look at the average time between recessions since the Great Depression   there have been 13  inclusive of the two already mentioned   suggests we are far closer to the next than we are the last 
China is in turmoil and Germany  Australia and Japan are felling collateral damage  Inflation across developed nations is virtually nonexistent  and central banks are scrambling to regain control ahead of a downturn that   if things remain as is   they will have little to no monetary tools with which to counter 
It won t take much movement  say a 30 35  decline  in the equities markets to instigate a negative wealth effect  and the implications this has for consumer spending  market sentiment and   eventually   employment  In short  it s time to start thinking about safe haven allocations 
Gold  of course  is the go to risk off asset  but a number of industries thrive on recession 
One such industry is the thrift space  Here is a group of thrift space exposures that could make for great allocations if  and when  things take a turn for the worse 
Let s start with the obvious candidates 
Dollar Tree  Inc   O DLTR Dollar Tree just closed on its long awaited acquisition of discount retail peer Dollar General  N DG   and  despite a rough second half of 2015  continues to print strong numbers  During the three months to October 31  2015  the company pulled in  4 95 billion revenues for a gross profit of  1 4 billion and a net  81 9 million  Full year financials  alongside holiday period reports  are due February 24  2016  and analysts expect a strong final quarter  If the numbers come in as expected  it should kick off a strong year for the company   and that s while things remain buoyant  If the economy takes a turn for the worse  Dollar Tree s  and now  Dollar General s  deeply discounted products should draw increased attention  and the company could gain further  Its market capitalization is down 10  on end of 2015 highs  representing an opportunity for a discounted entry ahead of a recovery 
Big Lots Inc   N BIG Big Lots offers a wide variety of goods at a discount  everything from food and drink to household furniture   the latter of which has boosted the company s bottom line over the past twelve months through a financing program  It generated in excess of  1 1 billion revenues in each of the last six quarters and  with the exception of last quarter  during which the company invested in a wide scale revamp of its stores  regularly posts a net income in the triple digit hundreds of millions  Big Lots expects to report an EPS in the range of  1 95 2 00 for the final quarter of 2015  due March 4  2016  
The company has  62 million cash on hand as of October 31  2015  with a further  48 million due in net receivables and  1 billion worth of stock  With a current market cap of just  1 7 billion  down 30  on 2015 highs  it looks cheap  Analysts agree  with a mean target of  50 83 across those that follow the company 
Now for some less obvious candidates 
Tuesday Morning Corporation  O TUES This Dallas based company sells decorative home goods  bath and kitchenware etc   through a network of close to 800 outlets  across 41 states  It s business model involves sourcing high volume closeout items   items that free up as other outlets clear out stock   from across the US and Europe  It only buys up named brand  reputable stock  and as such  markets itself as a deep discount luxury item retailer  Tuesday Morning just reported second quarter fiscal 2016 results  and outperformed on almost every metric  Net sales hit  319 9 million  up from  301 4 million during the same period a year earlier  Net income came in at  18 9 million  or  0 43 per share  It s just about to open a national distribution center in Phoenix  which positions it to satiate any increased demand that comes on the back of an economic downturn  has no debt  cash on hand of  35 3 million and  232 million in stock  Furthermore  it s down 74  on 2015 highs 
Epic Stores Corp   OTCMKTS EPSC Epic Stores is a Phoenix  Arizona based outlet that specializes in second hand goods  retailed out of its network of Epic Thrift brand stores  It s got a slightly different model to the other two companies on the list  which are both buy to retail outlets  Instead  it sources its merchandise through donation 
The company collects about 750 000 lbs  of product each month   45  of which it recycles  50  of which it retails and 5  of which it discards  It has a far smaller store count than Tuesday Morning or 99 Cents Only   12 currently operating   but generates between  700 000 and  1 million revenues at each location  on a zero per item cost  excluding  of course  operational expense    a ten times multiple on the average goodwill annual revenues location  reported as  107 000 by the Small Business Chronicle in 2014 
So how does it outperform other companies in the same space  Well  it sells the same items as outlets such as the Salvation Army  or Goodwill  but it attempts to emulate the shopping experience of higher ticket outlets  Its locations are all major retail zones  its stores are kept clean and bright  and each unit has an average 2000 sq  ft  processing area that allows it to organize stock in a manner consistent with first hand retail 
It s a small operation    1 15 million revenues recorded during the three months ended September 30  2015   but it s growing steadily and  assuming a conservative expansion model  should maintain a much better liquidity profile than 99 Cents Only  Further  what other company can boast an 80  gross margin on retail items 
99 Cents OnlyThis is an indirect exposure  for the investor seeking an element of diversity  In October 2011  Ares Management  L P   N ARES  teamed up with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to acquire 99 Cents Only for  1 6 billion 
The company is a deep discount chain  selling a range of items for a fixed   0 99  price  It s headquartered in California  and operates most of its network of stores along the East Coast and in Texas  At last count  third quarter fiscal 2015  99 Cents only generated net sales of  491 million  an increase of 2 8  on the same period a year earlier  and increased its store count by 7 7  between the end of the third quarter 2014 and the same date in 2015 
This isn t as straight forward an allocation as Tuesday Morning  99 Cents Only has a weak liquidity profile  high debt  and despite improving net sales between 2014 2015  loses money each quarter  The market capitalization of its parent company  Ares  reflects this fact   the company is down over 45  on 2015 highs and carved out all time lows at the end of January  2015  It currently sits a little over 5 5  off these lows  at  11 52 a share 
Having said this  if we do get a negative wealth effect  and the subsequent shift in consumer preferences that such an effect would initiate  99 Cents Only could quickly turn around 
ConclusionSo there we go  The thrift industry is growing faster than the general retail sector in the US  and attracts more than 57 million shoppers annually  Its growth outpaces that of the US economy as a whole  and its constituent stocks make for attractive allocations even under current conditions  Factor in the potential for a near term downturn  and this attraction only strengthens ",2016-02-18,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/some-thrift-space-exposures-for-when-things-take-a-turn-for-the-worse-200118772,200118772

First revision of 1Q GDP slightly misses forecasts  consumer sentiment revised lower
The second look  of three  at 1Q Gross Domestic Product  the broadest measure of economic output  showed a quarter over quarter  q q  annualized rate of growth of 0 8   revised upward from the 0 5  expansion reported in the first report  This compared to the Bloomberg forecast of a revised 0 9  pace of growth  4Q GDP expanded by an unrevised 1 4  rate  The upward revision came as private inventory investment  residential fixed investment and exports were adjusted higher  while imports were revised lower  However  Personal consumption was unrevised at a 1 9  gain  with expectations calling for an upwardly revised 2 1  pace of growth  Personal consumption grew by an unrevised 2 4  in 4Q 
On inflation  the GDP Price Index was revised to a 0 6  gain  versus forecasts of an unrevised 0 7  increase  while the core PCE Index  which excludes food and energy  was unadjusted at a 2 1  rise  in line with expectations 
The final May University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index was revised to 94 7 from the preliminary level of 95 8  and compared to expectations of 95 4  as a downward adjustment for the expectations component of the report overshadowed an upward revision to the current conditions portion  However  the index was up compared to April s level of 89 0  and sits at the highest level since June 2015  The 1 year inflation outlook declined to 2 4   from April s 2 8  rate  The 5 10 year inflation forecast remained at April s 2 5  level 
In an afternoon speech  Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen reiterated that it s appropriate for the Central Bank to gradually and cautiously increase the overnight interest rate and that in the coming months such a move would possibly be appropriate  Meanwhile  bond yields have rallied as of late amid resurfaced Fed rate hike expectations courtesy of hawkish commentary from Central Bank officials  stronger than expected economic data including continued signs of budding inflation and the April monetary policy meeting minutes which kept the possibility of a June rate hike on the table

Please Note  All U S  markets will be closed on Monday in observance of the Memorial Day holiday 
Europe extends weekly rally  Asia modestly higher to close out the week 
European equities finished modestly higher to extend a strong rally that took the Stoxx Europe 600 Index 3 4  higher for the week its best since February per Bloomberg and allowed it to post its third straight weekly gain  However  the energy sector slipped as crude prices moved lower  while the G 7 meeting in Japan delivered little in the way of new agreements  Traders appeared to tread with some caution ahead of today s speech from U S  Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen  The euro and British pound were lower versus the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mixed  European stocks rallied this week on relatively favorable economic data  eased concerns about the potential for the U K  to vote next month to leave the European Union  EU  known as a Brexit and as the global markets seemed to come to grips with the heightened expectations of a summer rate hike in the U S 
Asian stocks finished mostly to the upside  though conviction may have been limited by caution ahead of today s speech from U S  Fed Chair Yellen  while the G 7 meeting in Japan of world leaders delivered no new major developments  The communique from the meeting noted risks to growth  and stressed the need for monetary fiscal and structural policy to play a role  while it reiterated a commitment to avoid competitive currency devaluations  Japanese equities added to a modest weekly gain  amid some choppiness in the yen following a report on the nation s consumer price inflation  which showed core inflation declined by a slightly smaller amount than expected in April  Also  reports of a potential sales tax hike delay buoyed sentiment 
Mainland Chinese stocks dipped and those trading in Hong Kong advanced following a report that showed the country s industrial profits rose in April  but at a smaller rate than the growth registered in March  Australian securities were led higher by technology  financials and oil and gas issues  while basic materials listings weakened slightly  Indian equities gained ground amid this week s improved global sentiment and as some key earnings reports in the nation topped expectations and stocks trading in South Korea finished higher 
Stocks rally on the week
U S  stocks participated in a global rally  as technology issues continued their upward momentum  healthcare stocks rose solidly and financials remained in rally mode  Some upbeat economic data  highlighted by a jump in domestic new home sales to the highest level in over eight years  helped the markets come to terms with heightened Fed rate hike expectations  Also  the rally in crude oil persisted  with WTI prices breaching the  50 per barrel mark during the week for the first time since last fall  Moreover  growing confidence that the U K  will stay in the EU aided the mood 
With the summer season approaching  a breakout for U S  stocks doesn t appear imminent  But there is hope for the second half of the year  and investors should be aware of the less told story  A continued sluggish U S  economy has kept stocks in a trading range for two years  but there could be a bounce in the second half of the year  Now that the market and the Fed are basically on the same page  the beginning of year turmoil which accompanied the initial rate hike may not be repeated 
Flood of data set to add to Fed focus
Next week s holiday shortened U S  economic calendar will bring a plethora of key data for the markets to digest in their pursuit to determine if a summer Fed rate hike is in the offing  The ISM and Markit s Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers Indexes  PMIs   personal income and spending  the Fed s Beige Book  factory orders and the trade balance highlight the docket  but the headlining report will likely be Friday s May nonfarm payroll report  Sluggish wage growth may be a relatively poor indicator of labor market slack  In fact  correcting for worker composition changes  wages are consistent with a strong labor market that is drawing low wage workers into full time employment  It also may help to explain why the Fed appears itchier than ever to raise rates again 
International reports slated for next week include  Australia building approvals  1Q GDP  trade balance and retail sales  China PMIs  India 1Q GDP and PMIs  Japan retail sales  industrial production  overall household spending and 1Q capital spending  Eurozone European Central Bank monetary policy decision  Consumer Price Index  retail sales  lending figures and PMIs  along with German unemployment change  U K  PMIs ",2016-05-27,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-manage-strong-weekly-gains-200132764,200132764
124659,346174,BIG,Big Lots Stock  BIG  Closed 14  Due To Promising Earnings,opinion,"Shares of Big Lots  NYSE BIG  performed well during Friday trading hours due to a promising first quarter of fiscal 2016  The Ohio based discounted merchandise company reported income from continuing operations of  38 6 million  or  0 79 per diluted share  This result includes an after tax expense of  1 3 million  or  0 03per diluted share  associated with legacy pension plans which have been terminated 
Excluding this expense  adjusted income from continuing operations totaled  39 9 million  or  0 82 per diluted share  non GAAP   which compares to our guidance of adjusted income from continuing operations of  0 66 to  0 72 per diluted share  non GAAP   
Big Lots  net sales for the first quarter increased 2 5  to  1 3 billion  as the company s comparable store sales increase was partially offset by a lower store count compared to last year 
The company also revised its guidance for both the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the entire fiscal 2016  For the second quarter Big Lots estimate adjusted income from continuing operations will be in the range of  0 42 to  0 47 per diluted share  non GAAP   compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of  0 41 per diluted share  non GAAP  for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 
This guidance is based on an estimated comparable store sales in the range of flattish to an increase of 2  compared to a 2 8  comparable store sales increase in Q2 of fiscal 2015 
Based on the actual results for the first quarter and the guidance provided for the second quarter  Big lots updated its guidance for the full year of fiscal 2016  The company changed its estimate fiscal 2016 adjusted income from continuing operations from  3 20 to  3 35 per diluted share  non GAAP  to  3 35 to  3 50 per diluted share  non GAAP  
This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations of  3 01 per diluted share  non GAAP  for fiscal 2015  This outlook is based on a comparable store sales increase in the low single digit range and total sales up slightly  Big Lots  believes that this financial performance will result in cash flow of approximately  200 million

124683,346198,BIG,Stability Premium Leaves  Safe  Sectors Vulnerable,opinion,It s the last week of what has turned out to be an incredibly light volume summer  with equities quietly grinding higher for months  The blue chip indices are still very close to 52 week highs  but last week s action raised some questions in terms of how sustainable this mild bullish action really is  Both the Dow and the S P 500 had ugly reversal days on Tuesday  The Dow after coming within 8 points of hitting a new high  and the S P after hitting a new high earlier in the day Both indices not only closed at the low of their daily trading range  but also took out the lows of previous day s ranges   tracing out an unusually volatile day considering the placid action of the last few weeks  Small caps followed a similar path  with the Russell 2000 Index  IWM  clearing the July high  only to finish lower on the day and continue to fall later in the week  From a macro perspective  the risks continue to loom  with plenty of bearish potential catalysts threatening  Europe s debt issues continue to weigh on the global market  And now that a German recession is likely  traders have to worry about a lack of German demand for goods and services   adding more pressure to an already weak eurozone  In China  the situation is shifting from bad to worse  China remains an export based economy  despite efforts to boost domestic consumption  With less demand from the developed world  Europe primarily  but also the US   China simply cannot maintain robust growth rates  This creates an interesting dynamic for the Australian economy which relies heavily on Chinese demand for natural resources like coal and base metals  Our most aggressive position right now is a bearish bet on the Australian dollar  Our short AUD USD position should continue to benefit from weakening demand from China  as well as a potential reversal of  safe haven  capital flows which have been supporting Australian government bonds  While it may be a long shot  our trade could benefit significantly from any surprise announcement from the Reserve Bank of Australia  There is increasing incentive for the RBA to lower rates in order to increase the country s competitive stance   which in turn would add tremendous pressure to the Australian dollar  Aussie Aussie Aussie  Oi Oi Oi  Despite the relatively calm action for domestic equity markets  we re seeing a number of situations developing that could lead to excellent trading scenarios  As we finish up a dull summer and first string traders start turning their attention to markets once again  things could quickly heat up and kick off some dramatic trading opportunities  Below are a few of the areas we re tracking this week Reach For Yield Puts Dividend Stocks in Vulnerable Spot The Fed s    zero interest rate policy has created a stretch for yield that has affected a wide range of asset classes  Treasury prices rallied to record levels  and corresponding low yields   corporate bonds   both investment quality and junk   have seen massive capital inflows  and dividend stocks have been bid higher as investors try to generate income  Barron s weekend article    notes the extent to which investors  appetite for yield has driven prices to unsustainable levels  Sectors with the highest dividends are trading at rich premiums to the broad market  relative to the historical norms  Utility stocks  which yield about 4   are more expensive than they have been roughly 90  of the time  Likewise  telecoms  which yield about 4 5   are costlier than they have been about 80  of the time  The consumer staples sector  which yields north of 3   is in nosebleed territory  too  Its valuation is higher than it has been in almost 90  of its history  While we re not likely to see the FOMC hike rates anytime soon  traders appear a bit too optimistic about additional liquidity measures considering the relatively strong domestic economic data  Treasuries are already beginning to back off  with corresponding rates increasing   As Treasury rates increase  the effect trickles into the corporate bond world and also into high yield equities  The presence of alternative income options could very well shift capital away from the high dividend equity areas  triggering a reversion to the mean in terms of industry valuations  Utility stocks have been in a bull market for well over three years now  Given the extended valuations  a shift in the fundamental dynamics could trigger an extended selloff   with plenty of opportunities for bearish swing trades along the way Consumer Stress Pressures RetailersThe retail sector has been a dangerous minefield during the second quarter earnings season  Last week  Big Lots Inc   BIG  blew up  dropping roughly 25  after missing earnings and issuing lower guidance for Q3  Breaking down the report  it appears that low margin items like groceries did well  while sales for higher priced items such as furniture and home goods were poor  We ve seen this this theme across the board  with discretionary purchases being delayed  and retailers competing to capture revenue from low margin staple items  This trend has put tremendous pressure on grocery stocks like Kroger Co  KR  and Safeway Inc   SWY  as big box retailers and drug store pharmacies capture more market share  Even the luxury   leisure side of retail has been hit as fewer middle class consumers can afford big ticket discretionary items  As mentioned in the August 6th turret  the Harley Davidson  HOG  CEO issued sobering comments regarding the uncertainty for consumer purchases heading into the second half  While retail stocks have been relatively resilient as a group  the third quarter could usher in some significant shifts as traders begin to incorporate weak Q3 guidance along with the broad macro issues Precious Metal Mania We re watching the action in precious metals as interested observers from the sidelines right now  Silver in particular had a tremendous week   rallying 9 2  and logging gains in each of the 5 trading sessions  From a technical perspective  the move looks very powerful with spot metal prices and precious metal miner stocks all participating in the action  Short covering likely added firepower to the move as resistance levels were broken and light trading volume made it difficult to cover positions efficiently  Looking at the action from a macro economic viewpoint  it s difficult to place a lot of confidence in the move  A rally in precious metals would imply increasing confidence that the Fed will embark on another round of quantitative easing  But consider the following  Blue chip equities are near 52 week highs Employment metrics have been showing modest improvements The presidential election is just around the corner Given this environment  the Fed is likely to act only on a delayed basis   and even if they do act  the result is likely to be swift disappointment  the hope better than the delivery   If the bullish action in precious metals continues  we are certainly prepared to participate  Even if the move turns out to be a false trend  there is nothing false about profits pulled from the action  But with a flawed fundamental backdrop for the current rally  we remain skeptical for now with a watchful eye on the situation Heading into the week  our roster of open trades is modestly bearish with plenty of cash available for new trade setups  With the second quarter earnings season over  traders will now turn their attention to news from the Fed meeting in Jackson Hole  along with the evolving global economic picture  Given the low level of volatility over the last several months  it would not be abnormal to see a major price move  higher OR lower   Traders have been lulled into complacency with the tame price action  and the light volume makes it difficult to react to any significant shift in expectations  Trade  em well this week Disclaimer  This content is
