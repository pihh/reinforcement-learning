194930,416446,DISCA,Why the Summer Olympics are held in July  August despite heat,news,"By Malcolm Foster TOKYO  Reuters    A heat wave scorching Japan is raising questions about timing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics during July and August  typically the annual peak for temperatures and humidity  and the health risks that might pose for athletes and spectators  When Tokyo first hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964  they were held during the cooler  drier month of October  The 1968 Mexico City games were also held in October  But most Summer Olympics for the past three decades have been held in July or August  recognized as an ideal time window for TV networks to cover the event  They pay billions of dollars for broadcasting rights during these months when the global sports calendar is otherwise light  increasing the chances of capturing a bigger audience  Neal Pilson  the former president of CBS Sports  which broadcast the 1992  1994 and 1998 Winter Olympics in the United States  said  the IOC is well aware of American network preferences for the timing of the Summer and Winter games   referring to the International Olympic Committee  IOC    The Summer Olympics are simply of less value if held in October because of pre existing program commitments for sports   he told Reuters  The IOC stipulated that bidders for the 2020 Olympics should hold the event between July 15 and Aug 31  Tokyo chose July 24 to Aug 9  To set the dates  the IOC gets input from international sporting federations so as not to interrupt their schedules  PRIME TIME But the dates are also chosen because of the lull in the sports calendar  public Olympic records show and TV sports marketing experts say  In September or October  the Olympics would have to compete for viewers  attention against other events  such as the start of the NFL American football season  Major League Baseball playoffs in the United States and the early months of the soccer season in Europe   It s designed to fit in this window  a lull in the sports schedule where not much is going on   said Victor Matheson  a professor of economics at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts  Candidate cities can propose alternative dates  although they are not always granted  When Doha in Qatar proposed hosting the 2020 games in October because it was too hot in July and August  the Olympic Broadcasting Services  which provides TV coverage for many events  and International Television and Marketing Services were critical of the idea in feedback published in an April 2012 Olympic working group report   Olympic Games held in the IOC s preferred period of July August provide broadcasters with a  guarantee  that they will be prime time market leaders   the feedback read   In October  broadcasters would face lower viewership ratings levels   NBC  which in 2014 agreed to pay the IOC  7 65 billion for exclusive broadcasting rights in the United States through 2032  declined to comment  Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA   which acquired Eurosport in 2015 and spent 1 3 billion euros to buy pan European rights to four Olympics through the Paris 2024 games  also declined to comment  IOC spokesman Michael Noyelle said in an email that broadcasters provide their input during the development of the competition schedule after the Olympics dates have been set  The IOC established July and August as the months to hold the Summer Olympics in 2000  Noyelle said   As there was no exception requested for the Tokyo 2020 candidature  no stakeholders were consulted on Tokyo s dates   he said   IDEAL CLIMATE  Most Summer Olympics have been held in July and August since 1976  and organizers have had to cope with hot weather in several host cities  Exceptions to the dates are made  The 2000 Sydney games were held in the last two weeks of September to adjust to the Southern Hemisphere weather  Tokyo said in its bid that its proposed dates have  many days of mild and sunny weather   providing  an ideal climate for athletes to perform at their best   The concerns about high temperatures during the Olympics have arisen because of a heatwave in Japan this year  Temperatures soared to a record 41 1 Celsius  106 F  on Monday just north of Tokyo  At least 80 people have died and thousands have gone to hospitals  However  the average high for the last 10 days of July and first 10 days of August in Tokyo over the past 20 years has been about 32 Celsius  90 F   according to Japan Meteorological Agency data  A team of international researchers that gathered heat  humidity and other data along the proposed Tokyo marathon course in late July and August in 2016 and 2017 found conditions could put athletes and spectators at increased risk of heat stroke  and have urged organizers to create more areas of shade   I m afraid that Tokyo s conditions will be the worst in Olympic history  for the marathon  said Makoto Yokohari  a professor of environmental studies at the University of Tokyo who was involved in the study and is an advisor to Olympics planners  Tokyo organizers say they are taking the warnings seriously  and have decided to move up the start time of the marathon races to 7 a m  from 7 30 a m  They are also covering the marathon course and other major roads with more than 100 kilometers  60 miles  of a resin based surface that reflects infrared rays and lowers the pavement temperature by as much as 8 degrees Celsius  Organizers are also looking at ways to keep spectators cool with tents  fans and sprays of cooling mist   We are preparing for the heat counter measures in every possible aspect   said Masa Takaya  a Tokyo 2020 spokesman  
Holding the games in October or November  would be an ideal time for Tokyo  but I would say never in summer in Tokyo   said Yokohari  the marathon study professor   It s hot and very humid    Reporting and writing by Malcolm Foster  additional reporting by Elaine Lies in Tokyo and Liana Baker in New York  Editing by Neil Fullick ",2018-07-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/why-the-summer-olympics-are-held-in-july-august-despite-heat-1546193,1546193

194962,416478,DISCA,Insurers bet  a little nervously  on smooth Games in South Korea,news,"By Noor Zainab Hussain  Carolyn Cohn and Suzanne Barlyn LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    If South Korea s Winter Olympics go off without a hitch this month  organizers will not be alone in toasting success  Their insurers will also be celebrating a tidy profit  The Games are being staged about two hours  drive from one of the world s most heavily militarised borders  in a host country that is technically at war with its neighbor and with teams that include two nations    the United States and North Korea    which have swapped nuclear threats  There are also concerns among Olympic organizers and sponsors that the Games  at the ski resort of Pyeongchang  could become a target of cyber hacking  a threat that could disrupt competition in the event of a major cyber attack  The International Olympic Committee  IOC  takes out protection for around  800 million at each Games  which covers the vast majority of the roughly  1 billion investment it makes in each of the host cities  The policy will pay out for a range of mishaps  ranging up to declarations of war  actual war  or acts of war  An IOC spokesperson said it was in constant contact with the South Korean government about the security situation   We have been informed that the position of the South Korean government with regard to security at the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018 has not changed   the spokesperson said  The IOC declined to reveal the premium it has paid for the Pyeongchang  but insurers said it was likely to be around 2 3 percent of the total cover  At the IOC s coverage of about  800 million  this would represent a cost of around  16 24 million  One underwriter said this would be relatively high and could reflect the greater security risks surrounding the Pyeongchang event  At the summer Games at Rio de Janeiro in 2016  when worries were centred on an outbreak of Zika virus  and at London in 2012  the IOC paid premiums of about  13 million  At Beijing in 2008  it paid just over  4 0 million for the same coverage  In terms of corruption  theft or violent crime    which bedeviled the Rio Olympics    South Korea is a relatively safe country to host the Olympics  says research firm IHS Markit   If you didn t have North Korea  there would be very little to discuss   said Duncan Fraser  senior partner at insurance broker JLT Sport Media and Entertainment  He said not all war scenarios would be covered   If there is a war involving one of the five major powers  it is unlikely to be covered by an insurance policy  but if it just happens to be a war between North Korea and South Korea  without any sort of involvement of the U S  or China or Russia  you might have cover there   Fraser said  CYBER SECURITY As organizers prepare to stage the opening ceremony on Friday  political tensions surrounding the event are evident  despite South Korean President Moon Jae in s efforts to use the Games as a way to re engage with the North  A team from North Korea is competing  and two of the reclusive nation s most senior officials  including leader Kim Jong Un s younger sister  will be among the VIP guests for the opening  U S  Vice President Mike Pence will also be there  two days after he vowed tough new sanctions against the North  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  who met Pence on Wednesday and agreed they could  never accept  a nuclear armed North Korea  is also among some 20 heads of state and top political leaders to attend the Games  Olympics sponsors as well as hoteliers  merchandisers  car hire firms and travel companies also typically buy insurance  Switzerland s Swatch Group  SIX UHR   which owns Omega  the official timekeeper of the Games  said it had taken out  several insurance contracts  as normal  a spokeswoman said  Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA   which owns European broadcaster Eurosport and is a first time Olympics broadcaster  is insured against cyber attacks  said Dave Schafer  senior vice president for Olympics operations at the firm   We ve taken a lot of measures around cyber security   he said   We feel very secure  But there can always be an issue   Comcast Corp  NASDAQ CMCSA   whose NBC Sports will broadcast the Games in the United States  said in its 2016 annual report that increasing data security breaches meant its insurance policies in general  likely would not be sufficient to cover our losses   NBC Sports declined to comment  Olympics organizers and contractors rely on many insurers and types of coverage  Firms worried about event cancellation buy so called contingency insurance against loss of revenue  Political risk is offered as a standalone policy or an add on to property insurance to cover disruption from terrorism or war  These policies typically also include accident and health cover  Adam Posner  senior underwriter for crisis management  North America  at Allianz  DE ALVG   said the insurer had seen more enquiries for political risk insurance for the Games  Those concerned about an online attack  including by nation states  buy cyber policies  with broadcasters also able to buy cover against transmission failure  Still  some insurers are wary of covering these Games  Lloyd s of London insurer Talbot Underwriting Services  which has covered past Games  decided against underwriting Pyeongchang after weighing up the risks against the premium it could fetch  
 A number of enquiries came to Talbot for this year s Winter Olympics  but we were unable to match our assessment of the exposure with the pricing   said Alan Norris  Head of Contingency at Talbot ",2018-02-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/insurers-bet-a-little-nervously-on-smooth-games-in-south-korea-1215123,1215123

195024,416540,DISCA,Discovery  DISCA  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this operator of cable TV channels such as TLC and Animal Planet is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Discovery is 1 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 71 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of  4  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Discovery is 26 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 14 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 18 4  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 15 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Discovery have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Discovery a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Discovery well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/discovery-disca-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-200480008,200480008

195026,416542,DISCA,Discovery Communications  DISCA  Surpasses Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 87 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 52 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 82   A quarter ago  it was expected that this operator of cable TV channels such as TLC and Animal Planet would post earnings of  0 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 98  delivering a surprise of  1 01

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Discovery shares have added about 11 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 22 7  
What s Next for Discovery 
While Discovery has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

195031,416547,DISCA,TV networks open labs to read the minds of viewers,news,"By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK  Reuters    TV networks are trying a new tactic to understand what shows and commercials people like to watch  read their minds  Comcast  O CMCSA  Corp s NBCUniversal and Viacom Inc are each opening labs where they will study TV viewers in mock living rooms filled with infrared cameras tracking their biometrics   such things as eye movements and facial reactions made while hooked up to skin sensors and heart monitors   Viacom s lab  which is being built in New York  will include electroencephalograms  EEGs  to monitor peoples  brain waves while watching television  And ratings firm Nielsen Holdings  which just bought neuroscience firm Innerscope Research earlier this year  is adding facial coding and biometrics to its labs  which currently conduct eye tracking and perform EEGs   Networks have tried for years to find out what viewers think  but their technology is still mostly based on surveys and asking watchers to turn dials about what they like and don t  The new biometric data avoids questions  tapping straight into physical response    The problem is that when you ask someone how they respond to things  they sometimes think about it or they overthink it   said Alan Wurtzel  president of research and media development at NBCU   This is the closest to what s going on inside your brain    As more viewers fast forward through ads  and advertisers increasingly shift their budgets away from TV in favor of digital ads  networks see neuroscience and biometrics as a way for them to target ads better and improve relations with advertisers   The experience of The Ad Council  a New York based organization that creates ad campaigns for non profits and government agencies  shows how using biometrics could help boost response from viewers  It has worked with Nielsen Neuroscience to test some of its ads   In testing one ad  for The Shelter Pet Project  which promotes the adoption of pets from local animal shelters  viewers were engaged by watching a mixed breed dog playing with the screen and reaching out to viewers  But the parts of viewers  brains triggering memory weren t firing when the message about contacting Shelterpetproject org appeared on the screen  said Patty Goldman  research director with Ad Council   So Ad Council tweaked the ad to add audio encouraging viewers to visit the site  While it s not known how much the change affected the results of the ad  the Ad Council did have success with the entire campaign  seeing average monthly visitors to the Web site increase to 174 000 from 74 000 within the first three months of the campaign   NBCUniversal  which opened its lab in Orlando  Florida  in September  wants to be able to tell which scenes elicit the strongest emotional response from viewers  and then use those scenes in its promotional ads  said Wurtzel   Viacom is examining different kinds of viewer focus and ultimately wants to find the best time for a commercial  so that  for example  if a scene elicits a response from expectant mothers it can plug in a diaper ad  if the scene makes people hungry  it s time to run an ad for food  Viacom  whose offerings include Nickelodeon and MTV  has been working to improve the ratings of many of its top networks  which have been in decline   The concern is that the new process  which at  30 000 to  100 000 per study costs about twice as much as normal focus groups  may not improve sales    Just because their brain cells are lighting up during a commercial  doesn t necessarily mean they are going to buy the product  they may simply find the commercial engaging   said Beth Rockwood  senior vice president  market resources and advertising sales research at Discovery Communications  O DISCA   which is looking into possibly doing more with neuroscience research   Hershey Co has been using neuroscience and biometric research for several years  and still is unsure what conclusions it can draw regarding their effectiveness   I don t think anyone is comfortable saying that this is going to translate into more sales   said Andy Smith  director of consumer insights at Hershey   He said he agrees that the research can win points with advertisers  a crucial advantage in TV s war with the Internet   If I can get more growth by spending less  we benefit   Smith said   MIND READING  Every week in the Time Warner Center in New York City about 200 people are paid to come to be watched watching television  movies or playing on computers in Time Warner Inc s three year old Medialab  Participants get paid anywhere from  10 for a 10 minute study to  1 000 for a full day   Cameras which track their eyes and record their facial expression line the front of a fake living room  Clip on sensors on their fingers pump a micro electric current to track sweat  Belts track heart rates and next year  the lab will add EEGs   Time Warner s Turner Broadcasting System  a pioneer in biometrics  with Innerscope Research tested a U S  Navy ad that depicted an aircraft carrier  Using eye tracking technology  Turner was able to see that viewers with devices in their hands looked up at the sound of the helicopters in the middle of the ad  There also was a spike in the heart rates and skin sensors in the moments following the sound  showing that they had the strongest emotional response to the ad during those seconds  said Howard Shimmel  chief research officer at Turner    The eye tracking showed that they looked back up  but the biometrics showed that they were engaged   said Dr  Carl Marci  chief neuroscientist at Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience   Eye tracking is not an emotional measure  it s an attention measure and even people focus on something  their brain may not be responding to it    However  viewers looked back down at their devices after the sound  Turner s response to advertisers  announce your brands  don t just show them   Networks also need to worry about toeing the line between being engaging and making consumers feel used    I think that we should all feel a little paranoid and a little manipulated by all of this   said Dave Poltrack  chief research officer at CBS Corp  N CBS    This is a trust and if we do it right  we provide information and content that is valued

195034,416550,DISCA,Is Discovery  DISCA  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Discovery  Inc    NASDAQ DISCA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Discovery has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 34  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 39  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Discovery s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 77 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 05  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Discovery has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Discovery stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Discovery has a P S ratio of about 2 06  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 32x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Discovery currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Discovery a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the PEG ratio for Discovery is just 0 41  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 24  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DISCA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though Discovery might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives DISCA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been sturdy at best  The current year has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has seen one up and one down in the same time period  This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 4  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Discovery  Inc  Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat robust trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineDiscovery is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 33  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nevertheless  over the past two years  the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to delve deeper in this stock as it appears to be a compelling pick  Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit PotentialThe biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of

195040,416556,DISCA,3 Reasons Why Discovery  DISCA  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this operator of cable TV channels such as TLC and Animal Planet is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Discovery is 1 6   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 71 4  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of  4  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Discovery is 26 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 14 2  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 18 4  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 15 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Discovery  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Discovery has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

195051,416567,DISCA,Discovery Communications  DISCA  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 2  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This operator of cable TV channels such as TLC and Animal Planet is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 79 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  49 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 71 billion  up 17 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Discovery 
For Discovery  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Discovery will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Discovery would post earnings of  0 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 74  delivering a surprise of  8 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Discovery doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/discovery-communications-disca-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200410998,200410998

195083,416599,DISCA,Is Discovery  DISCA  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Discovery  Inc    NASDAQ DISCA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Discovery has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 2x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Discovery s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 51 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Discovery has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Discovery stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Discovery has a P S ratio of about 1 8  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DISCA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Discovery currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Discovery a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Discovery might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives DISCA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen three up and five down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 8 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Discovery Communications  Inc  Price and Consensus    The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDiscovery is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 40  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  16 13   A quarter ago  it was expected that this operator of cable TV channels such as TLC and Animal Planet would post earnings of  0 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 66  delivering a surprise of  21 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Discovery shares have added about 47 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 3  
What s Next for Discovery 
While Discovery has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Discovery was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Segmental Performance
Media Networks

You can see  
The segment generates revenues principally from three sources   i  affiliate revenues  ii  advertising revenues  and  iii  ancillary revenues  Affiliate revenues climbed 2  to  1 16 billion owing to increase in revenues both on the domestic and international fronts  However  advertising revenues decreased 1  to  1 11 billion  mainly due to below par showing on the domestic front 
Moreover  the quarter witnessed ancillary revenues to be flat at  129 million  Domestic ancillary revenues were  70 million  down 8   Such revenues increased 11  to  59 million on the international front 
Additionally  quarterly operating income  on an adjusted basis  declined significantly to  747 million

Price Movement
Shares of Viacom have underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over the past six months due to its struggles  Shares of the company rallied 4 5  in the last six months  while the industry witnessed gain of 14 6  in the same period 

The outperformance in the fiscal second quarter might provide the stock with the much needed boost 
Our Take
Viacom is leaving no stone unturned to turn around its fortunes  Earlier  Viacom s proposed merger with CBS Corp    NYSE CBS   was cancelled  The merger would have given Viacom a much needed boost   Also  it has been inking multiple deals of late  in a bid to expand further  To this end  Viacom inked a deal with Telefonica  MC TEF  S A   NYSE TEF   in Nov 2016  to acquire Television Federal S A   Telefe  Viacom Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   In another move aimed at combating the challenges  Viacom unveiled a new strategic plan in February  As a part of the plan  it is currently focusing on six of its core brands  BET  Comedy Central  MTV  Nickelodeon  Nick Jr  and Paramount

The increase in revenues witnessed in the U S  Networks and International Networks units was somewhat mitigated by the disappointing performance of the Education and Other division  Quarterly adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization  OIBDA  also increased 5  year over year 
Quarterly Performance 
Revenues in the US Networks division climbed 3  to  829 million  Segmental growth was driven by a 5  rise in distribution revenues to  408 million  While advertising revenues climbed 1  to  405 million  revenues from other sources increased 7  to  16 million  Moreover  adjusted OIBDA was up 6  year over year for the segment  Adjusted OIBDA margin was 60  in the reported quarter compared with 59  a year ago 
In addition  international networks revenues climbed 5  to  747 million  While distribution revenues in the segment climbed 9  to  447 million  advertising revenues declined 1  to  282 million  Revenues from other sources increased 20  to  18 million  Moreover  adjusted OIBDA increased 7  on a year over year basis  Adjusted OIBDA margin was flat at 26  
However  revenues from the Education and Other division decreased 16  to  37 million  The decline was primarily due to the timing of production deliveries at the company s Studios production operations 
In fact  this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company exited 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of  267 million and  7 970 million of debt outstanding  non current portion  compared with  300 million and  7  841 million  respectively  at the end of 2016

195192,416708,DISCA,Is Discovery Communications  DISCA  A Great Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Discovery Communications  Inc    NASDAQ DISCA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Discovery Communications has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 74 as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 38  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Discovery Communications  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years   Moreover  the current level is significantly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Broadcasting Radio TV industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 79  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is largely undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Discovery Communications has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 63  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Discovery Communications stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Discovery Communications has a P S ratio of about 2 38  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DISCA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Discovery Communications currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DISCA a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for DISCA is just 0 76  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 21  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DISCA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Discovery Communications might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives DISCA a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen three upward and downward estimate revisions in the past sixty days  while the next year estimate has seen four upward revisions and two downward revision in the same time frame This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as well  as the current year consensus estimate has tumbled 0 9  in the past one month  while the next year estimate has gone up by 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Discovery Communications  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDISCA is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 18  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Broadcasting Radio TV industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors and analysts  sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Stocks to Ride a 588  Revenue Explosion At Zacks  we re mostly focused on short term profit cycles  but the hottest of all technology mega trends is starting to take hold   By last year  it was already generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early

Top ROE Stocks to Play in a Raging Bull Market

	The curtains are almost down on the second quarter reporting cycle with earnings growth for the S P 500 index remaining in the negative territory  Yet  results show a sequential improvement and impressive beat ratios  igniting hopes of an inflection point in the vicinity 

	However  an aging bull market that is currently running for over 89 months raises an element of doubt among investors who dread a market correction with stocks hovering near their record highs 
	As investors scout for cherry pickings  they are often on the lookout for  cash cow  stocks that would enable them to milk more cash or profits 
	However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make them a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return ROE  An Effective Financial Metric
	ROE   Net Income Shareholders  Equity
	ROE helps investors distinguish between profit generating companies from profit burners and is useful for determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns 
	Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher the better  It measures how well a company is growing its profits without investing any new equity capital in the business and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Screening Parameters for Solid ROE Stocks
	In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we take a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy 

Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts receivable  property  equipment  inventory and furniture  Of course  the higher the ROA  the better it is 5 Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X Industry  This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated to solid cash strength Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment

195240,416756,DISCA,6 Stocks Set To Rise On New Analyst Coverage,opinion,"Do analysts create value for companies by initiating coverage  Coverage initiation of a stock by analyst s  is actually a sign of increased investor keenness 
Investors  on their part  often assume there is something special in a stock to attract analysts to cover it  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value 
Why do analysts initiate coverage  Of course  stocks are not randomly picked to cover  A new coverage on a stock is usually the result of a promising future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investors  focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closure look at it  After all  who doesn t love to produce something that is already in demand 
Interestingly  stocks typically see an incremental upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage analyst  The price movement is a function of the recommendations from the new analysts  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significant positive incremental price reaction than Hold recommendations  In this regard  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation 
However  one should also look for the average change in broker recommendation rather than a single recommendation change 
Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock 
So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks 
Screening Criteria 
Number of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  
Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  
The number of increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy  but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof  Here are the other screening parameters 
Prices greater than or equal to 5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors 
Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual investors

195244,416760,DISCA,Sumner Redstone Replaced Close To Half Of All Viacom Board Members,opinion,"The internal conflicts at Viacom   NASDAQ VIAB   between Sumner Redstone and board members have reached a boiling point  as Mr  Redstone has removed 5 members of Viacom s board   One of these members includes CEO Philippe Dauman  who has been Redstone s biggest target for months   Their relationship took a turn for the worse when Dauman elected to sell a minority stake in Paramount Pictures 
The other four directors removed include George Abrams  Fred Salerno  William Schwartz  and Blythe McGarvie   Redstone is 93 years old  and many speculate that he has grown too senile to be able to make decisions for the company   There are also rumors circulating that Shari  Mr  Redstone s daughter  is using her father so that she can take over control of Viacom 
New board members include Kenneth Lerer  co founder of the Huffington Post  Nicole Seligman  a former executive at Sony  Judith McHale  former head of Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA   Ron Nelson  who used to work at Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Studios  and Thomas May  chairman of Eversource Energy 
Some of Viacom s directors have voiced their disapproval of the board reshuffling  saying that Shari Redstone is going against her father s wishes by undermining the board s ability to manage Viacom in a way that is reflective of the best interests of shareholders   The ousted directors plan on contesting their removal from the board in court

195254,416770,DISCA,Twenty First Century  FOXA  Q3 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"Twenty First Century Fox  Inc    NASDAQ FOXA   is slated to report third quarter fiscal 2016 results on May 4  after the closing bell  The big question facing investors now is  whether the company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter after posting in line earnings in the previous quarter 
Notably  in the previous three out of four quarters  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with a positive earnings surprise of 4   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Likely Earnings Beat in the Cards
Our proven model shows that Twenty First Century Fox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  The Most Accurate estimate is 47 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 46 cents for the company  So the ensuing difference  that is  an Earnings ESP of  2 17   combined with the company s Zacks Rank  3  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factors Influencing This Quarter
Management expects Cable Network Programming to drive the company s fiscal 2016 financial performance on the back of rising affiliate fees  Affiliate fees are the dominant source of revenues for the Cable Network segment and also account for a major portion of the total revenue  In the past few months  the company s Fox Business Network   FBN   organised the Grand Old Party s   GOP   presidential debates which turned out to be a grand success 
According to Nielsen Media Research  FBN achieved new highs in viewership in the first three months of 2016  Higher ratings will not only increase the company s advertising revenues but help in boosting subscriber growth 
However  the company s international Cable and Film operations may be negatively impacted by the foreign currency exchange rate 
Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Discovery Communications  Inc    NASDAQ DISCA   has an Earnings ESP of  2 22  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Nexstar Broadcasting Group  Inc    NASDAQ NXST   has an Earnings ESP of  19 40  and a Zacks Rank  3

195255,416771,DISCA,Scripps Networks  SNI  Q1 Earnings  Stock Set To Disappoint ,opinion,"Scripps Networks Interactive  Inc    NASDAQ SNI   is scheduled to release first quarter 2016 financial numbers before the opening bell on May 5 
In the fourth quarter of 2015  Scripps Networks had posted a positive earnings surprise of 33 66   In fact  the company boasts an impressive history with respect to earnings  having outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  The average earnings beat is 17 93  

However  things don t look rosy this time round and the stock may be in for a rude shock in the first quarter  In fact our quantitative model too does not hint at an earnings beat  Here s why
Scripps Networks does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   necessary for increasing the odds of an earnings surprise 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Scripps Networks is  5 94  with the Most Accurate estimate lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 01 by 6 cents 
Zacks Rank  Scripps Networks carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  that alone is not sufficient to secure an earnings beat 
As a caution  we advise investors not to consider Sell rated  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  stocks going into an earnings announcement 
Factors Likely at Play
We expect Scripps Networks  first quarter revenues to be hurt by foreign exchange related headwinds  Moreover  the company s bottom line is likely to face the brunt of elevated programming expenses 
During the first quarter  the Knoxville  TN based company completed the remaining 35  stake buy in Travel Channel Media from Cox Communications Inc  Moreover  Scripps Networks bought a 52 7  stake in Poland s popular multi platform media company  TVN  last year  Even though positive on the company s growth by acquisition strategy  we cannot ignore the integration risks attached to it  Moreover  this could exert further pressure on the company s cash position 
However  we are impressed with the company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments buybacks  During the quarter  the company raised its quarterly dividend per share by 8 7  to 25 cents  We expect a detailed commentary on these shareholder friendly activities during the conference call

195257,416773,DISCA,DreamWorks  DWA   Stock To Disappoint In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc    NASDAQ DWA   is scheduled to release first quarter 2016 results on May 5  after market close 
In the fourth quarter of 2015  the Glendale  California based company posted a massive positive earnings surprise of 223 53   In fact  the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  by an average of 119 42  

Factors at Play
We believe that more than the first quarter report  investors keenly await an update on Comcast Corporation s   NASDAQ CMCSA   recent announcement that it has entered into a deal to buy DreamWorks  The deal  expected to close by Dec 31  2016  has an equity value of approximately  3 8 billion 
Coming back to first quarter results  we expect the company to be hurt by higher costs  We believe that higher promotion and distribution expenses coupled with the implementation of new technologies will hurt margins  Moreover  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with the release of the movies outside the U S 
Furthermore  the lack of business diversification at DreamWorks is a cause of concern  The company depends extensively on its Feature Films segment  Consequently  below par performance of the unit will hurt results significantly 
Earnings Whispers
Our quantitative model shows that the company is likely to disappoint in the first quarter  Here s why 
DreamWorks does not have the right combination of two key ingredients   positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better   required to top expectations 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for DreamWorks is  200 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate currently stands at a loss of 3 cents  wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 1 cent per share 
Zacks Rank  DreamWorks carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement 
Stocks to Consider
With DreamWorks likely to disappoint  we present below some other companies in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter
