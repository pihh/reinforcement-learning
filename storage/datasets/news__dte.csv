7231,228746,DTE,Earnings Preview  DTE Energy  DTE  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects DTE Energy  DTE  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 28  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 1  
Revenues are expected to be  3 82 billion  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 68  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for DTE Energy 
For DTE Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 84  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DTE Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that DTE Energy would post earnings of  1 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 99  delivering a surprise of  9 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
DTE Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-dte-energy-dte-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200475804,200475804

14941,236456,DTE,Near Term Outlook Looks Sunny For Electric Power Stocks,opinion,The Zacks  industry involves the process of generation  transmission  distribution  storage and sale of electricity to residential  commercial and industrial customers  Most of these companies are regulated and have operations in highly competitive markets  Demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady  regardless of economic cycles Widely available coal once used to be the key source of electricity in the United States  However  courtesy of the shale gas revolution and conscious efforts toward generating more electricity from clean sources  natural gas gradually replaced coal  Natural gas  clean burning nature  vast availability and low prices are working in its favor  In addition  decline in the cost of setting up utility scale power projects based on renewable energy sources is helping utilities to replace coal from their generation portfolio Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Utilities are focusing on adding energy storage projects to their portfolio and providing clean energy to customers  The industry participants are investing in battery storage devices that will help in transition toward usage of clean sources and boost usage of renewable energy as fuel sources  thereby lending support to the grid during peak demand periods  The U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   projects that utility scale battery storage capacity will increase over the long term  As of March 2019  899 megawatt   MW   of battery storage projects was being operated in the United States  By 2023  EIA expects battery storage power capacity to exceed 2 500 MW  provided the currently planned additions are completed and no current operating capacity is retired  Electricity from clean sources is another key area of work  With new power plants being installed  overall electricity generation is going to increase in the United States  EIA forecasts renewable sources to contribute 17  of electricity production in 2019 and nearly 19  in 2020 The share of natural gas will be 37  in 2019 and 2020 each  Both renewable energy and natural gas continue to eat away the share of coal in electricity generation  which is expected to average 25  in 2019 and 22  in 2020  One of the most significant developments in the utility space is the awareness of energy efficiency programs  and implementation of the same in residential and commercial buildings and industrial plants  Utilities of the United States are spending billions of dollars in educating their customers about the benefits of proper and effective usage of energy  Usage of government certified ENERGY STAR products helps customers to lower its utility bills by nearly 30  in a year  without compromising on energy usage  This helps in lowering emission and allows utility operators to continue serving a wider customer base without developing a costly new power plant Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates a thriving near term  The 65 stock Utility   Electric Power industry is housed within the broader  Sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  65  which places it at the top 25  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 25  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are  gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since May 2019  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised upward by 3 8  Before we present a few Utility   Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and current valuation Industry Beats S P 500 and Sector on Shareholder ReturnsThe Utility Electric Power industry has outperformed its own sector and the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past 12 months The industry has gained 14 6  compared with its sector s gain of 0 7  and the Zacks S P 500 composite s gain of 7 1  in the period One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  TTM ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Utility Electric Power companies  the industry is trading at 12 66X compared with the S P 500 s 11 08X and the Utilities sector s 17 46X  Industry EV EBITDA TTM  vs S P 500 Industry EV EBITDA TTM  vs Sector In the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 12 74X  as low as 7 83X  with a median of 9 75X To Sum UpCapital intensive Utility companies are concerned about continued increase in interest rates  After increasing interest rates for nine times since December 2015  the Fed lowered interest rates twice in recent months  which is definitely a positive development for utilities  Another rate cut is expected before the end of the year and the industry participants are taking advantage of this to lower their capital costs by refinancing their high cost debts with low cost ones Moreover  cost control  new electric rates and customer growth should continue to help the players maintain operational stability  However  as per EIA forecasts  winter this year is going to be less severe than last year and is expected to lower the utility bills of customers The utility industry being a mature one has a quite a few members in the elite S P 500 group

14982,236497,DTE,Manure  trash and wastewater  U S  utilities get dirty in climate fight,news,"By Nichola Groom
PIXLEY  Calif   Reuters    Joey Airoso has always been proud of his cows  whose milk goes into the butter sold by national dairy company Land O Lakes  Now he has something new to brag about  the vast amounts of gas produced by his 2 900 head herd is powering truck fleets  homes and factories across the state of California 
 It s pretty incredible if you think about it   Airoso said during a recent tour of his 1 500 acre farm  as a stream of watered down manure flowed from cow sheds into a nearby pit  There the slurry releases methane that is captured and eventually piped into fueling stations and buildings 
Airoso is tapping into a growing market among U S  utilities for so called renewable natural gas  or biomethane  that is being driven by the fight against climate change 
For farmers  it is a way to get ahead of a wave of greenhouse gas regulation and make a bit of cash at the same time  And for utilities that buy or transport the gas  it is a way to respond to the increasing demands of customers and lawmakers to cut their reliance on fossil fuels 
 It is not something very many people are aware of yet  but it makes sense once it s explained   said Emily O Connell  director of energy markets policy at the American Gas Association  the trade group for gas utilities 
Renewable natural gas can come from manure  landfills or wastewater and is interchangeable with gas drilled out of the ground  It cuts greenhouse gas emissions by ensuring significant volumes of methane that would have been produced anyway never reach the atmosphere  Methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide when it escapes into the air unburned 
Nationwide  more than a dozen utilities have started developing renewable natural gas production through partnerships with farmers  wastewater treatment plants and landfill operators  while nine have proposed price premiums for customers who choose it as a fuel  according to the American Gas Association industry group  Renewable natural gas is currently between four and seven times more expensive to produce than fossil gas  a gap that its proponents hope will narrow as the fuel becomes more widely used 
BUSES  STOVES
California s SoCalGas  the nation s largest natural gas distribution utility  is one of the industry s top proponents of the alternative fuel  It has committed to making renewable natural gas 20 percent of its supply by 2030  said Sharon Tomkins  vice president of strategy and engagement 
She said California has enough biomethane potential  to make a significant dent in reducing the overall emissions from both the agricultural sector as well as reducing the carbon intensity of our gas stream  
Across the country  Vermont Gas hopes to one day supply only renewable natural gas  leveraging the state s preponderance of dairy farms  The utility s renewable natural gas supply currently stands at less than 1 percent of overall volumes  according to spokeswoman Beth Parent  But the company is helping large energy buyers in the state  like cleaning products maker Seventh Generation  Middlebury College and Vermont Coffee Company transition to using biomethane 
CenterPoint Energy  N CNP   Southwest Gas  N SWX   DTE Energy  N DTE  and NW Natural  N NWN  are among the other gas utilities seeking to integrate more renewable natural gas into their systems  Last year Dominion Energy  N D  partnered with meat producer Smithfield Foods on a  250 million venture to capture methane emissions from hog farms 
 It s good for their business   said Marcus Gillette  spokesman for the Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas  an industry lobbying group   Many are on missions to decrease emissions from their side of the energy sector as much as possible  
Until now  nearly all the market for biomethane has come from bus fleets and other vehicles that are able to use state and federal subsidies to make the fuel competitive with fossil gas  Production of the fuel doubled between 2015 and 2018 to 304 million ethanol gallons equivalent thanks to the incentives  according to a report from consulting firm Bates White 
Today about three quarters of renewable natural gas production is still used for transportation  though Gillette said that is shifting as more utilities seek to provide it for heating  cooking and industrial uses 
Some states are more aggressive in bolstering the renewable natural gas industry than others 
Oregon  for example  passed a bill in August that sets a goal of making renewable natural gas account for 30  of what is carried in the state s gas pipeline network by 2050 
California  meanwhile  has mandated a 40 percent reduction in methane emissions by 2030  something that will spell specific regulatory curbs on agriculture in the coming years  Methane accounts for about 9 percent of the state s greenhouse gas emissions  half of which comes from livestock 
For Airoso  that made tapping into the growing biomethane market an easy decision   We ve got a  10 mln investment here  so I had to figure out how I protect my investment   he said ",2019-10-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/manure-trash-and-wastewater-us-utilities-get-dirty-in-climate-fight-2002079,2002079

124200,345715,DTE,Analyst  3 Dividend Stocks to Own in a Volatile Market,opinion,You never can know what events will impact the stock market  In recent weeks  news of the coronavirus outbreak in China has been garnering headlines   and rightly so  as there have been over 2 800 confirmed cases of the contagious respiratory virus  and 81 people have died in China  With confirmed cases in the US  it s clear that the virus has gotten into international travel routes   and while it s not a particularly deadly disease  it does have potential for a serious epidemic That prospect spooked investors  at least temporarily  and the S P 500 lost  1 57   The NASDAQ  which is tech heavy and also more exposed to China  saw the steepest daily loss  at 1 9   Overall  it was the worst market day since October The key point is uncertainty  While the virus  as noted  is not very deadly  it does a contagious respiratory disease   and the potential impact on productivity  sick leave  and staffing in the event of viral epidemic is serious  Alec Young  in global markets research at FTSE Russell  points out that China is the worst possible place for such a virus to break out   China is the biggest driver of global growth   He adds   Markets hate uncertainty  and the coronavirus is the ultimate uncertainty in that no one knows how badly it will impact the global economy  Uncertainty  however  is kissing cousins with volatility  and volatility isn t necessarily bad  When markets start to swing  up or down  the extreme values extend outward  Yes  you can see sharp losses  but you can also see sharp gains  A new report from Evercore ISI outline where some of those gains are to be found The report is authored by Greg Gordon  one of Evercore s Senior Managing Directors and the head of Power   Utilities Research  Gordon sees reason for optimism in the utility sector as 2020 gets rolling  and has upgraded three stocks from Neutral to Buy We ve taken the analyst s picks and looked them up in the TipRanks database  These are investments that the Stock Screener tool reveals as  Buy  rated and  more importantly  all three offer reliable dividend yields  Let s take a closer look CenterPoint Energy  CNP First up is Houston  Texas based CenterPoint  a major electric and gas supplier in Texas  Oklahoma  Arkansas  Louisiana  Mississippi  and Minnesota  The company does nearly  10 billion in business annually  and sees a net income exceeding  1 7 billion On the dividend front  CNP has been a consistent high performer  The annualized payment is  1 15  or 28 75 cents per share quarterly  which translates to a yield of 4 4   This yield is more than double the 2  average found among S P stocks  and CNP has a 14 year history of consistent payment  Even better  the 54  payout ratio indicates that the dividend is easily sustainable at current earnings Greg Gordon notes the shares  poor performance in his comments  writing simply   CenterPoint has underperformed significantly over the past year   He goes on to point out  however  that the company has plenty of reasons for optimism in the near term   CNP may or may not sell their unregulated businesses  per news reports  which while it would be EPS dilutive could improve its quality of earnings  enhance its risk profile and reduce equity needs because they have to shore up the balance sheet   W e believe they could grow EPS 6  annually through  22 after a repairing of the balance sheet due to above average rate base growth at the utilities  Gordon puts a  28 price target on CNP  showing modest confidence in this company  his target implies an upside of 7   In line with his belief that CNP can turnaround  Gordon has upgraded his stance from Neutral to Buy   To watch Gordon s track record  click here Chronic underperformance leaves a mark  even if the stock is ready to break out  CNP has 12 recent ratings  including 5 Buys and 7 Holds  giving it a Moderate Buy in the consensus view  The average price target   28 64  suggests room for a 9 27  upside from the current  26 21 trading price   See CenterPoint stock analysis at TipRanks NiSource  Inc   NI Second up is a holding company  NiSource owns subsidiaries that deliver natural gas to 3 5 million customers  and electricity to another half million  across states in New England  the Midwest  and the Gulf Coast  The company is one of the largest utility providers in the US  Its northwest Indiana headquarters are conveniently located in a central point for its customer base NiSource has reliably maintained its dividend payment since 2011  sometimes adjusting the payout in order to keep the dividend sustainable for the long term  The current payment  20 cents per quarter  was raised to its current level in two years ago  The yield  based on the annual payout of 80 cents  is 2 77   slightly higher than the S P 500 average and significantly better than the 1 5  to 1 75  yield on Treasury bonds  With a 57  payout ratio  NI should have no difficulty maintaining its dividend Gordon  of course  also sees a hopeful future for NI  He s raised his stance on the stock to Buy  writing of the company   NiSource stock has significantly underperformed the last two years and the stock now trades at a discount to peers  The company appears to have  finally  put a firm band around total costs for the Greater Lawrence incident  the cause of that underperformance  We derive a 9  estimated total return from our sum of the parts analysis where  for the electric utility  we assign a 5  premium multiple to our base P E target multiple of 19 5x  22 EPS   Gordon s  31 price target suggests an upside potential of 7 3  here With NiSource  we get to a Strong Buy analyst consensus  This stock has 4 recent Buy ratings against a single Hold  Shares sell for  28 89  so the average target of  30 60 indicates a 6  upside   See NiSource stock analysis at TipRanks DTE Energy Company  DTE Based in Detroit  DTE is Southeast Michigan s major electricity provider  The company serves 2 2 million customers  mostly in Metro Detroit and the Thumb  Its operations include power generation from renewable energy sources  Another subsidiary  DTE Gas  provides natural gas to 1 3 million customers throughout the state  DTE is committed to encouraging green energy  and has a net zero carbon emission goal date of 2050 Being the major provider in its region has been good for business  DTE brought in  14 2 billion in revenues for fiscal 2018  up from  12 6 billion in 2017  Net income was essentially steady  at  1 11 billion in 2017 and  1 12 billion in 2018  The company has started 2020 with a modest share price gain of 1 86  Rising revenues and steady income have allowed DTE to be generous with the dividend  The  1 0125 quarterly payment annualizes to  4 05 and gives a yield of 3 06   This makes DTE s dividend return 50  higher than the average S P listed company   and about double that of a Treasury bond  DTE has raised its dividend three times in the past three years  and with a payout ratio of 53  should have no difficulty maintaining the payment Greg Gordon s outlook on DTE is upbeat  This is his third utility upgrade in a row  from Neutral to Buy  and he writes of the stock   DTE has a long history of overcoming that skepticism by over delivering on financial targets and we believe this will continue  with our expectation that DTE will deliver toward the upper end of its 5 7  EPS growth plan  with growth at the utilities and gas storage and pipeline business offsetting the next roll off of Reduced Emissions Fuel Credits in 2022  We expect outperformance over the coming months as investors get more comfortable with DTE s latest gas midstream acquisition and as the company potentially outperforms financial targets  In line with his optimistic outlook for the stock  Gordon raises his price target on DTE from  128 to  139  implying a potential upside of 5    To watch Gordon s track record  click here DTE

124289,345804,DTE,Near Term Outlook Bleak For Electric Power Stocks ,opinion,The Zacks  industry involves the process of generation  transmission  distribution  storage and sale of electricity to residential  commercial and industrial customers  Most of these companies are regulated and have operations in highly competitive markets  Demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady  regardless of economic cycles Widely available coal once used to be the key source of electricity in the United States  However  courtesy of shale gas revolution and conscious efforts toward generating more electricity from clean sources  natural gas gradually replaced coal  Natural gas  clean burning nature  vast availability and low prices are working in its favor  In addition  usage of renewable energy sources is helping utilities to replace coal from their generation portfolio Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Utilities are focusing on adding energy storage projects to their portfolio and providing clean energy to customers  The industry participants are investing in battery storage devices that will boost the usage of more renewable fuel sources and lend support to the grid during peak demand periods  The U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   projects that utility scale battery storage capacity will increase over the long term  As of February 2019  1 184 megawatt   MW   of battery storage projects was predicted to be added in the United States through 2023  EIA expects battery storage power capacity to exceed 2 000 MW by 2023  provided the currently planned additions are completed and no current operating capacity is retired  Electricity from clean sources is another key area of work  This is evident from the EIA release which states that total electricity generation per day in the United States will touch 11 209 billion Kwh  bKwh  per day in 2019 and will increase to 111 224 bKwh per day in 2020  Renewable sources are expected to contribute 18  of the production in 2019 and nearly 20  in 2020  The share of natural gas will be 37  in 2019 and 38  in 2020  Both renewable energy and natural gas continue to eat away share of coal in electricity generation  One of the most significant challenges facing the utility industry is its aging workforce and gradual decline in talent to replace its retiring workforce  Per a Department of Labor report  nearly 50  the U S  utility workforce will retire in the next five to 10 years  With utility projects becoming bigger and more complex  there will be a need for employees with specialized knowledge in engineering and allied fields  which is lagging  Per the U S  Department of Energy  DoE  Quadrennial Energy Review  QER  report  the utility electric power industry will need 105 000 new workers for the smart grid and in other development activities by 2030  but expects only 25 000 existing industry personnel to be interested in filling those positions  We expect this huge gap to create a bottleneck in the future development of the electric power industry  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates weakness in the near term  The 64 stock Utility   Electric Power industry is housed within the broader  Sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  163  which places it at the bottom 36  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since May 2018  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised downward by 14 7  Before we present a few Utility   Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and current valuation Industry Beats S P 500 and Sector on Shareholder ReturnsThe Utility Electric Power industry has outperformed its own sector and the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past 12 months The industry has gained 15 7  compared with its sector s gain of 11 6  and the Zacks S P 500 composite s fall of 1  in the period One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s Current ValuationOn the basis of EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  TTM ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Utility Electric Power companies  the industry is trading at 11 53X compared with the S P 500 s 10 48X and the Utilities sector s 11 92X  Industry EV EBITDA TTM  vs S P 500  Industry EV EBITDA TTM  vs Sector In the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 11 75X  as low as 7 83X  with a median of 9 77X To Sum UpCapital intensive Utility companies are concerned about continued increase in interest rates  The interest rates have increased nine times since December 2015  which is in turn is increasing capital servicing expenses of these utilities and curbing their ability to pay out dividend  However  the Federal Reserve s present stance to keep the interest rates unchanged is indeed good news for the utility space Moreover  cost control  new electric rates and customer growth should continue to help the players to maintain operational stability  However  an aging workforce and adverse weather conditions will be concerns for utility players At present  we have a few top ranked stocks from the Utility Electric

124291,345806,DTE,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love DTE Energy  DTE ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at DTE Energy  DTE   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  DTE Energy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for DTE that show why this utility shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For DTE  shares are up 2 48  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is up 3 08  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 1 18  compares favorably with the industry s 1 72  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of DTE Energy have risen 4 49   and are up 32 26  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 4 24  and 5 78   respectively 
Investors should also take note of DTE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  DTE is averaging 660 826 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with DTE 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost DTE s consensus estimate  increasing from  6 18 to  6 22 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period

124350,345865,DTE,DTE Vs  AEP  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Utility   Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with DTE Energy  DTE  and American Electric Power  AEP   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Right now  DTE Energy is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while American Electric Power has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that DTE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
DTE currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 04  while AEP has a forward P E of 20 52  We also note that DTE has a PEG ratio of 3 34  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  AEP currently has a PEG ratio of 3 63 
Another notable valuation metric for DTE is its P B ratio of 2 06  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  AEP has a P B of 2 17 
Based on these metrics and many more  DTE holds a Value grade of B  while AEP has a Value grade of C 
DTE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than AEP  so it seems like value investors will conclude that DTE is the superior option right now ",2019-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dte-vs-aep-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200416594,200416594

Factors Under Consideration
Ameren s service territories witnessed below normal and below average temperatures during most of the first quarter of 2019  characterized by excessive cold winters along with heavy and prolonged snowstorms  The freezing conditions witnessed in one of the company s service territory  Illinois  was led by the emergence of the Arctic blast that occurred in late January  This resulted in increased demand for electricity by the utility s customers on account of enhanced heating facility usages  This must have boosted the company s top line in the to be reported quarter

124595,346110,DTE,Utility Industry Stock Outlook   January 2018,opinion,"The year 2018 has just started and this is the right time to look into utilities as an investment option  Staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic focused utility stocks assure investors a steady performance and regular dividends  These highly regulated capital intensive stocks are subject to heavy regulation  both at the federal and state levels  Utility business is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flow 
Over the last few years  we have noticed that utilities are gradually changing their preference of fuels to produce electricity  In the United States  natural gas currently contributes the largest portion of the fuel mix  removing coal from the top spot 
Utilities  apart from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amounts of emissions  are also focused in improving transmission and distribution networks  Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity  They are also undertaking plans to shift the transmission lines underground in weather sensitive areas to lower chances of power outages 
Natural gas utilities depend on pipelines to deliver their product to the end users  Water utilities are also required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains  So  to upgrade and strengthen the existing infrastructure  utilities depend on capital markets 
These capital intensive utilities therefore routinely take recourse to capital markets to meet the above requirements  Though regulated utilities are cash generators  the funds generated from internal sources are not sufficient to carry out long term projects  Utilities have been benefiting from the rock bottom interest rate environment  However  the Fed raised interest rates four times in the last five quarters  December 2016  March 2017  June 2017 and December 2017   which will certainly hurt utilities 
The rise in interest cost will no doubt increase cost of capital for utilities and might limit their ability to pay dividends and buy back shares  These developments could lower attractiveness of utilities and investors might turn to bonds as an alternative source of investment 
Weather continues to impact the operation of utility services  Hurricanes in Texas and Florida have adversely impacted normal operation of the utilities operating in the region  Even with efficient work of a large team of workers it took weeks to bring back services at normal levels  The results of the utilities were adversely impacted by disruption of normal services 
Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis  GDP rose 3 3  in the third quarter of 2017  up from 3 1  in the second quarter  The improvement in GDP is expected to continue in 2018 as well 
All other industries depend on utilities for the basic requirements of electricity  gas and water  The ongoing growth will result in higher demand from industrial  commercial and residential space for utility services and boost its performance 
Repeal of Clean Power Plan  Impact on Utilities
Historically  electric utilities have heavily relied on coal for a large part of power generation  which has become a big challenge for the group in these times of enhanced environmental awareness  In line with this  in August 2015  President Obama introduced the Clean Power Plan to lower emissions levels from electricity generation by around 32  by 2030 from 2005 levels 
President Trump acted on his pre election promises and has taken steps toward repealing the Clean Power Plan  Trump believes that such plans will make U S  manufacturing non competitive in the global markets  This new development will help in running the coal fired electricity generation units for a longer period than previously expected 
Per a U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  release  the overall emission of carbon dioxide declined 1 7  in 2016 and 0 8  in 2017 due to initiatives undertaken by the utilities  According to EIA carbon dioxide emission is likely to rise 1 8  in 2018  due to higher coal usage  However  utilities are overall focusing on sources on fuel that helps to lower emission levels  Utilities like NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   NEE  and Dominion Energy Inc   D   among others  have already invested and plan to spend more to create green energy generation portfolio 
Zacks Industry Rank   Negative
Within the  classification  utilities are a stand alone sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  The rural wire line telephone companies are also grouped within the Zacks Utility sector  but the three major industries within this sector include Electric Power  Gas Distribution and Water Supply 
We rank the 265 sub industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries in two groups   the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one  To learn more visit  About   
All three industries related to the utility sector   Gas Distribution  Electric Power and Water Supply   fall in the second group  having the Zacks Industry Rank of  161   202 and  212  respectively 
Our present outlook for the utility sector is negative  with all the major industries placed in the second group of the Zacks Industry Rank 
Utility Trading at Mid Range
The valuation of the sector  Considering Gas Distribution  Water Supply and Electric Power industry  looks attractive at present  The Water Supply industry is currently trading at 19 7x forward 12 month EPS estimates  Gas Distribution industry is trading at 21 6x while Electric Power industry is trading at 12 4x  compared with S P 500 trading average of 19 8x 
The current 21 6x multiple for Gas Distribution companies compares to the five year range of 16 6x to 24 6x  median of 20 3x  while 19 7x multiple for Water Utilities compares to five year multiple ranged from a low of 12 4x to a high of 23 3x  median of 18 6x   The current 12 4x multiple for Electric Utilities compares to a five year range of 11 5x to 16 4x  median of 13 9x  
The above study shows that the current multiples are within the five year ranges  but are trading above its median level  except Electric Power  and offers some room for increase from the current levels 
Earnings Review   Outlook
Third quarter earnings in the utility space were down 3 6  due to a 2 1  drop in revenues  Inconsistent weather and hurricanes impacted their performance 
However  cost control  new electric rates and customer growth will help the utility sector to come up with earnings growth in the fourth quarter reporting cycle  Fourth quarter earnings from the utility sector are expected to improve 4 9  on the back of revenue growth of 3 2

124603,346118,DTE,Public Service Enterprise Files For Rate Hike To Boost Sales,opinion,Public Service Enterprise Group Inc  s   NYSE PEG   subsidiary   Public Service Electric and Gas Co   PSE G    recently requested the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities   BPU   to increase its electric and gas base delivery rates  If approved  the new rates will boost the company s revenues by 1  This filing comes as a mandate of the company s Energy Strong program worth  1 2 billion that got approved by the New Jersey BPU in 2014 Other Details Once approved  the combined residential electric and natural gas customers  annual bill will witness a nominal rise of 1   The company has assured customers that even after this proposed increase  residential customer bills are expected to be more than 15  lower than they were in 2010 Per management  this rate hike will enable Public Service Enterprise to recover costs that the company incurred to strengthen its electric and gas distribution systems  thereby making them more reliable  Moreover  this proposal reflects the company s first regulatory rate review in more than eight years Through this rate filing  Public Service Enterprise has also sought BPU approval for a rate design change  called the Green Enabling Mechanism  GEM   This new rate structure aims at separating the company s revenues from sales volumes and thereby encourages energy efficiency   If approved  the GEM will remove the incentive to sell more energy and will instead encourage utility investments in energy efficiency  renewables and other clean energy technologies that will benefit customers by bringing down bills and reducing carbon emissions The company expects the new base rates as well as the GEM to come into effect from Oct 1  2018 Our ViewIn May 2014  Public Service Enterprise announced that the New Jersey BPU approved its Energy Strong proposal to proactively protect and strengthen its electric and gas systems to withstand severe weather conditions  Per this proposal  the company aimed at significantly upgrading its infrastructure  which included adding intelligence to its system to help speed restoration during outages Under the agreement  it was announced that PSE G will earn an authorized return on equity of 9 75  on the first  1 billion of investment based on an accelerated recovery mechanism   The impact of the  1 billion investment on the typical residential customer bill is expected to be approximately 2  in 2018 which will be more than offset by transitional charges stemming from deregulation that are expiring in the same time frame For the remaining  220 million  the company aimed at filling a base rate case after Nov 1  2017  We believe the latest rate review proposal has been filed by the company to recover this  220 million of the Energy Strong program Notably  in March 2017  Public Service Enterprise announced plans to spend  12 3 billion for PSE G s baseline infrastructure program  which in turn reflects 7  CAGR growth in rate base  The latest rate reform request  if approved  will allow the company to achieve this target Moreover  Public Service Enterprise continues to undertake several initiatives to support New Jersey Senate s bill that requires utilities in the state to source 80  of their electricity from renewable energy by 2050  We believe to further comply with this bill  the company has included the GEM clause in the latest rate filing Notably  in the clean energy space  the company is currently pursuing two solar initiatives  namely  the Solar Loan Program and the Solar 4 All and Solar 4 All Extension programs  In November 2016  the BPU approved a settlement providing for an extension of PSE G s existing solar program to construct up to 33 MW of grid connected facilities with projected investment of approximately  80 million through May 2020 Also  the projected addition of 1 858 megawatts of new gas fired capacity over 2017 through 2019 will help the company transform itself  Banking on these recently adopted initiatives  management expects nuclear and gas fired generation facilities to provide more than 90  of the company s electric output  by the end of this decade Price PerformanceBuoyed by the solid investment plans  the company s shares have outperformed the broader  over a year  Evidently  Public Service Enterprise s share price has

124609,346124,DTE,DTE Energy  DTE  To Raise Generation Capacity In Michigan ,opinion,DTE Energy Company   NYSE DTE   unveils plans to double its electricity generation capacity from renewable resources of energy in the State of Michigan by 2022  The proposal is part of the company s 2018 Renewable Energy Plan  which was submitted to the Michigan Public Service Commission on Mar 30   The plan is in sync with DTE Energy s earlier announced initiative to lower carbon emissions  Notably  the company projects to achieve this goal by reducing carbon emissions from its power plants up to 30   45   75  and more than 80  by early 2020s  2030  2040  and 2050  respectively If approved  these projects will enable DTE Energy to produce 2 000 megawatts  MW  of renewable electricity along with boosting investments of more than  1 7 billion in Michigan  The entire work is scheduled to be completed by 2022  post regulatory nod 2018 Renewable Energy PlanPer the recently submitted Renewable Energy Plan  DTE Energy intends to generate additional 1 000 MW of electricity from new wind and solar projects in Michigan  These projects include the company s Pine River and Polaris wind parks  which have the combined capacity to generate 330 MW  While Pine River is expected to commence commercial operations later in 2018  Polaris will be operational in 2019 The company plans to build two wind parks by 2022 that will produce around 375 MW of electricity and begin operations in 2021 and 2022  This includes a wind project with a capacity to generate 300 MW for large commercial customers The plan has provisions for the installation of approximately 15 MW of new Michigan based solar capacity over the next three years  which will enhance DTE Energy s solar capacity by almost 25   This includes the launch of a pilot program for battery storage technology to improve the overall reliability of energy resources Our ViewThe recent filing outlines DTE Energy s efforts to meet Michigan s Renewable Portfolio Standard  RPS  that requires the state s electricity providers to generate 15  of their retail electricity sales from renewable energy resources by 2021  Notably  the company successfully lowered its carbon emissions in the last decade up to 25   courtesy of investments worth  2 5 billion in Michigan and the addition of 1 000 megawatts of wind and solar capacity In fact  DTE Energy is investing steadily to enhance its renewable generation assets  Over the next 15 years  DTE Electric plans to lower coal fired generation and boost natural gas fired generation and renewables mix  In this context  DTE Electric retired four coal fired generation units at its Trenton Channel  River Rouge and St  Clair facilities and announced plans to retire by 2023  The units at the Belle River and Monroe facilities are expected to be retired by 2040  These facilities will be replaced with natural gas fired generation and renewables Moreover  the recent tax reform has compelled the company to reduce electricity and gas rates  On Jan 23  2018  DTE Energy announced that it has reduced its electricity and gas rates by 3  to pass on the tax savings to its customers  This is expected to widen the company s customer base  The gains from lower tax rate will enable it to upgrade its infrastructure and invest in clean energy generation We expect the recent developments to enable DTE Energy to achieve its target of reducing  carbon emissions by 80  in 2050 by incorporating new renewable energy projects and eventually transitioning its power sources from coal to natural gas as well as renewable Price PerformanceDTE Energy s shares have gained 2  in the last 12 months  against the broader  s decline of 2 9   The outperformance can be attributed to the

124653,346168,DTE,California Water s Unit Files For Rate Hike To Raise Revenue,opinion,California Water Service Group s   NYSE CWT   subsidiary  Hawaii Water Service  Hawaii Water   recently announced that it has filed a General Rate Case with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission   HPUC   for a rate increase  Notably  the company is seeking to recover the cost of capital investments made toward the Waikoloa Village and Waikoloa Resort systems The HPUC will review Hawaii Water s ongoing operations and capital improvements as well as other factors before approving changes in rates   Changes in the rates  if approved  will take place after the fourth quarter of 2018 Recovery of Investments   UpgradesThe rate hike  if approved  is expected to bolster the total annual revenues by  3 8 million  With respect to the Waikoloa Resort systems  the filing request is aimed at recovering additional revenues worth  0 2 million for the Waikoloa Resort water system  and  2 million for the wastewater system  Further  the rate hike is anticipated to generate additional revenues of  0 5 million for the irrigation system that offers recycled water service to customers From the Waikoloa Village  the company anticipates to realize additional revenues worth  0 7 million for the water system and  0 7 million for the wastewater system Among the upgrades covered in this request are Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition   SCADA   improvements and construction of the two new water wells shared with the Waikoloa Resort system  Furthermore  improvements to a third water well and electrical building shared with the Resort system  wastewater piping repairs  construction of the wastewater treatment plant  K plant   an extension to the wastewater treatment plant  R plant   and purchase of a jetting vacuum truck are also featured Why This Move Utility being a capital intensive sector  major players in this space need to make ample investments from time to time  to meet the increasing customer demand as well as conduct operations seamlessly  In particular  water utilities are frequently required to upgrade and replace old pipelines and water mains  Being no exception  Hawaii Water has also made significant investments to strengthen existing infrastructure  In line with this  we have witnessed the company s capital investments totaling to  180 4 million during the first nine months of 2017  reflecting an increase of 8 4  compared with year ago period Naturally being a profitable organization  Hawaii Electric will certainly try to recover the cost of those investments  We believe the filing for rate hike by the company is one such initiative to recoup capital expenses Interestingly  Hawaii s tourism industry   a significant driver of Hawaii s economy   ended with growth of 4 9  in visitor spending and 7 1  in arrivals  during third quarter 2017  This expansion in tourism industry reflects solid increase in demand for water service and potential improvement in days ahead  To make most of the situation  the rate hike decision seems to be a wise move on Hawaii Water s part In fact  given the growing opportunities in this state  California Water is currently aiming to extract higher revenues from Hawaii  by making similar rate case proposals  Evidently  in October 2017  the HPUC approved an increase in the company s annual revenues by  0 7 million 771 000 in

124732,346247,DTE,Enbridge On Track With Nexus Pipeline After FERC Approval,opinion,"Canadian energy distributor Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   is planning to finish its Ohio to Ontario Nexus natural gas pipeline in the third quarter of 2018  To build the pipeline  the company has partnered with Detroit based electric utility DTE Energy Company   NYSE DTE   
The project s construction received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  a few days back  The regulatory approval will ensure that the project stays on track  In July 2017  the partnership estimated that it would take seven to 10 months to build the pipeline after receiving FERC approval for the project 
About the Pipeline
The  2 billion Nexus natural gas pipeline will be 255 miles long  of which 47 miles will be in Michigan and 208 miles in Ohio  It will have a transportation capacity of 1 5 billion cubic feet of gas per day  The pipeline will carry natural gas from West Virginia and the Marcellus and Utica shale in Ohio  Pennsylvania to Eastern Canada and the Midwest of the United States 
The pipeline will meet growing natural gas demand in Ohio  Michigan  Chicago and Ontario  Canada  The pipeline will carry Appalachian shale gas to high demand markets  which will be used for cleaner power generation  industrial and commercial use  Household usage also creates a huge demand for the natural gas in the region  Moreover  the company expects the project to create 6 800 jobs 
About Enbridge
Headquartered in Calgary  Alberta  Enbridge is a leading energy infrastructure company  One of its businesses is the transportation of energy through the most extensive and advanced crude and liquids pipeline system that is spread across 17 511 miles globally  Through the Mainline and Express pipelines  the company transports 2 8 million barrels of crude every day  which accounts for almost 68  of the Canadian crude oil production that is transported to the United States 
In Canada  the company is touted to be the largest natural gas distributer  Hence  it is quite obvious that a significant portion of the company s earnings is generated from transportation operations  driven by a string of long term contracts  The substantial contract base will likely provide the company with stable cash flow in the coming years 
However  the persistently weak oil and natural gas prices have resulted in lower production in 2016 compared with the massive volumes of 2015  This could lead to decreased demand for new midstream infrastructure assets like oil and gas pipeline facilities  which might hurt cash generation for Enbridge 
Price Performance
Enbridge has lost 1 5  of its value year to date against 2 9  growth of its  

Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider

124902,346417,DTE,CMS Energy  CMS  Likely To Beat Q3 Earnings  Here s Why,opinion,"CMS Energy Corp    NYSE CMS   is scheduled to release third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Oct 27 
In the preceding quarter  CMS Energy posted a positive earnings surprise of 28 57   The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  with the average positive surprise being 5 87  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement CMS ENERGY Price and EPS Surprise

    
Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that CMS Energy is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP  CMS Energy has an  of  3 33   That is because the Most Accurate estimate is 62 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 60 cents  This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises Zacks Rank  CMS Energy has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2  Buy  or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates 
Also  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions The combination of CMS Energy s Zacks Rank  1 and  3 33  ESP makes us reasonably certain of an earnings beat  You can see  
What s Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
CMS Energy s latest initiative   the Consumers Energy Way   focuses on improving customer experience by offering prompt services at a low cost  The company also continues to make infrastructural investments in the fields of reliability  cost improvement  environmental mandates and other areas 
Looking forward  the company maintains earnings growth projection in the 5  7  band for 2016  with sultry weather conditions at the onset of the third quarter providing an impetus to this expectation  Moreover  the company expects to witness a year over year uptick of 13 cents in EPS in the second half of 2016  if weather conditions remain favorable 
Currently  one of the company s vital strategies is to focus on reducing operation and maintenance  O M  costs  which in turn will fund its capital investments  Particularly  management expects cost reduction of about  60 million or 3  year over year in 2016 and 2017 
Coming to the third quarter highlights  CMS Energy started operations at its second solar power plant in Aug 2016  transforming 8 5 acres at Western Michigan University into a new source of renewable energy for Michigan  This is the energy provider s second large scale solar project in the state  The company also presented more than 1 million of its customers with new electric meters that will enable selection of customized billing dates  Without a doubt  these initiatives are aimed at improving customer experience 
Moreover  to boost its electric and gas businesses  the company plans to self implement its electric rate increase of  170 million on Sep 1  2016  CMS Energy had also planned to file a  90 million gas case on Aug 1  2016  93  of which accounts for new investments to strengthen infrastructure and improve system capacity and deliverability 
For the third quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 57 cents a share  reflecting an increase of 7 55  year over year  while the consensus for revenues is pegged at  1 70 billion  implying a 14 27  year over year improvement 
Stocks to Consider

125069,346584,DTE,Can Southern Co   SO  Keep The Earnings Streak Alive In Q2 ,opinion,"We expect electric utility firm Southern Company   NYSE SO   to beat expectations when it reports second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Wednesday  July 27 
In the preceding three month period  the Atlanta based service provider delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9 43  on lower costs  In fact  Southern Company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters with an average beat of 4 49  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Southern Company is likely to beat earnings in the to be reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  for this company stands at  2 94   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 70 cents  whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 68 cents  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Southern Company carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us confident of an earnings beat 
Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  On the other hand  the Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement SOUTHERN CO Price and EPS Surprise
   What is Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
A leading utility holding entity in the U S   Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast  With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation  the firm generates steady earnings 
In particular  Southern Company s commercial sales has been strong over the past five quarters  culminating in a 0 8  growth  weather adjusted  in the first quarter  The momentum is expected to continue in the Apr Jun period too 
We are also encouraged by the improving ISM Manufacturing Index  which rose for the second straight month in June to its highest level since Feb last year  Signaling an expanding industrial production outlook  this bodes well for Southern Company with approximately a third of the utility s total retail sales coming from industrial customers 
Finally  we appreciate Southern Company s cost reduction initiatives as seen in the previous quarter when its total operating expenses decreased around 6  year over year  We expect a similar trend in the to be reported quarter  leading to earnings outperformance 
Other Stocks to Consider
Southern Company is not the only utility looking up this earnings season  Here are some companies from the space which  according to our model  also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
American Water Works Company Inc    NYSE AWK   has an Earnings ESP of  5 56  and a Zacks Rank  2  The utility is expected to release earnings results on Aug 3 
DTE Energy Co    NYSE DTE   has an Earnings ESP of  2 20  and a Zacks Rank  2  The utility is anticipated to release earnings on Jul 26

125070,346585,DTE,5 Utilities Set To Surpass Q2 Earnings Estimates ,opinion,"The utility sector continues with its steady run of performance  thanks to its domestic focus that insulates it from international turmoil  The regulated nature of operation also ensures steady earnings  We do not have any viable alternative for water and electricity  which keeps demand alive even during economic downturns  However  there is no fear of that at the moment as U S  economic conditions are looking up on the heels of a number of positive data read outs 
Utilities need to approach the capital markets to arrange for funds  In this situation  the prevailing low interest rate environment is a big boon for the capital intensive industry  Despite a slight rise in interest by the Fed last December  the interest rate has held steady this year  Choppy recovery in overall market conditions has come in the way of a lift off time and again 
The recovery in oil prices from historic lows began from February this year and continued through the better part of June  but prices have started to drop again wiping out some of the gains registered over this period  The uncertainties in the global markets would further drive investors to the safety of utility stocks  These primarily domestic oriented regular dividend payers can be a smart choice for investors this earnings season 
Q2 earnings from the Utility sector are expected to jump 20 9  while revenues are expected to be up 2 4  from the same period last year  The Dow Jones Utility Average  DJU  has appreciated 24 7  year to date  as of July 22  2016  compared with the S P 500 s return of 6 4  over the same time frame S P 500 Picture to Date
The second quarter 2016 earnings season is well underway  with nearly 25  of the S P 500 members having released their earnings as of Jul 22  Total earnings are down 1 1  from the same period last year on 2 6  lower revenues  Overall  total S P 500 earnings are expected to be down 3 4  on 0 5  lower revenues  with growth in negative territory for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors 
Given the evolving second quarter 2016 earnings picture  let s focus on the mature Utility sector Selecting the Right Ones
Picking the right stocks to add to your portfolio could appear to be a daunting task given the wide range of companies in the utility space  One way to narrow the selection process during this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have a solid Zacks Rank accompanied by a favorable   The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive Earnings ESP is usually an indication of an earnings beat 

Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to pull a surprise in their next earnings announcement  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70  
Applying the above strategy  we have selected five utility stocks that have a greater possibility of posting an earnings beat in the coming days UGI Corporation

125071,346586,DTE,4 Utility Stocks To Play As Fed Keeps Rate Hike On Hold,opinion,The Federal Reserve abstained from raising rates this month  but said that near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished  This can be read as a willingness to raise rates in the fall  Yet  all data needs to be uniformly strong and  with inflation remaining below the desired target  it is expected that a rate hike is not all too imminent  Presidential elections are also ahead which might lead to volatility  while the effects of Brexit are as yet unclear  Given these uncertainties  the Fed is expected to tread a cautious path The bottom line is a still low interest rate environment  which makes investments in utilities a prudent option  Low interest rates would be good for utility stocks due to a decrease in cost of capital  increase in profitability and decreased demand for treasuries Fed Keeps Rate Unchanged in JulyAt the policy meeting that ended on Wednesday  9 of the 10 members voted in favor of leaving the federal funds rate at 0 25  to 0 5   This came as no surprise  as the Fed was fretting about a wide range of risks including a slowdown in U S  economic growth in the first quarter  uncertainty about China s economic outlook and Britain s vote to leave the Eurozone  In fact  Fed Chair Janet Yellen had earlier cautioned that a Brexit would  usher in a period of uncertainty  and fuel volatility in world markets U S  stocks  however  showed remarkable resilience  shrugging off the initial shock of the Brexit decision to climb to record highs  As a result  the Fed concluded that the  near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished   More so  the U S  economy showed signs of strength in June  which did not go unnoticed by the Fed  The central bank pointed out that the labor market has  strengthened  last month  The Fed also said that household spending is  growing strongly  as buyers are more willing to spend  read    Based on these upbeat statements data dependent analysts might jump to the conclusion that a rate hike is round the corner  On the contrary  the Fed gave no hint as to when it might resume the rate hikes that took off last December  The Fed adopted a guarded stand  with the statement still remaining void of key components to justify further rate hikes No Clear Picture of Further Rate HikeThe Fed said that inflation continues to lag its desired target range  Even though some may argue that the core Consumer Price Index went up 2 3   the Fed s preferred inflation gauge  the Personal Consumption Expenditure Index  remained below its 2  target  The index recorded current inflation at 1 6   which continues to hover below the target since 2012  For the Fed to hike rates  data needs to be consistently strong  But  in the current case  inflation remaining low for a sustained period fails to fulfill such requirements  read    In fact  the latter part of the year into which we are headed should be fraught with volatility given the upcoming elections  Against this backdrop  the possibility of a rate hike is highly unlikely  We are also still not clear about the fallout of Brexit on major economies  Both the Bank of England and European Central Bank restrained themselves from taking any further stimulus measures  judging that it was too early to determine the economic fallout  The Fed is also maintaining a wait and watch approach before taking the all important rate hike decision How Utilities Benefit From Ultra Low Rates Without clear indication that the U S  economy is on a firm  sustainable footing  the Fed is expected to continue to exercise patience  Low level of business investment will do little to help Fed hike rates  Fed funds futures indicated that the odds of a rate hike remain at 30  in

The latest hike marks a 4 cent per share increase from the previous dividend of 73 cents per share and reflects management s confidence in its long range growth plan  The new annualized dividend amounts to  3 08  up from  2 92 paid earlier  and results in a dividend yield of 3 27  
DTE Energy s management has persistently raised the dividend payout for the last seven years  which is in line with its long term earnings expectations  The company has paid quarterly cash dividends for more than 100 years now 
DTE ENERGY CO Price
   Regular dividend hikes reflect the company s solid business strategy  which also ensures steady earnings  In addition  DTE Energy has a well planned capex program that not only translates into earnings growth  but also paves the way for incremental dividends  going forward 
Long Term Goal
DTE Energy is focused on improving its cost structure and directing capital investments toward renewable generation  strengthening its infrastructure and adding assets to comply with emission standards  Focus on the cost structure and operational improvements will help the company attain its long term earnings growth target of 5 6   Improving economic fundamentals in Michigan are an added stimulus for the company  which will likely boost utility demand in the state 
Moreover  DTE Energy expects an investment of at least  8 2 billion in its electrical distribution system over the 2016 2020 period as part of its  18 billion capex plan for the next 10 years  This includes  3 8 billion for maintenance and other projects   3 2 billion for distribution infrastructure  and  1 2 billion for new generation  Addition of utility infrastructure will enable the company to meet increasing customer demand 
Financial Position
DTE Energy maintains a stable liquidity position and cash generating capacity  As of Mar 31  2016  the company had available liquidity of around  1 6 billion  Cash from operations in the first quarter of 2016 was  741 million  Also  the company utilized  131 million to pay dividends while its free cash flow was nearly  317 million  We believe that the company s strong cash generation capacity enables it to easily increase its dividend rate at regular intervals 
Similar Moves by Other Utilities 
Backed by a strong financial position  other utilities have already taken similar steps  On Apr 21  2016 the board of directors of Southern Company   NYSE SO   has raised its dividend to 56 cents per share  marking a 3 2  increase from the previous payout

125155,346670,DTE,3 Utility Stocks Prepared For Higher Interest Rates,opinion,The Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said last month that she expects the central bank to raise interest rate this year as the U S  economy has started to show signs of improvement after a sluggish first quarter  She also said that delaying a monetary policy tightening until employment and inflation hit the central bank s targets risked overheating the economy Per the U S  Bureau of Labor Statistics  the unemployment rate was down to 5 4  in April  the lowest in the last seven years  Also  the U S  GDP is expected to improve by nearly 2  in the second quarter after contracting 0 7  in the first  Taking into consideration these positive movements and encouraging data  Fed officials might decide in favor of increasing the short term interest rate sooner than earlier expected  In any case  the rate hike is definitely expected this year While economically sensitive sectors like energy and industrials are expected to benefit from the rate hike  interest rate sensitive sectors like the utilities will be hit hard by the rise in rates after more than six long years Utilities are capital intensive and need to have a continuous inflow of funds to carry on their organic growth and infrastructure upgrade projects  This is essential in maintaining the uninterrupted supply of basic amenities like electricity  fresh water and gas  Utilities generate funds from operations  which are to some extent used to meet their capital requirements  But these funds are mostly used for dividend payouts  They take recourse to external sources of financing to meet their capital requirements  So  an interest rate hike will spur their cost of capital and lower profitability Additionally  these reliable dividend payers are in competition with bonds as an investment option  So  an increase in interest rates from the present level will definitely make bonds more attractive than utilities Moreover  historically low rates and their high yielding appeal have led investors to park their money here  This has given rise to pricey valuations in the utility sector making them look less palatable than ever And yet  the  boring  utilities have resurfaced time and again  Their strength lies in the fact that they will never run out of business  A recovering U S  economy with more jobs in the offing will drive customer growth across all classes  be it residential  industrial or commercial  Their diversification into renewable assets and efforts to curtail carbon emissions from the power sector have also been praiseworthy Even if the Fed decides to hike interest rates  which at this point looks inevitable  there are still a few utilities well prepared to withstand the challenges Our PicksWe have selected three utility stocks based on parameters so convincing that investors will think twice before ignoring them even post rate hike  The qualifying criteria include a current ratio greater
