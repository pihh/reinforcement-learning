174945,396461,IR,Climate change pushes U S  fund managers to bet on AC makers,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    Record heatwaves in Europe and Asia this summer are leading fund managers to buy shares of air conditioning manufacturers  betting that the public health risks of rising temperatures will compel businesses and apartment building owners to install cooling systems  Shares of  Johnson Controls   NYSE JCI  International Plc  United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX   and Ingersoll Rand Plc  are all up 25  or more since the start of the year  well above the 19  gain in the U S  benchmark S P 500 index  Those gains come despite concerns about slowing global economic growth due to the lingering trade war between the United States and China that have weighed on the industrial sector   Japanese companies Daikin Industries Ltd and Hitachi Ltd are also up strongly year to date  Fund managers and analysts say the recent outperformance will likely continue due to the necessity of cooling systems as temperatures rise globally  Paris hit 42 6 degrees Celsius  108 7 Fahrenheit  in July  the highest in the city s recorded history  while Britain reported its hottest July on record  Heat waves contributed to the deaths of 1 435 people in France this summer  the country s health ministry said Sunday   This is an issue that isn t going away and it will certainly continue to drive adoption  of air conditioning in regions that traditionally have not relied on it  said Rob McIver  a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management  McIver owns shares of United Technologies  which is spinning its Carrier business off into a separate company  expected to become independent next year   Europe will likely be a large growth market despite the outsized costs of retrofitting older buildings with new cooling systems  said Nicholas Heymann  co group head   global industrial infrastructure at William Blair  Currently  only about 20  of European households have air conditioning  compared with 87  percent of U S  households and 90  in Japan  due in part to greater emphasis on less energy intensive forms of cooling in Europe    It s something that s structurally more challenging in Europe  and conceptually too  because Europeans tend to be more environmentally conscious  But personal safety is going to be a bigger issue and they are going to have to come to terms with retrofitting   he said   That market would likely be particularly lucrative for Johnson Controls International  where cooling systems make up approximately 50 percent of its revenues and it has a lead in so called mini split systems  which do not require expensive ducts to send cool air through buildings  Heymann said   The number of European households that buy and install a new air conditioning system will increase by an average of 4 3  a year through 2040 as more people move to cities  according to a study published in Environmental Science   Policy in July  Overall  global air conditioner sales will increase by 700 million units by 2030 and 1 6 billion by 2050  driven mostly by sales in developing countries such as India  according to estimates from the U S  Department of Energy   A slowdown in new construction in Asia  which has accounted for the majority of the sector s growth  would likely weigh on the shares of air conditioning makers overall  said Noah Kaye  a senior analyst at Oppenheimer  Yet that could make companies such as Johnson Controls  which has seen its trailing price to earnings multiple jump nearly 72  over the last year  more attractive on a valuation standpoint  he said   
 There is a real opportunity here that s under the radar  if Europe begins to adopt greater usage of air conditioning than its historical trends  Kaye said   The use of air conditioning begets more air conditioning  and that s a trend we see continuing as the world gets hotter  ",2019-09-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/climate-change-pushes-us-fund-managers-to-bet-on-ac-makers-1976909,1976909

 And while we ll miss her when she retires in the upcoming months  we certainly wish her well and a well deserved retirement I d also like to welcome Chris Kuehn to the call as the future CFO of Trane Technologies  Chris has been a strong business partner and leader at Ingersoll Rand since he joined the Company five years ago  Execution of his succession plan is well under way in order to ensure a smooth transition and he is well positioned for the role  Sue will be with us through the close of the RMT transaction and we re happy to have both Sue and Chris participate on the call today Turning to Slide 3  I d like to start out today s call with a brief overview of our global business strategy that s enabling us to consistently deliver strong financial results for our shareholders  As we continue to progress toward the close of the RMT transaction and prepare to transition to a pure play climate company  our strategy remains unchanged  At its core  our strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact  which are strong secular tailwinds for our business The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes  At our core  we are focused on and excel at reducing energy intensity in buildings  reducing greenhouse gas emissions  reducing waste of food and other perishable goods  and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers  all enabled by technology Unless you think the world is getting cooler  less populated and less resource constrained as time passes  these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision  As I look back over the past several years  these secular tailwinds are only growing stronger and have a greater sense of urgency Moving to Slide 4  fiscal 2019 was a great year for Ingersoll Rand with strong execution against all elements of our strategy  We delivered top quartile performance with organic revenue growth of 6   70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation of  1 8 billion or 118  of adjusted net earnings We established a leadership role in tackling the world s environmental and sustainability challenges by putting forth our aggressive 2030 sustainability commitments and we issued this challenge to like minded companies in order to amplify progress toward a more sustainable future We invested heavily in our core business  acquired precision flow systems  entered into a game changing RMT transaction with Gardner Denver  repurchased  750 million in shares and continue to pay a strong dividend to our shareholders  executing against all elements of our capital allocation strategy The RMT transaction creates a leading industrial company  It also creates a world class pure play Climate Control business which squarely focuses 100  of our portfolio on our sustainability strategy  Finally  we maintained very high employee engagement despite a rapidly changing environment with additional economic and geopolitical challenges  ensuring Ingersoll Rand remains a great place to work for our people  I m very proud of our teams for delivering these strong results for our customers and our shareholders In the fourth quarter  our global end markets largely continued to be healthy with solid revenue growth across North America  Europe and China  We ve highlighted North America Commercial HVAC s growth as a standout all year long and the fourth quarter was no exception  Year over year revenue growth was up high teens in the fourth quarter alone  despite very tough comps in 2018 We ve talked about the extraordinary transport business bookings growth in 2018  and the normalization process that s been occurring in 2019 with steep rates of decline in transport bookings in every quarter  This has been a drag on top line enterprise bookings all year  So we ve been providing bookings growth numbers excluding our TK business to help you understand the real underlying bookings of the enterprise for the Climate business  I hope this information has been helpful to the investment community In the fourth quarter enterprise bookings were extremely strong  excluding TK  up high single digits  Climate bookings excluding TK were even stronger up low teens  Note  our underlying business remains very healthy  Our fourth quarter enterprise and climate leverage was lower than our guidance at the end of Q3 The lower leverage in the quarter was a result of three factors  First  revenue in our higher margin transport business declined high single digits in the quarter or roughly  50 million  deleveraging in line with gross margin rates  In addition  the combination of very strong commercial HVAC growth coupled with transport declines drove incremental negative portfolio mix The second impact is a good news  bad news story  On the positive side  we had exceptional free cash flow in the fourth quarter that well exceeded our forecast  So  on the flip side  we needed to accrue a substantial increase to our full year incentive compensation plans as a result  which impacted operating leverage And lastly  we had some unplanned inventory adjustments in the fourth quarter  We know from your pre call questions that the transport markets are in many people s minds  so we devoted a fair amount of discussion to this topic throughout the presentation  and have a slide near the end Throughout the year  we ve talked about the significant declines in order rates expected in 2019 balanced against the very strong backlog we carried into the year  We expected that the net of the two factors combined with increasing cancellations in summer and fall will lead to a mid single digit revenue growth for 2019 and year end backlog that returned to more normal levels We highlighted that Europe was soft throughout 2019 and that we were largely in agreement with the ACT data  which was showing a correction in 2020 in North America trailer and that November and December 2019 and early 2020 market conditions in order rates are going to be important to really understand how the end of 2019 and 2020 might play out We closed out 2019 with 3  revenue growth for transport  Overall market demand in November and December did not pick up as much as we anticipated and fourth quarter revenue is weaker than expected as a result  This knocked a couple of points off our full year Thermo King growth We believe the fourth quarter marked the first quarter of what ACT and others believe will be a relatively short lived down cycle as the booking anomalies of 2018 and 2019 reset  positioning the market for a flat or slightly positive growth profile for 2021 Our Industrial Businesses continue to execute very well in the fourth quarter  Our leaders remained focused on running the business and employee engagement remains strong  a testament to our culture and the strength of the businesses that will combine with Gardner Denver In the fourth quarter  our Industrial Business saw strong margin expansion and a low single digit revenue decline  Good growth in small electric vehicles was offset by soft short cycle demand in compression technologies and industrial products  We re seeing excellent payback on the restructuring  operational and commercial investments we made in the business over the past few years  as evidenced by our strong margin expansion in the quarter We believe the business is well positioned moving into 2020 and for the combination with Gardner Denver  We continued our balanced capital allocation strategy throughout 2019 and in the fourth quarter  The strong free cash flow we re generating continues to provide us with good capital allocation optionality moving forward Please go to Slide 5  we exceeded or delivered toward the high end of the range against all of our guidance commitments for 2019 and delivered top quartile performance  Again  I m extremely proud of the entire Ingersoll Rand team for their hard work and perseverance navigating through a very dynamic economic and geopolitical landscape in 2019 Please turn to Slide 6  as we continue to move closer to the close of the RMT transaction with Gardner Denver  we re excited and well positioned to debut as Trane Technologies  100  of our portfolio will be strategically focused on global megatrends and at the intersection of sustainability and advanced technology and innovation All of our products and services are uniquely positioned to have a real and significant positive impact on reducing carbon emissions  We continue to compete in largely healthy end markets globally and our strategy provides tailwinds to grow faster than GDP  While we expect the transport market to move through a short term correction period  we believe this is a great business to be in over the long term We expect the new Trane Technologies to continue to drive top quartile performance and we expect to deliver approximately 25  leverage in 2020  despite headwinds from our Transport business  We re excited about the new Trane Technologies  business and expect to host an Investor Day in the fall to layout our long term strategy and targets Please turn to Slide 7  This slide provides a visual depiction of organic bookings and revenue growth in the fourth quarter  The underlying climate business remains very strong with broad based bookings and revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions Our Compression Technologies and Industrial Products Businesses continue to be impacted by soft industrial short cycle spending while our small electric vehicle business has continued to deliver excellent growth  The headline enterprise bookings decline of negative 6  does not accurately reflect the underlying strength of the business  Enterprise bookings were up high single digits and climate bookings were up low teens respectively  when you exclude transport and the very large quarter four 2018 commercial HVAC order Please turn to Slide 8  This slide combines our quarter fourth growth performance with our preliminary view of our major end markets for 2020  I ve covered the main points regarding fourth quarter growth on the prior slide  so I ll focus my comments on our preliminary 2020 Market outlook Our Global Commercial HVAC outlook continues to be positive  Leading economic indicators remain largely supportive of continued market growth in 2020  albeit slower growth than in 2019  We re expecting to see low single digit market growth for Global HVAC with North American office  government  education and industrial markets all healthy In the Residential HVAC market  which is the North American market for us  we re expecting to see low single digit market growth led by continued growth in the replacement markets  which is approximately 80  of our business today  Economic indicators are also largely supporting continued growth As I discussed earlier  ACT  other data sources globally and our internal estimates point to transport markets moving through a relatively short term down cycle in 2020 and a more stable market in 2021  I ll cover this in more detail later in the presentation Relative to the industrial markets  we continue to see impacts of soft  short cycle capex spending in the fourth quarter  partially offset by solid growth in small electric vehicles  We expect this to continue through the first quarter of 2020  Through focused execution of our business strategy  we expect our businesses to grow faster than each of the major market growth expectations just outlined And Now I ll turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter  Sue Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Mike  Please go to Slide number 9  I ll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today s call  As Mike discussed  fourth quarter organic revenues were particularly strong in our Climate segment  With consistent focus on sustainability and energy efficiency for our customers  our Climate segment delivered organic revenue growth of 7  compounding on 9  growth in 2018 Climate orders were also strong  up low teens when excluding our transport business that saw outsized order growth throughout 2018 and the approximately  200 million large commercial HVAC order that we specifically called out in the fourth quarter of 2018 In our Industrial segment  organic revenues were down 2  on a tough year over year comp of 6  in 2018  Small electric vehicles delivered continued revenue growth  which was offset by revenue declines in the soft industrial short cycle markets we mentioned previously  Our team delivered exceptional free cash flow in 2019 of 118  of adjusted net earnings We have delivered free cash flow in excess of adjusted net earnings consistently over time with a five year average of 107   Adjusted earnings per share was up 6  versus the year ago period  building on 29  growth in 2018  EPS growth was driven by operational performance in both our Climate and Industrial segments Importantly  we remain focused on deploying excess capital on our best ROI investments for our shareholders  After reinvesting in our core business through expense and capital in 2019  we deployed  510 million in dividends   750 million in share repurchases and entered into or completed four acquisitions  totaling more than  1 5 billion  including precision flow systems and the pending RMT transaction with Gardner Denver Moving into 2020 and beyond  we expect to continue to generate powerful free cash flow and execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy deploying 100  of excess cash over time Please go to Slide 10  Stepping back from the details for a moment  Q4 was another strong quarter capping off a year of top quartile performance  In the quarter  we delivered organic revenue growth of 5   adjusted operating margin improvement of 10 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 6  Please go to Slide number 11  As mentioned previously  our Industrial segment delivered strong margin expansion through productivity  operational improvements and restructuring savings  When coupled with the strong revenue growth in our Climate segment  we delivered another quarter of strong operating income and EPS growth in the quarter Fourth quarter corporate costs were higher than prior year primarily due to two impacts  First  the timing of functional spend was higher in Q4  2019 than in 2018  Second  we achieved stronger than expected free cash flow performance in Q4  which increased our 2019 free cash flow conversion beyond our already strong forecast of 105  of net earnings to our actual results of 118  Free cash flow conversion is one of our most important long term financial metrics for a healthy company and it plays a central role in our incentive compensation design  Note  the strong performance is great to see and a testament to the hard work by our employees globally On the flip side  it costs us a little more in incentive compensation and there was a full year true up taken us a lump sum in the fourth quarter  Lastly  our effective tax rate in the quarter of 20  was in line with third quarter guidance  but up versus the low 16 5  in the fourth quarter of 2018 Please go to Slide number 12  before discussing the elements of our margin bridge today  I d like to highlight that we made one modification to what you ve seen previously  We ve separated volume from mix and combined mix with price  material inflation and tariffs We believe this is a clear way to visualize the margin bridge  As this is a bit different than you may be accustomed to  I d like to take a couple of minutes walking you through the modification and why combining mix  price and material inflation and tariffs is a positive adjustment Since late 2016  we ve seen tremendous amounts of material inflation in tariffs that have been fast moving and volatile  To offset the massive material inflation in tariffs  we have realized price increases in the neighborhood of 5 times historical levels  At the same time  our business has been growing at very high rates and we have a large percentage of business that is not driven off of a price list The line between mix and price and inflation is thin already and it has become more difficult to break mix and price apart at the level we ve been providing on these bridges  For example  when we create a configured system for a high rise in New York  that system is unique to that building  since we have detailed tracking of input cost to calculate inflation  when gross margins on the project are better than the project on the Street  the question we must answer is whether the margin improvement is because we ve priced the project better or if it s better mix because we utilized higher margin components in the system To be clear  we are confident we delivered strong price cost in the quarter  completing our seventh consecutive quarter of positive price cost  We also delivered strong margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter  Negative product mix more than offset price cost as we continue to deliver outsized growth from our commercial HVAC equipment as compared to revenue declines in higher margin products like transport and short cycle compressors and industrial products Productivity versus other inflation was flat in the quarter  Our segments delivered solid productivity from operational excellence and restructuring savings  The savings were offset by the previously mentioned incentive compensation increases and Climate segment year end inventory adjustments following an ERP implementation and footprint optimization projects  We continue to invest heavily in growth and operating expense reduction projects with high returns on investment Please go to Slide 13  our Climate segment delivered another quarter of solid organic revenue growth  Consistent with our expectations  we delivered strong volume growth  price realization and productivity  As previously mentioned  operating leverage was below expectations  primarily due to the deleverage on transport revenue declines and the year end true ups we mentioned on the previous slide Please go to Slide 14  In our Industrial segment  organic revenues were down 2  on a tough year over year comp of 6  in 2018  Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles was offset by revenue declines in the soft industrial short cycle markets we mentioned previously  Over the past several years  we ve built a stronger  more resilient Industrial business Despite organic revenue declines in the quarter  our Industrial segment expanded adjusted operating margins by 240 basis points through productivity programs  operational improvements and restructuring savings  The combination of our operating margin improvement efforts with our PFS acquisition expanded EBITDA margins 350 basis points in the quarter Please go to Slide 15  We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders  We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology  innovation and operational excellence projects which are vital to our continued growth  product leadership and margin expansion We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long term shareholder returns  We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve  We have a long standing commitment to a reliable strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time With the proposed transaction with Gardner Denver growing closer  I remind you that we expect to maintain our annualized dividend of  2 12 per share post closing and through 2020  This will deliver an attractive dividend yield for Trane Technologies  For 2021 and beyond  we will evaluate dividend increases in line with earnings growth and consistent with our long standing capital deployment priorities As we look forward to 2020  we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy  We remain enthusiastic about the future opportunities to deploy excess capital to the best ROI investments  whether that d be reinvestment in the business  a strong dividend  making value accretive strategic acquisitions or repurchasing shares Please go to Slide 17  Anticipating the Reverse Morris Trust transaction will close early this year  I ll spend a few minutes walking you through a high level 2020 outlook  for Trane Technologies  After the proposed transaction closes  we anticipate the newly combined Industrial business to provide guidance including our Industrial segment  Given the market backdrop Mike outlined earlier  we expect total reported inorganic revenues to be up 3  to 5  in 2020 and broadly healthy HVAC end markets During 2019  our Climate segment delivered 40 basis points of margin expansion  In 2020  on an apples to apples basis  we expect to further expand segment margins between 30 basis points and 70 basis points  In the first quarter  we anticipate solid revenue growth in our HVAC business offset by steep declines in our transport business  creating continued mix headwinds Mike will outline our transport outlook in more detail later in the presentation  Apples to apples unallocated corporate expenses are expected to be approximately  260 million  including stranded cost previously allocated to our Industrial segment  I ll explain more about our stranded cost outlook later in the presentation For modeling purposes  we also offer the following items  Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately  300 million  We estimate interest expense to be approximately  240 million  reflecting debt retirement of  600 million in the May timeframe  We re targeting free cash flow to be greater than 100  of net earnings with capital expenditures approximating 1  to 2  of revenues and we ve modeled  500 million in share repurchases And now I d like to cover two topics of interest with you  Please go to Slide 19  We often get questions about the status of the proposed Industrial Segment Reverse Morris Trust transaction  We ve covered most of this slide throughout the presentation  so I ll cover a few points here Entering 2020  we anticipate one time separation and transaction costs to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of  150 million to  200 million  During 2019  we spent approximately  95 million and we expect to spend the rest in the next few months We continue to execute our detailed project plans to carry out all of the separation  integration planning and transformation work  Given that we and Gardner Denver continue to operate as two separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction  much of the integration and transformation work ramps after the deal closes Last month we announced that our pure play sustainability focused Climate Company will be named Trane Technologies  pending shareholder approval  We expect Trane Technologies to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as TT and we plan to host our first Trane Technologies  Investor Day in the fall of this year In contemplating the timing of our Investor Day  we recognize that 2020 is the third year of the three year financial targets we set at our Investor Day in mid 2017  Today  we re giving guidance for the final year which will complete that three year plan  Additionally  between now and the time of the Investor Day  we will close the transaction  begin operating as two separate companies  file the appropriate historical financial statements  and give you a chance to analyze a couple of quarters of reporting under our new segment structure With those tasks complete and 2020 performance well under way  we will be in a position to give long term financial targets and further outline Trane Technologies  continued strategy at Investor Day Please go to Slide 20  We also get questions about the stranded costs associated with the RMT transaction and how to model the savings for our new Trane Technologies  With that in mind  I ll walk you through the math illustrated in the chart at the bottom of the slide  Starting from the left  our 2020 unallocated corporate cost guide was  250 million at the time of the agreement At the time  we also estimated approximately  50 million of allocated corporate costs were being absorbed by our Industrial segment that were not specific to Industrial  In addition  we are targeting  50 million of cost reduction for a total of  100 million of stranded cost To make the math simple  we ve shown a rebaseline totaling  300 million that includes both the unallocated costs and the costs currently allocated to the Industrial segment  Our guidance for 2020 unallocated corporate cost of  260 million reflects a  40 million reduction in stranded costs netted against the  300 million rebaselined corporate costs To be clear  these cost reductions may come from corporate or from the Climate businesses  We are presenting guidance in this way to give you easily comparable climate margin and corporate cost targets for modeling our 2020 outlook As we move to 2021  we plan to remove an additional  60 million from either corporate or the Climate businesses to achieve our full  100 million stranded cost reduction target  To realize these stranded cost reductions  we expect to spend approximately  100 million to  150 million  We will provide quarterly updates on our stranded cost reduction progress And with that  I ll turn the call back over to Mike Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Sue  Please go to Side 21  The last topic of interest is related to transport refrigeration  While this is a preliminary view based on available forecast and our internal estimates  I ll cover both what we are currently anticipating for the major end markets for the transport business and what we expect to see for our Thermo King business  specifically Given the complexity of this topic  we ve significantly expanded the level of disclosure on our TK business for the purpose of this discussion  We hope this will be useful in better understanding our outlook for the market and for our TK business  We expect the transport markets to move through a short term correction period in 2020 We re expecting to see steep declines in North American trailer and APU and mid single digit declines in truck  These businesses account for approximately 40  of our TK business  We currently expect the decline to be most significant in the first quarter where the market faces tougher comparisons to solid growth in the first quarter of 2019  but remain challenging throughout 2020 We re also expecting to see a high single digit decline in our European  Middle East and Africa trailer business with a steep decline in the first half of the year and recovery in the second half  The truck business in EMEA is expected to be lumpy  but flat for the overall year  What s shown is the all other market for TK reflects aftermarket parts  marine  bus  rail  air and a few of the relatively smaller regional markets where market forecasts are not as robust as in North America or Europe However  for these markets  we re currently expecting modest growth of low single digit to mid single digit growth in 2020  We believe we have the opportunity to outperform the overall markets in 2020 in part by leveraging the 40  of our business that is in markets where modest growth is expected We believe we have opportunities to significantly outperform in areas such as aftermarket parts where consumption increases in a down cycle  and in APU where we continued our successful strategy to improve our bolt on rate beyond current levels  We also anticipate outperforming the overall trailer and truck markets in both North America and EMEA through innovation and new product launches  and where we see opportunities for share growth The situation is obviously fluid in transport refrigeration and we re closely tracking order rates and other market indicators to improve our line of sight into 2020 moving forward  At the present time  however  we re guiding for quarter one TK revenues to be down somewhere in the 20  range and for 2020 TK revenues to be down in the 5  to 10  range Please go to Slide 22  2019 was another year of top quartile financial performance with strong revenue growth  EPS growth and free cash flow  Looking forward  we believe the Company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years  Fundamentally  we excel where global megatrends and sustainability intersect with our innovation and capabilities Today 15  of the world s carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings and another 8  comes from global food loss and these numbers are growing  We are continually innovating to bend the curve on global warming  By 2030  we will reduce our customers  carbon emissions by 1 gigaton by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated food  medicines and other perishables We ve been heavily investing for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent  profitable growth  We have an experienced management team and a high performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do  We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top tier shareholder returns over the years And lastly  we re extremely excited about the pending RMT transaction and the strategic combination of our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver  Combining two of the premier complementary industrial businesses offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies  supported by secular growth trends and diverse end market exposures And personally  I couldn t be more excited about creating the premiere pure play HVAC and Transport Refrigeration Company as Trane technologies  Our Climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance and we see significant opportunity as a pure play to build on this performance for our people  customers and shareholders And with that  we ll be happy to take your questions  Operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan  Your line is now open Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  good morning guys Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Steve Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystJust a question on the kind of timing of everything that s happening here  I think you might have touched on an update  but when would you expect to kind of have a little bit of a deeper dive on the new TT business from an Investor Day perspective Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo Steve  it s Sue  And Chris can join in with that  The first thing we re going to do is  finish off the very detailed work that s going on right now on the separation of the Industrial businesses and then start building off of the base that we ve got  We ll have to go through and issue some historical financial statements and then transition into that  But  Chris  your thoughts Christopher J  Kuehn    Vice President   Chief Accounting OfficerSure  Hi  Steve  Good to meet you here virtually over the phone  To Sue s point  I think there is a fair amount of effort still left to get done  We re on track from the RMT closure to be completed here in early 2020  But right after we do complete separation  we ve got some requirements to restate some prior year financial statements and I would expect around that time  we d provide some more information around the historical view of Trane Technologies at that point I think from an Investor Day perspective  we are targeting kind of that September timeframe with respect to getting us a chance of having a couple of quarters of closes under the new Trane Technologies structure  and then be ready to walk out with a little bit more details here in the fall Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSteve  this is Mike here  Just one second  Steve  I would say that just from an internal planning perspective  once we filed all that we need to file around the restated financials  targeting something like a 5 to 10 day period after that  after you have digested it  to come back and provide more guidance  And so  we ll likely structure a call  put a presentation together and lay out the 2020 guidance  And then we ll will reserve until the Investor Day  report back on the last three years and then restate kind of going forward likely another three year view for Trane Technologies through 2023 Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay and then    thanks for the color on all the TK moving parts  When will you expect kind of the orders comp to get easier  Is that kind of a    just remind us when you would think these orders should bottom out Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Steve  the way our revenue bottoms out  first  I would say that you probably are just going to see the bottom in both Europe and North America in the first quarter and then it s going to still be negative  obviously as you can see from the graph  So we ve got on Slide 21 of the deck for the balance of the year But from a bookings perspective  you recover obviously a little bit quicker than that  although there is a fair amount of book in turn  I think that will happen in the business and so the comps get easy third and typically fourth quarter  So you know second  third and fourth quarter you get to see bookings  I think  improving  Revenue progressively improves throughout the year in both regions Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks for the color Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure OperatorOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays  Your line is now open Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  Good morning and thanks  Sue  for all the help  Maybe just a question around the Climate revenue growth  Just wondered  within that low single digit commercial HVAC market assumption for 2020  what are you assuming for Asia  given orders were down through most of 2019  And how much of a jump in the U S  do you think you ll have this year after such a good 2019 Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Julian  I want to be careful not to mix market expectations versus our internal businesses  So the market  I think that North America remains very healthy  We ll see growth across the board equipment  parts  services  I think that  we feel good about what will happen in institutional  particularly education and healthcare  We expect industrial and commercial also to remain healthy And then if I translate say our internal view in North America  as an example  we end the year at the 17  high teens kind of backlog over the prior year  So the setup for us and the setup for the market look pretty good In Europe  where you ve got the sort of flattish expectation in 2020 and still some lingering Brexit execution uncertainties  We ll continue to outgrow the market as we have been really based on the whole sort of sustainability focus and the go to market strategy that we ve had there  So we expect to grow    sort of outgrow the market at least a multiple of two or three there  I would assume off a very slow kind of growth in the underlying market in Europe Middle East  Africa HVAC  it s going to be positive but the patterns are always lumpy because  particularly in the Middle East  these orders tend to be large district cooling plants  And so they re very large orders when they come and so you get a little bit of an anomaly there And then actually healthy growth in China and for the AP region in general  And again here  the backlog that we ve got in China fourth quarter versus prior year fourth quarter is up low double digit  So a good set up for us kind of coming into 2020  So I feel pretty good about what s happening in the commercial HVAC space And residential  you know a similar view  80  of the market for us is replacement  Underlying markets still look good  Consumer confidence still remains relatively high  U S  economy remains relatively healthy  Unemployment is low  GDP is stable  So pricing remains healthy  I think the market there appears to be pretty solid going into 2020 Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThanks  Mike  for all the color  And then just my second question around climate margins  Just looking at your margin guide for the segment for 2020  backing out what you re saying for Thermo King or transport  it implies the non transport piece margins are up maybe 80 basis points or so in 2020  Just wanted to check that was roughly in line with what you were thinking  And to what degree you think that number is back end loaded  again  excluding transport Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean at starting point I ll let Sue and Chris chime in  but you really end up with a pretty low quarter four to comp that we just completed when you think about most of those impacts really were center hit on the commercial HVAC markets  And so the roadmap we ve got here is still a strong pricing environment  probably a moderating materials environment Our productivity pipeline looks robust  should cover all of inflation  Volume should drop through our gross margins  we don t see anything happening there and we don t see any repeat issues that would have done in the fourth quarter  I mean  obviously  we talked about the silver lining perhaps and the cash conversion  but some of the inventory adjustments were partially result of just an immense amount of factory consolidations that were done starting in  18 and through  19 and those don t repeat  That smoothes out as well So  I feel like we re in great shape on commercial  I think residential continues to hum along  a good conversion there  I don t see any changes there  And even in a market like Latin America  we had great success in  19  It appears to be recovering particularly Brazil I would highlight  Margins there are good for us and I think that can help contribute as well Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse  Your line is now open John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  John Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  John Christopher J  Kuehn    Vice President   Chief Accounting OfficerGood morning John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystAnd I ll echo the sentiment  thank you to Sue for all the help Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  JohnJohn Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystYou know    sure  Wanted to maybe get a mark to market on where we stand with kind of the controls in the connected buildings platform  I know last time I think we got an update on that revenue base  It was north of  1 billion and you guys used to throw out some metrics around the number of connected buildings or the portfolios of buildings that you were monitoring  Can you kind of mark to market us on that Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  John  I would start with a caveat that if a company can actually tell you the generation from their digital business  they probably don t have a digital strategy  because the whole strategy really hits every bit of the value stream from the way that you design and develop systems to not fail all the way through to the way you monetize offerings in the service business through to the way that you utilize fixed service contracts  fixed service agreements to deliver service in more creative and better ways for the customer So you put that all together and it s in everything that we re doing  So it continues to be the norm  I would say  100  of what we re shipping out in the applied space today is absolutely communicating  if not inside the customers  firewall  It s coming across to us with important data  We re acting on it  At last count  I think we monetized  in our commercial space alone  about 20 different offerings that we put together in that space that use digital to monetize Same thing would hold through to TK  Interesting with TK  I m just going to kind of maybe skip to this  There is little bit of a story here  When you look at ACT s 2020 forecast of 37 500 units  we look at the replacement of units on the road today in North America and we get to a number of about 35 000 units  I mean  you can think about more than 90  of the market ACT is representing could be accounted just through replacing units Well  part of the reason that we know where these units are and whether or not they re a candidate for replacement would be through things like the telematics that would tell us how systems are operating  And so that s a great example of how the game really changes when you ve got a complete digital strategy across these businesses John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot you  Thanks for that color  And then  you know  just looking at the investment in other line  obviously you covered a little bit in the prepared remarks  But that s been a long time since we ve seen that flat  You have the comment saying gross investment spending remains at high levels  As we think about 2020 and beyond  does that flip back to be a headwind or are you kind of plateauing right now on how you re thinking about your investment spending Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we re coming through some really major platform investments and have got a multi year investment for Thermo King  let s just say in particular  That s going to tend to kind of flatten out there  but likely not in the Trane business  particularly with some of the regulatory changes that will happen between now and 2023  So it s at a very high rate  A good estimate for 2020 is probably you know as low as 20 bps of incremental and maybe as high as 50 bps of incremental that will go into the Trane Technologies portfolio for 2020 Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJohn  I would also add that you know as you think about those investments  that s such a huge part of the capital allocation strategy and what we do with the business that we are a great generator of cash  We have processes throughout the company with Investment Review Boards looking at various and sundry things We want our businesses to bring us great ROI projects that continue our growth and continue the great capital allocation strategy that we ve got  So as    A  as you think about Trane Technologies going forward  I see that great cash generation as an opportunity and a way to really do great capital allocation with investing in the businesses  And I think that should continue and I think you d want that to continue Christopher J  Kuehn    Vice President   Chief Accounting OfficerAnd I ll just affirm here  Sue  this is Chris  that it will continue that way  knowing that we have a strong free cash flow generator in Trane Technologies and we ll be following those similar priorities for capital deployment John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you for the color OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research  Your line is open Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystThank you  Good morning everyone and thanks and good luck  Sue Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystAnd appreciate all the help  Two questions on TK  First  just the aftermarket in general  has it been your experience historically that when you get into OE equipment downdrafts that aftermarket actually does grow  Certainly we ve seen in some machinery and equipment markets that aftermarket doesn t turn out to be quite as countercyclical as people would have hoped  So I would imagine  it would typically decline less  But the question is  does it actually tend to grow in those down cycles Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah Jeff  there is a number of things that I think that we can count on and in some ways rather control even with a trailer decline forecast for 2020 and that s one of them  So  if the standard aftermarket growth rates would be something kind of in the normalized 3  to 5  range  as an example  if all of 35 000 North American units that are probably up for replacement wouldn t be replaced  which would be an extreme view  you d likely see something in the high single digits  Our experience has been something maybe 8  to 10  if that were to be the case  So that tends to always pan its way out The other thing that is interesting  when you look at the auxiliary power unit bolt on rate  I think in 2016  we re talking about something in the 10  to 11  kind of bolt on rate there  and we said  look  we think we can move this thing and for every 2 4 units of APUs we sell  it equates to one trailer unit  That was a strategy to help us through 2016 and  17 We actually have increased that bolt on rate by 10 points  So we ended the year kind of in the low 20s  The remarkable thing about that is that s what the denominator  right  increasing dramatically in terms of what was built in terms of OEM tractors put out into the marketplace  Other interesting thing there is the replacement factor that we see out there for APUs going into 2020 is roughly a 102 000 units that are available  You know that s compared to a 99 000 unit market So here you ve got a replacement rate opportunity that s actually bigger than a new complete  So by taking the same experience we ve had around bolt on rates moving three  four points a year  with even a more aged APU fleet out there  that s an opportunity for us The NPD launch  as I ve talked to the new platforms should be good and we have worked three years to get these things ready for the market  And then  as I said in my remarks  truck  bus  rail  those will all grow too  small truck in particular  Bus  rail all will grow too  So those are sort of factors that we can count on  I think in 2020 Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystGreat  And then just a follow up on Slide 21  I appreciate you trying to help us here and that you re noting the scale isn t exact  But the position of the plus 20 and the minus 40 looks pretty proportional to where the zero is  right  And so everything on that chart with the exception of APUs looks like it s down less than 20  with all other actually positive  So just a little unclear how or why you d be guiding Q1 down 20  in aggregate Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou know I can t speak to the scale maybe Zac or Shane  who threw the scale can talk to that Zac Nagle    Vice President  Investor RelationsYes  I mean  Jeff  the market will be down close to 30  for trailers in the first quarter  North America trailers  Europe trailers  a similar number APUs would be down in the 35  to 40  range  So that s really how you get there  Balance of the market being the other 40   So it s really the decline in the areas that really outgrew in last in the fourth quarter of 2018  which were trailer and APUs  And those are down most Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat s down    that is the reason Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystAll right  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi  Your line is open Andrew Kaplowitz    Citigroup Inc    AnalystGood morning  guys  Sue  thanks for all your help Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Andy Andrew Kaplowitz    Citigroup Inc    AnalystMike  you ve been talking about your focus on sustainability and improving efficiency for a long time now  But given the continued strong bookings  especially in North American commercial HVAC  are you just seeing more awareness and acceptance of your HVAC systems capability  especially in markets like office and education to help meet your customers  sustainability goals as they look to replace their equipment  And is that allowing the business to increasingly look better than the macro data that we see  like construction starts Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean  first of all  it s a passion inside the company  What I am telling you around company purpose is something that gets deeply ingrained and even how investments and projects get evaluated  because that s how we think we re going win in the marketplace  And so it s very tied out in terms of how we deploy goals and how we look at products going forward  so that    for sure  I think it s critically a critical factor in all of this When you look at some of the Dodge data as an example in the Put in place  which people look to  it s interesting and I am just going to talk obviously about North America here which is where the Dodge data is more relevant  You take our commercial business and you split it right down the middle 50 50 between equipment and services And of the 50  that s equipment  you get 60  to 70  of that which is replacement  which generally is not ever going to be reported on Dodge Put in place because we are negotiating energy service agreements  service contracts  retrofits  So that really only has the Dodge Put in place data addressing about 15  to 20  of the business  And so as folks try to read through that to our commercial business on Dodge data or ABI data  you re probably only predicting 15  to 20  of what that looks like Andrew Kaplowitz    Citigroup Inc    AnalystMike  thanks for that  And then just following up on some of the comments you made on China commercial HVAC  If I look at the bookings  they look like they turned down a little in Q4  But you mentioned backlog is up low double digits  So was it just kind of timing  Can you give more color on China  I assume you continue to grow service penetration  what particular end markets are helping you in China Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  first of all  when we talk about Asia in particular  we have to remember that China is sort of half of the business and the rest is the rest of the region  China was actually relatively strong  Bookings looked OK  Backlog  as I mentioned  is up double digit year over year  And so  a lot of the weakness was outside of China and I think in some ways you see those markets recovering You can think about electronics in South Korea  You can think about those sorts of markets which were pretty tough  But we expect healthy growth in China and for the region in 2020  Strength in healthcare and we think a rebound in some of the technology segments which   where we ve been a big player historically Andrew Kaplowitz    Citigroup Inc    AnalystThanks  Mike OperatorOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone  And congratulations to both Sue and Chris  Sue  you ll be missed for sure Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Joe Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystSo  maybe just my first question just following up on that China question Mike  Clearly you guys have done a great job growing into Tier 3  Tier 4 cities and the attachment rates  Obviously a lot of concern right now  given the virus outbreak  I m just curious  as you look forward and you think about like previous times  whether it s SARS impacting your business  Have you seen any impact at all at this juncture from the virus and how has this kind of played out for you guys historically Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I mean  first of all  we had no impact yet to employees  which is important and I think we ve sent 650 000 masks  is what I saw  to China  So we re trying to do our part there on that  I would tell you that what we believe we know today is that best case would be China essentially going back to work on February 10th  This is sort of the market in general and sort of our business as well So if that s the case  I mean you re talking about really a week of production and that s just going to get pushed  I mean that demand is there  It will get pushed out  Maybe it will get absorbed in the quarter if it s possible to do  if not it will get pushed to the second quarter So  it s fluid  We re watching it closely  We re looking at the supply chain as well  We generally have strong supply chains  We generally tend to work in region for region  But to the extent we ve got any Chinese components being imported  say  into the U S  or Europe  we re generally keeping those cases eight to 10 weeks of inventory on hand  So again  a one week or two week issue is not going to be a problem for us with regard to that  But Joe  it s fluid and I m hoping that this thing is contained and best case looks to be people are back to work February 10th Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Okay  that s helpful color Mike  And then maybe just my follow up here  Slide 21  super helpful  So nice job Zac and Shane  Just curious  as you kind of think about the climate business ex transport  Is there anything we need to be aware of from a    either growth or margin standpoint as you think about cadence for 2020 Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNone that I can think of  Guys  anybody have any color on that Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  The way I was thinking about it Joe was  you know as you think about the markets  you know when you think about HVAC with commercial and residential  it s going to follow the same cadence that it has historically followed with Q2 and Q3 being our stronger quarters  So I think that stays in line with what we re doing  We do think that Q1 is going to be a quarter where the volume is tough and buildings  So I think that one is an area where you can think about Q1 maybe not quite being at historical levels of contribution The other thing that I would say and I sound like I just think about cash  but I think as you think about Climate and Trane Technologies  we talked about this at the time of the stand up  we believed that we re still going to generate 100  or greater than net income over time in the Climate business  It does tend to be a little more back half loaded than what we have seen  although  I m sort of laughing because we did have such a huge fourth quarter for cash flow this year  But I think that s one of the impacts that you might see  So revenue sort of following normal patterns other than the TK guide that we ve already talked about and cash flow more back end loaded Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  And what I ll will say  Joe is that  going back to commercial North America which has been just incredibly strong and it s strong across the board meaning that even the unitary and services growth have been double    unitary has been in the teens  But the applied growth has been extraordinary  The win rates there  the pull through of systems has been excellent Now that does initially book and ship at generally lower margins than the unitary business  But of course you get the long service tail on the applied business  So in the long run  it s a great business  It s a win  So it does put a little bit of probably mix pressure within Trane commercial and that again is one of those mix pressures we saw in quarter four as well  And so historically  I usually get the question and I didn t get it so far  but I will talk about it We end up historically something in the 15  range of Q1 EPS for the total year and you know last three years has been that  Six years has been a little bit lower than that  I would tell you know  sort of a safer guide here will be something between 14  and 15  just a result of that strong mix differential between applied and unitary and between TK and Trane Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYes  twosome must have been caught off guard  So thanks for all the color Zac Nagle    Vice President  Investor RelationsYes  No  just to add to that  we re actually just    since we re guiding OI at this point  I d say the average for OI for Climate as a percentage of the year has been in the 15  range  It will probably be in the 14  to 15  range this year  So a little lighter in the first quarter Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Zac  I m so used to EPS after all this time that  Speech Overlap  we re going to talk about OI  yeah  Thanks guys OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America  Your line is now open Andrew Obin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYes  good morning Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey  good morning  AndrewAndrew Obin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystSue  it was such a pleasure working with you  I think actually with multiple companies  So congrats and good luck Susan Carter    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Andrew Andrew Obin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystJust a question  you know  residential construction  can you just walk us through your framework  How much visibility do you think on resi construction cycle over the next several years and what gives you confidence that they will continue sort of to be positive Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Andy  it s such a small part of kind of what drives our business that us    we would far from being the experts on giving you a forecast there  I mean if you think about the res equipment business being probably 10  of the company going forward and you think about 80  of our business there being replacement  New construction doesn t move the needle one way or the other for us really in a residential market  So I d probably defer to some of the better forecast that are out there on that one than tell you that we ve got a good read on that Andrew Obin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYes  I was just asking more as a lead indicator for non res  Another question I have for you  how should we think about Trane s market share over the next couple of years  You ve done a fantastic job  So how sustainable it is and what are the headwinds Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I mean you know  when we guide  we are generally guiding on    we think the market is going to be pricing some sense of volume  some sense of mix  We always target our teams with market share and margin expansion  So the goals there are always higher than what you see and I think that s a healthy thing for us to do  I feel really good about what s coming out into the marketplace  I feel good about a lot of the training and development we ve had had around the company in terms of systems  sales and some of the more sophisticated offerings that we do around services So I feel like there s a lot of ways to win  It s not always on the product technology  although we re a leader there and that s a heavy part of the investment  But it s also in the way that you go to market in a way that the expertise gets played out in the channel  And as you think about  what I ve always said in the commercial space  these are always going to be people that are 100  dedicated on behalf of the company This is not something that you see sort of distributors doing for us  That s such an important thing when you re trying to drive an overall system strategy and trying to sell total cost of ownership over the long run  It s a sophisticated sale generally done by very technical people  They ve been doing it for a long time and that s something that s very difficult to replicate and something we always invest in that capability  That s a big part of the secret sauce  I guess  of the business Andrew Obin    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystThank you very much Michael W  Lamach    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Andy OperatorAnd that s

worst quarter since the height of the credit crunch in the
fourth quarter of 2008  The S P 500  index has lost

 NEW YORK  May 6  Reuters    An unexpectedly strong report
on U S  payrolls propelled stocks higher on Friday for the
first time this week  but indexes retreated from highs after
speculation Greece might leave the euro zone 
 The largest boost to U S  equities Friday was a government
report showing non farm payrolls increased by 244 000 in April 
the most in 11 months and well above economists  expectations 
according to Brian Jacobsen  chief portfolio strategist at
Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls  Wisconsin 
 But stocks came off highs after a German news report  later
denied  that Greece had raised the possibility of leaving the
euro zone 
  Speculation on Greece leaving the euro zone and
uncertainty as to what that means kept some people wary of
going long into the weekend   Jacobsen said 
 He added that  a close above 1 340  on the S P 500  would
be healthy  indicating a strong foundation  for the equities
market 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  gained 78 26
points  or 0 62 percent  to 12 662 43  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  rose 7 99 points  or 0 60 percent  to
1 343 09  The Nasdaq Composite  added 21 18 points  or
0 75 percent  to 2 835 90 
 Earlier  the three major indexes were up more than 1
percent  The S P is on track to post its worst week since mid
March 
 A massive sell off in commodities on Thursday forced
investors out of high risk assets and put into question the
equities rally  The Reuters Jefferies commodities index 
was down 0 3 percent Friday  extending its 4 9 percent slide
from Thursday 
 The iShares Silver Trust  suffered outflows of more
than  1 billion in the week ended Wednesday  its worst one week
outflow ever  plus heavy losses due to the slump in the price
of silver 
  Commodities and stocks could perhaps move in opposite
directions  in the future  said Jacobsen  He said a change in
leadership from energy and other commodity related stocks to
industrial and transport companies could be expected 
 On Friday  industrials  led sector gains on the S P
500  up almost 1 percent  Ingersoll Rand  gained 2 3
percent to  50 39 
 Friday marks the one year anniversary of the  flash crash 
on Wall Street when nearly  1 billion was wiped off the U S 
stock market in a matter of minutes before the market bounced
back  The crash is said to have diminished retail investors 
confidence in the market 
 The CBOE volatility index    dropped 0 4 percent to
18 12 after closing on Thursday at its highest level since
March 28

175052,396568,IR,Regal Beloit Vs  IDEX  Which Stock To Bet Post Q1 Earnings ,opinion,With first quarter earnings drawing to a close  industry peers are doing various analysis and comparisons to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance  Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the    Regal Beloit Corporation   NYSE RBC   and IDEX Corporation   NYSE IEX     to pick the better investment option   Earnings ScoresheetRegal Beloit reported decent first quarter 2018 results  supported by strong organic sales growth and favorable foreign currency translation impact  On a GAAP basis  the industrial goods manufacturer reported net income of  58 4 million or  1 31 per share compared with  46 3 million or  1 02 per share in the year earlier quarter  The year over year improvement was primarily due to higher revenues across segments  Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were  1 34 per share compared with  1 07 in the year ago quarter  The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 26  Net sales increased to  878 8 million from  813 5 million in the year earlier quarter  driven by strong organic sales growth across all three operating segments  Moreover  quarterly revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  867 million IDEX reported strong first quarter results with all time high revenues  operating income and earnings driven by healthy organic growth and diligent execution of operational plans  GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were  99 million or  1 27 per share compared with  75 9 million or 99 cents per share in the year earlier quarter  The year over year improvement was primarily attributable to top line growth  Excluding restructuring and other non recurring items  adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were  1 29 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 24  Net sales came in at  612 3 million compared with  553 6 million in the year ago quarter  Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  601 million  The top line increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of 7   Investments in product innovations  business development and reallocation of resources led to growth in revenues across all segments of the company  which helped drive total revenues Based on first quarter earnings  there appears to be no clear favorite as Regal Beloit has an edge over IDEX with respect to earnings surprise percentage  while it is just the opposite with respect to revenue surprise percentage Price PerformanceOver the past month  Regal Beloit has outperformed IDEX with an average return of 8 7  against a loss of 3 1  for the latter while the sector declined 1 7   Based on the price performance  Regal Beloit appears to be a clear winner  Zacks Rank   VGM ScoreWith a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Regal Beloit has a Value Growth Momentum score    of A  IDEX has a VGM Score of D and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  offer the best investment opportunities for investors  Consequently  Regal Beloit appears to be better positioned than IDEX with regards to this metric Estimate RevisionsPost earnings release  Regal Beloit s current quarter estimates increased from  1 49 to  1 52 per share  up 2   while that for the current year increased from  5 57 to  5 66  up 1 6   IDEX s current quarter estimates increased to  1 31 from  1 29 post earnings release  up 1 6   while current year estimates increased to  5 18 per share from  5 07  up 2 2    With positive estimate revisions  investor sentiments appear to be more bullish on Regal Beloit than IDEX with respect to current quarter estimates but just the opposite for current year estimates GuidanceFor 2018  Regal Beloit raised its adjusted earnings per share to  5 60  6 00 from  5 35  5 75 expected earlier  It expects the Nicotra Gebhardt acquisition to be 13 15 cents accretive to adjusted earnings in 2018  The company projects GAAP earnings per share between  5 29 and  5 69  up from prior expectations of  5 19  5 59 IDEX is poised to gain from robust organic growth  disciplined capital deployment and a favorable global macroeconomic environment  With solid quarterly results and continued strength in order trajectory  management has raised its earlier guidance for 2018  Full year adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the  5 05  5 20 per share range  up from  4 90  5 10 expected earlier on organic growth of 5 6  To Sum UpBased on the current scenario  although the two stocks seem to match each other on most counts  Regal Beloit appears to have trumped IDEX on few metrics and stands out as a better investment proposition  A couple of other top ranked stocks in the industry are Ingersoll Rand Plc   NYSE IR   and A  O  Smith Corporation   NYSE AOS    both carrying a Zacks Rank  2 Ingersoll Rand has a long term earnings growth expectation of 11 2   It surpassed estimates

175100,396616,IR,Here s Why You Should Add Donaldson  DCI  To Your Portfolio,opinion,Earlier this month  filtration systems and replacement parts manufacturer  Donaldson Company  Inc  s   NYSE DCI   third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings trumped estimates  scoring a hat trick of earnings beats  Buoyed by stabilization in market conditions  robust sales and complementary acquisitions  the company raised both its top  and bottom line guidance for fiscal 2017 for the second time in a row Encouragingly  the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse  gaining 33 5  over the past one year  and outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s average of 30 9    We believe the company has a number of solid growth drivers  which will continue to stoke growth for the remainder of the fiscal 2017  Read on to find out the key factors which make this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company an attractive proposition for investors right now Why Should You Buy Impressive VGM Score  The company has a VGM Score of  B   The score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth and momentum characteristics  and a good score indicates stronger chances of success  Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of  A  or  B   when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  offer the best upside potential Superior ROA  Donaldson s Return on Assets  ROA  ratio for the trailing 12 months is 12 1   higher than that of the industry average of 9 1   This indicates that the company uses its capital more efficiently and profitably compared with the industry Analyst Sentiment Positive  Analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company over the last month  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year 2017 earnings trended up over the same time frame from  1 66 to  1 70  supported by eight upward estimate revisions versus zero downward Glance at Major Catalysts  Donaldson is beginning to experience signs of stabilization in its end markets  which are expected to benefit the company in the upcoming quarters  The positives include effects of restocking  favorable commodity prices  decent rig counts and stable industrial production  Donaldson projects fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of  1 67  1 71 compared with the earlier guidance of  1 60  1 68 The company believes that benefit from the Northern Technical  L L C  escrow settlement  which occurred in the fiscal first quarter  will supplement earnings growth  Currently  Donaldson expects fiscal 2017 sales to increase up to 6  from fiscal 2016  up from the previously guided range of 2 4   The guidance hike is primarily attributable to the additional sales accruing from the recently acquired filtration systems firm  Hy Pro Corporation In terms of segments  Donaldson estimates Engine Products sales to rise 10 11  year over year  mainly supported by robust performance of the Aftermarket  Off Road  and Aerospace and Defense segments  For the Industrial Products segment  the company expects sales to decline in the range of 3 2  on a year over year basis  Unimpressive Gas Turbine Systems and Special Applications performance are also expected to play spoilsport Streamlining Efforts  In order to maximize growth opportunities  Donaldson has been undertaking restructuring initiatives to align its operating and manufacturing cost structure  The company expects to realize about  12 million of incremental restructuring benefits in fiscal 2017 from the actions taken in fiscal 2016  As a matter of fact  Donaldson s profitability has benefited significantly from restructuring actions that were implemented over the last 12 months Globally  the company has identified opportunities to cut about  8 million of expenses out of their respective businesses from these restructuring actions  Donaldson believes that its previously completed ERP implementation program will help slash its expense run rate by a few million dollars  Going forward  ERP implementation is expected to improve inventory management  pricing and processes  adding to Donaldson s strength Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top ranked stocks in the industry include Barnes Group Inc    NYSE B    ACCO Brands Corporation   NYSE ACCO   and Ingersoll Rand Plc   NYSE IR    Each stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Barnes Group has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four

175218,396734,IR,Mark Lackey   This Is Your Energy Entry Point  ,opinion,Oil prices are starting to creep back up while gas  coal and uranium are poised for moves this fall  according to Mark Lackey  long time energy analyst now representing resource companies with CHF Investor Relations  In this exclusive interview with The Energy Report  Lackey shares his current insights on energy markets and talks about a number of companies he thinks are sleepers  ready to move quickly when the energy commodities take off  The Energy Report  Since your last interview  you ve made a jump from the research side of the business to the investor relations  IR  side  How has the view changed  Mark Lackey  When I worked in the brokerage industry  I relied on IR people to bring me clients and stories  updates on companies I was following or promising companies of which I was never aware  There are over 3 000 companies listed on the TSX and TSX Venture exchanges and you can t know all the stories  so analysts often need introductions  Here at CHF  I m involved in taking clients  largely in the resource sector  to meet with research and corporate finance people and brokers as well as retail and institutional investors  We also help with companies  press releases  presentations and even market making  But regardless of whether I m doing research or IR  it s still a function of whether you believe in commodity cycles and how certain sectors  companies  locations and managements will benefit and profit  TER  Talking to other brokerage firms and people in the investment business  what s the general mood at this point  ML  In the small  and mid cap market  the mood has been mixed  Some people are negative about the commodities sector in the short run  and some even think the whole commodity cycle is over  Others are more neutral  Then you have a smaller group of people who tend to support my view and are much more positive in the very short run  TER  How does this affect your view of the oil and gas markets  ML  I m actually quite positive  After getting down below  80 barrel  bbl   West Texas Intermediate  WTI  is now back up over  96 bbl  The Brent price is at  115 bbl  Recent inventory numbers  particularly in the U S   are down  so there s no overhang in the near term  Demand has hung in reasonably well  considering all the European problems  and there s still decent demand coming from the emerging markets  WTI will likely trade between  100 bbl and  105 bbl next year  with Brent between  115 bbl and  120 bbl  Natural gas has been somewhat weaker  but it bounced off the  2 thousand cubic feet  Mcf  price a few months ago up to the  2 85 3 Mcf range in North America  With more industrial demand coming back  particularly in the auto sector  and stronger demand from electric utilities  gas should move back up closer to  3 25 3 30 Mcf in the next year  By way of comparison  prices in Europe can be anywhere from  4 8 Mcf  and in China they re as high as  15 Mcf  TER  What interesting oil and gas situations have you recently come across that deserve some investor attention  ML  The first company I d like to talk about is Greenfields Petroleum Corp   GNF TSX V   which has production in Azerbaijan  a country that used to produce about 70  of the old Soviet Union s oil and gas  Azerbaijan probably has the best history and the best understanding of oil and natural gas relative to most of the other countries in that area  Another advantage there is getting the Brent price for oil  Azerbaijan still has some pretty good land positions available that would be more difficult to get in North America these days  Greenfields has gone back into some of the previously developed areas and is doing more delineation work  rather than wildcat exploration  It also has some greenfields projects  It s going to get some pretty good returns given the prices over there for both natural gas and oil  I think you ll see growing production from this company over the next few years in an area where there s potential to see some real improvement in cash flow  The stock has had pretty nice moves off its lows  With higher expected oil prices in the next year  we would anticipate that the share price should move higher  TER  Is Azerbaijan stable  ML  Yes  Azerbaijan has had an oil and gas industry for over 50 years and recognizes that this is its biggest source of income  It understands the oil and gas industry and this is a relatively good place to do business compared to all the potential places that you could look for oil in the world  TER  Who else is on your radar  ML  We like Primeline Energy Holdings Inc   PEH TSX V  and its prospects in the South China Sea  Its partner is the China National Offshore Oil Co   CNOOC   which is a huge company  Primeline just put out an updated resource report and should be producing by the middle of next year  With the extremely high natural gas prices in China  the company should have good cash flows and earnings within the next year or two  as well as some pretty good capital appreciation potential  The stock started to gain momentum after the company filed its Overall Development Plan for the Lishui gas project in June and it s now pushing its 52 week high of  0 60  We think it offers investors a really attractive opportunity over the next few years  TER  Oil services have been getting some positive press lately  Are you following any companies in that sector  ML  The oil services side is often overlooked by investors  But drilling activity and rising prices create rising demand for oil services  We represent Bri Chem Corp   BRY TSX   which is a North American wholesale distributor of oil and gas drilling fluids and piping products to the energy business  Bri Chem is well integrated in the oil and gas service industry and expanded from Canada to the U S  last year  It has earnings and cash flow and it is one that investors should be looking at  Up until a couple of years ago  U S  production had been on the decline for 40 years  But in the last few years  production has increased with improved technology accessing unconventional hydrocarbons  particularly in the shale formations  This has been a boon for many of the oil service companies like Bri Chem  which is likely to grow its cash flow and earnings even more over the next few years  It s trading around  2 65 and provides a pretty good opportunity for capital appreciation at these levels  TER  Let s talk about the uranium market  Prices have been fairly flat and they ve shown a little weakness in the past month  What do you think is happening there  ML  Uranium was  70 pound  lb  back in March 2011 and then drifted down after the Fukushima incident  Japan took steps to close all 56 of its reactors and the Germans have taken out about seven or eight  There are about 445 operating worldwide  The price has been sitting around the  50  51 lb range for a number of months and recently has gone down to  49 lb on the short term market  The lower demand in the short run is the reason for the  20 hit  The Japanese have probably gone through three quarters of their reactors  testing them to make sure they can withstand certain high strength earthquakes  They are also putting up larger retaining walls and doing other things to prevent future problems from flooding  Our guess is that at least half of those reactors will be back in operation in the next six months and maybe as many as 75 80  of them within the next year  period  Nuclear power accounts for 15  of Japan s needs  Japan s economy really can t function without some nuclear power in order to meet demand  its manufacturing sector requires an ongoing  inexpensive  stable power supply  There are 60 other reactors around the world under construction and about another 240 planned over the next 5 10 years  Another factor is that next year  the phaseout of the Russian exports to the U S  of highly enriched uranium from its nuclear warheads will end  Thus  demand is coming back and some supply is constrained  which should cause prices to move up in the next couple of years  TER  What stocks do you like in the uranium industry at this point  ML  We have followed Strathmore Minerals Corp   STM TSX  STHJF OTCQX  for a while  It has large positions in both New Mexico and Wyoming  which has produced 90  of past U S  uranium production  In 1980  the U S  was the biggest producer of uranium in the world  Today it only produces about 4 million pounds  Mlb  a year  making up about 8  of its needs  Strathmore is sitting on large reserves and has the potential to be a significant producer down the road  It expects to be producing in 2016 out of Wyoming and in 2017 out of New Mexico  The stock price has probably been hurt by the weaker uranium price and the fact that it is three years from production  We expect uranium prices to rise to  65 lb by the end of next year and to  75 lb by the end of 2014  This could be a perfect storm for Strathmore  and the market will start to recognize this stock  I think you ll see quite a bit of capital appreciation over the next two to four years  TER  What else are you looking at in the uranium sector  ML  We like Fission Energy Corp   FIS TSX V  FSSIF OTCQX   It recently took over another uranium company  Pitchstone  which had some very good properties  also in the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan  What makes Fission very attractive is its proximity to Hathor  which was taken over by Rio Tinto Plc  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  RIO LSE  RTPPF OTCPK  last year in a battle with Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE   the world s largest uranium company  It s obvious that Rio Tinto wants to get bigger in North America and Cameco would also be interested in making acquisitions  One of the potential takeover candidates would have to be Fission  It does need to do more drilling and prove up its resource over time  But  it s well positioned  has the money and is certainly in the right address near some of the biggest and highest grade uranium mines in the world  It has good management and the company is well funded  We think this is a stock that people should also be looking to invest in  As this company moves forward and proves up more reserves  it will become a much more likely takeover candidate  perhaps in the next couple of years  The other company that I like in this sector is Forum Uranium Corp   FDC TSX V   which is really more of a microcap company  of which I only follow maybe three or four  My interest in Forum is based on its very good project location in the Athabasca Basin and its very experienced management team  Its partner is Rio Tinto  which just took over Hathor and wants to expand in the area  Other than maybe Cameco  you couldn t ask for a better partner  It s done some drilling and needs to do more to move this stock to a point where somebody would consider taking it over  For a micro cap uranium play  Forum is a good one to look at considering its project and its partner  TER  The other part of the energy market is thermal and metallurgical coal used in steel production  What have those two markets been doing  ML  We tend to follow more of the met coal market  The weakness in the natural gas price  particularly in the U S   has hurt thermal coal producers  especially in Appalachia  where there are somewhat higher costs  We think the thermal coal market will see some recovery over the next couple of years because it s not just the U S  that uses thermal coal  Far more thermal coal is used in China than in the U S  The high cost producers have been affected the most as thermal prices have been hit as much as 20 30  in the last three to four months  That s made a difference to the bottom lines and investment analysts  view of that sector  The same thing has happened in the met coal market  Because Chinese steel prices  particularly in China  have gone down 20  in the last three months  iron ore has gone down 20   putting downward pressure on the met coal price because the biggest steel market in the world is China  On the Australian market  the price has gone from  225 ton  t  down to  175 t  We think that this is probably the bottom of the market for steel  iron ore and met coal because construction activity usually picks up dramatically in China in October  November and December  We expect that all three areas will see recovery moving into the fall and through next year  Weakness in the met coal market has affected the prices of all the companies we re going to talk about  I d rather be buying when the met coal price is  175 t than when it was  225 t three months ago or when it was  300 t at one point last year  Now you can buy these companies at much lower prices and probably get much better value for your money  TER  Let s talk about some of the companies you like  ML  The first one I like is Corsa Coal Corp   CSO TSX   based in Ontario with production largely in Pennsylvania and some in Maryland  It s largely metallurgical  and a little bit thermal  Corsa has very high quality coal that can be blended because of its low sulfur and ash levels  It s well located in Pennsylvania near the major U S  steel industry  which is still the third largest producer in the world  If you re one of the somewhat bigger neighboring producers in Pennsylvania whose quality of met coal is not as good  I think Corsa could be a good acquisition target  It expects to have some significant increases in production in the next two to three years  With the met price getting back up to the  225 t range over the next year or two  it should have some pretty good cash flow and potential earnings over that time  The stock s trading right now at  0 17 share  I don t follow that many microcaps but Corsa is certainly one of the few I do and like  TER  How about some other ones  ML  Another one we follow is Cline Mining Corp   CMK TSX   a Toronto based company with a significant met coal operation in Colorado that was about to start production within the last month  The decline in the price of met coal caused the company to postpone start up and lay off people for 60 days  As a new producer  it could have been difficult to sell any of its coal  I think management did the wise thing by waiting to see if the market will come back in the fall and not build up too much inventory in a weak market  Of course  this disappointed the market and it hit the stock price fairly hard  Cline has very good quality coal with significant reserves and could be a pretty significant producer within the next two to three years  selling some in the U S  and shipping some through Texas all the way over to China  With the expansion of the Panama Canal in 2014  bigger ships can go to China and a company like Cline would probably sell most of its coal abroad in the future  TER  What other companies do you like  ML  Colonial Coal International Corp   CAD TSX V  is a western Canadian met coal company in the Peace River area in Alberta  It s in a good met coal producing area with infrastructure  rail  experienced labor and decent power prices  Colonial is working on developing two very high quality met coal properties  suitable for coking  with large reserves  There have been a number of takeovers in this area in the last year  And  looking at valuations  this company could certainly be trading at a much higher level if somebody was targeting them  If I had to pick someone in the met coal business in western Canada right now  Colonial would be my most likely acquisition target  Comparing it to the value of some of the other companies out there  its stock price should be considerably higher than where it s trading right now  at around  0 76 share  TER  To wrap things up  give us your general thoughts on where you think things are headed and how the average man on the street should be looking at these energy investments  ML  If you believe we re in a long term commodities cycle  as we do here at CHF  then this is probably one of the best points to enter these markets  We think oil is going higher  while some of the natural gas prices in the world are already extremely high  Coal and uranium markets appear near the bottom and we expect to see higher prices over the next two to three years  In short  we think this is actually one of the better buying opportunities we ve seen in the last decade for small and mid cap companies in these sectors  and select micro caps with sound fundamentals  TER  Thanks for talking with us today  There are certainly lots of good opportunities out there    executive vice president of CHF Investor Relations  Cavalcanti Hume Funfer Inc    has 30 years of experience in the energy  mining  banking and investment research sectors
