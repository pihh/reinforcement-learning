10893,232408,CUTR,New Analyst Coverage Make These 5 Stocks Worth A Bet,opinion,Most investors depend on analysts  research before taking decisions as they fear that lack of information might trigger inefficiencies  Here  analysts play a vital intermediary role with their extensive access to relevant data Coverage initiation of a stock by analyst s  usually portrays higher investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume there is something special in a stock to attract analysts  attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not randomly chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects a reassuring future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investors  focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it  After all  who doesn t love to produce something that is already in demand  Hence  we often find that analysts  ratings on newly added stocks are more favorable than their ratings on continuously covered stocks It is worth mentioning here that the average change in broker recommendation is always preferred over a single recommendation change Impact on Price MovementThe price movement of a stock generally depends on the recommendations on it from new analysts  Usually  stocks see an upward price movement on new analyst coverage compared to what was witnessed with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock Below  we have selected five stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not attract individual investors  Here are five of the eight stocks that passed the screen Diodes Incorporated   NASDAQ DIOD    a semiconductor products manufacturer  returned 6 9  in the last three months  outperforming the Zacks classified Electronics   Semiconductors industry s 2 5  gain  Over the last 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rose by 37 cents to  1 25 for 2017 and 25 cents to  1 50 for 2018  Positive earnings estimate revisions for 2017 and 2018 along with an expected earnings growth rate of 62 3  for 2017 and 20  for the next indicate the stock s potential for further price appreciation  The stock sports

11064,232579,CUTR,AMSC  EOLS  IO  CVNA  IIN  MED,opinion,"At this point  the market is starting to pull back and do some retracement  but Thursday was a good day for several stocks  I am going to show you some longs and prepare you for whatever pullbacks may be coming with shorts 
On the Long Side  
American Superconductor Corporation  NASDAQ AMSC  has a terrific chart  It broke out  pulled back in a falling wedge along the 7 8 range  and here it is up 66 cents  or 4 76   to 14 54  on 604 050 shares traded on Thursday  It needs a push  Looks to me like this is a 19 dollar stock going forward 
Evolus  Inc   NASDAQ EOLS  had a spectacular follow through after the pause on Wednesday  It only went from 23 50 to 29 00  jumping 4 85 or 20   to 28 91  on 5 million shares  If it gets through resistance at 28 91  the next target is 34 34 1 2 
ION Geophysical Corporation  NYSE IO  ran 2 43  or 25   to 12 18  on 450 765 shares traded  The swing that I put on it is working well  It consolidated for a few weeks  and then exploded on Thursday  There s resistance in that level  The next target is around 14  followed by 18 
Stocks on the Short Side  
Carvana Co   NYSE CVNA  is ugly  as you can see  It dropped down in Sept  formed a big wedge  cracked and formed a rising wedge before we told you to go short  and dropped 39 cents  or  1 17   to 33 02  on 1 9 million shares on Thursday  and is pulling back near support  Ultimately  if it doesn t hold the 24 5 zone  which is my next target  and gets through 29 first  it could get dramatically lower to 21  and then the 17 range 
IntriCon Corporation  NASDAQ IIN  broke down in Sept  I gave you a short around 51 28  it formed a short flag  and is forming another one now  On Thursday  it dropped 1 40  or  5 39   to 24 58  on 106 215 shares traded  It has broken this pattern  and if it doesn t hold 22 22 1 2  this could get to 17 fairly quickly 
Medifast  Inc   NYSE MED  broke down earlier in Sept  formed a wedge  broke down  formed another wedge  broke down sharply  bear flagged  formed another rising wedge  and actually fell 19 cents  or  0 15   to 127 07  on 208 021 shares traded on Thursday  It did not get above the moving averages  but if it takes out the 132 high from last week  it could fall back to 106 108  maybe even the high 80 s

11111,232626,CUTR,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  ACM Research  GAIN Capital  Cutera  Columbus McKinnon And Minerva,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 23  2019   Stocks in this week s article are ACM Research  Inc    NASDAQ ACMR    GAIN Capital Holdings  Inc    NYSE GCAP    Cutera  Inc    NASDAQ CUTR    Columbus McKinnon Corp    NASDAQ CMCO   and Minerva Neurosciences  Inc    NASDAQ NERV   5 Stocks to Buy on New Analyst CoverageCoverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  helps in interpreting information pertaining to capital markets  creating value for investors  Lack of information creates inefficiencies that might trigger misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  In fact  coverage initiation usually depicts increased investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it Notably  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change How Does Analyst Coverage Influence Stock Price The price movement of a stock is generally a function of the recommendations on it from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly more positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst gives a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may

11113,232628,CUTR,Cutera  Party City  Micron  Perficient And CACI Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 24  2019    Cutera Inc    NASDAQ CUTR   as the Bull of the Day  Party City Holdco Inc    NYSE PRTY   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Micron Technology Inc    NASDAQ MU    Perficient  Inc    NASDAQ PRFT   and CACI International  Inc    NYSE CACI   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Cutera Inc  is a company that designs  develops  manufactures  and markets the CoolGlide family of laser products  The original CoolGlide CV provides permanent hair reduction on all skin types  and the second generation CoolGlide Excel added the capability to treat a variety of vascular lesions like telangiectasia  spider and reticular leg veins  CoolGlide Vantage added non ablative skin therapy to the company s range of applications Q2 Earnings Fly Past ExpectationsOverall  Cutera had a great second quarter  Revenue of  48 million beat our consensus estimate and rose 12  year over year  marking the highest sales level in the company s history  Earnings of  0 04 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus of a loss of 16 cents  with net income of  0 6 million The company saw strong growth internationally revenue grew 36  year over year in its international segment and nice gains across Japan  Europe  and Asia all contributed to Cutera s growth this past quarter As a result  CUTR shot up 34  after releasing its Q2 earnings Year to date  CUTR is up nearly a whopping 90   Estimates have been rising lately too  pushing the stock towards a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  For the current fiscal year  Cutera s earnings growth is expected to rise almost 73  year over year  Two analysts have revised their estimate upwards in the past 60 days  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped 16 cents higher from three cents to 19 cents per share during the same time frame 2020 looks strong too  and earnings could see growth of roughly 116   next year s consensus estimate sits at 41 cents per share  with one upward revision in the last 60 days  though one analyst cut their estimate during the same time frame  Bottom LineCutera has a new CEO at the helm  David Mowry  and he said in the company s news release that he is confident  there are multiple pathways to sustain above market growth  enhance the Company s profitability  and be the supplier of choice in these exciting and growing markets  Looking ahead  Cutera looks to have a solid rest of the year ahead of it  It expects revenue to fall in the range of  165 to  175 million  reflecting a 2  8  increase over 2018  Gross margin is also expected to expand compared to last year s  while adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between  2 million and  4 million If you re an investor looking for a computer and technology stock to add to your portfolio  make sure to keep CUTR on your shortlist  Party City Holdco Inc  designs  manufactures  and distributes party goods like paper and plastic tableware  metallic and latex balloons  Halloween and other costumes  accessories  novelties  gifts and stationery  It also operates specialty retail party supply stores throughout the U S and Canada Last month  Party City reported weak second quarter results overall  and shares closed down over 18  that day  Earnings of 22 cents per share and revenue of  563 9 million both lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate  comparable sales fell 2 1  year over year  while gross margin slumped 390 basis points to 37 1  Party City partly blamed tariffs on China for its disappointing performance  as well as  direct and indirect impacts of the helium shortages and higher helium costs in many of our markets   noted CEO James Harrison in the company s Q2 earnings release Analysts have since turned bearish on Party City  with five cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped 36 cents during that same time period from  1 66 to  1 30 per share  This sentiment has stretched into 2020  and our consensus estimate has also dropped 36 cents in the past two months GT is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Looking AheadParty City has cut its guidance for 2019  and now expects revenue in the range of  2 4 billion  2 45 billion  down from a previous range of  2 49 billion  2 54 billion  Comparable sales are projected to be flat to down 1  compared to 1  growth  and Party City s bottom line is now expected to fall in the range of  1 26  1 36 per share The party supply retailer is also closing down stores  It said it would sell all of its Canadian stores to Canadian Tire  and is planning on 55 more store closures this year In addition to a lowered outlook  Party City is dealing with a  1 9 billion debt burden Micron Technology  MU  to Post Q4 Earnings  What s in Store Micron Technology Inc  is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on Sep 26 Notably  the company s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  the average positive surprise being 10 3  In the last reported quarter  the company s non GAAP earnings of  1 05 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents but declined from the year ago quarter s figure of  3 15 Moreover  revenues dropped 33  on a year over year basis to  4 80 billion but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 66 billion The year over year revenue decline was due to industry oversupply and higher than expected fall in DRAM and NAND pricing  Moreover  restriction on sales to Huawei negatively impacted the company s DRAM and NAND revenues Estimates and Guidance for Q4Micron projected revenues for fourth quarter fiscal 2019 between  4 3 billion and  4 7 billion The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  4 51 billion  suggesting a decline of almost 46 51  from the year ago reported figure The company envisions non GAAP earnings to be roughly within 38 52 cents per share The consensus mark for earnings currently stands at 48 cents  indicating a plunge of 86 4  from the prior year reported number Factors at PlayMicron is witnessing progress in customer inventory adjustments in most of its end markets  making it anticipate bit demand for DRAM to resume healthy year over year growth from the fiscal fourth quarter onward  The company anticipates a strong uptick in DRAM bit shipments for the cloud  graphics and PC markets in the fiscal fourth quarter and thereafter In the automotive space  while slowdown in global auto sales is a woe  rising demand for in vehicle infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems is likely to drive content growth at a steady pace Despite challenges  Micron s focus on increasing the mix of high value solutions in its portfolio is a tailwind  We also expect strong growth in managed NAND products to leave a positive impact on its Mobile Business Unit revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter Moreover  in the computing and networking business unit  normalized customer inventory levels   particularly in graphics and client   are expected to expand shipment volume in the to be reported quarter However  Micron s overexposure in China makes the Sino U S  trade war a major overhang on the company  Moreover  starting mid May  the company suspended its chip shipments to Huawei  a major customer  in response to the export ban imposed by the U S  government  Even though the company has resumed shipment of select products to Huawei  the considerably lower revenues coming from such a sizeable customer are likely to remain a headwind on the to be reported quarter s results Moreover  there is a glut in the market with surplus supply due to the industry s transition from 2D NAND production to 3D NAND  Moreover  even though NAND bit demand is inversely related to price declines  NAND shipment growth in the fiscal fourth quarter is likely to be limited due to the ongoing transition of the SSD portfolio What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model  a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  along with a positive  has maximum chances of beating estimates  Meanwhile  the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  are best avoided Micron has a Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of 7 64   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or

the small space delivered outsized earnings beats in the second quarter A month ago  when a number of August laser company earnings beats got picked up by our earnings estimate system  the Laser Systems industry catapulted from a middling spot at  110 to a very attractive pole position of  25  top 10   British science writer Chris Woodford gives us the best online laser industry narrative   Lasers are amazing light beams powerful enough to zoom miles into the sky or cut through lumps of metal  Although they seem pretty recent inventions  they ve actually been with us over half a century  the theory was figured out in 1958  the first practical laser was built in 1960  At that time  lasers were thrilling examples of cutting edge science  secret agent 007  James Bond  was almost chopped in half by a laser beam in the 1964 film Goldfinger  But apart from Bond villains  no one else had any idea what to do with lasers  famously  they were described as  a solution looking for a problem   Today  we all have lasers in our homes  in CD and DVD players   in our offices  in laser printers   and in the stores where we shop  in barcode scanners   Our clothes are cut with lasers  we fix our eyesight with them  and we send and receive emails over the Internet with signals that lasers fire down fiber optic cables  Whether we realize it or not  all of us use lasers all day long  but how many of us really understand what they are or how they work  The basic idea of a laser is simple  It s a tube that concentrates light over and over again until it emerges in a really powerful beam  I
