172625,394141,FE,Ohio House expected to pass bill to save nuclear power plants,news," Reuters    Ohio s Republican controlled House of Representatives will likely pass a bill on Tuesday to create subsidies to avoid the early shutdown of the state s two nuclear power reactors  according to analysts and those watching the legislation 
The two reactors   Davis Besse and Perry   are owned by FirstEnergy Solutions  which has said it would shut the money losing plants in 2020 and 2021 unless the state provides some financial assistance 
FirstEnergy Solutions is a bankrupt unit of Ohio power company FirstEnergy Corp  NYSE FE   FirstEnergy Solutions said shutting the reactors could result in the loss of 4 300 jobs 
Analysts said the Ohio Senate s version of the bill  known as House Bill 6  HB6   would likely pass the House before going to Republican Governor Mike DeWine  who has expressed his support for the legislation  The House passed its version of the bill in May 
 We anticipate the House will pass the Senate version of the bill today   analysts at Height Capital Markets said on Tuesday  noting that Republican House Speaker Larry Householder  would not have a called a session for today unless he had the necessary votes  in our view  
The bill comes nearly a month after FirstEnergy Solutions  original June 30 deadline to purchase fuel for the spring 2020 refueling of the Davis Besse plant 
Officials at FirstEnergy Solutions were not immediately available for comment  but in the past have said the company would work with the state to avoid the Davis Besse closure if the legislature passed the bill by July 17 
Although the Senate  also controlled by Republicans  passed the bill on that date  the House did not take up the legislation because there were not enough votes to pass it at that time 
The Senate version of the bill would provide an overall reduction in consumer power rates by weakening the state s renewable and energy efficiency goals even though FirstEnergy Solutions would receive an estimated  150 million a year during the 2021 2027 period to keep its reactors in service 
Analysts said the bill would also provide about  60 million a year through 2030 to keep a couple of Ohio Valley Electric Corp s  OVEC  coal plants in service 
Several environmental groups opposed the nuclear bailout because it would subsidize coal plants and weaken the state s renewable and energy efficiency goals 
The natural gas industry opposed the bill in part because gas fired power plants would make more money by running more often after the coal and nuclear plants shut ",2019-07-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/ohio-house-expected-to-pass-bill-to-save-nuclear-power-plants-1931670,1931670

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGreetings  and welcome to the FirstEnergy Corp  Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instrucstions  As a reminder  this conference is being recorded  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host  Irene Prezelj  Vice President  Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp  Thank you  Ms  Prezelj  You may begin Irene M  Prezelj    Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  Doug  Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call  Today  we will make various forward looking statements regarding revenues  earnings  performance  strategies and prospects  These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such statements can be found on our Investors section of our website under the earnings information link and in our SEC filings We will also discuss certain non GAAP financial measures  Reconciliations between GAAP and non GAAP financial measures can be found on the FirstEnergy Investor Relations website along with the presentation  which supports today s discussion  Participants in today s call include Chuck Jones  President and Chief Executive Officer  Steve Strah  Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  and several other executives in the room who are available to participate in the Q A session Now  I ll turn the call over to Chuck Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsThank you  Irene  and good morning  everyone  Thanks for joining us  2019 was another great year and a step forward for FirstEnergy  marked by solid execution on initiatives that benefit our customers  shareholders  communities and our Company  One of the accomplishments that makes us most proud is our record of delivering on the commitments we ve made to the financial community This morning we announced 2019 GAAP earnings of  1 70 per share and operating earnings of  2 58 per share  which is at the top end of the guidance range we provided on our last earnings call  By executing on our customer focused growth strategy  along with some benefits from third quarter weather  we successfully mitigated the absence of the Ohio Distribution Modernization Rider in the second half of the year We ve reached five years of consistently meeting or exceeding the midpoint of the quarterly guidance that we provided  The culture of execution and ownership that our leadership team has established at FirstEnergy is one you can continue to count on as we improve service for our customers and communities and deliver strong results for our shareholders  Two years ago  we introduced our first long term growth rate projection of 6  to 8  compounded annually from 2018 to 2021  In the first year  we hit it out of the park Our 2019 growth versus our original 2018 guidance was 12   excluding both the Ohio DMR and weather impacts  Our culture of strong execution is clearly evident and has gotten us off to a great start on what now is a five year growth plan  And we re looking forward to another solid year in 2020 as we reaffirm our operating earnings guidance of  2 40 to  2 60 per share We continue providing investors with clarity into our long term expectations for earnings growth  In November  we extended the CAGR at a rate of 5  to 7  through 2023  As we ve discussed  this projection includes plans to issue a modest amount of equity up to a total of  600 million annually starting in 2022  When this happens  it will represent the first infusion of equity into our growth initiative since early 2018  and we will have invested approximately  12 billion in our business during that period By successfully executing on our regulated growth strategies  we have driven strong results for investors  In 2019  our total shareholder return was 34   placing our stock within the top quartile of the EEI Index  The TSR over the last two years  2018 and 2019  was 71   making FirstEnergy the number one stock in the EEI Index over that period  Over the past several years  the rating agencies have acknowledged our transition to a fully regulated company with primarily transmission and distribution operations  resulting in a lower risk profile  In 2019  we received numerous ratings upgrades across the FirstEnergy family as well as at the parent level With the November upgrade from Fitch  we are making solid progress toward our goal to achieve solid BBB ratings at all three agencies  While we remain focused on making steady improvements to our balance sheet  we believe we are well positioned to support our plans for growth  including the extended CAGR and associated equity issuance In 2019  we continued executing on our long term customer focused growth plans  This included an annual capital investment of approximately  3 billion in our transmission and distribution infrastructure  which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future  In our transmission business  we successfully completed year six of our Energizing the Future investment program  with more than  6 8 billion in investments during that period  As we reported to you throughout 2019  our customers in the ATSI footprint are seeing measurable reliability improvements  including a nearly 50  reduction in equipment related transmission outages as a result of the work we re doing to modernize the grid As we continue extending the program into our eastern footprint  we expect those customers to experience similar benefits  We took another important step in 2019 to continue the expansion of our Energizing the Future initiative  In December  FERC accepted our application to move JCP L s transmission assets in the forward looking formula rates  effective January 1  2020  subject to refund  With this change  nearly 90  of our transmission business is on forward looking formula rates  The forward looking rate structure in New Jersey supports our plan for approximately  175 million in customer focused capital spending on the JCP L transmission system this year On the distribution side of our business  last month  we received approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to implement a decoupling mechanism for our residential and commercial customers in the state  The commission also removed the requirement that our Ohio companies file a distribution rate case by 2024  Decoupling provides rate transparency and stability for these customers  while providing revenue certainty to our Ohio companies  Rates for 2019 and each year thereafter will be reconciled to 2018 baseline revenues and adjusted through a Conservation Support Rider  There is no impact from the rider on 2019 earnings  That adjustment will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020 Going forward  the rider will be reflected in current period results  Also in Ohio  our utilities are moving forward with  516 million three year Grid Modernization program that was approved by the PUCO in July  As we ve discussed  the plan includes modernization projects designed to help reduce the number and duration of power outages and allow our customers to make more informed decisions about their energy usage We expect to complete approximately  170 million of grid mod work this year  This initial phase includes deploying 250 000 smart meters to Ohio customers  implementing time varying rates and installing more than 600 reclosers and capacitors on the electric distribution system  which will help automatically isolate problems  prevent entire circuit lockouts and quickly restore electric service to customers In Pennsylvania  we completed work on the initial phase of our original  350 million long term infrastructure improvement plan in 2019  Last month  the Public Utility Commission approved our LTIIP II  spanning 2020 through 2024  The LTIIP II program includes a  572 million investment across our four Pennsylvania utilities to accelerate distribution infrastructure projects in the state  The improvement plan for each utility complements the work we already perform on our distribution network to reduce the number and duration of outages experienced by our 2 million Pennsylvania customers  Investments include replacing older poles  lines and fuses  installing new substation equipment  network vaults and manual covers  and reconfiguring circuits Approximately  120 million of the work is expected to be completed in 2020 across our Pennsylvania service area  with the remainder spent over the next four years  Costs associated with these service reliability investments are expected to be recovered through the Pennsylvania Distribution System Improvement Charge  If you recall that earlier in 2019  the Maryland Public Service Commission approved our rate case  an Electric Distribution Investment Surcharge and a five year electric vehicle pilot program  while the New Jersey Board of Utilities approved our JCP L Reliability Plus initiative Together  these initiatives position us to improve service to our customers as we enable new technologies and the grid of the future Later this month  we plan to file a distribution rate    base rate case in New Jersey  We will seek to recover increasing costs associated with providing safe and reliable electric service for our customers  along with recovery of storm costs incurred over the last few years  To sum up my discussion of our regulated investments  I want to remind you that after the conversion of the JCP L transmission assets to a forward looking formula rate  more than 60  of our annual investment will now be in formula rates and distribution riders  making our investment profile very transparent Finally  I hope you ve taken the time to review our five year strategic plan and our corporate responsibility report  which were both published to our website in the fall  These reports are an important element of our commitment to provide transparency and it has enhanced engagement with our stakeholders  They also offer a platform to track progress on our goals and strategies  including ESG initiatives such as our carbon reduction target  efforts to build a more diverse and exclusive workforce and our ISS Governance score We are excited to recently earn the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index designation for the second consecutive year  And last month  we were named to Forbes  list of the Best Employers for Diversity  In addition  we are one of only four companies in our sector to achieve the best possible rating in the ISS Governance Quality Score  We will refresh the data in our corporate responsibility report when we publish our annual report next month  and we intend to update the strategic plan later this year to maintain a five year outlook I think you will see that we are continuing to drive FirstEnergy toward our mission of becoming a premier forward thinking electric utility that our stakeholders can trust and believe in  As I mentioned earlier  we are affirming our 2020 operating earnings guidance of  2 40 per share to  2 60 per share  We re also pleased to affirm our expected CAGR of 6  to 8  through 2021 and 5  to 7  extending through 2023 In addition  we are introducing operating earnings guidance of  0 60 per share to  0 70 per share for the first quarter of 2020  Thank you for your time  We had a great year  and we look forward to building on our progress Now  I ll turn it over to Steve for a review of the fourth quarter and 2019 Steven E  Strah    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  It s great to speak with you today  All reconciliations and other detailed information about the quarter are available in the strategic and financial highlights document that is posted to our website  We also posted an updated fact book to the website this morning  which includes additional supporting materials related to 2022 and 2023 such as our capital and load forecasts Now let s review our results  We reported a fourth quarter GAAP loss of  0 20 per share  driven by our annual non cash pension and OPEB mark to market adjustment  I ll spend a few minutes discussing our pension performance later in my comments  Adjusting for special items  fourth quarter operating earnings were  0 55 per share  which is above the midpoint of the guidance we provided on our last earnings call In the distribution business  earnings were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  O M expenses were lower this quarter compared to the same period in 2018  and distribution revenues were higher  This offset the absence of the Ohio DMR and the impact of more mild temperatures across our footprint  Total distribution earnings increased due to incremental rider revenue in Ohio and Pennsylvania  but customer usage decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  both in actual and weather adjusted basis Heating degree days were 2  below normal and 7  lower than the fourth quarter of 2018  Residential sales were down 1 3  on an actual basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  but increased slightly on a weather adjusted basis  In the commercial customer class  fourth quarter sales decreased 4 3  on an actual basis and 3 5  when adjusted for weather compared to the same period in 2018 Finally  in our industrial class  fourth quarter loads decreased 2 4   While shale    while the shale gas sector continues to grow  we saw a sales decline in every other major sector  including steel  automotive  coal and chemical Looking at our load trends for the full year of 2019  We are encouraged to see the stability in the residential sector where we ve recorded two consecutive years of modest growth in weather adjusted sales  However  full year 2019 sales to commercial customers were down 2  compared to 2018  Drivers include weaker economic conditions  energy efficiency and distributed generation measures initiated by customers in the education and food and beverage sectors  and lower usage from the real estate sector related to decreases in new construction While it s widely recognized that the U S  has entered into a manufacturing recession  the impacts of that slump  combined with a couple of large plant closings  resulted in a 1 7  decrease in deliveries to industrial customers for the year Turning back to fourth quarter results for the transmission business  Earnings increased primarily due to higher rate base at our formula rate companies related to our continued investments in the Energizing the Future program  And in our corporate segment  fourth quarter results primarily reflect lower operating expenses in the absence of a fourth quarter 2018 contribution to the FirstEnergy Foundation Before we open the call to your questions  let s spend a moment on a few other financial matters starting with the pension performance and its impact on our future funding requirements  In 2019  our pension plan investments produced a return on assets of 20 3   far exceeding our original assumption of 5 7   This superior plan performance  coupled with the low discount rate of 3 34   produced two outcomes First  our 2019  non cash after tax pension and OPEB mark to market adjustment is approximately  480 million  which is at the lower end of the range we provided in October  Second  our pension plan funding requirements for 2022 and 2023 have decreased significantly  A year ago  our 2022 funding requirement stood at  382 million  As a result of the robust plan returns last year  this has decreased to  159 million  And for 2023  our funding requirement has decreased to  375 million compared to  455 million at the end of 2018 As we indicated during the third quarter  the lower interest rate environment has resulted in a higher pension liability  but our funded status has improved to 79  compared to 77  at the end of 2018  As you know  we normally only mark the pension at year end  but we will need to remeasure it again when FES emerges from bankruptcy  Assuming that they emerge in the first quarter of this year  we anticipate an after tax non cash loss of up to  400 million based on the discount rate and pension performance Finally  our corporate liquidity continues to be strong with  3 5 billion of undrawn credit facilities and approximately  465 million in cash  This cash position  plus a portion of revolver borrowings  will fund the final payment of  853 million to FES upon their emergence  Please keep in mind  2020 will be a transitional year from a rating agency perspective as this final FES payment will impact our credit metrics  However  when you exclude this payment  our 2020 credit metrics will be compliant with the thresholds established by each of the three rating agencies With respect to equity we have no incremental needs through 2021  And as we told you at EEI  we plan to issue up to  600 million of equity annually in 2022 and 2023  The ultimate amount will be determined by a number of factors  including customer load  storm activity  weather trends  pension performance and rating agency metrics Thank you  We re proud of our results in 2019 and we look forward to continuing our strong progress this year Now  let s take your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you  We will now be conducting a question and answer session   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI  Please proceed with your question Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey  thanks  Congrats on a good year  guys Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsGood morning  Greg Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystA couple questions  The    looking at the cash flow disclosure you gave  there are some changes relative to what the outlook look like in the last fact book  But I guess when I unpack it  it looks like the major change is just the delay in the cash payment to the FES creditors and a decision to pay them out in cash  rather than take on that tax note associated with the prior settlement  So  can you just walk through  I know the former is just timing  but the decision making on the latter and why you see that as value accretive Steven E  Strah    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  Greg  it s Steve Starh  So the way you explained it  is exactly what happened  We were planning to make the payment in 2019  assuming an FES emergence at that point  but obviously that didn t happen  It s going to happen here sometime in February  at which point in time  we will fund the cash payment of  225 million and we will also pay what we were previously thinking would be issued as a tax note  We will also pay that tax note in cash And so from an economics perspective  it just makes more sense for us to use cash on hand to pay off that tax note now  rather than have to deal with it by the end of 2022 and refinance it again at that point Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsAnd I ll just emphasize that point  that means we won t be answering questions about FES for the next five years Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystNo  We re all happy about that  Two more questions  The    as it pertains to just  obviously  a lot of moving parts when you think about the  22 and beyond equity    potential equity needs  You ve set up to  600 million  But one of the pieces that looks like it s gotten better is pension performance means future pension contributions are down by a little over  300 million  So all things equal  does that mean that your equity needs are down by potentially up to  300 million Steven E  Strah    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  I would say this  we put a range in there that allows for flexibility for lots of things to change between now and then  The range of zero to  600 million  including the DRIP  is a range that we expect to stay in  I don t think it should be extracted that it will be  600 million every single year  but it will be within that range depending on where we re at when we get to that point Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystAll right  That s a fair not Phonetic  answer  And my final question is  I know this has no direct economic impact on your    definitely it has an impact on your customers  What do you think the Ohio government s response is going to be FERC decision on the MOPR rules with regard to the capacity market  Is it possible that the state of Ohio will consider leaving PJM through FRR Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsI would say that the state of Ohio has already kind of talked about their disappointment with the PJM market and their intention to use the next year or so to look at energy policy for the state  The last time they looked at energy policy of the state was 20 years ago  1999  when Senate Bill 3 deregulated the state  I think there is a lot of disappointment that some of the goals they though would be achieved through that never materialized  I think there were some unintended consequences that happened that they didn t expect to happen And so I think they re going to fully look at everything from how the utilities interact with the Public Utilities Commission  to how we ensure a long term secure supply of generation for Ohio customers  to how we get back to us    the Ohio being a state that has an energy surplus as opposed to a shortfall  I think there is a lot of things they re going to look at  But beyond that  what our intention is  we ll be at the table helping where they want help  providing our guidance where they want guidance  and expressing our views where we feel strongly about certain things should go a certain way Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystDo you feel strongly about FRR one way or the other Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsI don t  I m not in the generation business anymore  So    but I feel strongly that we need to come up with a long term solution for customers that ensures they have adequate  Indecipherable  secure  cost effective generation  not just right now  and I mean it s no  My views on these markets has not changed  A one year capacity signal three years out and the next hourly short run marginal cost signal is no way to do this business for the long haul and they are failing  And so something needs to be done  Whether Ohio decides to step up and do something is up to them  but I do not think the market as constructed today is going to provide the best long term outcome for my customers Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup  Please proceed with your question Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystThanks so much  Hi guys Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsHi Praful Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystHi  So maybe just firstly clarifying something more specific  On Page 11  you have regulatory charges for the fourth quarter in the distribution business  which is being adding    which is adding back about  0 15 of earnings to get to more operating earnings  What specifically does that  0 15 relate to Jason J  Lisowski    Vice President  Controller and Chief Accounting OfficerYeah  Praful  this is Jason Lisowski  Chief Accounting Officer  That is related to a FERC order that reallocated some transmission expenses across our utilities  And as you may recall  in Ohio  we at the time in the past did not have the ability to pass those on to customers  So it ends up being actually a refund and a credit back to our companies  And since in the past  we were excluding that from our non GAAP operating earnings  when you receive that credit  we consistently also excluded from our non GAAP operating earnings Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystI got you  That s helpful  Thank you  And then in terms of longer term growth  the  21 to  23 earnings profile based on the growth that you ve talked about  looks like a 4 5  earnings growth  if I just were to use the math for the last two years  I m assuming some of that is obviously a slower rate base growth and then the equity need  Can you just walk through or help us understand what kind of rate base growth you re assuming for the last two years in the current forecast and like how much dilution you expect was from rate base to EPS Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsI ll answer this  The CAGR that we ve given you for the next five years is the CAGR that we expect to hit  which is 6  to 8  for the first three and then 5  to 7  after that  I ll let Jason try to walk you through the rate base accounting that gets to that  but as I ve told you many times  when you look at our Company from the outside in  trying to align up what you look at with the regulatory accounting that goes on  because it s no longer just the same simple math that it used to be is difficult  But we ll have Jason try Jason J  Lisowski    Vice President  Controller and Chief Accounting OfficerYeah  So  Praful  if you look at the fact book that we released this morning  we actually do show our expected rate base growth both separately for the regulated distribution and regulated transmission through 2023 broken down by each state  And you will see that in 2022 and 2023  there is still growth but that growth does slow down a little bit Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystOkay  Fair enough  I ll dig through that a little bit more and discuss that  And then just finally on the equity needs point  I understand that clearly the pension has helped  so that should help reduce the equity need a little bit  I wanted to understand in terms of balancing other goals right around leverage  holdco debt  what are the key guide posts that we should be thinking about as you think about the equity up to  600 million  what could help bring it down apart from pension  what could help    what could kind of lead to pushing it up  Just a few of those guide posts would be helpful Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsWell  obviously  one thing that could help bring it down is if we eventually see some reasonable load growth throughout our footprint  just a little bit of load growth can have a huge impact  I    we give a range for a reason  I mean what could the performance of the pension plan can continue to affect  what s needed there  It s    I wasn t trying to dodge Greg s question  I can t sit here today and tell you how much equity we re going to recommend we issue in 2022   23   24  it s not going to be more than  600 million  I can confidently say that Praful Mehta    Citigroup    AnalystGot it  Really appreciate it guys  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Please proceed with your question Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  good morning team Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsGood morning  Julien Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  so perhaps just to pick up on a slightly different state and angle  can you talk a little bit more about New Jersey and the Energy Master Plan here  And specifically how do you see opportunities emerging from that and or some of your peers in their respective Clean Energy filings in parallel  I m thinking AMI or otherwise  And then as well  can you touch on some of the commentary in the E P with respect to a reduction or meaningful reduction in gas  And obviously you guys aren t in gas  but conversely how do you think about the electrification implications that seem to be pretty clear in the E P as well  So perhaps such holistically on the New Jersey business  given everything going on  if you don t mind Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsOkay  Well  there s a lot in that question  I was just over in New Jersey last week  I met with three of the BPU commissioners  I met with the governor and his policy team the afternoon after he rolled out the Energy Master Plan  So  I had a lot of opportunity to talk with him and his team in particular  about how I think our Company can help him be successful with it  I think there are opportunities for us to help  particularly in the electric vehicle area  if the state decides to embrace utilities  investing and building out a robust charging network throughout the state I think advanced metering is something the state has to decide what their policy is on  but we ve got a lot of experience now in Pennsylvania with nearly 2 million meters there  and we re going to be rolling out a 0 25 million in Ohio  So what I offered is we re    we ll come to the table and help them understand the pros and the cons  because there are both  that we see to help them make an informed decision on that  I was very honest with him that I have no intention to get into investing in offshore wind  that s not something I see us taking on at this point in time  Talked with him about transmission  And I know the BPU President made some comments about transmission  so I might as well just address those here  because I know I m going to get a question  And his comments were specific to the network transmission service charges in the BGS auction for one company and that company was not us by the way I saw what happened in the market with our stock yesterday after his comments became public  I think the market should be smart enough to figure out that  that involved one company  Should also be smart enough to figure out as he said at the end  that FERC sets transmission rates not the BPU  and they re not going to set different ones for New Jersey than they do everywhere else  It should also be smart enough to figure out that what we ve told you all along is 90  of our transmission capital investment is in states other than New Jersey and 90  of all of our  3 billion of investment is in states other than New Jersey But what I talked to the Governor and his team about is the fact that our transmission plan  if we work together  can be complementary to what he is trying to do with his Energy Master Plan and actually enabling of what he wants to do with his Energy Master Plan  And they were very receptive to that and we agreed to continue to work together to figure out how to make that happen  So all in all  I think FirstEnergy is at the best place that it s ever been in New Jersey  in terms of our relationships  in terms of the things that we re doing  in terms of us being trusted advisors to the Governor s Office on his Energy Master Plan  There was nothing in that Energy Master Plan that scares me in any way  but there are pieces and parts that I think we can help more on  and there s pieces and parts that we don t want to be part of Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystBut just to clarify on that  could this be incremental capital  I know you guys talked about a very specific and committed equity capital plan and financing plan through the forecast period  But I just also hear your comments about helping the state of New Jersey here too Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsThe reason we have a range in this capex plan that we ve communicated is so that we have the ability to have flexibility to move it around state to state transmission to distribution  I m not going to say here and tell you that we re going to add incremental capital beyond the range that we ve given you  And the range that we re giving you is    has got a couple control rods in it  One is our customers  ability to pay and a constant awareness of the fact that without load growth these are going to be rate increases for customers and we have to be careful with that  And the other control rod be in the balance sheet and managing the amount of equity that we re ultimately going to need to do to maintain our credit where we want it and get to that goal be BBB rated with all three agencies So we re going to use this range that we have to satisfy what we re going to execute from a work plan in all five states  I m not planning to change that range in the near term Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAll right  Great  Well  best of luck  Thank you Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsThanks  Julien OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Michael Lapides    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey guys  Thanks for taking my question  Chuck  you only really owned general    regulated generation in one state  West Virginia  Just curious how you re thinking about kind of the potential for kind of changes to the generation fleet  the composition of the generation fleet  Maybe  especially since the state kind of sitting on the Marcellus Shale  whether the economics make sense for the company and the customer to add a little bit more gas fired generation into the regulated mix there  And then obviously  is there a need for kind of an uptick in either renewable or even kind of smart grid on the distribution side capex in West Virginia Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsWell  you make a good straight man  because you can help me reemphasize the point that one of the things that I think differentiates us from many others in our sector is we are a transmission and distribution company buy and large  We have four states that are deregulated  so we don t own generation there  And that creates a risk profile that s very low risk  We don t have the risks that go along with owning massive fleets of generating plants particularly coal and coal waste disposal sites and so forth  In West Virginia  the process is real simple  we re going to file a Integrated Resource Plan in West Virginia by the end of this year We ll share our ideas with West Virginia about where we see their capacity needs being  some thoughts on how to meet that  But those decisions are going to be made in conjunction with the state of West Virginia  And I think that there are opportunities to embrace what s going on with the shale development and they re capitalizing on it with a lot of industrial growth in that state in terms of collection and compressing and so forth Whether they want to capitalize it in terms of generation sources  that remains to be seen  And I don t want to speak for the state of West Virginia  but up until now at least haven t been real welcoming to renewables there  But from a synergy perspective  as we get separation from the whole FES issue and put that behind us  I think investment in renewable generation in a regulated context is something that we need to be thinking about adding to our portfolio  Not deregulated in any fashion  We worked so hard to get to this company that I just said  it s a T D company  low risk  no exposure to markets  that s where we want to stay Any generation we might invest in  there s going to be earning a regulated rate of return just like those two plants in West Virginia do Michael Lapides    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  One other question  totally unrelated  Just curious  can you    what s embedded in guidance in terms of kind of O M growth rates across the distribution business and also at the corporate level Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsWhat s embedded in our guidance is keeping O M flat over that period  So    and so what I ve challenged the team to do is to get more efficient at how we deliver service to customers  We re in the process of rolling out an innovation center at FirstEnergy  We ve got a number of employees who have earned black belts in innovation engineering We re going to put them all into one group  We re going to use that group to help drive innovation throughout this Company as a way to make us more efficient and offset the annual    we d give a this year  a 3 5  wage increase on the average to our employees  about half of which ends up O M  We ve got to find a way to offset  but what s in the guidance period is flat O M throughout that period Michael Lapides    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Starting off of 2019 base or starting off 2018 base and was there anything unusual in 2019 Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsStarting off of the    when we finished FE Tomorrow and finish dealing with our corporate costs  which by the way our T D costs are bottom decile for as far as O M  and our corporate costs are bottom quartile in terms of low being good in both cases  So we ve got this Company very lean and we expect to keep it that way throughout this period Michael Lapides    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Thank you  Chuck  Much appreciate it Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsThank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research  Please proceed with your question Charles Fishman    Morningstar Research    AnalystYeah  Chuck  90  of your transmission now on the one slide you showed was formula base or forward looking  And what gets you to that last 10   Is it a process similar to what we saw in New Jersey  Or    and what s the timing on that do you think Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsWell  it s what s left  That is not forward looking formula rate  it is the former Allegheny system  And yes  the process would be to either eventually merge that into one of our existing transcos or form another transco  But the timing is what is such that we ll do that when it makes the best sense in terms of there will be a crossover point where the investment returns more returns to shareholders in a forward looking formula rate than it does in a stated rate  Right now  he stated rate is better for all of you Charles Fishman    Morningstar Research    AnalystAnd then second question  When we last talked in November  you hadn t finished the planning process  and you wanted to hold off on guidance through  23  As you wrapped up that process  in your mind  was there anything that  I don t know  surprise is probably a too strong of a word  but maybe it was a little different than you thought as you wrapped up that process Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsNo  not at all  I mean  I think  it s very difficult to predict the future five years out  So a lot of what we had to get comfortable with in that planning process is what    what s the world going to look like  not today  but what s the world going to look like in 2023  What s going to happen with inflation  what s going to happen with growth  etc   etc   and bracket those types of things  One thing I can tell you I m confident in is that we re going to execute on the plan that we put out to this company and if it s  3 2 billion or  3 3 billion or  2 9 billion  it s going to deliver the results that we intend to deliver  And by getting to the point where more than 60  of all of it is in formula rates  it s very transparent and easy to calculate  And where we need to have rate cases  we re going to have them Just as I said  we re going to file a rate case probably this month in New Jersey to get that trued up  recover some storm costs that we ve deferred up until now  So our ability to execute on rate cases  we ve demonstrated we can do that too  But it was just really more getting comfortable with a range of outcomes that could happen between now and then  to get comfortable with the CAGR and get comfortable with the equity assumptions  both Charles Fishman    Morningstar Research    AnalystOkay  That s all I have  Thank you Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsAnd the only other thing I d add  and I said this repeatedly at EEI  I m not going to tell you something until I know  The engineer in me is still in there  We got to have the plan and we got to have the numbers work and I know we can execute on it  Which is why I was probably a little slow in getting into a five year CAGR  but that s also what results in five straight years now of meeting or exceeding every single quarter that we ve given you guidance OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank  Please proceed with your question Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    AnalystHey  good morning  everybody Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsGood morning Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    AnalystMy first one  I just want to follow up on the New Jersey questions earlier  I believe  excuse me  in the capex outlook  do those forecasts include some level of spending related to things that were covered by the Energy Master Plan  like energy efficiency  EVs  AMI  And will those buckets be part of the upcoming JCP L rate case filing or would they come later in separate compliance filings or something like that Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsNo  they don t include anything for that  Right now  it s about  175 million in transmission  You know what the IIP is  We re going to round out the first round of IIP  And at some point in time  hopefully you ll see IIP 2 just like you saw LTIIP II in Pennsylvania  And when that comes  again  that s why we have a range of capex  so that we have the ability to have flexibility from state to state and T to D Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  So that would be upside to the current numbers  if they were to be spending on that Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsMight be upside in New Jersey  but it would probably come away from somewhere else  I mean you can count on the capital plan being what I ve told you it is  and we re going to get the CAGR that I ve told you we re going to get  But the pieces and parts of it may move around from state to state Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  And then last  this is just kind of a small one  But in Pennsylvania  you    congratulations on getting the LTIIP II approved in full  My question is on the DSIC Rider  The benchmark ROE was just reduced by 10 basis points  I believe yesterday  to 9 45   Does that apply to your subsidiaries  And if so  can you give any sort of earnings sensitivity  I know that s just came out yesterday  so didn t give you a whole lot of time  But any thoughts on that Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsEileen s on top of it Eileen Mikkelsen    Vice President  Rates and Regulatory AffairsGood morning  It s Eileen Mikkelsen  I m Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs  Thank you  Chuck  Yes  we are aware that the PA PUC reduced the benchmark for the ROE in Pennsylvania yesterday to 9 45  Where that benchmark is used is really relates to our DSIC calculation and four utilities that have not had a base rate case in the last two years  they substitute that ROE benchmark number into their calculation when they calculate their DSIC revenues  So for our four distribution utilities in Pennsylvania going forward will use in our return calculations a return on equity of 9 45   rather than the 9 45  that we ve been using in the past  which really is the 10 basis points across those DSIC calculation s immaterial change to the revenues that will collect under those riders The second thing that that ROE benchmark is used for is really a customer protection to say to the extent that the utilities have earnings in excess of that benchmarks that they report in their quarterly earnings reports  if they exceed that benchmark they will then have to turn off their DSIC recovery until such time as their earnings fall below that  So we ve looked at those numbers overnight  we re confident that it doesn t change our outlook for DISC collections during the planning horizon  I would put a caveat on it to say  we do have a settlement pending before the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission to increase the cap we have in Penn Power So assuming that s approved  we expect to be able to continue to collect DSIC across all of our utilities throughout the planning period Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    AnalystOkay  Great  That s very helpful  You mentioned Penn Power  Is there a potential for Penn Power rate case sometime soon Eileen Mikkelsen    Vice President  Rates and Regulatory AffairsI don t think we re expecting a Penn Power rate case over the planning horizon and largely that s because we were able to reach a settlement with the other parties in Pennsylvania that s pending before the commission to allow us to collect DSIC revenue up to 7 5  of our base distribution rates in Penn Power where for all the other utilities it s capped at 5   So that really allowed us to cover that additional investments through the DSIC Rider and eliminated the need for a base rate case Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    AnalystThat s great  So  Chuck  and is it fair to say that JCP L might be the only rate case through 2023 Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsI d say that s a fair way to look at where we re at today  yeah Eileen Mikkelsen    Vice President  Rates and Regulatory AffairsI would just    again  it s Eileen  I agree with Chuck  Put a caveat on it that we do have an obligation in 2023 to file an additional base rate case in the state of Maryland Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    AnalystRight  Good reminder  Okay  Thank you so much OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Sophie Karp    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHi  good morning Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsGood morning Sophie Karp    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystI had a question on load growth  So you guys clearly mentioned that there s one of the factors that can help offset equity needs or impact you re planning in a way  And despite sort of a strong overall economy  it doesn t seem like we see in a lot of that in Ohio or elsewhere  may be new territories  Could you discuss that a little bit and maybe give us some sense of what you have seen on the ground and what can change that to actually see some positive load growth  Thank you Steven E  Strah    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSophie  this is Steve Strah  And we re conservative in terms of the load growth that we do put into our plan  And right now  I believe we will see more of what we ve seen in 2019 and that is basically flat load growth to slightly declining load growth  But I also just looking at 2019 for a moment  we were down 1 1  and that was slightly lower than our guidance  which was 0 6   So when we estimate it  we re pretty good at estimating where we re going to land  we didn t miss it significantly And in terms of sensitivities  the 1  decline that we saw in 2019 versus the guidance really impacts earnings only about 2   and that s really driven by the residential sector  Our commercial and industrial loads are really    and rates are fixed or having demand rates  which are not as impactful  So right now  we do see the manufacturing recession continuing on in 2020 before we start to see recovery  We re hopeful to start to see that recovery in mid year or a little bit later So right now  I would just say  look forward to flat load growth within our territory  We don t really see that changing significantly Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsSo the only thing that I would add that I think at    in the back half of this planning period that we re talking about  that could be significant is this shell cracker plant in Western Pennsylvania  And empirically as economists look at the world  it s difficult to factor that in  But I just drove over there for a meeting last week  it s due to come online end of 2021  So it s a year and a half away  It won t be a lot of load itself because they re going to self generate with the methane that s a waste product of the cracking process  But the industrial load that s going to pop up  and is already popping up  you re starting to see cranes in the air on other sites  I think can have an opportunity to jump start this economy in Eastern Ohio  Western Pennsylvania  Northern West Virginia And we are now starting to see construction progress on the cracker plant in Ohio too  So the combination of both of those I think can be something that could be a good surprise  and it s difficult to factor into the numbers Steven E  Strah    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would also add  Sophie  lastly  We are encouraged by seeing the two consecutive years of residential load growth  albeit modest  We look at that as being very positive for some of the reasons I mentioned earlier  So I don t want to be too much of a downer or at all Sophie Karp    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystThank you Charles E  Jones    President  Chief Executive Officer and Member of Board of DirectorsAnd look  I mean you re in northeastern Ohio  I

172661,394177,FE,Take 5  Can t miss NFL games in 2019,news,"The NFL s schedule release is like Christmas morning    that is  if after unwrapping all of your gifts  you sat and stared at them for 4 1 2 months before unboxing the goods  With Wednesday night s unveiling  we can finally start circling the calendar  counting the days and drooling over the best 2019 battles to come  You don t need me to tell you to watch the rematches of last season s conference championships    Saints at Rams in Week 2  Chiefs at Patriots in Week 14    but here are a few others you absolutely should not miss  1  Patriots at Eagles    Week 11  Sunday  Nov  17 Not only is this a rematch of Super Bowl LII  a battle of the last two Super Bowl winners and the first meeting between Tom Brady and Carson Wentz  but it s also the next installment of a very strange head to head history  These teams have faced each other just 14 times total  with two of those coming in the Super Bowl  The five meetings since 2003 have pitted Brady against five different quarterbacks  with very odd results  Brady outlasted Donovan McNabb in Super Bowl XXXIX but needed a fourth quarter rally to keep 2007 s perfect season alive against A J  Feeley  of all people  The Patriots rallied from a 10 0 deficit to beat Vince Young     and the  Dream Team  Eagles in 2011  then blew a 14 0 lead at home to Sam Bradford  Chip Kelly   Co  in 2015  as Philadelphia scored three non offensive touchdowns  Of course  Nick Foles   Co  won Super Bowl LII    which featured the most combined yards  1 151  in a game in NFL history    despite Brady throwing for 505 yards and the Patriots never punting  The star power at quarterback is reason enough to watch  The possibility of something strange happening only makes it more fascinating  2  Colts at Chiefs    Week 5  Sunday night  Oct  6 This game is a rematch from January s divisional playoffs  Let s also hope it s the second of many installments in a Patrick Mahomes vs  Andrew Luck rivalry  When Father Time eventually ousts Brady in a 12 round split decision  not only will there be a superstar vacuum to fill  but the battle for AFC supremacy will be more open than it s been in two decades  These two quarterbacks  ahem     Baker Mayfield and Deshaun Watson also would like a word  are the most likely future rulers of the conference  We can only hope Mahomes vs  Luck becomes a rivalry half as historic as Manning vs  Brady  As for meeting No  2  the Colts should be awfully dangerous  Luck is further removed from his lost 2017 season  and a coaching staff that was duct taped together on the fly last January  thanks  Josh McDaniels  has had another year to jell after an outstanding debut season  With former Chiefs pass rusher Justin Houston aboard and Chris Ballard s war chest of draft picks  Indy s defense should make major strides under rising coordinator Matt Eberflus  The Chiefs  meanwhile  have a ton to prove despite an excellent 2018 campaign  Almost no offense that reached the level they did last season has been able to sustain it year after year  while the defense lost Dee Ford and Eric Berry in addition to Houston  3  Rams at Browns    Week 3  Sunday night  Sept  22 This will be the Browns  first time hosting a non Thursday night prime time game since 2015  and their first time hosting a Sunday night game since    amazingly    2008  It s easy to forget because they ve had so little to cheer for in ages  but Cleveland fans are among the most devoted in football  With the Browns  expectations suddenly pointing skyward  FirstEnergy  NYSE FE  Stadium will be electric when the reigning NFC champions come to town  Freddie Kitchens and Mayfield will try to break down Wade Phillips  scheme while hoping Joel Bitonio   Co  can hold up long enough against reigning two time Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald  On the back end  the team that tried to trade for Odell Beckham Jr  last offseason will be tasked with slowing him down  likely with heavy doses of Aqib Talib and Marcus Peters  Meanwhile  Steve Wilks  defense faces one of its toughest tests of the season against Sean McVay  as freakish young star Myles Garrett battles crafty veteran left tackle Andrew Whitworth to get to Jared Goff  4  Cowboys at Saints    Week 4  Sunday night  Sept  29 This might not be everyone s cup of tea  but last year s Thursday night meeting in Week 13 at Dallas was like a bar room brawl you couldn t turn away from  The Cowboys  defense  led by blossoming star linebackers Jaylon Smith and Leighton Vander Esch  battered the previously red hot Saints offense and delivered the first major blow to Drew Brees  MVP candidacy  New Orleans getting robbed of a Super Bowl LIII appearance overshadowed a suspect finishing stretch from Brees  who averaged just 6 7 yards per attempt with seven touchdowns and five interceptions from Week 13 through the postseason  No one is arguing he s washed up  but when the end arrives for quarterbacks  it does so swiftly and with little warning  Jared Cook gives Brees his most dynamic tight end since Jimmy Graham was traded in 2015  but trusted center Max Unger retired  and Mark Ingram is also gone  The Week 4 rematch with Dallas  defense should be an excellent barometer for where Brees stands early in his 19th NFL season  5  Vikings at Chiefs    Week 9  Sunday  Nov  3 It s easy to overlook Minnesota after 2018 went sideways  but the Vikings still have one of the NFL s best rosters  If they can piece together a respectable offensive line  they could be a juggernaut  Most fascinating in this battle is the clash of Andy Reid s offense and Mike Zimmer s defense  Zimmer s unit dictates terms to opposing offenses more than any other NFL defense  using a terrifying front four  finely tuned coverage rotations and a litany of blitzes to punish opposing quarterbacks  But trying to dictate to the Chiefs  offense is dangerous because Reid has so many answers  He routinely creates six  and even five man boxes to run against through spread formations and packaged plays  He also feasts on zone coverage by getting Tyreek Hill inside against linebackers and safeties  
There should be fireworks against Zimmer s aggressive  flat footed zones  but Harrison Smith   Co  should also force Mahomes into a few turnovers    David DeChant  Field Level Media",2019-04-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/take-5-cantmiss-nfl-games-in-2019-1839313,1839313

172664,394180,FE,Pennsylvania governor wants to tie nuclear bailout to joining RGGI,news,"By Scott DiSavino
 Reuters    Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf asked Republican lawmakers on Tuesday to authorize the state to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative  RGGI  as part of a nuclear bailout deal  according to reports from local media and analysts 
Officials at the governor s office were not immediately available for comment 
RGGI is a market based program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in several Northeastern U S  states 
Joining RGGI would create additional costs for several power companies that operate coal plants in Pennsylvania  like FirstEnergy  NYSE FE  Corp s bankrupt FirstEnergy Solutions unit 
FirstEnergy Solutions said it could shut its 2 490 megawatt  MW  Bruce Mansfield coal plant and the 1 808 MW Beaver Valley nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in 2021 unless the state or federal government finds a way to provide more money for the facilities 
One megawatt can power about 1 000 U S  homes 
In recent years  electricity prices have been depressed by cheap natural gas from shale fields  including the Marcellus in Pennsylvania  and increased use of renewable power  This has made some nuclear and coal plants uneconomical  and forced generators to shut several units over the past five years 
FirstEnergy Solutions said it has not seen the details of Governor Wolf s RGGI proposal but said it  applauds  the governor  for continuing the conversation about carbon free energy generation      and  looks forward to remaining part of the discussion and greenhouse gas reduction solution  
Legislators in Pennsylvania have been working on a plan to subsidize the state s nine nuclear reactors to keep them from retiring because they provide thousands of jobs and produce most of the state s carbon free electricity 
That plan  however  did not come soon enough for Exelon  NYSE EXC  Corp s Three Mile Island plant  the site of the worst nuclear accident in U S  history in 1979  Exelon said in May it would shut the one reactor operating there on Sept  30 
The state s other reactors are operated by Exelon at Limerick and Peach Bottom and privately held Talen Energy at Susquehanna 
Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington said they expect Pennsylvania legislators will resume negotiations on a nuclear bailout in the autumn and noted Wolf s comments appear to be an early public nod to negotiations occurring behind the scenes 
Height Capital Markets said momentum to join RGGI is gaining in Pennsylvania but noted it was unclear at this point whether Republicans would be willing to authorize joining RGGI in exchange for nuclear subsidies ",2019-06-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/pennsylvania-governor-wants-to-tie-nuclear-bailout-to-joining-rggi-1901962,1901962
172690,394206,FE,Trump s Latest Plan For Saving Coal Comes From the Cold War,news," Bloomberg     Months into the Korean War  President Harry Truman capped wages and imposed price controls on the steel industry  seizing authority under a newly passed law to take action in the name of national defense 
Now  more than a half century later  Trump administration officials are considering using the same statute to keep struggling coal and nuclear power plants online  according to four people familiar with the discussions who asked for anonymity to discuss private deliberations 
Under the approach  the administration would invoke sweeping authority in the 68 year old Defense Production Act  which allows the president to effectively nationalize private industry to ensure the U S  has resources that could be needed amid a war or after a disaster 
 The security of our homeland is inextricably tied to the security of our energy supply   Senator Joe Manchin  a Democrat from West Virginia  said in a Wednesday letter urging President Donald Trump to employ the statute   The ability to produce reliable electricity is critical to ensuring our nation s security against the various threats facing us today    whether those threats be extreme weather events or adversarial foreign actors  
Trump campaigned on a promise to bring back coal that is increasingly being edged out of the U S  power market by cheap  cleaner burning natural gas 
But the administration has struggled to find an approach that can survive scrutiny from the courts and independent energy regulators  A proposal to subsidize some power plants was unanimously rejected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in January  And doubts have risen within the White House about a request by a FirstEnergy Corp  NYSE FE   subsidiary for the government to declare a grid emergency and guarantee profits for coal and nuclear plants using a legal authority generally reserved for emergencies such as war 
Administration officials are researching the law that Truman invoked on behalf of steel as a possible alternative  The statute classifies energy as a  strategic and critical material  and gives the president wide latitude to protect providers  including by ordering businesses to accept contracts for materials and services  It was previously invoked in 2001 to keep natural gas flowing to California utilities to avoid electrical blackouts 
By contrast  this would be an unprecedented use of the law more typically employed to invest in critical technologies used to develop advanced weapons 
 This would extend the statute far beyond how it s ever been used before   said Ari Peskoe  director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University   This statute did not contemplate the sort of use that apparently now the administration is considering  
The law allows the president to allocate and prioritize contracts for materials  equipment and services  It also empowers the president to provide incentives to modernize and expand the production capacity of critical resources such as energy    including buying equipment for private companies to use 
The Defense Department  for example  bought semiconductor manufacturing equipment so companies could churn out radiation hardened microelectronics used by the military    such a niche market that businesses might not have made the investment on their own  It has also been deployed to fund research and procurement projects in lithium ion batteries  lightweight ammunition and other technologies 
The government also invoked the statute to force telecommunication companies to divulge confidential information about their networks in 2011  And Trump told Congress last June he would use the law to buttress the aerospace industry and prevent shortfalls in the production of a vaccine for military use 
Officials have not decided on precisely how they might use the statute to help coal and nuclear plants    if they even chose to do so  Because the law gives the government such wide discretion  assistance could come in the form of loans and loan guarantees or purchase commitments with the potential for direct payments to facilities  The aid also could be directed toward a single region or specific plants 
Congressional Authority
Congress would have little say in the matter  The administration has to notify lawmakers when the authority is invoked but doesn t need their approval 
The issue is a priority for some of the president s top supporters  including coal moguls Robert E  Murray and Joseph Craft of Alliance Resource Partners  who donated a million dollars to the president s inauguration  And Trump personally directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to find a solution  according to people present for the conversation 
Supporters of the effort argue coal and nuclear plants are essential to delivering reliable  always on power capable of snapping back after intense storms and emergencies 
The push is driven by concerns that electric grid reliability and resiliency are eroding  with the problem worsening since FERC rejected Perry s first proposal  Power generators are expected to retire    or announce the retirements of    16 200 megawatts of coal fired and 550 megawatts of nuclear plant capacity this year  according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance 
Administration officials are trying to find an equilibrium that balances power reliability with potential cost  two people familiar with the deliberations said 
Backers of coal and nuclear power s chief competitors    renewable energy and natural gas    are warning the administration against meddling in the market   Recent efforts by owners of coal fired and nuclear generators for special treatment within electric markets would lead to bad policy and negative implications for gas fired generators   the Independent Petroleum Association of America told Trump s top economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  in a Wednesday letter 
Opponents within and outside of the administration argue it would be just as legally treacherous and politically fraught as the grid emergency declaration FirstEnergy Solutions is seeking 
The Defense Production Act  is written so broadly you could swoop in and save a facility  you could swoop in and save a company  you could swoop in and save a sector  It s the ultimate in flexibility   said Mike McKenna  a Republican energy strategist   That act gives the president an enormous amount of authority  but it s specifically premised on the idea that this stuff is essential to national security    that we re going to war  The problem in this instance is that some might think that an approach relying on the act trivializes national security

172691,394207,FE,Nuclear  coal bailout worth any cost  to keep America free   U S  energy chief,news,"By Richard Valdmanis WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Thursday that bailing out struggling coal and nuclear power plants is as important to national security as keeping the military strong  and that the cost to Americans should not be an issue   You cannot put a dollar figure on the cost to keep America free   he told reporters at a press conference in Washington  when asked about the administration s effort to extend the lives of the facilities  When asked about the cost of a potential bailout  he said he did not yet know   We look at the electricity grid as every bit as important to  national security  as making sure we have the right number of ships  aircraft and personnel   he said   What is your freedom worth   President Donald Trump ordered the Department of Energy  DOE  to take emergency measures to slow the retirements of coal and nuclear power plants  arguing those kinds of facilities can store months of fuel on site and therefore withstand supply disruptions that could be caused by storms  hacks  or physical attacks  The effort fits neatly with the administration s broader agenda to boost U S  fossil fuels production and to save the coal industry  but has been criticized by an unusual alliance of drillers  renewable energy advocates  environmentalists  regulators and grid operators who say it is unnecessary and unfair  Aging coal and nuclear facilities have been shuttering at a rapid pace in recent years  pushed out by cheaper natural gas as well as renewable energy sources like wind and solar   a driving factor in declining U S  emissions of greenhouse gases   The Trump administration considers natural gas and renewable energy vulnerable  however  because gas fired plants rely on pipelines that can be disrupted  and solar and wind facilities only produce energy under certain weather conditions   Perry pointed out that nearly all U S  military bases rely on power from the civilian grid  The DOE is currently studying ways to bail out coal and nuclear facilities  including potentially by mandating grid operators to purchase power from them  Perry said the DOE is examining the costs now  Federal energy regulators rejected a previous effort by Perry to require them to subsidize nuclear and coal plants for providing  resilience  to the grid  That did not stop the coal industry from making new requests for help from the administration  In late March  FirstEnergy s  N FE  FirstEnergy Solutions unit   which runs coal and nuclear power units   called on the U S  energy secretary to use the emergency powers to lift the sectors

172717,394233,FE,FirstEnergy seeks emergency lifeline for U S  nuclear  coal plants,news,"By Scott DiSavino and Valerie Volcovici NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  power company FirstEnergy Corp  N FE  urged the federal government on Thursday to evoke little used emergency powers to help it keep several struggling nuclear and coal fired power plants open  a move critics blasted as an attempt at a corporate bailout  On Wednesday  Ohio based FirstEnergy said it would shut several nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania in the next three years without some kind of state or federal relief  FirstEnergy s FirstEnergy Solutions unit called on U S  Energy Secretary Rick Perry to use the emergency powers to order PJM Interconnection  the regional power grid operator  to negotiate a contract that would compensate owners of coal and nuclear plants for the benefits such as reliability and jobs those units provide   PJM  in response  rejected the need for an emergency order   Nothing we have seen suggests there is any kind of emergency from these units retiring   said Vincent Duane  senior vice president at PJM  calling the problem  fundamentally a corporate issue   A spokesman for FirstEnergy Solutions declined to comment on Thursday about speculation the unit was headed for bankruptcy  but he directed attention to a filing the company made with the Energy Department earlier in the day  The filing included a comment made by FirstEnergy Corp s chief executive  Charles Jones  in February that he would be  shocked  if FirstEnergy Solutions did not file for some type of bankruptcy protection by the end of March  Coal and nuclear power plant operators have struggled in recent years as low natural gas prices as a result of the shale boom have spurred utilities to retire dirtier coal plants  Last year  Perry proposed a plan that would subsidize coal and nuclear for providing what is known as base load generation  which refers to units that run around the clock   U S  regulators rejected that proposal in January and said they would conduct a study on grid resilience  Many grid operators  including PJM  have said they already factor in reliability of their systems and the fuel resources available to generate electricity  Murray Energy Corp  which supplies coal to FirstEnergy and has been lobbying elected officials to keep coal and nuclear plants operating  said it fully supports the request for emergency relief   As a result of FERC s failure  critical power plants will close  thousands of American jobs will be lost  and the reliability  resiliency  and security of our electric power grids will be forever compromised   Murray Energy said in a statement  referring to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission s rejection of Perry s resiliency proposal  FirstEnergy said in November 2016 that it would exit the competitive generation business overseen by FirstEnergy Solutions as natural gas has taken up a greater part of the power load   On Wednesday  FirstEnergy Solutions said it told PJM it would retire all of its nuclear reactors in Ohio and Pennsylvania  totaling 4 048 megawatts  MW   in 2020 and 2021  One megawatt is enough power for 1 000 U S  homes  FirstEnergy said it wants an emergency order because the power grid s reliability is threatened  due to the  premature retirement of plants that have many years of useful life but cannot operate profitably under current market conditions   PJM said  however  that FirstEnergy s assets  have been financially stressed for some time    The Energy Department said it received FirstEnergy s request and will go through its standard review process  It did not comment further  PJM said such a request  if granted  would effectively circumvent FERC  putting it in  uncharted waters    Shares in FirstEnergy closed down 1 1 percent to  34 01 on Thursday  The use of emergency orders related to power generation has been minimal  having been evoked only eight times since December 2000  according to the Energy Department  usually in response to natural disasters or blackouts  Groups that rarely agree on anything condemned FirstEnergy s request  The American Petroleum Institute  API   a trade group for the oil and natural gas industry  said   FirstEnergy s claim that the electric grid would be in immediate danger with these power plant retirements is simply untrue   PJM is responsible for the reliability of the grid and if there is an emergency  PJM already has the tools to respond   API said in a statement The environmental group the Sierra Club said it would sue if Perry issues any order to bail out FirstEnergy   Ratepayers and regulators have already rejected multiple attempts by  FirstEnergy  to bail out these coal and nuclear plants that can no longer compete in the marketplace   Mary Anne Hitt  director of the Sierra Club s Beyond Coal campaign  said in a statement  Other companies have sought assistance from federal  state and regional officials to keep their coal and nuclear plants in service  and some states  including New York and Illinois  have offered subsidies to nuclear plants  These companies argue that the diversification of fuel sources is necessary to keep the power grid operating in the most optimal way  More coal plants are expected to be decommissioned in coming years  and natural gas recently surpassed coal as the biggest source of power generation in the United States

TransCanada s proposed Energy East oil pipeline also faced a setback this month  when the Quebec government filed a motion for an injunction to ensure that the pipeline complied with the province s environmental laws ",2016-03-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/transcanada-in-talks-to-buy-columbia-pipeline-group:-sources-389245,389245

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision

At this time  FirstEnergy has a subpar Growth Score of D  a grade with the same score on the momentum front  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side  putting it in the middle 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook

172844,394360,FE,Earnings Preview  FirstEnergy  FE  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"FirstEnergy  FE  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 87 billion  down 6 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 04  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FirstEnergy 
For FirstEnergy  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FirstEnergy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FirstEnergy would post earnings of  0 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 61  delivering a surprise of  1 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

172908,394424,FE,What Makes FirstEnergy  FE  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at FirstEnergy  FE   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  FirstEnergy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if FE is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this utility company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For FE  shares are up 0 81  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is up 0 29  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 93  compares favorably with the industry s 1 42  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of FirstEnergy have increased 5 34  over the past quarter  and have gained 27 44  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 2 51  and 6 79   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to FE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  FE is currently averaging 3 522 740 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with FE 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost FE s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 56 to  2 59 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period

Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that FE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep FirstEnergy on your short list ",2019-05-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-firstenergy-fe-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200423464,200423464

172963,394479,FE,Earnings Preview  FirstEnergy  FE  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects FirstEnergy  FE  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 97 billion  down 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FirstEnergy 
For FirstEnergy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  20  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FirstEnergy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FirstEnergy would post earnings of  0 48 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 50  delivering a surprise of  4 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is FirstEnergy due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  FirstEnergy Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q4FirstEnergy delivered fourth quarter 2018 operating earnings of 50 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents by 4 17   Quarterly earnings declined 13 7  year over year On a GAAP basis  the company generated earnings of 25 cents  against a loss of  5 62 incurred in the prior year quarter In 2018  FirstEnergy delivered earnings of  2 59  up from  2 17 in 2017 Total RevenuesFirstEnergy generated total revenues of  2 710 million in fourth quarter 2018  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 668 million by 1 6   The figure improved from  2 681 million in the year ago quarter In 2018  FirstEnergy generated revenues of  11 261 million  up from  10 928 million a year ago Highlights of the ReleaseTotal electric delivery increased 418 000 megawatt hours  MWH   or 1 2  year over year  Residential sales rose 0 5  on a year over year basis  Commercial and industrial sales rose 1 7  and 1 4  year over year  respectively  Total distribution deliveries increased by 1 cent per share primarily on the back of higher weather related and industrial usage Heating degree days were up 7  year over year and 7  above normal Financial UpdateFirstEnergy s cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31  2018 were  367 million  down from  588 million as of Dec 31  2017 Long term debt and other long term obligations as of Dec 31  2018 were  17 751 million compared with   18 687 million as of Dec 31  2017 Net cash provided from operating activities in the last three months of 2018  was  852 compared with  1 046 million in the year ago quarter GuidanceThe company  management guided 2019 EPS range of  2 45 to  2 75  whose mid point of  2 60 is higher than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the period of  2 55  Also  the company provided first quarter earnings guidance in the range of 60 70 cents  
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
Analysts were quiet during the last two month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions  The consensus estimate has shifted  5 56  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
At this time  FirstEnergy has a poor Growth Score of F  however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A  Following the exact same course  the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side  putting it in the top 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/firstenergy-fe-up-25-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200399784,200399784
173010,394526,FE,FirstEnergy  FE  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"The market expects FirstEnergy  FE  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  32 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 67 billion  down 22 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FirstEnergy 
For FirstEnergy  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 04  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that FirstEnergy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FirstEnergy would post earnings of  0 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 80  delivering a surprise of  9 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
FirstEnergy appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/firstenergy-fe-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200386942,200386942
173028,394544,FE,Is FirstEnergy  FE  Stock Outpacing Its Utilities Peers This Year ,opinion,"For those looking to find strong Utilities stocks  it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers  Is FirstEnergy  NYSE FE  one of those stocks right now  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Utilities peers  we might be able to answer that question 
FirstEnergy is a member of the Utilities sector  This group includes 121 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of  4  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups  The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured  and the sectors are listed from best to worst 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months  FE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FE s full year earnings has moved 1 46  higher within the past quarter  This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company s earnings outlook is stronger 
Based on the most recent data  FE has returned 1 20  so far this year  At the same time  Utilities stocks have gained an average of 0 59   As we can see  FirstEnergy is performing better than its sector in the calendar year 
To break things down more  FE belongs to the Utility   Electric Power industry  a group that includes 64 individual companies and currently sits at  76 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has lost an average of 0 49  so far this year  so FE is performing better in this area 
FE will likely be looking to continue its solid performance  so investors interested in Utilities stocks should continue to pay close attention to the company ",2019-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-firstenergy-fe-stock-outpacing-its-utilities-peers-this-year-200375697,200375697
173046,394562,FE,FirstEnergy  FE  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at FirstEnergy  FE   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  FirstEnergy currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for FE that show why this utility company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For FE  shares are up 0 88  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is up 1 71  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 2 91  compares favorably with the industry s 3 66  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of FirstEnergy have increased 1 5  over the past quarter  and have gained 19 17  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  6 21  and 4 36   respectively 
Investors should also take note of FE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  FE is averaging 3 961 237 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with FE 
Over the past two months  6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost FE s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 46 to  2 55 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that FE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep FirstEnergy on your short list ",2018-12-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/firstenergy-fe-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200365267,200365267
173048,394564,FE,FE Vs  CNP  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Utility   Electric Power stocks are likely familiar with FirstEnergy  FE  and CenterPoint Energy  NYSE CNP   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while CenterPoint Energy has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
FE currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 66  while CNP has a forward P E of 17 88  We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2 44  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  CNP currently has a PEG ratio of 3 03 
Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P B ratio of 2 81  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CNP has a P B of 3 02 
Based on these metrics and many more  FE holds a Value grade of B  while CNP has a Value grade of C

173240,394756,FE,Is FirstEnergy  FE  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put FirstEnergy Corp    NYSE FE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  FirstEnergy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 99  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 06  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts FirstEnergy s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having trended downwards over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Utility   Electric Power sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 97  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peersWe should also point out that FirstEnergy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 34  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for FirstEnergy stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  FirstEnergy has a P S ratio of about 2 57  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 11 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  FirstEnergy currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  b   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes FirstEnergy a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 3 85  which is far lower than the industry average of 7 25  Clearly  FE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though FirstEnergy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives FE a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen two up and one down in the same time period This has had a solid impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 11 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched upper by 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below FirstEnergy Corporation Price and Consensus
    Despite the bullish estimate revision trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineFirstEnergy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 32  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2017-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-firstenergy-(fe)-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200189749,200189749

Our View

	Amid the ongoing low interest rate environment  cost of capital for capital intensive companies like FirstEnergy has been falling  which is leading to improved credit ratings 

	The regulated nature of the utility industry gives these companies  revenues a high level of certainty  while their domestic orientation shields them from unfavorable foreign currency movements  Keeping with this  FirstEnergy has been making consistent efforts to expand its regulated generation mix  The company has 62 million Mwh committed for 2016 and about 42 million Mwh for 2017 thereby ensuring bottom line stability ",2016-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/firstenergy-(fe)-beats-on-q2-earnings,-revenues-down-y-y-200144980",200144980
173316,394832,FE,Brett Wilson  How To Beat The Big Banks And Build An Energy Powerhouse,opinion,"When a businessman of the calibre of Brett Wilson grants CEO ca an interview  we aren t going to waste his time with softball questions  I think the ex Dragon s Den star  Nashville Predators co owner and co founder of FirstEnergy Corporation  NYSE FE   was a bit surprised with our directness  But as one of Canada s most approachable titans  he generously obliged us with his story of making a mint in Calgary s oilpatch 
The first point Wilson wanted to convey is that there is way more to life than money 
 If it s the single minded pursuit of wealth that drives you  make sure that you don t really care about family  friends or health   said Wilson  a cancer survivor   Just go get the money  pile it up  and jump on that pile and enjoy it  because that s all you ve got  
Brett Wilson was born in North Battleford  Saskatchewan in 1957  He had a comfortable small town upbringing  but even as a boy decided to become rich after hearing his parents occasionally fight about money 
After high school  where he skipped a grade   Wilson became an engineer and soon after moved to Calgary to work in the petroleum industry  The connections he made at school and the hands on experience he gained in Western Canada s oilfields were critical to his eventual success 
 I can t emphasize enough the value of real life experience  
Wilson got an MBA at the University of Calgary before joining the investment business at McLeod Young Weir 
He said his first big score was a life changing business lesson  Wilson paid  25 000 for a 50  stake in a broken oil and gas company that was nearing bankruptcy  The owner sold it to Wilson on the condition he would clean it up 
He spent the next few years selling off its assets and fixing its balance sheet  The experience taught him about land tenure  law  taxes  partnerships  and importantly  brokering oil and gas properties  a highly lucrative field to this day  according to Wilson 
Assets that are under managed and under capitalized are his favourite vehicles for wealth creation   That s often where people don t want to play  because it s too much work and too complicated and ugly  
Wilson spent a few years brokering oil and gas properties before co founding Wilson Mackie   Co in 1991 with Jamie Mackie  then forming FirstEnergy Capital in 1993 with Rick Grafton  Jim Davidson  and oilsands billionaire Murray Edwards 
 FirstEnergy s business model was to back Canadians wherever they went   Wilson said   We wanted to be set up to do it all  cradle to grave  small to large  We provide research  sales and execution  trading  and corporate finance capabilities on par with anybody and we are going to do only one industry and that s energy  
FirstEnergy s founders weren t afraid to invest their own capital  rolling up their sleeves to deal with a diversity of oil and gas property owners  And there were some early successes 
 We were there when Canadian Natural had a market cap of  5 million  and now it s  50 billion  Penn West was one of my largest holdings  I was buying it at 12 5 cents and it hit  35 and was cash flowing  3 per share  I had lots of those stories  
When FirstEnergy was founded  independents had 20  market share  according to Wilson  with the remaining 80  belonging to the big banks  Within a decade  Wilson said the banks had  let their guard down  and those market share figures were reversed  FirstEnergy is now one of the leading energy investment banks in the world 
 I don t think the story has ever been written about how dramatic that shift was  and the balance of power in terms of wealth that was transferred from bank owned dealers to a bunch of independents  
On creating wealth  Wilson said it helps to choose the right industry  He referenced a line from the Harry Potter book series   Men are not known by their abilities  they are known by their choices  
We spoke about mentorship  and Wilson said he learned the most from his colleagues 
 People want to meet their mentors and ask them questions  and I think that s a shame  The learning curve against people who you never meet can be just as steep  You don t need Richard Branson to give you advice  You can read his book or watch his online materials  
On that note  Wilson s own book  Redefining Success  Still Making Mistakes  is available on Amazon  
Wilson retired as FirstEnergy s chairman in 2008 and soon after joined the popular CBC Television series Dragon s Den as a co host for 55 episodes  There he proved himself to be the most compassionate of the Dragons  and he was a good counter to Kevin O Leary  Wilson loved the experience because he got to help a lot of people  and while you can still see him in re runs  he s happy to be done with the show  He currently manages a portfolio of investments that includes a share in the Nashville Predators  a NHL hockey team  and Canoe Financial  a suite of mutual funds 
Wilson still has a few speculative oil and gas investments  He is the largest owner and chairman of Forent Energy  an Alberta wildcatter  and Lightstream Resources  another Canadian energy player  He said there are likely 20 30 energy names in his portfolio 
There is no gold bullion in Brett Wilson s account  Not that he is against owning gold shares  but he prefers productive assets like real estate or operating businesses 
Despite all the excitement Wilson has enjoyed throughout his remarkable career  when asked what he s looking forward to the most  he said it s his next family vacation  Last month  that he is fighting prostate cancer for a second time  We at CEO ca sincerely hope that the fire this dragon breathed into the energy sector will sustain him through this next journey ",2014-11-20,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/brett-wilson:-how-to-beat-the-big-banks-and-build-an-energy-powerhouse-233126,233126
