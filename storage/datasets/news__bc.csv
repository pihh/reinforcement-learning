14874,236389,BC,After Trump rally  equity investors move into healthcare  retailers,news,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    High U S  share prices are pushing Lipper Award winning equity fund managers into the shares of beaten down healthcare companies  retailers and emerging market stocks that they say offer a greater chance for outsized gains  Fund managers from Poplar Forest  Parnassus Investments and Brandes Investment Partners are among the 2017 Lipper Award winners who are concerned about the high valuation of the benchmark S P 500 index  With a forward price to earnings ratio above 18  the index is at the high end of its historical range   Even after tumbling on Tuesday  the index is up more than 10 percent since Donald Trump s unexpected U S  presidential election victory on Nov  8    It s absolutely harder to find stocks at attractive valuations  now than it has been in the past few years  said Todd Ahlsten  lead portfolio manager of the Parnassus Core Equity fund   As a result  Ahlsten said he has been adding to his positions in healthcare stocks such as  Gilead Sciences Inc   O GILD   Allergan PLC  N AGN  and  Novartis  AG  S NOVN   Healthcare stocks had fallen in price on concerns over possible drug price controls ahead of the vote on the Republican bill to repeal and replace President Obama s signature healthcare law  Shares of Gilead Sciences have slumped 5 5 percent since the start of the year  shares of Novartis are up 2 percent over the same time  The vote  scheduled for Thursday  has now been postponed  The S P is up about 5 percent in the year to date   We feel like the rhetoric out there is creating opportunities   Ahlsten said  J  Dale Harvey  portfolio manager of the Poplar Forest Partners fund  said he has been trimming his energy and materials shares exposure and buying into brick and mortar retailers whose stocks have come under pressure as Amazon  O AMZN  continues to expand    Mall based businesses are facing declining traffic  but we re trying to look for the proverbial baby thrown out with the bath water   he said   So far that has been early  but we have a habit of being early   He recently added a position in mall based Signet Jewelers Ltd  N SIG   which is looking to expand its number of freestanding stores  Shares of the company are down nearly 30 percent for the year to date and trade at a price to earnings ratio of 9 7    There s a lot of negativity embedded in its valuation that we think is not warranted   Harvey said   Not every Lipper Award winning fund is turned off by the high valuations  however   Robert Marvin  portfolio manager of the Hood River Small Cap Growth fund  said the recent stock market rally prompted him to buy recreational boat builder Brunswick Corporation  N BC  and recreational boat and yacht dealer  MarineMax Inc   N HZO   Shares of both are up more than 10 percent in the year to date    We re starting to see significant improvement in demand as middle  and upper income consumers feel the wealth effect   he said  Kenneth Little  a co portfolio manager of the Brandes Global Equity fund  said high valuations have left his fund  significantly underweight  the U S   Instead  his fund has been adding positions in emerging markets such as South Korea  Russia and Brazil  with large overweight in energy holdings and healthcare  The fund is focusing mostly on large cap companies such as Russian oil producer Lukoil  Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer SA  and South Korean auto parts maker Hyundai Mobis Co    The U S   broadly speaking  looks pretty fully valued to us   he said  By comparison  in emerging market stocks   if you look through the short term challenges  you have very good companies trading at very attractive prices   he said

Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorGood morning  and welcome to Brunswick Corporation s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call   Operator instructions  Today s meeting will be recorded  If you have any objections  you may disconnect at this time  I would now like to introduce Al Marchetti  senior director  investor relations Al Marchetti    Senior Director  Investor Relations Good morning  and thank you for joining us  On the call this morning are Dave Foulkes  Brunswick s CEO  Bill Metzger  CFO  and Ryan Gwillim  vice president  finance  and treasurer  Before we begin with our prepared remarks  I would like to remind everyone that during this call  our comments will include certain forward looking statements about future results  Please keep in mind that our actual results could differ materially from these expectations  For the details on the factors to consider  please refer to our recent SEC filings and today s press release  All of these documents are available on our website at brunswick com  During our presentation  we will be referring to certain non GAAP financial information  Reconciliations of GAAP to non GAAP financial measures are provided in the appendix to this presentation and the reconciliation sections of the consolidated financial statements accompanying today s results As a reminder  on June 27  2019  Brunswick completed the sale of its Fitness business  Starting with the second quarter of 2019  the historical and future results of this business are now reported as discontinued operations  Therefore  for all periods presented in this release  all figures and outlook statements incorporate this change and reflect continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted  I would now like to turn the call over to Dave  Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Al  and good morning  everybody  2019 was a very successful year for Brunswick and our shareholders  We delivered record earnings for the 10th consecutive year  substantially grew margins  made significant additions to our product portfolio  manufacturing capacity in technology platforms  completed meaningful cost reduction actions and have emerged as the world s premier recreational marine company  Our solid fourth quarter performance reflects the continued successful execution of our marine strategy and reinforces the tremendous confidence we have in the future growth opportunities within each of our businesses  The more favorable retail trends in the U S  persisted in the quarter and  together with planned lower wholesale shipment activity  resulted in us achieving our stated goals in the lower field inventory than 2018 and relatively flat pipelines on a weeks on hand basis  Aside from our updated estimates on tariffs  our views on our 2020 financial goals have not changed  and I have a high degree of confidence that we will execute our strategy and deliver strong shareholder returns in 2020  We started the year off an exciting fashion with a spectacular debut at CES and new product launches at early boat shows  and I look forward to leading Brunswick through further successes in our first full year as an integrated marine powerhouse  I ll now provide some highlights on our segments and the overall marine market  The marine engine segment had tremendous success in 2019  again  posting record earnings and significant margin increases  This was in the face of approximately  25 million of headwinds from unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates in tariffs and partially mitigated by a full year of solid performance by power products  Demand for higher horsepower outboard engines remains particularly strong  especially in the 175  to 300 horsepower categories introduced in 2018 and the 400  and 500 horsepower engines released in 2019  During the fourth quarter  we brought online additional capacity  allowing us to manufacture significantly more of these engines in 2020 with dealers and international channels already seeing some of the benefits in the fourth quarter  We also continue to expand our outboard engine presence in saltwater markets  Our industry leading engine lineup was on full display at the Fort Lauderdale boat show  where we  again  had a leading engine share  and we plan to continue our success at Miami in two weeks  Finally  in December  we announced the formation of the Advanced Systems Group  which is comprised of the power products brands and the Attwood group of businesses  which include Attwood  Whale  Garelick and MotorGuide  Power products continues to perform in line with our expectations and is accretive to the overall growth and margins of the Parts and Accessories portfolio  Brett Dibkey  who joined us at the start of the year from Whirlpool  will be leading ASG that brings a great combination of talent and relevant experience to deliver future growth in these outstanding businesses  In the boat segment  revenue and earnings in 2019 were lower as anticipated  but we are primed for sizable improvement in 2020 due to our new products  focus on operating efficiency and wholesale volume improvements enabled by the lowering of pipeline inventories in 2019 to appropriate levels  Our premium boat brands  including Boston Whaler  Sea Ray and Lund  all performed strongly at retail in their key product categories  Sea Ray also had strong wholesale sales growth with larger  higher content product driving the improved sales  As we discussed on recent calls  Boston Whaler continues to have very strong retail momentum as we exit 2019  However  wholesale sales in the second half of the year faced challenging comparisons versus 2018  In 2019  the business has been leaning pipelines in advance of new product introductions in 2020 compared to strong pipeline increases in 2018 due to the introduction of new rail models  As we enter 2020 with a substantial offering of new products  we anticipate a very strong retail and wholesale performance from this brand in our upcoming year  The Boat business continues to focus on product leadership and expanding operating margins  The cost reduction and organizational initiatives that we undertook in the back half of 2019 are already driving efficiencies and allowing us to fully leverage our scale and drive operational excellence  Sharing knowledge  engineering capabilities  and best practices across brands is enhancing our product and technology development and design excellence while lowering related costs and accelerating time to market  Lastly  Freedom Boat Club celebrated the opening of its 200th franchise location early in the quarter  on its way to a current total of 210 locations and continues to perform as anticipated  Freedom was also named as a top 500 Franchise with the top spot in the miscellaneous recreational business category by Entrepreneur magazine  which is a further testament to the substantial opportunities associated with this business  Next  I would like to review the year to date sales performance of our segments by region on a constant currency basis  excluding acquisitions  In the U S   total revenues were down 4  while international sales in total were up 4   International sales for the engine segment increased by 6  with gains in all regions except Canada  The engine segment performance relates mostly to increased demand for 175  to 300 horsepower engines  Boat segment international sales were down 4   As expected  European sales continue to be lower due to the slower market condition and the supply constraint caused by the transition from a contract manufacturing relationship that we noted at the beginning of the year  This capacity is anticipated to be fully recovered as we exit 2020 as a result of production expansion efforts at our manufacturing facility in Portugal with minimal investment  Finally  Canadian Boat revenue remained flat versus prior year  This table provides some color on the performance of the U S  marine retail market  In the fourth quarter  which comprises only 10  of the total sales for the year  retail trends continue to be slightly ahead of our expectations  For the second half of 2019  retail sales of outboard boats were up 3  while the main powerboat segments were up 1   Outboard engine sales were up 1  for the year  SSI data for the main powerboat segments was down 4  for the year  NMMA outboard engine unit registrations are up slightly year to date with outboards  150 horsepower and above  up 9  for the year  These results reflect the softness experienced in value pontoon and aluminum fish categories in the first half of the year and strength in premium offerings  which is generating dollar growth that is outpacing unit performance  We remain confident in the market environment as we move into 2020  Dealer sentiment is positive with well positioned pipeline inventories and strong early season dealership traffic  We believe that retail unit growth for both U S  and global markets will be flat to slightly positive in 2020 with outperformance of premium offerings  again  benefiting dollar growth  2019 was also a very significant year for capital strategy actions  As anticipated  we completed the remainder of our  400 million share repurchase commitment in the quarter  which  together with the purchase of Freedom Boat Club in May  fully deploys the new proceeds from our fitness sale  In addition  we completed the exit of our defined benefit pension plans  retired  300 million of near term debt through the retirement of our 2021 notes and refinancing of acquisition related debt  raised dividends and invested over  350 million in growth related R D and capital expenditures  Our year end balance sheet position and cash flow generation capabilities continue to afford us the opportunity to deploy capital in a variety of ways depending on market conditions  including for acquisitions  capacity enhancements  debt reduction or further share repurchases  Bill will speak more on our specific plans for 2020 during his outlook section later on this call  I ll now turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our financial performance Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Dave  For the full year  net sales were up 1  versus 2018 with acquisitions providing four points of growth  Operating earnings on an as adjusted basis increased by 6  with solid margin expansion of 50 basis points  We finished the year with an adjusted EPS of  4 33 per share  which exceeded our most recent guidance  This reflected a more favorable tax rate and strong execution by our businesses  particularly Mercury  As anticipated  fourth quarter sales were down 4  with slight decreases in operating earnings and margin  Our operating deleverage reflects the timing of some tariff related activity in 2018  which I will address in upcoming comments  In the marine engine segment  revenue was also relatively consistent with Q4 of 2018 as continued robust demand for higher horsepower outboard engines  especially in dealer and international sales channels  and gains in P A sales led by solid growth at power products were offset by anticipated softness in outboard engines 150 horsepower and below  in sterndrive engines  For the full year  Mercury sales were up 3  with power products contributing 5  of growth  Mercury s adjusted operating margins and operating earnings were also slightly lower in the quarter as comparisons between years were unfavorably influenced by the impact of a tariff exemption received in December 2018  For the full year  adjusted operating margins increased by a substantial 100 basis points  outpacing our expectations  This performance included contributions from power products  improving sales mix and operating efficiency gains  which exceeded the impact of tariffs and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  In the boat segment  adjusted revenues were lower by 15  in the fourth quarter as we completed our planned pipeline rebalancing efforts  For the full year  sales were lower by 6  versus 2018 but were in line with our revised expectations from July  By category in the quarter  aluminum freshwater sales were down primarily due to the planned reductions in value pontoons and aluminum fish products  recreational fiberglass remained essentially flat  and saltwater fishing performance was lower but in line and with our expectations due to the wholesale and pipeline dynamics Dave described earlier  Wholesale units sold in the fourth quarter were down 21  versus Q4 2018 with a 13  decrease for the full year  Average selling prices increased  reflecting a more favorable mix and expanded content on boats  Margins for the fourth quarter and full year decreased versus prior year periods due to several factors  including pressure from the impact of lower volume and production rates  plant inefficiencies due in part to new product integrations  higher retail discounts in previous quarters required a lower pipelines during the second half of the year  the impact of these factors exceeding benefits from cost reduction and operation excellence initiatives  which will also contribute to margin growth in future years  Pipelines are well positioned as we start the year and enter the boat show season  Dealer pipelines ended the year with 36 6 weeks of boats on hand measured on a trailing 12 month basis  which is essentially in line with year end 2018 levels  However  on a unit basis  field inventory is down 7  versus the end of 2018  In 2020  the plan assumes that pipelines will decrease slightly  Our fourth quarter continuing operations GAAP results also reflect the impact of certain items that are excluded from our as adjusted results  And in operating earnings  these include restructuring  exit  impairment and other charges in the quarter totaling  3 8 million primarily related to our previously announced structural cost reductions taken across the enterprise  In addition  we incurred  7 5 million of purchase accounting amortization in connection with the power products and freedom boat club acquisitions  Finally  we recorded  4 9 million of charges related to the legacy s sport yacht and yacht products  Moving to 2020 and guidance for the year  We anticipate diluted EPS as adjusted of between  5 10 and  5 40 per share  taking into account our view of the market  our cost reduction efforts in  19 as well as some of the more recent tariff developments  which I discuss on the next slide  We believe that the four main EPS drivers that we have discussed on our last few calls  namely  the impact from successful execution of our capital strategy  additional 175 plus horsepower outboard engine capacity  normal P A seasonal demand and our diligent management of pipeline inventory levels  each remain intact and support our view on EPS  Our plan contemplates revenue growth of between 6  and 8   operating margin improvements of between 40 and 60 basis points  continuing the favorable margin trends from recent years  Operating expenses should decrease as a percentage of our sales due in part to the full year impact of the cost measures taken in 2019  We are also projecting low double digit percent growth in operating earnings and free cash flow in excess of  3 and     325 million  First quarter revenue growth of low single digits will under index to the full year expectations  This is due mostly to the timing of wholesale shipments in 2019 and the significant reductions in the second half of the year  EPS in the first quarter will increase by high single digit percent versus Q1 2019 mostly due to benefits from 2019 share repurchases  Now moving to tariffs  we anticipate a net impact to 2020 pre tax earnings of between  30 million and  35 million or  10 million to  15 million incremental to the 2019 impact  The incremental impact is due solely to our Wave 1 exemption on the 40  to 60 horsepower engines not being extended into 2020  As you likely know  very few exemptions were extended  We are highly disappointed in this outcome and would note that our non U S  engine competitors import cost is not affected by these tariffs  despite utilizing the very same Chinese supply chain for engine components  Otherwise  there are no changes to our tariff assumptions  We are anticipating Wave 1 through three tariffs staying at the 25  rate and that any Wave 4 tariffs will not have any material impact on our businesses  We are not assuming any additional tariff exemptions being granted  although we do have several Wave 3 exemptions still under review by the USTR  which could total up to  5 million of    in relief if fully granted  On the Boat side  the impact of retaliatory tariffs on boat exports to the EU remains unchanged and incorporated into our plan  We continue to proactively take actions to minimize the impact of our tariffs on our businesses  which are included in our estimates  and we are evaluating alternative manufacturing and supply chain strategies to further mitigate the impacts  I will conclude with an update on certain items that will impact our P L and cash flow for 2020  We are anticipating free cash flow for the year in excess of  325 million  and our free cash flow conversion will approach 80   We expect to use between  30 million and  50 million of cash for working capital for the year and incur between  120 million and  130 million of depreciation and amortization  Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between the 21  and 22  for the year  and the cash tax rate is anticipated to be in the low to mid teens percent range  Finally  including the impact of the  400 million of share repurchases completed in  19  along with planned repurchases in 2020  our average shares outstanding for 2020 will be approximately 79 5 million shares  We will execute our balanced capital strategy in 2020  leveraging our strong free cash flow generation  We plan to retire approximately  100 million of our long term    of our term loan obligations and expect to lower our debt to EBITDA ratio to less than one point five times on a gross basis by the end of the year  Our net interest expense is estimated to be about  65 million for the year  We anticipate spending between 20     200 million and  220 million on capital expenditures throughout the year  including investments in new product in our Engine  P A and premium boat businesses  cost reduction and automation products and additional capacity in our propulsion business  Finally  we plan to return to a systematic approach to share repurchases  and our plan includes  100 million of repurchases in 2020 spread relatively evenly across the year  I ll now turn the call back to Dave to continue our outlook comments Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Bill  I d like to provide some commentary on our new segment reporting  which we signaled on our third quarter call  During 2019  Brunswick implemented a series of strategic and organizational initiatives to sharpen the focus of the company on the recreational marine market and adjacent opportunities  Starting in 2020  the company s strategies are now focused on four business pillars  propulsion  parts and accessories  boats  and business aceleration  As a result  the existing marine engine segment will now be broken into two segments beginning in the first quarter of 2020  the propulsion segment  which will contain both outboard and sterndrive engine businesses  along with controls and rigging products  which are closely associated with our propulsion businesses  and the P A segment  which will contain all of the P A categories  including engine parts and consumables  electrical products  boat parts and systems and our distribution business  Concurrent with this change  our company has also decided to change its measurement of segment profit and loss due to a decision to streamline internal and external reporting practices related to marine engine sold from the propulsion segment to the boat segment  This change in presentation  which is not the result of a change in business practice  more closely follows current market dynamics and provides improved comparability with other boat companies  Consistent with past practice  we have provided select historical information reflecting this new reporting structure in today s Form 8 K  We believe that these changes will allow investors to more clearly evaluate the performance and value of each business  especially the aftermarket focused inn the P A business  which contributes nearly half of the earnings of the corporation  Moving to our outlook by segment under the new structure  2020 is setting up to be a fantastic year for all of our businesses  For our propulsion segment  we anticipate net sales growth for the first    for the year of between 6  to 8  with operating margins that are flat to up slightly versus 2019  We expect earnings growth  even with currency headwinds and the significant incremental tariff impact that Bill discussed earlier  Our top priority for this segment continues to be satisfying outboard engine demand and expanding market share  especially in the greater than 175 horsepower categories enabled by the added production capacity that now our online for higher horsepower engines  We also anticipate additional margin benefits as we satisfy greater levels of demand in the dealer  repower and international channels  We remain focused on developing new platforms and technology for our engines and related control systems and are investing in a robust new product pipeline to enable top line and earnings growth into the future  Finally  we remain committed to delivering improved technology and performance in our sterndrive and inboard lineup of engines  Although a much smaller component of our business versus a decade ago  these products serve a loyal customer base  and it remains our goal to retain our market leadership position in this category  Turning to our parts and accessories segment  We anticipate organic net sales growth of between 4  and 6  accompanied by solid margin improvement  As a reminder  operating margins in this segment were just shy of 20  in 2019 with more than 75  of segment revenues derived from the aftermarket  If you include the controls and rigging business  which is now part of the propulsion segment  operating margins were in the low 20  range  consistent with what we have articulated in the past  We will continue to concentrate our M A efforts in this area as we have the ability to build out our technology stack and fill white space product areas through acquisitions  Potential bolt on deals in this area are generally in the  20 million to  50 million range  which could be funded from free cash flow  The growth of Power Products  which is now part of the Advanced Systems Group as I discussed earlier  continues to outpace the rest of our P A business and should benefit from more normal aftermarket demand and improved OEM outlook in 2020  along with new products and other business opportunities  Our Attwood group  which is the other portion of ASG  also plans to leverage new products and a streamlined operating model to increase margins and earnings this year  We are very excited and confident in the outlook and growth opportunities for this business under Brett s leadership  Finally  our boat business as keenly focused on improving operational performance and completing significant product launches and integrations in 2020  the combination of which should lead to top line growth of between 6  and 8  and strong improvement in operating earnings and margins  Including the change in the reporting segments I discussed earlier  we anticipate exiting 2021 with double digit margins in this segment  In Miami in a few weeks  we will give further information on how we can reach even more aggressive margin targets by the end of our new three year plan  Our efforts in the back half of 2019 to manage pipeline inventory levels put us in a favorable position entering this year with 2020 wholesale sales expected to be    to more closely match retail sales for the year  resulting in top line growth versus 2019  Additionally  our structural cost reductions as well as the strategic actions within this segment that I referenced earlier in the call will both provide benefits to our margin expansion plans in 2020 and beyond  We will continue to expand Freedom Boat Club and execute against its strategic growth strategy  We anticipate adding another 30 locations in 2020 and capitalizing on our synergy opportunities  Notably  for the Freedom fleet conversion to Brunswick Boats and Mercury engines is ahead of plan  and we anticipate strong sales into the franchisee base in 2020  Lastly  as shown in Fort Lauderdale with the launch of the Boston Whaler 315 and 405 Conquest models at CES  where we debuted the Sea Ray SLX R 400e  and in New York with the Whaler 280 Vantage launch  our aggressive new product cadence is generating additional higher margin sales and capturing market share  Although the integration of these new products will likely result in a slight operational headwind during the first half of the year  these new products leverage technology capabilities from across our integrated marine platform that enable users to more easily enjoy their day on the water  Finally  as many of you know  Brunswick exhibited for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020  showcasing our technology on a global stage  We not only launched the new Sea Ray SLX R 400e with our unique Fathom power management system  but our team created a concept helm that illustrated what the future of boating could look like  The exhibit was awarded an A  grade  and we engaged with more than 40 potential partners that are interested in collaboration with us in areas such as artificial intelligence  sensors  autonomy and more  The traffic in our exhibit far exceeded our expectations  and we counted anywhere between 30 and 60 people per minute taking pictures in our exhibit  eight hours a day for four days  We also garnered national media attention and still have more stories in the queue  CES 2020 was so successful that we have already signed up for CES 2021  In case you are wondering  yes  we sold the boats on display  it will be delivered after the Miami boat show  Two people said that they wanted that exact boat  and we have taken orders for several more just like it  In closing  we had record earnings in 2019 and are proud of what we accomplished as a company  but our focus has now turned to 2020 and beyond  We will introduce an updated 2020 to 2022 strategic plan at our Investor Day in Miami on Tuesday  February 11 and hope you will join us for this event  2020 is our first full year of operations as an integrated marine enterprise  We have the best recreational marine brands in the world  the most capable workforce and a streamlined strategy that has positioned us for success in any economic environment  We plan on executing against our strategic plan and delivering shareholder returns consistent with our long term goals  We are confident that you will see that innovation and inspiration on water isn t just a phase  but it s the purpose that separates us and from all other companies in our space and that drives us to be    to deliver the best on water experiences for our customers  which in turn will create and sustain lasting value for all our stakeholders  I ll now open the line for questions  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  And our first question comes from James Hardiman with Wedbush  Your line is open James Hardiman    Wedbush Securities    Analyst Hey  good morning  Thanks for taking my call  It was a strong finish to the year  so I figured I d start with a nitpick here  So inventory three months ago  you said you thought they d be flat to down in terms of weeks on hand  It seems like the retail environment was  if anything  better than expected  They finished up just a fair  What s the difference there  And then as I think about competitive inventory levels  I think that certainly  the checks that we have done would suggest that you guys have been a lot more aggressive maybe than some of your peers  Is there any concern that  that could create sort of a heightened competitive environment here in 2020 Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer James  and thanks for joining us  Yes  I think it s not possible for us to manage inventories down to the nearest 0 1  But I would tell you  given the start to the retail season in 2020  I m pleased that we finished slightly on the upside versus slightly on the downside because I think that we have this potential risk of    it s more of a risk of it s not having enough than there is of having too much right now  So I think we managed very diligently  We managed units down very well  Managing exactly to the ten of a week is probably    is not something we can do  But I think to all intents and purposes  we finished as we planned  and I have no problem with that very slight kind of half a week  I think what we have seen more broadly across our competitors and is good behavior  I think some started a little later than we did coming down  So I don t see  broadly across the industry  that excess inventory of competitors is going to be a hurdle for us going into the year James Hardiman    Wedbush Securities    Analyst OK  And should I interpret the first answer as you feel a little bit better about where demand is likely to go than maybe you did three months ago Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Yes  you should interpret it that way  I think the early season dealer traffic has been good  boat shows have been good and dealer sentiment is positive  So I would say that the season is off to a good start for us  So  yes  so that s a good interpretation  I m glad we are where we are James Hardiman    Wedbush Securities    Analyst OK  Got it  And then I think you essentially answered this  But the incremental tariff on the 40  to 60 horsepower outboards  that request actually got denied  Or have you just not gotten any approval yet  So  I guess what I m asking  is there any chance that  that could come back  It sounds like the answer to the question is no  Is that the way to think about it Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So I think the process  as it turns out  is different every time  And when we first were granted the exemption  the U S  was speaking with companies individually  This time  of this    I think  in several hundred extension requests  only a handful were granted  And the message that we got was that  that was it  So I don t know if we actually finally got our company communication  but the message that we have is that no further exemptions are on the table OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird  Your line is open Craig Kennison    Robert W  Baird    Analyst Good morning  Thanks very much for taking my questions and congratulations on a big year last year  Bill  I had a question on gross margin  Is there any way you can frame gross margin for both propulsion and the P A segment  I know you are not going to give me a precise number  but any light you can shed there would help us build our models Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer Craig  we really don t get to that level of specificity in anything that we report externally  I think we do talk generally about kind of how things may index above or below the boat companies  where I think we have been pretty clear to people  under indexed overall to company gross margins  The propulsion business is more in line  maybe a bit more favorable that    to company margins  And then the P A business  the new P A segment would over index to overall company margins Craig Kennison    Robert W  Baird    Analyst OK  Thanks  And then Dave  a question for you  I mean there have been just so many changes here  including changes in the Boat group  and I m just trying to maybe wrap my head around it  But you have made changes to the aluminum boat growth and then the technology center  I m wondering if we can provide an anecdote or two that ll help illustrate what those changes have created from a product standpoint Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Yes  Craig  and thank you for joining us  too  Yes  I think the way to think about this is that we are continuing to build strong brands  but it s brand focused as opposed to individual businesses  So we see a lot of benefits in consolidating some of the kind of back end operations  if you like  of the closely related businesses to leverage scale and increase the expertise available to all of our brands  So the aluminum boat group  which is Lund  Lowe  Crestliner  Harris  a lot of commonality on our operations  a lot of need to enhance the digital marketing  which is not necessarily possible on individual brand basis but is very possible on a collective basis  So    and then on the value fiberglass side  we formed a venture group to achieve something similar  So this is really about making sure we have strong brands  but we leverage our scale and bring to bear the highest possible of level of expertise through leverage kind of back end operations  if you like  And so on the two brands that we have not done that fully on yet are    or don t intend to do are Sea Ray and Whaler  They have very strong kind of individual operations  But we have put together the fiberglass tech center  which is serving both of those brands  And you will see  possibly already seen  but certainly will see over the next year  the rate at which that tech center can push out new products for both of those brands and others is extremely high  And we have 160 engineers and technicians in that group now  And that s more horsepower than any other company can bring to bear in that kind of product line  So think about it as maintaining strong brands  leveraging infrastructure  improving capability and    but sharing our best practices OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Michael Swartz with SunTrust  Your line is open Michael Swartz    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Hey  Good morning  guys Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Good morning Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer Good morning Michael Swartz    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst David  I just wanted to talk about your commentary around the    your retail expectations for 2020  I think you have said flat to low single digit growth  And just  I guess  a point of clarification  Is that global growth or U S  growth  And now how do you think about the cadence of retail through 2020 Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer Yes  That s a global    it s a global view  So I think  typically  the U S  over indexes  U S  will    Europe will probably under index a bit  but it s broadly global  In terms of cadence  I guess  versus last year  we were  at this point in the year  still anticipating a stronger first half to the year than we actually achieved  So we were still building wholesale  and the retail activity obviously didn t emerge quite as we expected it to  So I think this year will be now a much more balanced year  We go in with lower pipelines  So I think we ll better match wholesale and retail throughout the year this year  Obviously  we ll still be building inventory in the first part of the year to serve the demand of the peak season  but I expect just an overall more balanced wholesale and retail across all our quarters Michael Swartz    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst But just    go ahead Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer I think  Michael  the only thing I d add to that is that I think we are kind of expecting or anticipating more normal seasonality  and 2019 probably didn t have    exhibit kind of normal seasonality  It was a bit more back end loaded than front end loaded  On the retail side  wholesale was exactly the opposite  more front end loaded than back end loaded  So I think as you look at wholesale comparisons   19 to  20  the comps gets to be a little bit more challenging in first half  Back half obviously much more favorable  On the retail side  the performance in the back half of the year was a little bit more    or the front half of  19  a bit more challenged  We d expect maybe the comps to be a little bit more favorable in the first half of the year Michael Swartz    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst OK  Great  That s very helpful  And then just maybe    I think you have given us the total tariff impact you expect for 2020 and then the incremental versus  19  So  I guess how much of that increase was due solely to not getting the your exemptions on the smaller horsepower engines  If I go back to  18  and I think the number was some kind of in the high teens millions as far as that impact  Is that still the way to think about it from just this piece Ryan Gwillim    Vice President  Finance  and Treasurer No  Mike  this is Ryan  The way to think of it is  10 million to  15 million incremental for the year  and it is all related to the 40  to 60 horsepower exemption not being renewed  There s very little difference in volume  There s a little bit of difference in how many engines we had on the way over here and inventory position  So it s within a margin of error  But 10  to 15  this is the best way to think of it Michael Swartz    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst OK  Great  Great  And then  David  I think in your closing comments  you had mentioned on the Boat group  you think you can get the margins back to double digits by 2021  I guess that caught me a little off guard  So maybe    and I m sure we ll get more color in Miami  But maybe give just us a sense of some of the larger levers you can pull getting there  because I and    I think the guidance for this year implies 8 5   so 8 5  plus  So that seems like a pretty big jump Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So I think we have articulated the kind of things that we are doing in the Boat group around a couple of areas  One is  as I referenced with Craig earlier  we have significantly leaned out the Boat group organization  including the management structure  So SG A levels will be also significantly lower  especially as we get into this year and beyond  and we see a full year effect of the actions that we took in the back half of 2019  And then we have a lot going on operational excellence    supply chain management that we will reap significant benefits from in this year and next year as well  And that is    those are progressive benefits that will build over time  if you like  We also have some additional capacity in place that allows us to build more of that higher content  larger boat product that is helpful to margins for us  Of course  in the    just in the last three months  Boston Whaler  which was leaning out its pipelines ahead of product introductions  has already introduced three brand new models  And that is just the start for Whaler  and there s more to come from our other brands as well  So I think a lot of efficiency in operating model  SG A  in our plans and our supply chain and then some very nice new product coming through as well OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Steve Zaccone with JP Morgan  Your line is open Steve Zaccone    J P  Morgan    Analyst Good morning  guys  Thanks for taking my question  Dave  first question was just on the marine industry  following up on the first question today  Where do we stand on the health of channel inventories when you segment value versus premium or maybe saltwater markets versus freshwater markets  And so are all markets pretty stable or are there some areas where maybe inventory is still a little bit high Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer I think that    I think we have done a pretty good job of bringing inventory down in all segments  and I think I mentioned on the last call that what we have been trying to achieve is not just an aggregate number  It is by segment number as far as we possibly can  making sure that our inventories are in line with these anticipated needs for 2020  I would say that the sell through of premium products at the back half of 2019 in retail was probably a little higher than we anticipated  And in some earnings calls earlier  you also probably heard a little bit more about that  But    so I would say that we are below average on premium product  particularly Whaler  but really  we are not in bad shape anywhere now Steve Zaccone    J P  Morgan    Analyst Great  And then just the second question was just talking through the top line expectations for the boat segment through the year  Any help around thinking about performance by specific category  And then one clarification with    in that segment  How much revenue should we be expecting from the business acceleration division  Just trying to figure out what the organic growth rate is for the boat segment versus the guided 6  to the 8  Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer OK  So Bill  do you want to answer the last one Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer Right  I think it s going to be pretty similar to what it was this year  which is a couple of points  Yes Ryan Gwillim    Vice President  Finance  and Treasurer Yes  that s exactly right Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer A couple of points for full year of Freedom Ryan Gwillim    Vice President  Finance  and Treasurer For Freedom Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Revenue acceleration for the boat group by segment  I think Whaler will be particularly strong for us  But our other premium brands  we are anticipating good years for that as well  So we are expecting everybody to contribute here  We    the realignment of wholesale and retail  given our    the wholesale was so far behind retail in the back of 2019 allows a lot of options for    a lot of possibilities across our brands  But I would say the premium brands  again  will be really strong OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Tim Conder with Wells Fargo  Your line is open Tim Conder    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Thank you  And gentlemen  congrats on racking a strong year  Just a couple here  if I may  The Freedom Boat Club  how    you commented that the adoption of Brunswick products is maybe trending a little bit ahead of your expectations  and I think you said also 210 locations or franchises by the end of the 2020 from the current 200  So what do you have built into that 6  to 8  growth that    due to the conversion or a picking up of Brunswick products by    in those locations Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer So yes  Tim  Good morning to you  So we just achieved 210 locations  We are expecting probably another 30 this year  So we ll be up in the 230  240 range by the end of the year  Yes  the conversion rates  we have been very  very pleased  engaging with our franchisees on the very compelling product and service offerings that we can provide and the uptake of both our Boat products and our Engine products has been really very strong  So that s really good  As we mentioned earlier  the fleet size of Freedom is roughly in the 2 500 range  It turns over every kind of two to three years  So you can expect roughly 800 new boats into the franchise every year  and we are expecting to become a significant portion of that  The rate that we ll accelerate will be accelerating more strongly in probably  20 back half of this year and 2021  but we ll make good progress already in 2020  And I m not going to give you an exact number here  but we ll make strong progress in penetrating that 800 this year  both on the Boat side and more on the Engine side Tim Conder    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  OK  No  Helpful  David  And then gentlemen  how would you frame    I mean you narrowed your    the range to your guidance kept your midpoint the same  despite these incremental tariffs being folded in there  But how would you frame  at this point  the upside downside scenarios  Let s just say if the marine industry globally is down 5 or plus 5 versus you are kind of saying globally flat to maybe slightly up  What if we hit that down 5   plus 5   Or is that  5 10   5 40 still achievable or would that fall outside of that range under the down 5   plus 5 scenario Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So yes    so we    as we set our guidance  we go through a list of risks in ops for the year  and we make an assessment  And I think what we have in place here is a very balanced assessment that includes considerations of potential downside and potential upsides to the market in various other factors  So I would say that we    our guidance is robust  and we have considered various other scenarios  obviously not extreme scenarios  but certainly plausible scenarios on the up and downside Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer I think it kind of depends  Tim  of what other things accompany a market adjustment and how much of our portfolio is adjusted  I think we consider some of the opportunities on the premium boat side  high horsepower engines and things like that  not to be potentially as variable as the overall market might be  If the 5  market difference in kind of the value end similar to what we now experienced this year  our ability to manage the cost structure and things like that  I think  is pretty reasonable  and you could stay within that  5 10 area in that sort of scenario but    with things like currency and tariffs and other parts of the market start to get influence and gets to be a little bit more difficult  But I think in general  when we have set a bottom end of the guidance range  we generally have tried to understand what sort of things do we need to compensate for  and so we feel pretty comfortable that we have got a pretty balanced view of that  given what we know today Ryan Gwillim    Vice President  Finance  and Treasurer So one of the    remember    Tim  remember also that when we went back to the dollar that took you from the  4 25 midpoint to the  5 25 midpoint  about  0 40 of that was capital strategy  which is now relatively already completed due to the share repurchases last year  So there s a little bit more certainty on that piece because it relies on our actions that have already been taken Tim Conder    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst OK  OK  Thanks again  gentlemen  See you in a few weeks Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Yes Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Eric Wold with B  Riley  Your line is open Eric Wold    B  Riley FBR    Analyst Thank you  Good morning  guys  A couple of questions  I guess  one  your follow up on the last one around the guidance for 2020  So obviously  you kept the midpoint of the range unchanged with the incremental tariffs being in there  I guess  what was the main factor that    or factors that allows you to kind of absorb that to be the incremental 10 to 15  because obviously now you are giving some better outlook on the sales side  Is the sales growth a little bit more robust than you would have thought  given this    what you have done to the pipeline  etc  or kind of maybe what were the factors that are going to kept that    and will keep that unchanged Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Well  I think certainly there was the unexpected tariff headwind  But if you think about the back half of the year  a lot of things are going very positively and providing a tailwind  I think when we talked to the kind of analyst investment community about that manufacturing expansions that we were doing on Mercury and the extent of them  there was some nervousness about that  But in fact  they went without a hitch  And we added that additional capacity with no issues  We saw retail tick up in the back half of the year  which was positive for us  When we started to get that manufacturing capacity in place  we also started to see clearly the margin benefits in Mercury from being able to serve the    some of the higher margin customers  So that is a validation of part of our strategy  And then our launch of the new boat products has also gone to be flawless in the reception has been absolutely wonderful  We saw this unexpected headwind  But overall  if you think about what I have just described  plus a pretty decent start to the year this year  So I think we are in pretty good shape to offset that Eric Wold    B  Riley FBR    Analyst Perfect  And then just the follow up on the engine capacity  You obviously noted in the capex plan for this year possibly additional expansion  kind of what was added in the fourth quarter around the engines  Is that fully in place  And does it need to kind of ramp a little bit in 2020 or what else could you add this year Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer No  It s fully executed  It was fully executed in the back half of 2019  So we are able to take full advantage as we enter 2020 and as we have entered 2020  Certainly  there s    Mercury is always looking at making its operations more efficient  and so if we need to add more capacity  and we certainly will  But I think we are in very good shape as we enter the season to service all of our customers right now and to go after the Conquest opportunities that have really been in reach  but we couldn t quite get to them because of capacity  So I think the whole Mercury team is very  very excited about having capacity behind it  to go after those additional opportunities OperatorThank you  And our next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital  Your line is open Gerrick Johnson    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Hey  Good morning  Bill  on the new segment reporting  reallocation of operating profit two boats from engines  Can you talk a little bit more specifically about that and what is actually causing that Bill Metzger    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Gerrick  thanks for the question  We    the process that we are following here  we have decided to make an adjustment to the measure of segment profitability  I d say what we are doing now is very consistent with kind of an ex internal reporting methodology that we have followed for quite a while or had in place for quite a while  that we think that it s better reflects market dynamics and comparability to external comps  I think it is really important to note that it s not the result of a change in business practice  I think if you look at what s implied on the company sales  that amount is unchanged  We have had a kind of a parallel methodology internally that we have used externally that kind of reflects business practices that date back to over a decade ago  We are    which maintain consistency with historical practices  But as we sit here today  we have made a decision to streamline and follow this kind of what I would consider to be more current and relevant kind of economics between the Boat and    or between the engine and boat segment  And the new segment change was an ideal time to do this Gerrick Johnson    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst OK  I don t think I still understand  but we can take that off line later  Moving on  on your realignment actions announced last year in June and July  You said you also get about  50 million in annual run rate savings  So are you now still expecting this  50 million  And is all of that being realized in 2020 and how do we face toward that through the year Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So the structural actions that we took in 2019  we expect the full benefit of in 2020  You ll note  I think  that we noted operating expenses down as a percent of sales this year versus last year that    this is despite the fact that we have a full year of Freedom Boat Club expenses  despite the fact that we have put a full variable compensation provision back in and despite inflation  So yes  the structural cost reductions of  50 million we are firmly holding OperatorThank you  At this time  we would like to turn the call back to Dave for some concluding remarks Dave Foulkes    Chief Executive Officer Well  to    thank you very  very much for joining us today  We are very pleased about 2019  not only for the financial results but also because it was a transformational year for us  We are delighted with the way that the company is operating  We are delighted with the foundation that we put in place  both physically  through product  technology  and capacity  but also via our capital strategy  So I enter 2020 with tremendous expectations for our business  We are built to win right now  and it s going to be very exciting new year for us  I cannot wait to share our 2020 to 2022 three year strategy with you guys in Miami  I think you will be just as excited as we are  So I can t wait to see you in two weeks  time Operator Operator signoff  Duration  63 minutesCall participants Al Marchetti    Senior Director  Investor RelationsDave

online sales in the United States totaled  7 5 billion  up 20 5  year over year  Black Friday sales are a preview to customer spending trends for the near term At the same time  consumer confidence levels remain high  thanks to almost a 50 year low unemployment level  scarce layoffs and steady rise in wages  All these will certainly improve consumer outlays as well In fact  in a survey conducted by the University of Michigan  consumer sentiment index rose to 96 8 in November  marking its third monthly gain  This index shows that consumers anticipate inflation  unemployment and interest rates

activities due to trade uncertainties and Trump s visa restrictions that made traveling to America difficult 5 Top PicksThe leisure industry  which falls under the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector

117131,338646,BC,Is Brunswick Corporation  BC  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Brunswick Corporation   NYSE BC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Brunswick Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Brunswick Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 7 over the past five years  In fact  the current level stands closer to the lows for the stock  suggesting that it could be a superb entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 6  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Brunswick Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Brunswick Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Brunswick Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 1  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  This makes the stock undervalued from the P S aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Brunswick Corporation currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Brunswick Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Brunswick Corporation is just 0 58  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 5  which is far better than the industry average of 8 4  Clearly  BC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall While Brunswick Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of F  This gives BC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite disappointing  The current quarter has seen ten estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen five downward and one upward revision in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 7 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Brunswick Corporation Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBrunswick Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish Zacks Industry Rank  Bottom 41   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988  the Zacks system has more than doubled the S P 500 with an average gain of  25  per year  With compounding  rebalancing  and exclusive of fees  it can turn thousands into millions of dollars This proven stock picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing  You can apply it to your portfolio starting today ,2017-09-06,Zacks Investment

in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Brunswick Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 0  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Brunswick Corporation s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Brunswick Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Brunswick Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Brunswick Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 1  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 6 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  the stock is trading somewhere around its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Brunswick Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Brunswick Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Brunswick Corporation is just 0 8  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 5  which is far better than the industry average of 16 1  Clearly  BC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Brunswick Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B  This gives BC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen twelve upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 6 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Brunswick Corporation Price and Consensus    This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term   Bottom LineBrunswick Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 32   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two  years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Brunswick Corporation Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without

pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 32  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Brunswick s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Leisure and Recreation Products industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 81  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Brunswick has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 73  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Brunswick stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Brunswick has a P S ratio of about 1 11  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  BC is exactly at the mid point of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Brunswick currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Brunswick a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Brunswick is just 1 05  lower than the industry average of 1 44  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate   Clearly  BC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Brunswick might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives BC a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to nine lower  while the full year estimate has seen eleven up and no down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 1 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Brunswick Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBrunswick is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 9  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our

117177,338692,BC,A Look At North America s Oil And Gas Plays,opinion,North America is not a  Ponzi scheme  as some analysts and executives claimed back in 2009  Here are some chilling excerpts 1  The word in the world of independents is that the shale plays are just giant Ponzi schemes and the economics just do not work  an analyst from IHS Drilling Data  an energy research company  wrote in an email on Aug  28  2009  2  And now these corporate giants are having an Enron moment  a retired geologist from a major oil and gas company wrote in a February 2011 email about other companies invested in shale gas  3  They want to bend light to hide the truth  Money is pouring in from investors even though shale gas is inherently unprofitable  an analyst from PNC Wealth Management  an investment company  wrote to a contractor in a February 2009 email  Reminds you of dotcoms  I do not know whether these analysts are bow in the jobless claims list after such grossly failed statements  Shale plays are acquisition targets as they have been profitable and thus  they are here to stay  As no article has been released yet to capture all the transactions between the foreign suitors and the North American operators  this one will summarize all the M A activity during the last two years  The North American oil and gas plays get hotter every month Canadian Based Acquisitions1  South Korea s state run Korea Gas  Kogas  signed in 2010 an agreement with Canadian independent gas producer Encana  ECA TO  to jointly develop three unconventional gas fields in British Columbia  BC   Canada  Kogas paid almost C 7 30 per acre and acquired a 50  interest in the fields  Kogas would invest U S  1 1 billion over the next five years to jointly develop 720 square kilometers in Encana s Montney and Horn River shale plays in northeastern BC 2  In 2011  the South African Sasol  SSL  purchased a 50  net working interest in the Canadian Talisman  TLM TO  Montney assets for C 1 05 billion  Sasol had also purchased a 50  net interest in Talisman s Farrell Creek Montney properties west of Fort St  John in December 2010  The Canadian Terra Energy    which also holds a significan parcel  130 000 net acres  of Montney land  pointed out at its corporate presentation that Sasol paid a whopping C 38 000 per acre for this liquids rich Montney land  If we compare this deal with the aforementioned deal of KOGAS  we conclude that Montney land s value rose big in just one year  3  Sinopec  SHI   China s biggest refiner  agreed to buy the Canadian Daylight Energy  DAY TO  for C 2 2 billion  US 2 1 billion  in cash  gaining Canadian oil and shale gas reserves in its largest acquisition in late 2011  The state owned Chinese company offered C 10 08 a share for the Calgary based Daylight which was a 70  premium than Daylight s average price during the past 20 trading days  The takeover gave the Beijing based company access to more than 300 000 acres of land in areas rich with oil and natural gas 4  Malaysia s state owned oil and natural gas company Petronas agreed to buy the Canadian Progress Energy resources  PRQ TO  for C 4 8 billion in its biggest deal  as it moves to export Canadian gas from Progress s Montney land to Asia  Petronas offered C 20 45 a share for Progress Energy  77  more than its close before the deal  Including convertible debentures  the deal is valued around C 5 5 billion  Calgary based Progress Energy  Progress is the largest holder in the Montney shale gas area of British Columbia 5  The Chinese oil producer CNOOC  CEO  expanded its footprint in North America s energy market with a  15 1 billion acquisition of Nexen  NXY   a Canadian company  Nexen s assets in North America include exploration and development in the Gulf of Mexico and shale oil development in British Columbia  Nexen also has operations in the North Sea off the coast of Great Britain and off the coast of Nigeria 6  The Indian Reliance Industries inked joint ventures with U S  based Chevron  CVX   Carrizo  CRZO  and Pioneer  PXD  in 2010  Acquisition of shale gas assets has been a significant venture for RIL and in hopes of transforming itself into a global oil and gas developing enterprise in the coming years  Reliance is on the lookout for additional global opportunities and for extending a hand of partnership to leading oil and gas developing firms of the world  By adding reserves of natural gas trapped in overseas shale gas assets  Reliance will be able to add to its domestic fuel output substantially  The billionaire Mukesh Ambani who leads RIL is eying shale gas assets in the resource rich regions of Canada currently  after having successfully acquired and developed similar shale gas assets in Pennsylvania and Texas in the U S  last year  RIL  one of the top prospects  is presently studying Canadian shale gas assets and evaluating the possibility of likely partnership with its energy firms  7  ExxonMobil Corp   XOM   through its subsidiary ExxonMobil Canada Energy  signed an agreement to acquire Calgary based oil and gas exploration and production firm Celtic Exploration Ltd   CLT TO  from Fidelity Management   Research Co  and other investors for  2 9 billion in cash on Oct  17  2012  The Canadian Celtic Exploration Ltd  holds leases in Alberta s gas producing Duvernay and Montney formations U S  Based Acquisitions1  With the acquisition of Chesapeake  CHK  assets in the Fayetteville Shale   4 75 billion  in early 2011 and the acquisition of Petrohawk   12 1 billion plus  3 billion in debt  in 2011  BHP has joined the ranks of non U S  companies buying up shale resources in North America  This way  BHP decided to diversify from minerals and mining into oil and gas  Essentially  with the acquisition of Petrohawk  the Anglo Australian BHP has acquired acreage in the gas rich Haynesville Shale  225 000 net acres  and Lower Bossier Shale  120 000 net acres   a condensate wet gas position in the Eagle Ford Shale  332K net acres   and an oil rich position in the Midland and Delaware Basin  325 000 net acres  combined   As of their most recent investor presentation  Petrohawk had proved reserves of 3 4 Tcfe with an additional 27 4 Tcf plus 406 Mmbc plus 495 Mmbngl of risked resource potential  One last important item to note is that BHP not only bought Petrohawk s assets but also their people and technology  Petrohawk has been one of the innovators in shale gas drilling and with the acquisition  BHP quickly moves ahead of the learning curve 2  The Norwegian Statoil  STO  also announced recently the acquisition of Brigham getting unconventional oil expertise as Brigham operates in the Bakken formation of North Dakota  The deal was an all cash tender offer of all outstanding Brigham shares at  36 50 a share totaling  4 4 billion  Statoil gains a top position in arguably the premiere unconventional oil play in the U S  Over 3 000 Bakken wells have been drilled since 2004  with 98 being Brigham operated  The Brigham Williston Basin position entails 235 200 net  core development  acres and an additional 140 600  future development  acres  In their Oct  5 presentation Brigham noted 794 net remaining locations in their core area  Statoil will be busy for years in the Bakken  even with wells per year at 140  Much has been made of the Statoil technical expertise and how the Brigham technical culture is a good fit  Drilling info data also shows Brigham s 30 day peak oil rate is 80  above the average  The Brigham type curve shows a peak monthly oil rate of 514 BOE D 3  The Chinese giant CNOOC has done two JVs with Chesapeake  In 2010 it bought a 33  position in Chesapeake s Eagle Ford shale position for  1 1 billion  Then in 2011 it added a 33  stake in Chesapeake s Colorado acreage in the Niobrara shale for  1 3 billion 4  In early 2012 Devon Energy  DVN  signed a JV agreement with the Chinese petrochemical company Sinopec in a  2 5 billion deal that gives Sinopec a one third stake in five U S  emerging plays  These include the Mississippi Lime  Niobrara  Utica  Tuscaloosa Marine  and Michigan plays  Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration   Production Corp  a unit of Sinopec  will make a  900 million cash payment upon closing of the deal and pay  1 6 billion in the form of a drilling carry  Devon expects the entire  1 6 billion designated for drilling costs to be spent by the end of 2014  Through 2012  the companies expect to drill about 125 wells in the five plays  5  The latest JV agreement of August 2012 involves Japan s Sumitomo Corp  in a  1 4 billion deal  The agreement entitles Sumitomo to a 30  stake in 650 000 net acres in the Permian Basin prospective to the Cline and Midland Wolfcamp shale  Sumitomo has agreed to invest in the non operated interests of the project  including leases  existing wells and facilities  Drilling activities are expected to last over a 15 year period  while the entire project life is estimated to be more than 30 years  This will enhance the company s capital efficiency  future returns and overall financial strength  according to Devon Energy CEO  John Richels  The transaction is expected to close in late September when Sumitomo agreed to pay  340 million in cash and another  1 025 billion in a drilling carry  which would cover 70  of Devon s capital requirements  This is not the first U S  JV in which Sumitomo has been involved  In 2009  Sumitomo was the first Asian company to participate in shale gas development in the Barnett  The next year  Sumitomo also moved into the Marcellus  striking up a JV there  6  Another  landing  on a U S  based property took place few weeks ago when a Chinese company paid  27 5 million and two Indian ones paid  82 5 million for a 10  and a 30  stake  respectively  in Carrizo s  CRZO  Niobrara land  Haimo Oil   Gas LLC  Haimo   a subsidiary of Lanzhou Haimo Technologies Co  Ltd   a company formed under the laws of the People s Republic of China  will acquire an undivided interest in approximately 6 000 net acres located primarily in Weld and Adams Counties  Colo   along with associated infrastructure and production of approximately 185 Boe day for an all cash payment of  27 5 million  Oil India Ltd  and Indian Oil Corp   which bought the 30  stake  said it intends to invest another  230 million over the next several years to develop the Niobrara acreage  Following the closing of these transactions late in the fourth quarter of 2012  the joint venture interest ownership participation in Carrizo s Niobrara development activities will stand collectively at 60  Carrizo  30  OIL IOCL and 10  Haimo The Canadian Oil Sands Are Out Of FavorApart from the 2011 deal when the Chinese CNOOC spent  2 billion to purchase the Canadian oil sands operator OPTI Canada and the Sinopec  4 65 billion agreement to buy a stake in Syncrude Canada in 2010  the M A deals favor oil and natural gas over the expensive oil sands of Canada The Asian state owned oil companies are planning in a very holistic way for energy demand over the next few decades  and North American gas is cheap if a company wants to add reserves  Oil sands projects are too big in scale  in terms of advanced investment and the slow pace of return and scale of the infrastructure building  as they will require C 23 billion this year in investments  according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers  This is why the foreign companies are holding off on oil sands purchases but are eying Western Canadian natural gas reserves as well as conventional oil deposits instead to quench current supply shortages  said Wenran Jiang  a University of Alberta professor and adviser to the Alberta government on Asian investment  Price discounts for Canadian heavy crude  made from oil sands bitumen  when compared to prices paid for Brent  the international benchmark  are also working against oil sands investments  U S  energy companies ConocoPhillips  COP   Marathon Oil Corp   MRO  and Murphy Oil Corp   MUR  said recently they are all considering divesting oil sands assets amid industry concerns about project cost overruns and discounting of Canadian crude prices as export pipeline capacity is squeezed All that being said  the consolidation of the oil and the natural gas assets in North America is ongoing  and the question is   Who is the next acquisition target  Disclosure  Long Second Wave Petroleum  SCS TO   Terra Energy  TT TO  and Tuscany Intl Drilling     All companies are from the Canadian Stock exchange ,2012-11-06,Value
