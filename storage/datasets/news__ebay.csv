217996,439512,EBAY,NYSE Parent No Longer Considering eBay Merger,news,"Just days after the informal negotiations were revealed  Intercontinental Exchange  NYSE ICE   the parent of the NYSE  has said it is no longer interested in pursuing an acquisition of eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   
Having defended its pursuit of the online marketplace to investors during its earnings conference call who were apparently less than thrilled  the stock exchange operator said it was no longer interested in a deal  
 Based on investor conversations following today s ICE earnings call  ICE has decided to cease exploring strategic opportunities with eBay   it said in a statement  But that s OK  because eBay apparently wasn t interested in selling itself anyway 

Just an exchange of ideas
eBay has been under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value to sell parts of its business  Just days ago it published a letter calling on management to divest its classified ads business so that it could  return to its roots in targeting its historical core buyer universe of  self expressionists and treasure hunters   
eBay has been in turmoil for some time and is without a chief executive officer  which would make it a prime target for a takeover effort  But that doesn t mean it wanted it 
According to ICE CEO Jeff Sprecher   Curiosity  and the fact that we know people there  led us to open a dialogue  And that s kind of the end of the story   since the pitch apparently fell on deaf ears 
eBay s stock is down by 4  in morning trading while shares of ICE are up by a like amount  a reversal of when the news broke and the tech stock s investors were heartened by the news and ICE investors aghast ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psiu3,2079343

218005,439521,EBAY,Can EBay  EBAY  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering eBay  EBAY   which belongs to the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this e commerce company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 6 38   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  eBay came out with earnings of  0 67 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 65 per share  representing a surprise of 3 08   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 62 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 68 per share  delivering a surprise of 9 68  
Price and EPS Surprise

For eBay  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
EBay has an Earnings ESP of  4 90  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 28  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-ebay-ebay-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200501181,200501181

What s Next for eBay 
While eBay has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for eBay was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

218013,439529,EBAY,Why eBay Stock Fell Wednesday,news,"What happened
Shares of eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  took a hit on Wednesday  falling as much as 5 1   As of market close  however  the stock was down 4 5  
The pullback in the online marketplace specialist s stock price comes despite eBay s better than expected earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2019  The decline is likely primarily due to the company s softer than expected outlook for its first quarter 2020 revenue 

So what
eBay s fourth quarter revenue fell 2  year over year to  2 8 billion  This was in line with analysts  average forecast for the metric  Non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share of  0 81  however  was ahead of a consensus estimate for  0 76 
eBay said active buyers across its platform rose 2  year over year to 183 million  But the tech company s total gross merchandise volume fell 5     or 4  on a constant currency basis    over this same timeframe 
Now what
Looking ahead  management said it expects first quarter revenue between  2 55 billion and  2 60 billion  This range is below analysts  average forecast for revenue of  2 64 billion during the period  Management forecast non GAAP EPS between  0 70 and  0 73  This compares to an average analyst estimate of  0 70 ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/polhv,2071074

Before we get there  let s take a closer look at eBay s latest quarter  starting with its headline numbers 

Data source  eBay  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
 

Adjusted for one time items  eBay s non GAAP  adjusted  earnings from continuing operations fell a more modest 2  to  661 million  And thanks to the company s ambitious stock repurchase efforts    including 28 million shares bought back for  1 billion alone in Q4    eBay managed to increase its adjusted earnings per share by 15  to  0 81 
By comparison  both the top and bottom lines compared favorably to the midpoints of eBay s own outlook provided in October  which called for revenue of between  2 77 billion and  2 82 billion and adjusted earnings per share of  0 73 to  0 76 
The trends underlying these results were mostly encouraging  active buyers increased 2  year over year  remaining steady from last quarter  to 183 million  And revenue would have been flat had it not been for the negative effects of foreign currencies  eBay s marketplace platforms  gross merchandise volume  GMV  also fell 5  as reported  down 4  on a currency neutral basis  to  22 billion  translating to revenue of  2 2 billion  down 3  as reported and 1  at constant currencies  
eBay also continued to advance its younger strategic growth initiatives  The company s new Promoted Listings service saw revenue soar 73  year over year to  136 million  with more than 1 1 million sellers promoting  advertising  over 320 million listings in the holiday quarter    up from one million active sellers and 300 million listings in the third quarter  On the managed payments side  eBay has now processed more than  2 billion of gross merchandise volume for nearly 25 000 sellers  up from  1 1 billion last quarter  
Meanwhile outside of the core marketplace segment  classifieds platform revenue rose 3  as reported  6  at constant currency  to  269 million  and StubHub revenue grew 2  to  321 million  
That said  in a culmination of a months long strategic review process to determine the future of its non core subsidiaries  eBay also reached a deal during the quarter to divest StubHub to global ticket marketplace specialist viagogo for  4 05 billion  That transaction should close by the end of the  current  first quarter of 2020 
Perspective on guidance
 As we enter 2020  our priorities are clear    we will continue to drive revenue through our growth initiatives  deliver more seller tools  improve the buyer experience by leveraging our structured data foundation  all while driving more margin expansion   said eBay CEO Scott Schenkel   We believe these efforts will position us for sustainable  profitable long term growth and I am excited by the opportunities ahead  
For the first quarter of 2020  eBay anticipates revenue of between  2 55 billion and  2 60 billion  the midpoint of which would represent roughly flat organic currency neutral growth from last year  That should translate to GAAP earnings per share of  0 50 to  0 53  and adjusted earnings per share of  0 70 to  0 73  By comparison  most analysts were looking for Q1 earnings near the low end of that range  but on higher revenue of  2 64 billion 
As such  eBay sees full year 2020 revenue of between  10 72 billion and  10 92 billion  good for organic currency neutral growth of 1  to 3   with adjusted earnings per share of  2 95 to  3 05  Keep in mind  however  that this outlook assumes all current subsidiaries  including StubHub  will be in place for the entire year  Here again  Wall Street was modeling lower earnings of  2 86 per share  but on revenue right at the top end of eBay s guidance range 
In the end  while eBay is doing an admirable job expanding margins and propping up its bottom line  it s obvious the market is bothered by its top line headwinds as other online shopping platforms like Amazon com continue to enjoy enviable growth  As long as that dynamic holds true    that is  until eBay shows more tangible progress toward fulfilling its promise for  sustainable  profitable long term growth     I suspect eBay s share price will remain under pressure ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pp33e,2072165

218018,439534,EBAY,eBay Earnings Show Worsening Volume Trends,news,"Investors had low expectations heading into eBay s  NASDAQ EBAY  fourth quarter earnings release last week  While integrated e commerce giants like Amazon com and Walmart have been enjoying robust sales growth  the online marketplace has struggled with losses  in part due to state tax law changes that effectively raised prices on many of its products 
Last week  eBay announced results that did little to change that overall weak operating picture  The company also projected another year of sluggish growth  but robust cash generation 
Let s dive right in and see what the report had to say 

Sales trends weakened
eBay remained a powerful force in e commerce during the holiday season  with its marketplace ranking second in online retailing traffic  Yet the business failed to improve on the weak operating trends that shareholders witnessed through most of 2019  Growth in its buyer pool fell to just 2   in fact  after having held at 4  through the last four quarters 
Sales volumes declined in both the U S  and international segments  too  with the 8  domestic slump representing a new low  On a global basis  organic growth slowed to 1   versus 3  in the prior quarter and 5  a year ago  Major pressures included the rollout of new state tax collection requirements and eBay s decision to scale back on inefficient marketing channels 
On the bright side  the company achieved good growth in its promoted listings program and its payments processing  These wins offset the falling sales volumes to keep revenue inching higher 
Solid profit trends
The news was better on the financial side of the business  eBay managed to reach its profitability goal for the year  with operating margin ticking up to 29 3  of sales from 29 2   That success was supported by steadily increasing seller fees as the company capitalized on its many improvements to the selling experience 
Cost cuts played a big role  too  with marketing expenses diving to 28  of sales in Q4 compared with 32  a year ago   I am proud of how well our teams have executed   interim CEO Scott Schenkel said in a press release   and the innovative solutions we have provided for our buyers and sellers   Executives also highlighted the fact that eBay s robust cash flow supported the return of  5 5 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividend payments 
A busy year ahead
eBay is still hunting for a permanent CEO to lead the company through its next growth phase  and investors can count on its  4 billion sale of StubHub to close around mid 2020  In the meantime  the tech giant s operating outlook is conservative  The company predicts organic growth between 1  and 3   which implies continued struggles with negative volumes  especially in the U S  market 
Its financial outlook is a testament to its efficient  asset light sales model  Earnings are projected to rise by 4  to 8  this year as eBay generates around  2 3 billion of free cash flow representing over 20  of its revenue base 
Those metrics  plus the extra cash raised from its StubHub sale  will give management plenty of resources it can direct toward the business and to stock buybacks and special dividends  But investors aren t likely to gain confidence in this stock until they see concrete signs of stabilizing volume trends in the core marketplace business ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqz9d,2075652

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is eBay due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  eBay Surpasses Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q3eBay reported third quarter 2019 non GAAP earnings of 67 cents  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents  The reported figure also improved 19 6  year over year Net revenues of  2 65 billion also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 64 billion  The top line was flat on a year over year basis  up 2  on an FX neutral basis  The company witnessed strong performance by its Classifieds platform during the reported quarter  Further  eBay experienced strong momentum across its managed payments offerings  which processed over  500 million worth of payments during the third quarter However  StubHub volume failed to exhibit year over year growth which affected eBay s gross merchandise volume  GMV  eBay s shares have plunged almost 8  in pre market trading which can be blamed on the disappointing fourth quarter guidance Nevertheless  the company s introduction of tools  advanced features and seller protections is likely to aid its momentum among customers and sellers in the near term Revenues and GMVIn the second quarter  the Marketplace platform accounted for  2 1  down 1  year over year on a reported basis and up 1  on an FX Neutral basis  Further  Marketplace GMV was  20 5 billion  down 5  year over year on a reported basis and 2  on a FX Neutral basis StubHub contributed  1 2 billion of GMV  flat with the year ago quarter level  It generated  306 million of revenues  up 5  on a year over year basis The Classifieds platforms performed well during the quarter  contributing  265 million to revenues  up 4  year over year on a reported basis and 8  on an FX Neutral basis Total GMV of  21 7 million in the third quarter was down 4  year over year on a reported basis and 2  on an FX neutral basis During the quarter  global active buyers customers increased 4  from the year ago period to 183 million Margins and IncomeIn the third quarter  eBay s gross margin was 76 4   down 60 basis points  bps  year over year Adjusted operating expenses of  1 49 billion increased 0 3  from the prior year quarter  This was due to the 1 9  and 14 1  respective hike in product development and general   administrative expenses Non GAAP operating margin was 26 6  in the third quarter  up 20 bps year over year Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Sep 30  2019  cash equivalents and short term investments came in at  3 1 billion  down from  4 5 billion as on Jun 30  2019 Further  eBay s balance sheet is highly leveraged  with a long term debt of  7 2 billion at the end of the third quarter The company generated  1 billion of cash from operating activities and had free cash flow of  913 million during the reported quarter  It made dividend payments worth  115 million GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of 2019  eBay expects revenues within  2 77  2 82 billion Non GAAP earnings are expected within 73 76 cents For 2019  the company expects revenues between  10 75 billion and  10 80 billion  indicating FX neutral growth of 2 3  Adjusted earnings per share are expected within  2 75  2 78

information about risks  uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent periodic reports on Form 10 K and Form 10 Q and our earnings release from earlier today  You should not rely on any forward looking statements  All information in this presentation is as of January 28  2020 and we do not intend and undertake no duty to update this information With that  let me turn the call over to Scott Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Joe  Good afternoon  everyone  As I mentioned last quarter  our focus was to deliver our Q4 and full year commitments  execute on our growth initiatives of managed payments and advertising  improve the buyer experience and seller capabilities and make progress on our portfolio and operational reviews  For  20 and beyond  we would assess how to deliver for our buyers and sellers while ensuring focus    we focus investments to serve our customers and shareholders Let me walk you through each of these in more detail  Specific to our Q4 commitments  volume was in line with our expectations  down 4   while organic revenue was at the high end of our guide  up 1   Margin was strong at over 29   inclusive of our ongoing investment in managed payments  Non GAAP EPS was  0 81  up 15   substantially better than expected  In addition  we reached a deal to sell StubHub to viagogo for  4 05 billion  while following a disciplined process that led to a favorable valuation For the full year 2019  GMV was down 2   while organic revenue growth was 3   at the high end of our January outlook  Non GAAP earnings per share grew double digits each quarter and was above our guidance and we drove strong productivity  allowing us to reinvest in the managed payments  while delivering one point of margin accretion Additionally  as part of our operating review  we announced plans to further reduce expenses to reinvest in growth initiatives and improve profitability  The net of these actions is expected to yield at least two points of margin accretion over the next three years  Finally  we returned  0 5 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and our first ever dividend  Since separating from PayPal  we have repurchased approximately 35  of shares outstanding net of dilution For the year  GMV declined primarily due to two headwinds  First  we indicated that we would reduce marketing that was not activating buyers with high lifetime values  while reducing near term GMV and buyer growth  this also drive a    drove a higher take rate and better profitability  The second was the implementation by US states of internet sales tax  This rollout happened faster than anticipated and affected small businesses and consumer sellers requiring marketplaces to collect and remit on their behalf  We expect this headwind to continue until we lap a fully rolled out US internet sales tax landscape We remain hopeful and are advocating that the US will take a national approach to simplify compliance requirements and reduce the burden on small businesses  While dealing with those volume headwinds  organic revenue grew five points faster than GMV  much of which came from our growth initiatives  managed payments and advertising Regarding managed payments  we continue to make great progress on our journey to transform our ecosystem  Since launch  we have processed more than  2 billion of GMV for almost 25 000 sellers on our payment rails  While our pricing has been discounted to report    to reward early participation  to date  sellers have saved almost  10 million in fees and they have more options on how and when they get paid As we exited the year  our US volume approached the limit permitted under the operating agreement  while in Germany we ramped from 0  to 3   faster than our US ramp  We remain confident in realizing an incremental  2 billion in revenue and  0 5 billion of operating income in 2022 Advertising continues to drive revenue growth  In Q4  Promoted Listings delivered  136 million of revenue  up 75   Over 1 1 million sellers promoted more than 320 million listings in the quarter  For the year  Promoted Listings revenue double and helped us reach our plan of more than  700 million in total advertising  While we have started to lap significant acceleration from a year ago  we still expect double digit advertising revenue growth going forward  This performance was supported by deeper integration into listing flows and the seller hub  which increased adoption In addition  ad conversion was up due to improved algorithms  which utilize structured data to enhance search ranking  We remain on track with our plan to build a  1 billion advertising business Over the course of 2019 we improved the buyer experience by increasing the collection and use of structured data  We collected more aspect data from sellers in fashion and home categories by making it easier to see what buyers were searching for in the listings flows and the seller tools  When sellers uploaded that data  these structured data in rich listings make search better and convert faster  This additional data contributed to a improved merchandising algorithms and promoted listing relevance in search We also improved our seller hub over the course of the year  In addition to the Terapeak integration  one feature we launched with seller initiated offers where a seller can engage individual buyers with better deals  This feature has grown to over 1 million offers per day with pricing options and an easy to use automated experience We are pleased that we delivered on our 2019 commitments  As we enter 2020  our priorities are clear  We will continue to drive revenue through our growth initiatives  deliver more seller tools  improve the buyer experience by leveraging our structured data foundation  while driving more margin expansion  Managed payments will reach an important milestone in July when our operating agreement expires and we will be ready to scale    to rapidly scale additional countries and corridors while delivering a better customer experience For advertising  we will provide sellers more tools to optimize their ad spend  We expect this will increase conversion and improve pricing without adversely impacting the buyer experience  For sellers  we will expand insights and data in the seller hub  while improving our guidance capabilities  We will also remove friction from the consumer selling experience  particularly on mobile  For buyers  we will build better vertical capabilities that will start in a few categories and scale across the platform With features such as payments for high dollar items with escrow and clear item condition definitions  We will also focus on improving buyer trust through increased shipment tracking in our international markets  All of these experience will    all of these experiences will leverage aspect data  which will lead the benefits in search recall ranking and relevance  We also plan to collect more data in electronics  fashion and home and garden to increase the overall aspect data population While delivering on these better experience for customers  we will drive further margin expansion by simplifying our structure  controlling cost and reducing ineffective marketing spend  For buyer focused marketing  we will rebalance spending between acquisition retention and frequency Finally  there are two topics I would like to proactively address  First  regarding the portfolio  Our primary objective is to maximize shareholder value  We evaluate each business in our portfolio for long term synergies and value creation opportunities  When we take action like with StubHub  we utilize a consistent set of guiding principles  including value to eBay shareholders  speed of execution  certainty to close and operational simplicity Our Board and leadership team continue to operate with these guiding principles and we anticipate having an update to share about our Classifieds business by the middle of this year  We appreciate that our employees continue to maintain focus in a time of uncertainty about what the future structure of Classifieds might be  While everyone is excited about the opportunities it could bring Second  regarding the CEO search  The Board is actively conducting a process with the support of a search firm and is considering internal and external candidates  In the interim  the leadership team has the full support of the Board and we continue to make changes to better serve our customers  employees and shareholders  Over the past few months  we have reprioritized our product roadmap  reallocated marketing investments and simplified our structure  By elevating our largest on platform marketplaces regions and global marketing organization to the executive leadership team  we are increasing focus on the marketplace business  which is where we see the biggest value creation opportunity Our top 2020 priorities remain clear  deliver our growth initiatives  provide more seller tools  improved buyer experiences  leverage our structured data foundation  all while delivering margin expansion  We believe these changes will result in a better balance of sustainable growth and profitability that maximizes long term shareholder value  Our teams are excited about the challenge and look forward to delivering on these commitments Now  let me turn it over to Andy to provide more details on our financial performance  Mr  Cring Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Scott  I will begin my prepared remarks with our Q4 financial highlights starting on slide four of the earnings presentation  In Q4  we generated  2 8 billion of revenue   0 81 of non GAAP EPS and  672 million of free cash flow  while returning  1 1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends Moving to active buyers on slide five  We have 183 million active buyers  representing 2  year on year growth  This is a two point deceleration from Q3  driven in part by reduced marketing spend that was driving growth in buyers with lower engagement and a higher churn than we expected Moving to slide six  In Q4  we enabled  23 3 billion of GMV  down 4   decelerating two points versus the prior quarter  In the US  we generated  8 9 billion  down 8   while we delivered  14 4 billion internationally  down 1  Moving to revenue on slide seven  We generated net revenues of  2 8 billion  up 1  organically  We delivered  2 3 billion of transaction revenue  up 1  and  539 million of marketing services and other revenue  down 5   inclusive of a seven point headwind from the sale of brands4friends Turning to slide eight  Our Marketplace platform GMV was down 4  in Q4  decelerating two points versus the prior quarter  US GMV was down 9   driven by a six point impact from internet sales tax and four points from the continued reduction and redistribution of marketing spend  The impact of internet sales tax in Q4 was three points worse than Q3 as 11 more states  including California and Texas went live in October International GMV was down 1   decelerating two points versus Q3  primarily driven by lower consumer confidence in the UK from uncertainties surrounding Brexit and a reduced on platform marketing spend  Total Marketplace s revenue was  2 2 billion  down 1   decelerating two points from the prior quarter  Transaction revenue grew 1   a three point deceleration  the gap between revenue and GMV growth continues  The five point gap in Q4 was driven by three factors  Over three points from promoted listings  nearly one point from category mix effects and nearly another point from the continued growth in managed payments Looking forward  we expect the contribution of payments revenue to significantly increase in the second half of 2020  leading to revenue growth remaining at higher levels than GMV growth until fully scaled Marketing services and other revenue was down 17   decelerating four points versus Q3  The year on year decline is driven by 13 points from the sale of brands4friends and the continued reduction of third party ads  Marketplace segment margin was 32   up nearly one point year on year  primarily due to reduced marketing and continued cost leverage  partially offset by our investment in managed payments  For the full year  the Marketplace platform generated  85 5 billion of GMV  down 2   and  8 6 billion of revenue  up 2  Turning to slide nine  StubHub GMV was down 5   decelerating five points from Q3  mostly from the weak event landscapes    landscape in concerts and theater  StubHub revenue grew 2  year on year versus 5  in Q3  Transaction revenue was down 2   a two point deceleration  driven by volume  partially offset by a higher take rate from pricing changes and event mix MS O has more than tripled year on year for the fourth straight quarter  delivering  16 million of revenue in Q4  Most of StubHubs MS O revenue was first party sales  which represents    which provides buyers access to unique and exclusive inventory and insurance for purchase tickets StubHub segment margin was 22   down nearly four points  primarily driven by investments in our first party business and consulting costs  partially offset by lower marketing spend  For the full year  StubHub delivered  4 7 billion of GMV  down 1  and  1 1 billion in revenue  growing 4  Moving to slide 10  In Q4  Classifieds revenue grew 6   decelerating two points  Our German businesses continued strong double digit growth  driven by our market leading horizontal  eBay Kleinanzeigen and our vertical motors platform Mobile de  Phonetic   In addition  we are delivering strong growth in verticals across the portfolio The quarter on quarter deceleration is primarily driven by continued headwinds in horizontal display advertising across our markets outside of Germany  Segment margin for Classifieds was 43   down one point year on year  For the full year  Classifieds generated nearly  1 1 billion of revenue  up 9  versus the prior year Turning to slide 11 and major cost drivers  In Q4  we delivered non GAAP operating margin of 29   this is up 10 basis points year on year  inclusive of a full point of investment in managed payments and additional pressure from the growth in our first party inventory programs in Korea and StubHub  More than offset by reductions in marketing and the divestiture of brands4friends Cost of revenue was up 160 basis points year on year as a percentage of revenue  driven by scaling managed payments and our first party inventory programs  partially offset by the divestiture of brands4friends Q4 sales and marketing expense was down over three points versus the prior year  primarily driven by a double digit reduction in marketing and promotional spend in our Marketplace on platform business  While increasing year over year investments in our Marketplace off platform businesses Product development costs were up 70 basis points from investments in managed payments and in Classifieds to expand our vertical offering  G A was up one point  mostly driven by portfolio and operating review costs and our continued investment in managed payments  For the year  operating margin was 28 2   up one point and in line with our original 2019 full year guidance Turning to EPS on slide 12  In Q4  we delivered  0 81 of non GAAP EPS  up 15  versus the prior year  Our seventh consecutive quarter of double digit non GAAP EPS expansion  The non GAAP EPS growth was driven primarily by our share repurchase program  a lower tax rate and operating efficiencies  partially offset by FX and our investment in managed payments  Favorability versus our guidance in October was mostly driven by continued cost control and an end period tax benefit  For the year  we delivered 22  growth in non GAAP EPS  primarily driven by our share repurchase program and expanding operating leverage GAAP EPS for the quarter was  0 69  down 14  versus last year  The decrease in GAAP EPS is mostly driven by a higher tax rate as we lap a 2018 deferred tax adjustment  partially offset by gains associated with the Adyen warrant and share repurchases  As always  you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation Moving to slide 13  In Q4  we generated  672 million of free cash flow  down 39   mostly driven by timing of both working capital and cash taxes  We had another strong year of cash generation  finishing 2019 with nearly  2 6 billion of free cash flow  a 27  increase year on year  driven by lower cash taxes  improved working capital and lower capital expenditures Moving to slide 14  Our capital allocation strategy and key tenets and targets have not changed  For the quarter  we ended with cash and investments of  3 8 billion and debt of  7 8 billion  In Q4  we repurchased nearly 28 million shares at an average price of  36 19 per share  amounting to  1 billion  We ended the year with  2 2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining Turning to slide 15  In July  we shared progress on our capital allocation plan for 2019  Looking at that same view today  we have delivered against all the markers we set out for the year  We initiated and executed our first ever dividend  We completed  5 billion in share repurchases  we ended the year with cash of  3 8 billion above our year end target of  3 5 billion  driven by our over performance on free cash flow  And we maintained our BBB rating while delivering on our stated ratio targets of 1 5 times net debt and below 3 times gross debt to EBITDA Moving to full year guidance on slide 16  The 2020 guidance we are providing assumes our current portfolio  including StubHub  is in place for the entire year  We will provide updates as appropriate moving forward  I also want to provide a little more context on the impact of internet sales tax  Throughout 2019  as states implemented marketplace responsibility to collect sales tax  our sellers and our volume were negatively impacted  In each state  we saw an immediate drop in volume  followed by relatively stable growth rates in the months that followed  We expect growth to recover as we lap the launch dates in affected states  An early data from the states that launched in January of 2019 shows that recovery Given these dynamics  we expect a negative impact of internet sales tax to be modestly larger in the first half with more states launching and then start to taper off in the second half as we lap quarters where a larger number of states went live in 2019  Please refer to the appendix of the earnings deck for additional details on the impact of internet sales tax on our US Marketplace business throughout 2019  including the timing of one state launched With that as background  we are projecting 2020 revenue between  10 72 billion and  10 92 billion  growing 1  to 3  on an organic FX neutral basis and minus 1  to plus 1  on an as reported basis  We anticipate two points of growth to come from the continued ramp of managed payments and one point from advertising  which we expect to be approximately  800 million in 2020  Underlying this guidance  we expect Marketplace year over year volume to declined low single digits  consistent with our 2019 performance  As an incremental point of internet sales tax pressure will be offset with improvements in conversion We expect StubHub to deliver low single digit revenue growth  And in Classifieds  we expect similar top line growth to 2019  We anticipate the stronger US dollar and the disposition of brands4friends to negatively impact 2020 revenue by approximately  200 million compared to 2019  We plan to deliver additional operating margin expansion  while we invest in the long term growth of our business We expect margin of 28 5  to 29 5  for the year  which at the midpoint represents an increase of 80 basis points versus 2019  This margin expansion will be driven by continued marketing optimization  focused product and technology investments  best in class corporate functional costs and more effective procurement  partially offset by approximately one point from our investment in managed payments and currency headwinds  We expect non GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 15 5  to 17 5  With regards to capital allocation  our guidance implies approximately  1 5 billion of share repurchases in 2020  inclusive of dilution offset  In January  our Board approved a 14  increase to our quarterly dividend  raising it to  0 16 per share  The dividend will be payable to shareholders of record as of March 2nd with a payment date of March 20th  Our Board has also approved an additional share repurchase authorization of  5 billion with no expiration  We have not made any assumptions in this guidance for the use of StubHub proceeds  Should the deal close in Q1 as anticipated  You can expect that we will deploy that cash in a manner consistent with our capital allocation tenets We are projecting non GAAP EPS of  2 95 to  3 05 per share  up 4  to 8   This includes the impact of modest top line growth  additional margin leverage and the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program  Growth is partially offset by our investment in managed payments and approximately seven points from the combination of a stronger US dollar  less interest income based on lower cash balances and a higher tax rate as certain benefits impacting 2019 won t repeat  We expect free cash flow of  2 2 billion to  2 4 billion  which assumes capital expenditures in the range of 4  to 6   Full year GAAP EPS is projected to be  2 18 to  2 28 per share Turning to slide 17  For Q1  we are projecting revenue between  2 55 billion and  2 60 billion  growing minus 1  to plus 1  on an organic FX neutral basis  It s important to note that given the second half ramp of managed payments following the end of the operating agreement and the lapping of the internet sales tax headwind that we expect our second half performance will reflect higher growth rates for volume and revenue compared to the first half  We expect non GAAP EPS of  0 70 to  0 73 per share  representing 4  to 9  growth  EPS growth is driven primarily by the combined effect    benefit of lower share count and operational growth  partially offset by investments in managed payments In addition  there are four points of headwinds from the combination of a stronger US dollar and less interest income based on lower cash balances  partially offset by a lower non GAAP tax rate  We are expecting GAAP EPS in the range of  0 50 to  0 53 per share in Q1 In summary  while 2019 volume growth was challenged  we delivered on our financial commitments and our growth initiatives  while laying a strong foundation for 2020 and beyond  We ramped managed payments according to plan and scaled better buyer and seller experiences  including launching in a second market  We delivered strong advertising revenue including triple digits within promoted listings  In 2019 we delivered a point of margin expansion despite pressure from lower volume and our investment in managed payments  We executed a comprehensive operating review and are on track to deliver at least an additional two points of margin expansion over the next three years We continue to return capital to shareholders  initiating our first ever dividend and we repurchased  5 billion of our stock  We continue to make progress on our portfolio review  divesting brands4friends and reached an agreement to sell StubHub at a favorable valuation  We ve reorganized the leadership and operational teams to deliver better outcomes in our Marketplace on platform business  increasing focus on our customers and speed of decision making  We entered 2020 focused on our top priorities  managed payments  advertising  providing more seller tools  improving buyer experiences and leveraging our structured data foundation  As we navigate through a period of lower volume growth  our plan is to deliver continued revenue and earnings growth  margin expansion and a consistent capital allocation strategy to maximize shareholder value And now  we d be happy to answer your questions  Operator Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  The first question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead  your line is open Heath Terry    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  I was wondering if you could give us just a    if you could just give us a sense of the guidance as we look at 2020  Is there a    is there a way to kind of disaggregate the impact  both of the internet sales tax which you guys have given us a lot of information on  which I think we all appreciate  But some of your initiatives around focusing more on what you see is being kind of the core eBay revenue or the core eBay businesses and sort of chasing what    I think in the past you kind of described as being less profitable revenue as you look to sort of focus more on sort of the higher value or core eBay experience  Is there a way to disaggregate sort of the impact that that s having on guidance or the impact that  that s having on the growth that you re guiding to for this year And then  as we think about sort of the process around the Classified side of the business  you ve in the past talked about sort of the complication of pursuing anything less than a full sale of the asset  And I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of an update on sort of your thoughts around  as you ve gotten further into this  sort of what would make sense along those lines as well  Thank you Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerSure  Heath  it s Andy  I ll start with a couple of answers on guidance and then I think  Scott will kick in on the Classified side  It s    I think what I tried to point out in the script  and as you think about the volume guidance being relatively consistent year to year in the low single digit for Marketplaces  It will have a very different dynamic half  to half  The first half of the year with IST really at full ramp will look more like Q4 and the second half of the year will start to    will start to accelerate a little bit as we lap out of some of those states When you elevate up and you look at that on a full year basis  we go from about a little over a point of IST impact in 2019 to something a little over a point of it or two points of impact in 2020  So an additional point of pressure from IST or two full points of negative volume pressure from IST in  20  So that s how to think about that And then on the less profitable revenue piece  We continue to refine how we allocate the marketing spend  And I think similar to the IST dynamic  it won t be drastically different impact  19 versus  20 where we feel like we will have roughly a point of negative impact from continued refining    continuing to refine how we allocate the marketing spend and eliminating some of the lower ROI spend Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Heath on the sale of Classifieds  look  it s    as I think everyone understands  it s a great business and a wonderful space  We ve got one of the leading  if not  the leading asset in the industry  And this is about shareholder value creation  So  at this point  I would not exclude any option  Although it s unlikely that we would pursue an option of divesting platform by platform  which a lot of people have reached out on that  That s not really in our    I think our best interest or in line with maximizing shareholder value creation  But it s completely doable and we re looking at all those options  And as I said  in fact  I have an update on that by mid year Heath Terry    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat  Thank you both OperatorYour next question is from Eric Sheridan of UBS  Please go ahead  your line is open Eric Sheridan    UBS    AnalystThank you so much for taking the questions  Maybe two if I can on the marketing piece  How far long are you on the marketing optimization against your goals of multiple years  Are you talk about continuing to reduce exposure to the lower ROI channels  Just want to get a better sense of like the linearity going forward through  20 and beyond of how you ll sort of accomplish those goals And then  with the growth headwind you might be facing in the first half as you characterized it as the two half type year in 2020  Any thoughts around leaning into some of the paid marketing channels that are delivering for you  And sort of how did you have first half  second half component to the marketing expenditures in 2020 or how we should think about that  Thanks so much guys Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Eric  this is Scott  I would characterize that 2020 marketing costs is coming down approximately in line with the same as we came down in 2019  And so  we don t expect material headwinds in growth  but it will be reducing our underlying marketing spend  But within that  for sure  we will be reallocating  as I mentioned  And that would include reallocating into a paid search to help    to help growth where we think it makes the most sense and where the returns makes sense as well  Next question or a follow up OperatorYour next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Baird  Please go ahead  your line is open Colin Sebastian    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThank you  First  I guess on the pricing experiments with sneakers  I m wondering what you re seeing there in terms of listing activity and would determine if that s a model that could work in other categories outside of shoes  And then  maybe as a follow up on the marketing spend  but more specifically on the sequential plateauing of active buyers  Since    I think in past quarters  you guys have indicated that this is an important KPI in terms of the health of the platform overall and potential future growth  Are there any specific efforts geared at reaccelerating the number of active buyers  Thank you Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerFirst on sneakers  Yeah  look  it s an interesting question and certainly interesting in terms of what we did in December  As you might know  our online marketplace has one of the widest and most    and most unique set of inventory of sneakers out there  And we have a history of experimenting with different types of selling promotions across different markets  And in this case  what we announced in December was a sneakers promotion  that was a continuation of our practice of experimentation  It s in two markets and in sneakers over  100 And so  what we re looking for is really how does the monetization change as you think about no final value fees in sneakers over  100  but there is other dynamics at play here  including our first party ads and another dynamics where we re trying to look at conversion and accelerated active buyers in those categories And so  to date we ve seen some added benefits  not only with additional promoted listings  but also with additional listings by sellers  activity by buyers and GMV  And so  as we look at that and then consider what we re going to do with the product  it gets pretty interesting from here  And we ll see where we go from here  But right now it s a very small scale  but very interesting experiment Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think the only thing I d add to that  Scott    to your point  It s one category in two markets  but it s a way we cannot  Phonetic  really highlight the breadth and depth of the inventory we have across this competitive vertical  So feel good about that  And then active buyers Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerLook  on active buyers  couple of thoughts  First off  active buyers is always important  We ve indexed recently and overweighted on getting active buyers    new active buyers into this ecosystem  And as we ve been highlighting over the course of 2019  that s favored active buyer growth  particularly with new and    what we call new and reactivated buyers  As we look into 2019     20  we will continue investing in new buyers  but we re going to migrate some of that spend into getting those new buyers that we brought into the ecosystem over the next    last four quarters and get them to try and buy more And so  it s going to be more about generating the GMV and the GMV from them  while we look at and continue to explore ways to expand the GMV per buyer in our retained buyer base  Which by the way in Q4 was very stable  which is  I think  great news  And as we pivot into next year  you can expect us to look a little bit less toward bringing a whole bunch of new buyers in  but making    continuing some investments there  but expanding more into converting those buyers that we brought in the last year and our retained buyer base as well Colin Sebastian    Robert W  Baird    AnalystAll right  That s helpful  Thank you Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Thanks OperatorYour next question is from Ross Sandler of Barclays  Please go ahead  your line is open Ross Sandler    Barclays    AnalystHey  guys  Just two questions  So  thanks for the detail on slide 20 on the IST  So are you basically saying that if we look at these four quarters that the improvement that you re seeing ex IST  is that just lapping the couponing initiatives or are there other things that you re working on that are driving that uptick from down 6  to only down 3  in recent quarters And then as we look forward  your guidance assumes like the year starts kind of flat in 2020 and the back half is going to be up about 4   So is that GMV growth picking up or is that from payments kicking in  in second half  Any color there on those two  that would be great Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think on the half versus half  it s both  It s certainly an improved    an increased lift from payments  As I said  we ll get two points    roughly two points of revenue growth from payments in the year  And remember  we re capped through July on what we can    what we can do in the US and we ll quickly get to that cap in Germany here in the first and second quarter  So the majority of that two points of revenue growth is going to be coming in the second half And then with    and in GMV as well  you have the combined impact of the conversion improvements and the initiatives we re working on that    some of the things that Scott mentioned  In addition to a point of improvement half over half  just from lapping out of IST Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Ross OperatorYour next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse  Please go ahead  your line is open Stephen Ju    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Thank you  So Scott  just wanted to understand how you re thinking on payments maybe evolving now that you have another quarter of ops under your    in the rear view  So I think in the past you guys had articulated a hard fork scenario when the contract comes off to  I guess now more of a gradual transition  So  has that thinking changed in terms of the speed at which you re willing to go  especially now that you re running up against the guardrails in terms of what you can do Second  any directional commentary you can offer about what percent of your sellers have bought into using our promoted listings  And what that buy in percent may look like in the newer markets in the West versus some of the  I guess  the older markets like Korea where this has been live for some time now  Thanks Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  A couple of thoughts on payments  First  I don t    I view our payments evolution is going right on track right now  And the gradualness is only in the near term  in the sense that we re guardrailed with what we can do between now and July  Once we re independent of the operating agreement with PayPal  we will go hard at not only the two markets that we re in and expand the number of sellers and the GMV that s covered in the ecosystem  in both US and Germany  but we will expand into the markets in other quarters  And so  we re on track  if not  better than we thought as we look toward the second half of the year Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerWith regards to Promoted Listings  maybe I ll let Andy if he has any numbers weigh in on that  But on the Promoted Listings within the US  I mean what you see    sorry  within the market    on platform Marketplaces business is  roughly 30  of listings are actually getting some form of promoted listings utilization  And as we look forward  we will learn from our Korea business which has a much higher percentage but a completely different take rate  And so  what we said over time is that  as we scale promoted listings and modify how we think about not only the user experience  but also the monetization of those assets to make sure that it s a valuable thing for sellers  And they view it as marketing expense versus just a take rate and a requirement  And you can    look  I would expect us to continue to iterate that as we move forward within the plans that we ve laid out Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of number of sellers or percentage of sellers  Through the year  we grew the number of sellers promoting items by over 80   And we exited the year  that was more than 1 1 million sellers and represents more than  320 million listings in Q4 Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive Officer320 million Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial Officer320 million  Sorry Stephen Ju    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Steve OperatorYour next question comes from Edward Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets  Please go ahead  your line is open Edward Yruma    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystHey  good evening  Thanks for taking the question  I guess first on payments  are you noticing any change in conversion on when a seller is using payments and whether they re seeing any negative impact from switching over And then second  maybe just a follow up to one of the earlier questions  Scott  you talked about really embracing authentically eBay  And I guess  just trying to think about some of the verticals that you ve been very successful at historically  Any sense that you ll be able to kind of restart maybe a more favorable growth dynamic in those verticals through greater focus  Thank you Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So on payments conversion impact  no  it s not down  I think that s just sort of a simple answer  What you do see with payments is  different user behavior as you would imagine  Buyer side now have more alternatives and sellers have a series of tools from which how to manage their payments and connect their payments with their listing activity  which makes it easier for them  And so  I think on both sides of the equation this is a net positive and certainly the conversion is fine On authentically eBay  look  the way I alluded to it last time and what I would point you to in the script from today and the points that I made is  as we think about not only how we prioritize the product plans for 2020  but also as we think about which verticals that we experiment in  And again  this is based on leveraging the structured data work that we ve done  the aspects that we ve expanded upon recently and as we look toward 2020 and beyond  really indexing higher on verticals that are more authentically eBay that people think of  And as much as it s that  it s about also the inventory that they think of us in When we talk about vintage  collectibles  interesting items  et cetera  people think of us and we just have to be more relevant  not only in how we show up on our search results  but how that inventory is searchable and findable on the site in a way that doesn t undermine new buyers coming into the ecosystem as we talked about a lot last year and prior  And then  most importantly  over time also indexing on brand  So more to come on that as we move forward  but for right now  I think that s    I think  Pete and the team has done an excellent job over the course of the planning horizon and setting us up for a  20 plan that is very clearly focused on vertical categories  along with Jordan and the other regional country leaders to really focus on where we think we can win Edward Yruma    KeyBanc Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thanks so much OperatorYour next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets  Please go ahead  your line is open Dan Salmon    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystHi  guys  Good afternoon  Maybe just a quick follow up on the display advertising headwinds in Classifieds  if you could just expand on that a little bit  Scott  And maybe in particular  why you re not seeing it in Germany  And then second  just thanks for the update as well on the CEO search  I may have missed it  but I don t think you put a time line on that one  but just curious to see how you think about    how we might expect that to play out while the strategic review continues as well  Thanks Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerYeah  absolutely  Look  on the CEO search online  we didn t lay out a plan or a timeline  But just to reemphasize  the Board and a subcommittee of the Board is working very actively to find and    interview and find the best possible candidate With regards to headwinds in Classified  I think it s important to note that there is a combination of factors going on  particularly in our horizontal platform businesses  And each one has adjust to a different degree  In particular  display ads are impacted by  a  what Andy called out  which is the shift to mobile devices  And that s been happening over time and it s continuing and in some countries accelerating And the second is  kind of the downstream impact of a lot of the changes within the privacy laws  as well as what Google has done  And that limits to some extent  both the market of display ads and the effectiveness  as well as then what s showing up on our site  And I think that s pretty consistent across other players in the industry That said  look  as we head toward 2020 and beyond  I think that will normalize and I think the teams have done an excellent job  As Andy called out  particularly  in Kleinanzeigen  as well as our automotive verticals to continue to expand and grow  And so  I don t see this as a structural long term concern  it s just more of something that we ve got to work through  not dissimilar to the internet sales tax Dan Salmon    BMO Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Dan OperatorYour next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Wells Fargo  Please go ahead  your line is open Brian Fitzgerald    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks  guys  Maybe related to Stephen s question    second question  but asked a little differently  With promoted listings revenue up 32  sequentially  but actual number of Pro Listings  I think was less than 10  growth there  Can you walk us through what s the strongest driver there  Is it higher bids  Is it improved conversions  And how much runway for pricings and conversions can we see there going forward  Thanks Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Brian  it s a great question  I think you answered it  It s a combination of conversion  I mentioned that in my script and Andy alluded to it as well that a number of things that we ve been doing in the ecosystem under the underlying structured data improvements and aspects that we ve been collecting has given us the capability to then serve those ads up with more certainty about what people are looking for and what might fit on that page to improve conversion The other side of it then  obviously  prices fluctuate have been    have gotten a little bit better  And then I think finally  you re going to see us continue to look at where and how we place these ads to make sure that they re accretive to the user experience  Thanks  Brian Brian Fitzgerald    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks  Scott OperatorYour next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America  Please go ahead  your line is open Justin Post    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  A couple of questions  First  on international  it s decelerated  obviously  sales taxes aren t an issue  Are there any countries that you d call out that are doing better or worse  And what are your big product initiatives to maybe help with the users and the growth there that you d call out for international markets And the second question is  obviously  you believe eBay stock is a good value here  been aggressive with buybacks and helping grow earnings  Is core eBay at all part of the strategic review  Are you looking at some of your options there  Thank you Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Justin  Internationally I think the two countries to call out are the UK and Korea for different reasons  The UK is primarily macroeconomic  we ve been tracking our performance relatively well with what s happening on a market basis  And just the uncertainty around Brexit has put pressure on the growth rates in the UK  And then Korea  as we ve mentioned for several quarters though  it s been stable over the last quarter  but the continued pressure from lower margin    a tougher competitive couponing environment in Korea Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  as we look at helping international  I think you got to pivot to on and off platform  And if you look at our platform  first off  Japan and Turkey continue to grow really well  Korea  as Andy mentioned  is relatively stable in a very tough macro situation  And keeping in mind that  they actually make money in that market  whereas I don t think anyone else does  And they re doing    that team is doing a fantastic job of iterating on how to deliver growth in a market that has those dynamics And I d call out two things for them  One  maybe more applicable to the rest of the platform  which is loyalty programs  They ve done an excellent job with Smile Club and other parts of the loyalty program to really capture over 2 million Koreans at this point that are part of our paid loyalty program  that bring great inventory  a wonderful payments capability with credit included and first party inventory listings and the kind of capability to bring great value there  As well as a very retail centric first party set of inventory that s offered on the platform  And that s a bigger and bigger part of that part of the business every month The team has done an excellent job  And so  while they may not be growing at the same rate as some of the others that lose  1 billion a year  they are doing an excellent job at managing    at managing and driving our profitable growth  even if it s lower than the overall And if you look at    if you look at the on platform businesses  there is a combination by market  We ve talked about German    the ePlus  where we ve got a loyalty program there and we certainly learned and have incorporated aspects from Korea into the German platform  We have the same in the UK and the same in the US and we continue to iterate around those But I wouldn t point to any one per se  other than maybe in the UK and we alluded to this in the past  but what you ll see in 2020 is a very unique integration with Royal Mail that s going to allow tracking which doesn t happen today on Royal Mail  it s going to allow tracking on eBay  that will be a unique eBay  And so  consumers in the UK will be able to see where their packages are and improve their trust and confidence in receiving and when they re going to receive their item But there is a lot of different ones by country  but generally speaking  the larger platform    on platform dynamics that I talked about will apply to most of those countries across the board Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerAnd then on   Justin Post    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  And    go ahead Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  look  we do like    the stock is a good buy  which is why we continue to be aggressive with the buyback  In terms of core eBay being part of the review  it s   Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerEverything is part of the review  The way we approach it is exactly as we ve talked to you about  which is  we are disciplined in how we look at it and we continue to iterate with the Board  So  I wouldn t call anything specific out at this point  but we look at everything Justin Post    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  Thank you Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Operator  we can  Indecipherable  for one more OperatorCertainly  Your last question will be from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead  your line is open Brian Nowak    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking my question  I have two  The first one on 2020 GMV  I think you talked about how you re going to have the IST challenges  offset by higher conversion  Maybe talk to us about some of the qualitative changes of the product improvements that you see driving that higher conversion throughout 2020  And then back to the 4Q flat buyer number  You mentioned  now there is some higher churn than expected  can you just sort of talk to us about what you saw in the consumers that we re churning  Was it an inventory issue  Was it payment friction  So what did you observe that was causing that higher churn and how do you fix that going into 2020  Thanks Andy Cring    Interim Chief Financial OfficerI ll start with the buyer number  Brian  It s actually up 2  year on year  So just to be clear  it s 183 million buyers  The churn  I don t think it s anything special in Q4  It s more a continuation of what we saw in Q3  And it s really following the increase in marketing we spent    the buyer driven marketing spend that we had in the second half of last year  first half of this year where we attempted to reactivate buyers and attract new buyers  And what we saw with those cohorts is  visited less frequently  spent less and we re turning out at a higher rate  And that became the CLV and the value of those buyers started to not be worth the marketing dollars we spent on them  So that s why we ve been pivoting away from that toward retention and focused on some higher value buyers Scott Schenkel    Interim Chief Executive OfficerYeah  With 2020 GMV  the internet sales tax headwinds  really what you see is particularly a high    higher ASP items  especially in electronics categories that when people encounter at checkout sales tax  they bounce away  And the good news in that is that  they are at least coming back and we re not losing them other than that transaction  And so what you see is  there is a chunk of GMV that s not returning  but it s not getting worse in the states that we ve seen so far And so  I don t really see the dynamics there changing  And in the underlying conversion  we ve had some minor benefits  but I wouldn t point to one thing above all the others  I think in a marketplace  in an ecosystem like ours it s imperative to be working on the seller experience and making seller tools and seller dynamics better  as well as the buy side  And I think  broadly speaking  some of the efforts that we did in 2019 as we look at conversion improve  And as we look toward 2021  improve  We re not pointing to one thing  but it s a series of things trying to improve the overall ecosystem  Thanks for the question  Brian Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  59 minutesCall participants Joe Billante    Vice President of

218033,439549,EBAY,eBay Earnings  3 Things to Watch,news,"The past year has been a busy one for shareholders of eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   The online marketplace s growth rebound fizzled in 2019  with sales falling under the weight of intense competition and added sales taxes in the core U S  market  Yet investors received some good news  too  mainly in the form of eBay s  4 billion divestment of its StubHub ticket business 
Through all of that  the stock barely kept pace with a booming market last year despite having been up by nearly 50  at one point in 2019  Yet eBay has a prime chance to improve on that narrative when it announces holiday season sales results in just a few days 
Let s look at three metrics worth following when eBay reports fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday  Jan  28  after the market close 

1  Growth trends
Most investors who follow the stock are expecting eBay to post a 2  sales decline on Tuesday  But that reported revenue figure has a lot of noise in it from currency exchange movements  given the company s substantial international business 
For a clearer picture of demand trends  follow eBay s buyer pool  which has been growing at a steady 4  clip for more than a year  Gains in that area have become increasingly important given the marketplace s worsening sales volume trends  Its volume has declined by 5  or more in the U S  market in each of the last three quarters  in fact  and it is expected to continue being pressured by the higher sales taxes that are raising prices for buyers  eBay s international growth has slowed for four consecutive quarters  too  reaching just 1  in the third quarter 
These mostly weak trends will put pressure on interim CEO Scott Schenkel and his team to show some progress that ideally improves on last quarter s 3  slump in global marketplace revenue 
2  Prime cash flow
eBay s asset light sales model has always been much more profitable than the ones relied on by more integrated retailers like Amazon com and Walmart  which maintain their own vast inventory and fulfillment operations  That profitability gap has only increased recently  thanks in part to eBay s higher fees  The transaction fee that it charges buyers rose to 9 7  last quarter  up from 8 8  in mid 2018 
Continued success here should show up in two important metrics  operating margin and cash flow  On the margin front  look for the tech stock s operating margin to improve for the second straight quarter  rising to 28  of sales from 27  in Q3  Free cash flow should land at around  2 3 billion for the year  equating to 21  of eBay s annual sales haul 
3  Looking ahead
Investors will get to see a detailed financial outlook when eBay posts its 2020 forecast on Tuesday  Assuming it achieves management s 2019 prediction  the company will have the chance to target a rebound after growth slowed to 2  from 5  in 2018  Another sluggish outlook  on the other hand  will add even more pressure on executives to discuss how eBay plans to stem its market share slide 
The company will likely highlight the soaring direct capital returns that will be supported by its StubHub sale  But investors won t be in a celebratory mood until they see a clear path back toward faster marketplace growth  especially given the booming e commerce industry ",2020-01-23,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plyoh,2066188

What s Next for eBay 
While eBay has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Both eBay and MONOTARO have a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
EBAY currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 93  while MONOY has a forward P E of 62 88  We also note that EBAY has a PEG ratio of 1 38  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  MONOY currently has a PEG ratio of 3 29

These metrics  and several others  help EBAY earn a Value grade of B  while MONOY has been given a Value grade of F

218042,439558,EBAY,Vikings  Rudolph says gloves meant for charity wound up on eBay,news,"By Amy Tennery
NEW YORK  Reuters    Minnesota Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph said on Wednesday that he was duped into donating a pair of game worn gloves to what he thought was a charity  then saw them advertised for sale on eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  
Rudolph said on Twitter that someone approached him in the locker room after he caught the winning touchdown in his team s wild card game on Sunday against the New Orleans Saints

218044,439560,EBAY,EBay  EBAY  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when eBay  EBAY  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This e commerce company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 65 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 65 billion  down 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for eBay 
For eBay  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that eBay will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that eBay would post earnings of  0 62 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 68  delivering a surprise of  9 68  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
EBay doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-ebay-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200474014,200474014

When looking at the last two reports  this e commerce company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 8 01   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  eBay was expected to post earnings of  0 62 per share  but it reported  0 68 per share instead  representing a surprise of 9 68   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 63 per share  while it actually produced  0 67 per share  a surprise of 6 35  
Price and EPS Surprise

For eBay  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
EBay has an Earnings ESP of  5 31  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 23  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

Filling An Underserved NicheREAL operates an online marketplace that allows people to sell secondhand luxury goods such as designer clothing  jewelry  and art  In 2018  the company facilitated 1 6 million transactions with a total value of  710 million from over 400 thousand different buyers Selling and buying secondhand luxury goods online presents a unique challenge due to the proliferation of knockoff goods  If  for instance  someone posts a Gucci handbag for sale on eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   it s difficult  if not impossible  for any potential buyers to verify its authenticity  As a result  buyers will not want to pay full price  which means sellers of authentic goods will not want to sell on the platform  This creates a negative feedback loop that results in the majority of luxury goods posted on EBAY being fake REAL solves this problem by authenticating all the merchandise sold on its site and handling all elements of the sales process  including photography  pricing  fulfillment  and returns  This more intensive service allows REAL to retain a significant portion of the money buyers spend on its site  REAL s take rate  the percentage of each order that it keeps as a percent of revenue  was 36  in 2018  EBAY s take rate was just 9   and craft goods marketplace Etsy s  NASDAQ ETSY  take rate was 15   as shown in Figure 1 Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsHigh Cost Business ModelWhile REAL gets to keep a much larger portion of the money spent on its site than its peers  it also has to spend much more to earn that revenue  It pays the cost of authenticating  merchandising  shipping  and accepting returns for all the items it sells 
What s more  many of the above costs are not reported in cost of goods sold  Instead  they are reported as  Operations and Technology  expenses  According to REAL s S 1 
Operations and technology expense principally includes personnel related costs for employees involved with the authentication  merchandising and fulfillment of goods sold through our online marketplace  as well as our general information technology expense We would argue that many of these costs are directly related to the delivery of REAL s service and should be included in cost of revenue  By reporting these costs separately  REAL makes its gross margin look higher and presents a potentially misleading picture of its path to profitability 
Figure 2 shows that REAL s gross margin has stayed consistent at  65  since 2017  However  if we include operations and technology expense as part of cost of revenue  its  Adjusted Gross Margin  declined from 22  in 2017 to 15  TTM 





Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
REAL says that it expects operations and technology expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the longer term  but Figure 2 shows that they re currently not making any progress towards that goal 
Overall  REAL s after tax operating  NOPAT  decreased from   47 million in 2017 to   66 million in 2018  but its NOPAT margin improved slightly from  35  to  32  over the same time 
REAL seems like it should have a profitable business model  It fulfills an underserved niche and has relatively little direct competition  However  the company has yet to show significant concrete progress towards achieving profitability 
It s possible that this business is simply not a profitable space  which would explain why so few other firms have filled this niche 
Could REAL Benefit from a Recession While luxury goods manufacturers struggle during economic downturns  REAL s consignment business could actually benefit from poor economic conditions  Shoppers that normally buy new luxury items might substitute and buy used during a recession  At the same time  the company could also get a large influx of new sellers needing extra cash as well Of course  it s also possible that the overall decline in spending on luxury goods during a recession would more than offset this substitution effect and be a net negative for REAL  As with so many other recent IPO s  we ve never seen this company operate during an economic downturn  so we have no real idea how it will perform  Still  there s at least some reason for investors to hope that this company is better equipped to handle a recession Public Shareholders Have Rights   A Break from Recent NormsREAL s corporate governance also separates it from many other recent IPO s  While most companies now go public with dual class share structures that give insiders and early investors extra voting rights  REAL has just a single class of voting stock  Public shareholders get to have an equal voice in corporate governance 
This voting power is especially important because shareholders have reason to be skeptical of REAL s leadership  Founder and CEO Julie Wainwright first rose to prominence as the CEO of Pets com  the ill fated e commerce company that became the poster child of tech bubble excess in the late 90 s 
Wainwright s resume won t give investors much confidence  but at least shareholders have the power to potentially replace her if REAL doesn t start showing signs of profitability 
DCF Model Reveals High ExpectationsWhen we use our dynamic DCF model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into the current stock price  we see that REAL is expensive  but still has potential upside 
To justify its current valuation of  17 share  REAL must achieve 12  NOPAT margins  comparable to ETSY  and grow revenue by 23  compounded annually for the next eight years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 
If REAL can grow revenue at the same rate but achieve NOPAT margins of 19   equal to EBAY   the stock is worth  30 share today  a 73  upside to the current stock price  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 
A 23  compound annual growth rate seems very achievable for a company that grew revenue by 50  year over year through the first six months of 2019  so the issue is margins  Given the high take rate  REAL should be able to achieve comparable margins to its peers  with some cost controls   in which case the stock is undervalued  However  the poor performance of the stock since its IPO shows that investors are not satisfied with future promises and want to see progress towards profitability right now

218065,439581,EBAY,EBay  EBAY  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"eBay  EBAY  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for eBay basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for eBay imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for eBay
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this e commerce company is expected to earn  2 75 per share  which is a change of  1 4  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for eBay  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3 8  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of eBay to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-09-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-ebay-upgraded-to-buy-heres-why-200461494,200461494

WillScot has made an offer for Mobile Mini that values it in the mid to high  30 per share range  which would be funded for the most part by using WillScot shares as currency  sources told Reuters on Wednesday 
Mobile Mini shares were trading up 5  at  36 42 before news of Elliott s involvement  giving the company a market value of  1 6 billion  WillScot shares were up 4  at  16 23  giving it a market value of  1 9 billion 
Elliott  which has pursued changes at some of the biggest U S  companies  including AT T Inc  N T  and eBay Inc  O EBAY   believes that a combination with WillScot is the best transaction available to Mobile Mini  the sources said 
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Mobile Mini is also considering alternative transactions  including acquiring the U S  assets of mobile storage company  General Finance  Corp  O GFN   should the latter divest its Australian portable buildings and storage container business Royal Wolf Holdings 
There is no certainty that WillScot will successfully negotiate a deal with Mobile Mini  the sources said  asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential  The sources did not give details on the size of Elliott s stake in Mobile Mini

218095,439611,EBAY,UK regulator tells Facebook  eBay to tackle sale of fake reviews,news,"By Muvija M and Tanishaa Nadkar  Reuters    Britain s competition watchdog on Friday told Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  to go through their websites and crack down on the sale of fake and misleading online reviews  The Competition and Markets Authority  CMA  said  it had found  troubling evidence  of a growing marketplace for misleading reviews on the two sites  The CMA said it had found more than 100 eBay listings offering fake reviews for sale between November and June  and identified 26 Facebook groups with people offering to write fake reviews  or businesses recruiting people to write them on popular shopping and review sites  A Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters the company had removed 24 of the groups and pages flagged by CMA  a number of them before the regulator s report   We know there is more to do which is why we ve tripled the size of our safety and security team to 30 000 and continue to invest in technology to help proactively prevent abuse of our platform   the spokeswoman said  EBay said it was working closely with the regulator   We have zero tolerance for fake or misleading reviews  Listings such as these are strictly against our policy on illegal activity and we will act where our rules are broken   an eBay spokesperson told Reuters  Earlier this month  Facebook announced plans to create 500 new tech jobs in London by the end of the year  with many working on systems to detect and remove malicious content  fake accounts and harmful behavior  The social network has been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over its data sharing practices as well as fake news and hate speech on its networks  
Facebook said in March it had removed 137 fake pages  groups and Instagram accounts in the United Kingdom for engaging in hate speech and making divisive comments ",2019-06-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/british-regulator-asks-facebook-ebay-to-tackle-sale-of-fake-reviews-1904038,1904038
218096,439612,EBAY,Facebook Libra Update  Regulation Takes Center Stage,opinion,"Regulators the world over are gearing up to create a framework that could monitor  direct and control the way cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   Libra operate  Cryptocurrencies have been around for a while  but Facebook s June 18 announcement that Libra would hit markets in 2020 has created the urgency 
That s because Facebook has a huge network of 2 billion people that could make the kind of difference to economies and governments that can t be dreamed of by other fiat crypto coin systems  And Facebook has a spotty history of maintaining users  privacy and security      
Facebook s David Marcus  who joined the company from PayPal   NASDAQ PYPL    back when it was still a part of eBay   NASDAQ EBAY    is co creator of Libra and the head of Switzerland based Facebook company responsible for Libra  So in that capacity  he faced questions from the Senate Banking Committee and the House Committee on Financial Services last week 
At the House Committee on Financial Services
Chairwoman Maxine Waters has been sharply critical of Libra since its launch  So at the meeting on Wednesday  she said that Libra would allow the company  to wield immense power that could disrupt  governments and central banks 
Given the repercussions for people  banks and governments all over the world  Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney  strongly opposed the launch of Libra  She suggested that the company at least do a pilot program with a million users overseen by U S  financial regulators  including the Federal Reserve   I don t think you should launch Libra at all At the very least you should agree to do this small pilot program   she said 
Democratic U S  Representative Alma Adams pointed to privacy and security issues for users   You expect us to believe that you re going to start collecting financial data and not share it because you promised not to do that   she said 
There were also concerns regarding consumer protection and prevention of use for illegal activities like money laundering or terrorist financing 
Republican U S  Representative Ann Wagner mentioned every other concern while saying that the launch seemed hurried   I m concerned a 2020 launch date represents deep insensitivities about how Libra could impact U S  financial security  the global financial system  the privacy of people across the globe  criminal activity and international human rights  
Marcus explained that the company viewed Libra as a payment tool rather than a security or an exchange traded fund  an indication that it was not subject to oversight by the SEC  The company hasn t spoken to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton yet  although representatives have reportedly reached out to others in the organization   He said that it could be treated as a commodity under current law  While remaining noncommittal about a pilot program  he promised to do whatever was necessary to satisfy regulators and  get this right  
At the Senate Banking Committee
On Tuesday  the senate committee had similar concerns and Marcus went about explaining what Libra was  how it could change the way people do personal finance  etc  He also mentioned consumer protections like making mandatory a valid photo ID  In addition  Marcus tried to push the idea that the U S  should take a leading role in developing a new global currency before others did  interesting that the company didn t choose the U S  as its headquarters though  
Others Are Also Concerned
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  for one  is concerned about national security money laundering and other illicit activities   We will not allow digital asset service providers to operate in the shadows    Bitcoin is highly volatile and based on thin air   Mnuchin said   We are concerned about the speculative nature of Bitcoin and will make sure that the U S  financial system is protected from fraud  
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell thinks the broad adoption of digital currencies like Libra could be risky on multiple counts 
President Donald Trump said that Libra and other cryptocurrencies should face banking regulations  He also said that the U S  regulatory system may not be adequately equipped to handle the broad adoption of the huge digital payment system that Facebook envisaged 
The Group of Seven  G7  Are Concerned
Much the same concerns were raised at the G7 meeting in Chantilly  France  Country leaders were also concerned about the safeguards to withstand a run on reserves and users  privacy and ownership rights 
Benoit Coeure  the European Central Bank board member said his G7 working group on stablecoins would work on the matter until the International Monetary Fund s annual meeting in October  after which it will hand over the matter to the Financial Stability Board of global financial regulators  He also outlined the broad risks 
 A global stablecoin for retail purposes could provide for faster and cheaper remittances  spur competition for payments and thus lower costs  and support greater financial inclusion  However     they give rise to a number of risks related to public policy priorities including anti money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism  consumer and data protection  cyber resilience  fair competition and tax compliance Market discipline is useful but I wouldn t see it as progress to shift monetary sovereignty from governments to private multinationals  
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire of France  which holds the rotating presidency of the G7 top world economies  told a news conference   We cannot accept private companies issuing their own currencies without democratic control   He spoke for the ministers and governors to say that  stablecoins and other various new products currently being developed  including projects with global and potentially systemic footprint such as Libra  raise serious regulatory and systemic concerns  
The G7 also agreed to tax large tech companies for money they made in a country even if they weren t physically present  They agreed to fix a minimum taxation to eliminate competition between themselves for foreign investments  France  Italy  Britain and Spain already have a plan in force that could be replaced with the new tax 
What the Market s Saying
Coin Center Executive Director Jerry Brito says that Libra is a company issued asset whereas a true cryptocurrency has decentralized control and wasn t issued by any central authority  For instance  no company issues bitcoin 
Blockchain Association Director Kristin Smith seemed to welcome the publicity Libra brought while remaining wary about Facebook s past  It s mixed   she said   We certainly don t want the whole industry to become associated with some of the issues that Facebook has had as a company in the past   
Cryptocurrencies were appreciating after the announcement of Libra  but lost some value in the last week as regulators pressed down on Facebook  All the major currencies including bitcoin  ethereum and ripple responded 
Conclusion
A few weeks into the debate and it does look like Facebook has bitten off more than it can chew  To convince regulators the world over about the efficacy of broadly adopting a stable coin is going to be neither easy  nor cheap 
No doubt the idea was innovative and something governments might pursue in the future  as the People s Bank of China has apparently said it s doing   especially given the growing digitization of services  But there doesn t seem to be a good reason they would turn over control to a private multinational company 
And then of course there s the question of how Facebook has reacted to its mistakes transgressions in the past  None of that inspires a lot of confidence  As Senator Sherrod Brown said  it is like the  toddler  with the book of matches   Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience  
That said  if the government wants to really block the company  it has to come up with some legislation or designate the regulator

218098,439614,EBAY,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why EBay  EBAY  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at eBay  EBAY   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  EBay currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for EBAY that show why this e commerce company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For EBAY  shares are up 0 37  over the past week while the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry is down 0 01  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 15  compares favorably with the industry s 2 23  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of eBay have increased 5 88  over the past quarter  and have gained 22 41  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 2 94  and 9 16   respectively 
Investors should also take note of EBAY s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  EBAY is averaging 8 066 888 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with EBAY 
Over the past two months  15 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost EBAY s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 69 to  2 74 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  13 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that EBAY is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep eBay on your short list ",2019-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-ebay-ebay-is-a-great-choice-200444181,200444181

218112,439628,EBAY,eBay Price Action Showing A Bull In Charge ,opinion,"eBay is to release its earnings number on Wednesday after market close  By analyzing EBAY s daily chart  we can see the price action has made a consolidation move within a small symmetrical triangle since June 20  This may be an interesting move for this stocks  but as with symmetrical triangle patterns  price may break in either direction 
However  through Ichimoku cloud analysis  this particular stock may well be on the bullish bias  On the daily chart  both the Chikou line and the cloud shows bullishness and the price currently being supported by the Tenkan Kijun line and respecting the symmetrical triangle line 
Looking further back to Feb  12  the price created a rectangle channel  shaded area  between the 35 40 and 39 40 area up to mid June before breaching the channel line on June 18  This channel line has also created a support price line after the price bounce from the peak of 40 55 on June 20  It then started to make both lower high and higher low 
Momentum and oscillator tools all give a normal reading without any sign of divergence with ADX still showing a good momentum 
If the analysis validates a bullish bias as per above  we can put a buy stop above the the previous high of 40 55 to be conservative or if we wish to be an aggressive trader  place a buy stop just above the upper line of the symmetrical triangle  Stop loss can be set just below the low of June 25 at 38 90 and a minimum target shall be at least equal to the risk of the trade ",2019-07-16,Mukhriz Mangsor,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-price-action-showing-a-bull-in-charge-200440125,200440125

What s Next for eBay 
While eBay has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for eBay was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

218122,439638,EBAY,EBay  EBAY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"EBay  EBAY  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 17  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This e commerce company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17  
Revenues are expected to be  2 67 billion  up 1 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for eBay 
For eBay  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that eBay will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that eBay would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 67  delivering a surprise of  6 35  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
EBay doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-ebay-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200438446,200438446

The good news for watchers of this stock is the levels to be navigated are all clearly defined on the accumulation and distribution indicator and also on the volume point of control  First  the price based resistance which is denoted by the red dashed line just below  39  This level has been tested repeatedly from below since the start of the year but has held firm on each occasion  Indeed the price action of the last few days is testing this level once more  Below  we have two very strong price regions acting as platforms of support and denoted with the blue dashed lines  One at  35 and the other just above at  35 50  a cluster of strong support in this case  Finally in the centre  and moving to the volume point of control  we have the VPOC itself  the fulcrum of price action and the heaviest concentration of volume at  37 30 
Last week s widespread up candle was supported with excellent volume  and what we are waiting for now  is a follow through of this positive sentiment for the stock  with a break and hold above the ceiling of resistance  Once breached  expect to see this stock develop a longer term bullish trend and move firmly away from the VPOC  and into light volume extending through to  44 per share where a low volume node awaits 
The catalyst for a move higher may well be the next earnings report due on 17th July  Last time around EPS of  0 55 surprised the markets and comfortably beat market expectations of  0 51  A repeat may just be enough to drive the stock into the  40 region and beyond with the consensus forecast for the period at  0 49 ",2019-06-13,Anna Coulling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/patience-for-ebay-bidders-will-pay-off-200431125,200431125

218166,439682,EBAY,A Cheap Play On An eBay  Pause ,opinion,"The purpose of this article is not really to talk about eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   The truth is I don t really have an opinion about eBay s near term prospects one way or the other  The real purpose of this article is to highlight the potential to make an inexpensive play  please note how I skillfully avoided the use of the word  bet   on a given security via the use of options 
In Figure 1 we can see that eBay has a had a pretty good run of late  In addition  if one wanted to one could make an argument that price is at or near a resistance level  Finally  earnings are due on or around 4 24 

Figure 1  Courtesy AIQ TradingExpert
So  let s suppose a scenario where a trader felt that there was a decent chance that eBay was going to  pause  in the current price area  and possibly pull back for at least a short period of time  This is not an out and out bearish projection  so buying a put option may not be the most optimal play 
So  let s get creative 
The Example
The example trade involves 
 Buying 4 eBay May17 36 puts    0 66
 Selling 2 eBay Apr26 36 puts    0 52
 Selling 2 eBay Apr 26 35 puts    0 31
The particulars for this trade in Figure 2 and the risk curves in Figure 3 
Figure 2  Calendar Spread  Courtesy OptionsAnalysis com

Figure 3  Calendar Spread Risk Curves  Courtesy OptionsAnalysis com
A few key things to note 
 The cost and maximum risk on this trade is  98  So  we are talking about some really cheap speculation here
 If eBay does NOT pause   i e   if it moves higher  a 100  loss of the entire  98 is the most likely outcome 
 If eBay drifts sideways to slightly lower  this trade holds some decent profit potential on a percentage basis 
 If eBay drops out of the sky  this trade can earn roughly 100  return on investment 
Summary
So  if this type of trade in general   and this eBay trade in specific   even a good idea  That s not for me to say  As I intimated above the purpose of this piece is simply to highlight the possibilities  But just to round out this particular example  the relevant questions in this case are 
1  Do you think eBay may temporarily run out of steam and possibly experience a short term pullback 
2  Do you have  98 bucks

218167,439683,EBAY,EBay  EBAY  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when eBay  EBAY  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This e commerce company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 58 billion  up 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for eBay 
For eBay  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that eBay will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that eBay would post earnings of  0 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering a surprise of  23 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
EBay doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-ebay-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200407310,200407310

218208,439724,EBAY,Will EBay  EBAY  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  EBay  EBAY   which belongs to the Zacks Internet   Commerce industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This e commerce company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2 87  
For the last reported quarter  eBay came out with earnings of  0 56 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 55 per share  representing a surprise of 1 82   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 51 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 53 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 92  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for eBay lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
EBay has an Earnings ESP of  1 47  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-ebay-ebay-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200372133,200372133

218214,439730,EBAY,PayPal Stock Entering High Risk Territory,opinion,"PayPal Holdings  NASDAQ PYPL  was spun off from eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  in 2015 and  judging from its share price three years later  it has been a tremendous investment  PayPal stock fell to  30 a share in August 2015  By September 2018  it was trading above the  93 mark  Following last month s dip to  74 66  the stock is on the rise again  currently in the vicinity of  90 
PayPal stock s 200  total return in three years translates into 44 2  compounded annually  This is something even the best money managers out there can only dream of  What bothers us that people tend to extrapolate the recent past into the distant future  This creates the belief that what has worked before will continue to work  Unfortunately  all the stock market crashes in history suggest otherwise 
So is PayPal stock still a good investment  Is it time to join the bulls or get defensive  Let s see if the Elliott Wave Principle can help us answer these questions 
The daily chart reveals the structure of PYPL stock s bull market  The rally from  30 to almost  94 can be seen as the first three waves  labeled I II III  of a five wave impulse  The sub waves of wave III and the sub waves of wave  3  of III are also clearly visible 
This means the recent dip to under  75 in October stands for wave IV down and wave V up is now in progress  Since wave V is supposed to exceed the top of wave III  it follows that  100 a share is within the bulls  reach in the short term 
Danger Lurking Ahead for PayPal stock investors
On the other hand  the Elliott Wave theory states that we can expect a three wave correction in the opposite direction as soon as wave V is over  The bearish RSI divergence between waves  3  and  5  of III also indicate PayPal stock is losing momentum 
Besides  PayPal s 2018 guidance is for EPS of  1 69  which gives the stock a forward price to earnings ratio of almost 53  This is a very high ratio  which means a lot of optimism is already priced in PayPal s valuation  And where optimism is strong  disappointment lurks 
In conclusion  PayPal stock seems determined to reach  100 a share  Instead of joining the bulls  though  investors should proceed with caution  We believe a 30  decline to the support near  70 is just around the corner for the online payments provider

218222,439738,EBAY,Squaring The Circle On Square  Inc  Is Possible,opinion,"You don t need to be a mathematician to be able to calculate Square  Inc  s  NYSE SQ  valuation  You do need to circle back on your assumptions about whether PayPal Holdings Inc  NASDAQ PYPL  provides a good point of comparison  When Square is held up next to PayPal  it shows that though their business models may differ in some ways  they give a good reference  It then points SQ likely undervalued relative to PYPL  However  PYPL itself is overvalued 
A PayPal ComparisonIt s been proposed that PayPal offers a good point of comparison for Square  They both operate as payment service providers that allow businesses to accept payments  SQ hit the scene with their easy to use the dongle that turned your phone into a payment processor  PYPL operates almost exclusively online  In fact  for years they remained unchallenged until startups like Stripe decided to disrupt their business model 
Where the two differ  come in where they operate  Square firmly sits in the real world while PayPal lives in the digital  These trends are changing with SQ actively working on establishing their online platform and PYPL s acquisition of iZettle 
However  you get the sense Square is more interested in becoming the true one stop shop for payment processing than PayPal  Both make things easier such as payroll  However  PYPL seems to point to existing ways of using their program  IE mass payments  rather than SQ Payroll which made a specific application for payroll 
Price to Sales Growth Rate NormalizationIt s been pointed out Square trades at a much higher P S multiple than competitors like eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY   But  that makes sense considering how much faster SQ continues to grow  PYPL is no slouch  Their 5 year average is 18 26   and their most recent YOY was 20 77  with the latest quarter at 22 99  
 
Source  Morningstar PayPal Analysis
That s not the same thing as SQ  People pay more for it because the company threw up a 5 year average of 61 20   and the most recent YOY of 29 59  with the latest quarter at 47 77  
 
Source  Morningstar Square Analysis
At the moment you have the P S for PayPal at 6 7x and Square at 11 32x  Well  that kind of makes sense  If you assume PYPL at fair value  then if SQ puts up 2x 3x their growth pretty consistently over the years  you would expect the P S to be double that of PYPL 
In fact  you really could only make the argument it s overvalued based on the 2017 numbers  At the paltry 29 59  growth YOY  they should only be 1 42x the P S ratio of PYPL instead of the 1 69x they re at now  or a 9 51x P S and  62 a share 
But if you took the 3 year average  you would be at 2 12x the value of PayPal or 14 2x for an equivalent P S  and using the 5 year average you would be 3 35x the value of PYPL  or at 22 46x for an equivalent P E  That would put the share prices at  93 and  147 per share  Where their growth will land is debatable  But  when you compare the valuation to that of PYPL unless the overall market itself changes  it would be tough to see share prices drop much below  60 
P E NormalizationLet s consider what the P E ratio would look like for Square if they hit operating margins similar to those of PayPal  Right now PYPL runs an 18 82  margin  If that margin is applied to SQ s TTM  they will put out Net Income of  505m  That equates to  1 28 per share  At the current price  you end up with 57 86x P E  That s a good bit higher than PYPL who sits at 44 33x 
If you consider these companies equivalent and ignore the growth aspects  then a similar valuation of Square would give a share price of  56 74  That s not too far below the low end of what was noted above for the P S analysis  Again  let s consider what happens when you account for the higher growth  Using the 3 year growth rate  you d take 44 33 x 2 12   93 98 P E  and the 5 year 44 33 x 3 35   148 5 P E  That would give share prices of  120 and  190  respectively 
It s fair to point out that the business models between the two don t work in the same way  Square actually manages not just software  but hardware devices  PayPal is only just moving into that area

Why PayPal Doesn t Deserve It s PremiumSo far the article discussed why the valuation of Square relative to PayPal is not outlandish  as well as where potential floors and ceilings might exist  However  that relies on the assumption of PYPL being fairly valued 
Referring to the PayPal financials  you can see the expansion most years  Current margins sit near 18 82   up from 17 3  the prior year  It would be very unlikely that operating margins will get much higher than 20   The costs of the business simply make this prohibitive  unless you decided to redefine revenues and expenses which is another discussion for another day  
Take a step back to the growth rates that PayPal currently sees  Right now they ve seen averages that sit between 18  20  per year  Let s consider the S P 500  The S P 500 trades at a P S of 2 14x  and a P E of 22 60x  The earnings growth rate ranged from 6 0  to 14 41  for 5 year and 3 year periods  respectively  Just using the 18  point  you would get a multiplier for PYPL of 1 24x   3 0x 
Using these multipliers  you would expect to get a range of P S on PayPal between 2 65x 6 42x  and a P E of 28 02x 67 8x  Considering that the current earnings growth rate for the S P 500 sits at 17 75   on a relative and short term basis  the stock is overvalued  But in considering the median for the S P 500 sits at 12 28   you d be looking at a P S of 3 17x and P E of 33 12x  That would give you a P E derived price of  55 64 and a P S price of  40 12 
However  the story doesn t end there  Remember that PayPal has been expanding their operating margin  That gives another multiplier to consider  The PEG ratio for PYPL sits at 2 24x  The S P 500 sits at 1 25x  This would imply that PYPL is being overvalued  and better priced at  47 32 
ConclusionIf you consider Square relative to PayPal  it appears to be fairly valued  if not somewhat underpriced  However  PYPL itself seems to be trading at a premium and has further to fall  This would indicate that SQ also has further to fall  That would mean it likely to find a stable value base around  60  The easiest way to trade these pairs is to take a long short on any oscillations that cause compression in values  If SQ trades lower to PYPL  or PYPL higher to SQ  it becomes a no brainer ",2018-10-23,Sayat Kartabayev,https://www.investing.com/analysis/squaring-the-circle-on-square-inc-is-possible-200349860,200349860

218231,439747,EBAY,PayPal  Will Q3 Earnings Show It s Recovering From The eBay Split ,opinion,"Reports Thursday  October 18  after the market close
Revenue Expectation   3 66B
EPS   0 54

After surging more than 80  last year  shares of online payment giant PayPal Holdings  NASDAQ PYPL  have done little to impress investors lately  Trading at  80 as of yesterday s close  the stock was down 15  from the 52 week high of almost  94 
After this dismal performance  PayPal lovers are left wondering whether this is just a blip or a sign of the stock having peaked  The company s third quarter earnings  scheduled for release today  Thursday October 18  after the market closes  may provide some clues 

PayPal stock lost its luster earlier this year when eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  announced that it planed to take over crucial payments processing duties for its core Marketplace e commerce offering  a role that PayPal had handled for the e commerce site under a deal signed when the two companies split in 2015  EBAY expects to fully transition to the new system by 2021 with the help of its new payments partner  Adyen 
As eBay has played a crucial role in PayPal s growth  accounting for roughly 13  of total payments processed by the company  this shocking announcement sent PayPal shares tumbling from their remarkable rally 
PayPal management insists that this loss is manageable  as it believes the company is on the right track to expand its offerings  To offset the loss  the company is mainly focusing on the promotion of Venmo  a payment app that has been very popular with smartphone users  as well as on acquisitions 
When PayPal releases third quarter results later today  investors will look for solid evidence that the company has succeeded in monetizing Venmo a feat PayPal has been unable to accomplish until now  Just last week  PayPal said it will charge 1  when Venmo account holders transfer money quickly to their bank accounts  raising the charge from  0 25 per transaction 
An aggressive acquisition drive is another part of PayPal s strategy to diversify its payment processing business in order to become less dependent on eBay s business  As part of this push  the company has bought several companies  including Swedish small business payments service iZettle for  2 2 billion 
Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect PayPal to report adjusted earnings per share of  0 54 for the last quarter  up from  0 46 a year earlier  on the sales of  3 66 billion 
If PayPal can indeed show significant growth in total volume due to acquisitions and new partnerships  we believe its shares will break out of their bearish slump  Such an outcome would be important in order to quell investor fears about the company s growth potential over the next three years  after the divorce from eBay ",2018-10-18,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/venmo-acquisitions-are-key-to-paypals-q3-earnings-share-rebound-200349002,200349002

The electoral results in Germany may mean that Merkel will be unable to form a viable coalition for months  introducing considerable uncertainty for the single currency 

Sure enough  there is already talk of a possible new election  However  according to the    analysts said none of Germany s parties had an obvious contender to assume her mantel  

The euro dropped as much as 0 64 percent during the early Asian session  but between 2 and 4 AM EDT it rebounded on positive economic news when German PPI MoM and YoY met expectations  rising 0 3 percent and 2 7 percent respectively  After the release  previous losses were wiped out and the single currency actually climbed 0 8 percent  higher than it had been when trading started There s nothing like cold hard economic data with which to erase any whiff of instability generated by political pundits 

Also this morning  Germany s DAX fell to a seven week low to start the trading week  leading major European benchmarks lower  However  after gapping down 0 61 percent  the DAX pared losses to just 0 16 percent  as of 4 07 EDT  As with the euro  it demonstrates that investors think less of politics and more about economics  The continued  sustainable economic growth in Germany and the eurozone is providing all the certainty investors require  in lieu of political stability 
Global Economic Affairs
After China s ongoing regulatory crackdown on risky  highly leveraged trades seemed to enter yet another phase late Friday  Chinese equities  including the Shanghai Composite  were hit this morning 

However  as investors had an opportunity to take a closer look at the details of the newly drafted rules  including the prohibition of implicit guarantees regarding returns  markets rebounded 
With the exception of China  equities in other parts of Asia extended losses  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped half of one percent last week  ending a rally that moved the index 6 percent higher  The rally halted at the pre 2008 crash high  spurring many technical analysts  including   to forecast  a massive double top  as equities in Asia show fatigue   In other words  investors may be too scared to keep supporting additional rallies 

The spread between 2 year and 10 year Treasury yields is the stuff that gives institutional investors heartburn  It s returned to its narrowest level in a decade  a clear indication of a lack of faith in sustainable US economic growth  now being expressed via the spread by the smart money 

The battered British pound  which has been locked in a range since October 13  received a boost from reports the UK may increase their  divorce fee  offer to the EU ahead of the critical meeting with EU leaders in December 
Bitcoin climbed past  8 000 for the first time on Sunday  after traders were able to set aside technology concerns that had led the most popular cryptocurrency into a 29 percent crash  Speculation that a SegWit2x hard fork might still be a possibility may have also driven the digital currency s price higher 

Bitcoin has had a remarkable year so far  The opening price at the beginning of 2017 was  966 60  On January 30  it broke the  1 000 level and reached  1 241 30 on March 2  besting the price of gold for the first time  which was then trading at  1 1 25 
On May 15  Bitcoin broke above  2 000 and less than a month later  on June 12  it hit an intra day high of  3 000  As June closed  the cryptocurrency moved past the  3 000 mark  settling at  3 265 40  By August 8  it had closed above  3 500  nearly triple the price of gold at the time  which was then trading at  1 262 60 
That said  the gold market is worth trillions while Bitcoin s market cap was only about  57 billion at the time  However  by August 13 the cryptocurrency had climbed above  4 000 and rapidly moved toward the  5 000 level which it reached on September 2  On October 20  it passed through the  6 000 mark and on November 2  it broke the  7 000 barrier  barely two weeks later it s topped  8 000  And there s still more than a month to go before the close of 2017 
While  this may sound like a fairy tale and it surely must be for early Bitcoin investors one should always keep in mind the oft repeated disclaimer popular in financial literature  past performance is not indicative of future results  Since this is largely a sentiment driven market  it s highly unpredictable  Like Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  previously  which didn t start as businesses  by happy accident they all turned into some of the most successful ventures in history  That s a lot riding on happy accident 
We ve tried to use the principles of technical analysis to forecast future BTC moves  but didn t succeed  Still  based on studying the digital currency s balance of supply and demand  posting a price higher than a previous peak signals a resumption of an uptrend  whereupon a long trade may be entered 

WTI crude held on to gains above  56 after Friday s surge  which was spurred by Saudi Arabia s supply cut extension plans  In yesterday s Week Ahead post  we indicated that WTI s price had formed a weekly hanging man  When it s confirmed with a following closing price beneath the hanging man s real body  it suggests a decline will ensue  Thus far  the price is 3 cents below  as of 4 53 AM

218278,439794,EBAY,EU to launch more e commerce antitrust investigations,news,"By Julia Fioretti BRUSSELS  Reuters    The European Union plans to launch more antitrust investigations into e commerce companies after a two year inquiry uncovered business practices that restrict competition  the European Commission said on Wednesday  In its report on the initial inquiry  the EU executive said it had found an increased use of contractual restrictions to control product distribution  which could be in breach of EU antitrust rules   Certain practices by companies in e commerce markets may restrict competition by unduly limiting how products are distributed throughout the EU   Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement  The e commerce sector inquiry is part of the European Commission s campaign to overhaul the bloc s digital market in a bid to boost growth and catch up with the United States and Asia  The Commission collected about 8 000 distribution and license agreements and gathered information from retailers  manufacturers  price comparison websites  e commerce platforms and providers of films  sports  fiction  TV and music   The insight gained from the sector inquiry will enable the Commission to target EU antitrust enforcement in European e commerce markets  which will include opening further antitrust investigations   the Commission said  The EU executive found that manufacturers increasingly use selective distribution systems where products can only be sold by pre authorized sellers  giving them more control over distribution  price and brand image  Almost half of the manufacturers using selective distribution systems blocked pure online retailers  such as eBay Inc  O EBAY   from selling their products  The online shopping platform welcomed the report and encouraged the Commission to launch targeted investigations   The report also shows that marketplace bans prevent a significant number of small business entrepreneurs from selling products on online marketplaces and that these bans harm consumers by limiting choice  increasing prices and hindering cross border trade   said Paul Todd  senior vice president for eBay in EMEA  The report showed that almost 60 percent of providers of digital content such as music  films and TV shows have agreed with the copyright holder to geoblock  namely restricting consumers  access to products and services based on where they are located  Some licensing practices may also make it more difficult for new online business models and services to emerge  the Commission said  It pointed to long term licensing agreements between rights holders and distributors as a possible barrier to new entrants

218327,439843,EBAY,Why We Are Still Avoiding Ebay Stock ,opinion,"Our outlook on eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  has been negative since early 2015  And indeed  eBay stock went exactly nowhere  after moving up and down during the rest of 2015 and the first half of 2016  Things changed in the second half of last year when the bulls decided they have had enough and lifted the price to a new all time high  The uptrend continued and as of today  eBay shares will cost you more than  34 a piece  Does this mean it is time to give up and start buying  According to the   the answer is still  no   The following price chart explains why 
The weekly logarithmic chart of eBay stock allows us to see the wave structure of the entire uptrend since March 2009  It has been more than 8 years  Enough time for the price to draw a complete five wave  between  4 17 and  34 74 so far  Waves I and IV even obey the rule of alternation  since wave I is a sharp zig zag  while wave IV is an   Furthermore  the structure of wave V can hardly be any clearer  Unfortunately for investors  the Elliott Wave theory postulates that every impulse is followed by a correction of three waves of similar magnitude in the opposite direction  So  instead of trusting the bulls and joining them near  34 a share  we think we would be better off to continue avoiding eBay stock for now  because a major pullback is likely to occur soon  Calling a top is difficult  of course  which is why shorting is also not recommended  The best decision  it seems  is to simply stay aside 
In conclusion 
eBay stock has been rising for over 8 years
the trend seems to be exhausted
from an Elliott Wave perspective  staying aside is preferable right now",2017-04-20,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-we-are-still-avoiding-ebay-stock-200183857,200183857

218337,439853,EBAY,Mets  winning mojo helps team flex post Madoff financial muscle ,news,"By Ben Klayman  Reuters    Fans of the New York Mets had bemoaned the negative impact of the Bernie Madoff financial scandal on the Major League Baseball team s payroll until Thursday night s series clinching victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers  With believers now dreaming of the team s first World Series appearance since 2000  the Mets have enjoyed a similar boost off the field with higher attendance and TV ratings  That leads analysts and bankers to believe the club could be at the start of a virtuous cycle  where winning begets higher revenue and even more winning for years to come  Fresh off advancing to the National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs   another rising team with a compelling hard luck history   the Mets have combined low cost  young talent with the amenities of a relatively new home park  Citi Field  which opened in 2009  The best of seven Mets Cubs series begins on Saturday   The stadium  combined with aggressive marketing  combined with youth hope are a great triple play   said Rick Horrow  sports lecturer at Harvard Law School  That optimism seemed far away when owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz were caught up in Madoff s Ponzi scheme  which was uncovered in late 2008 and cost investors  17 billion in principal  While Wilpon denied it  analysts and bankers said the scandal certainly led to the team s lower payrolls   The Mets in 2009 had the second highest payroll in baseball at  142 2 million  but that fell to 21st last year at  84 million  according to Baseball Prospectus  This year it has risen to  101 3 million  which still ranks as 21st  In 2010  the trustee in charge of recovering money for Madoff victims filed a  1 billion lawsuit against Wilpon  Katz and more than 100 other defendants  claiming they turned a blind eye to the fraud  a charge they denied  The figure was later limited to  386 million by a federal judge  Wilpon and Katz settled that lawsuit in 2012 by agreeing to give up their claims to all but  16 million of the  178 million they lost in the Madoff fraud  though it is unlikely they will recover any funds   In addition  the settlement calls for Wilpon and Katz to pay as much as  29 million over the next two years to help repay other Madoff customers who lost money in the scheme   But the team and its finances are now on an upward trajectory    We were trending upward before the start of the season   Mets chief revenue officer Lou DePaoli said  citing ticket sales and sponsorship deals   Both have accelerated  particularly over the past two months     and we are already in the process of working to grow all these elements for 2016   YOUTH DRIVEN REBOUND  The Mets have racked up wins on the field relying on young  inexpensive star pitchers like Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard  which allowed the team to also add Cuban slugger Yoenis Cespedes in July  This week s playoff run glued some of the biggest names on Wall Street and finance to their TVs  laptops or smartphones for Thursday night s clinching divisional series win against the Dodgers  Devin Wenig  CEO of eBay Inc  O EBAY   attended last weekend s games in Los Angeles   As a displaced New Yorker  I have carried my love of the Mets to Silicon Valley   he told Reuters   There is a sense of renewal for a franchise long overdue for its moment in the spotlight    Mohamed El Erian  the chief economic adviser for financial services company Allianz SE  DE ALVG  and self described  long suffering fan   posted a congratulatory tweet    Mets  Cubs   Should be a great  NLCS  Congratulations  Mets  and  LetsGoMets   The team s winning this year has helped boost attendance and TV ratings  which translates to higher revenue  pushing the value of the franchise higher  Forbes magazine valued the team at  1 35 billion in March  the seventh highest valuation in the sport and up 69 percent from the year before  Only three other teams had higher estimated growth  Mets attendance totaled 2 569 753 people this season  an increase of 18 percent from last year  However  that still lags the more than 3 1 million the team drew in Citi Field s first year in 2009 and analysts said there is no excuse for a New York team not to draw at least 3 million fans   When you have teams like the Mets     that have struggled for a few years  when the team starts to perform well it is really heartening for our business to see the fans flock back   MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told Reuters  REVENUE SWEET SPOT  While ticket prices at Citi Field rank only 18th in the 30 team league at an average of  25 apiece according to Team Marketing Report  there is risk with raising prices too fast and then having a possibly mediocre 2016  said Robert Tilliss  chief executive of sports banker Inner Circle Sports    You ve generated a little bit more revenue in that case  but now you ve agitated your fan base  It s definitely a delicate balance   he said  One element in the team s favor is a wealthy fan base that has been waiting for a winner to return  which suggests huge upside for team revenue    It s kind of like cicadas   said Marc Ganis  president of consulting firm Sportscorp Ltd   They stay dormant under the ground  but my goodness when they come out seven years later  they come out in force and are as loud as can be   That is reflected in higher merchandise sales   almost double last year s levels compared with industry average growth of 5 6 percent   Mets viewer ratings also spiked 68 percent this year on SportsNet New York  the regional sports TV network the team partly owns  and that translates to higher ad rates  analysts and bankers said  It was the most watched season since 2010  Meanwhile  Madoff  77  the man blamed by many for the Mets  years of losing  is serving his 150 year prison term after pleading guilty in 2009 to masterminding the scheme  Listed under the register number 61727 054  he is not set to be released until Nov  14  2139  according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website   
Madoff could not be reached for comment from the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner  North Carolina  where he is being held  But there is plenty of reason for him  along with Mets fans everywhere  to have hopes for better days ahead for the team ",2015-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mets'-winning-mojo-helps-team-flex-post-madoff-financial-muscle-366614,366614

218346,439862,EBAY,Today s Trading Plan  Rate Day,opinion,"Technical Analysis 
The S P 500  SPX  keeps marching higher with little resistance to counter its momentum  rising another 14 points towards the goal of 2300 
Even more so  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  is up 22 of the last 26 days  over 84  win rate  and has made new all time highs 7 days in a row 
Despite all of this bullish price action  you have the VIX that has risen for the fourth time in the last five days  and breadth in the market isn t resoundingly strong 
Today the Federal Reserve will likely announce a rate hike in its FOMC Statement at 2pm eastern  followed by a press conference with Janet Yellen at 2 30pm eastern  Expect there to be some volatility in price movement for the stock market 
Last year when the FOMC announced its expected rate hike on December 16  2015  the market actually rallied hard that day  but the two days that followed resulted in a sharp sell off 
Volume on SPDRs S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   saw an increase in its volume for a second consecutive day as well as above average volume overall 
If there was ever a moment for a blow off top  a buy the rumor  sell the news kind of price action  this would be it  The banks and the market as a whole has largely priced in a rate hike  so it would not surprise me at all  if we eventually see a sell off reminiscent to the sell off we saw in December last year 
Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures   CL  has struggled to move beyond the trading range of the past two days  and stands to sell off some today  Some retraction in oil prices is likely a given at this point in time 
Nasdaq  COMPQ  decided to get be a market leader once again  and the main reason for yesterday s broad market strength 
Though it went through the end of the day ritual of getting pummeled prior to the close  the CBOE Volatility Index still managed to close higher on the day  At this point  there is a divergence in equities and the price action I am seeing on VIX  but it is not drastic enough to do anything with at this point 
SPX 30 minute chart remains very much overextended  That is really all you can say about it at this point

218356,439872,EBAY,Should Facebook  FB  Buy EBay  EBAY   ,opinion,"Shares of online marketplace eBay   NASDAQ EBAY   are down over 10  since the company reported its fiscal 2016 results after the closing bell Wednesday  Investors are reacting negatively to eBay s sluggish holiday season guidance  however  some on the internet are pointing to the company s new partnership with Facebook   NASDAQ FB   as an encouraging sign for growth or a potential buyout 
Lackluster Guidance 
eBay posted third quarter earnings of 45 cents per shares  which beat average analyst expectations by a penny  The company saw revenue figures of  2 22 billion  beating our consensus estimate of  2 182 billion and gaining 5 6  year over year 
Despite two beats  investors punished eBay for what was seen as relatively lackluster guidance  For the fourth quarter  eBay expects to see revenue of  2 36 billion to  2 41 billion and adjusted earnings of 52 to 54 cents per share  Wall Street analysts were previously calling for revenue of  2 40 billion and earnings of 54 cents per share  also read    
Perhaps the worst part about eBay s weak fourth quarter guidance is that  by all accounts  this year is gearing up to have a solid holiday shopping season 
Research from the  predicts that holiday sales  excluding autos  gas  and restaurant sales  will increase 3 6   which is  significantly higher  than the 10 year average of 2 5  and above the seven year post recovery average of 3 4   also read    
New Relationship with Facebook
While eBay s fourth quarter guidance is unsettling  some investors are looking forward to the company s new partnership with Facebook  The social media site has employed eBay to help it launch a shopping bot on its Messenger app 
Once dubbed  ShopBot   the artificial intelligence technology is expected to drive sales to Facebook  which has been looking for ways to employ bots without overloading users  Facebook s Messenger application has over one billion users  but the company currently does not have a way to monetize the transactions that take place on the platform 
A struggling eBay s new found friendship has  of course  sparked rumors and commentary on the web  with many suggesting that Facebook should go even further by buying out the online marketplace 
We do know that Facebook is gaining interest in e commerce  the site just recently launched  Marketplace   a sort of Craigslist eBay hybrid that allows users to buy and sell items from other users that are within the same geographical area  also read    
If Facebook is willing to try out its own online shopping platform  is it too unrealistic to think that it might want to carve out a main competitor  Personally  I don t think it is crazy at all  especially considering the fact that eBay is basically the original online re selling platform 
Marketplace could keep its focus on local sales  and eBay could continue to allow shipping to anywhere  Listings could be cross posted on both sites and  using Facebook s plethora of user data  customers could be targeted with products that would interest them specifically 
Bottom Line
At this point  any conversation about Facebook buying out eBay is simply an unfounded internet rumor  However  just because a rumor is unfounded doesn t mean it s inherently a bad idea  In my humble opinion  if the price is right  an eBay buyout could make sense for Facebook

218357,439873,EBAY,eBay Drops On Low Q4 Guidance,opinion,"eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  recently announced stronger than expected third quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday  However  the company provided fourth quarter guidance that was lower than the average analyst estimate  sending shares plunging in after hours trading 
The company posted revenue of  2 2 billion  surpassing the consensus estimate of  2 18 billion  The figures indicate a 1 percent increase year over year  but a slowdown from 6 percent growth in the second quarter  eBay disclosed earnings of 45 cents per share  beating analysts  forecast of 44 cents 
Shares of eBay lost 7 69 percent to  30 02 in after hours trading  following the company s announcement of a soft outlook for the current quarter  After the market close  eBay said it projects adjusted per share earnings between 52 cents and 54 cents on revenue between  2 36 billion and  2 41 billion for the fourth quarter 
Attempts to generate more value from its data and utilize that to create revenue got the company a target hike ahead of third quarter earnings  Market experts increased their price target on eBay stock to 36 from 34  considering the company s opportunity on its structured data initiative  The initiative is developed to prompt faster user growth  reduce the cost of traffic acquisition  and improve the user experience   making it easier for customers to find the best products on its site 
According to eBay s President and CEO  Devin N  Wenig  the company s plan was to maintain a low to mid single digit top line growth rate and keep margins and cash flow high 
eBay Introduces New Portal
eBay recently launched a new portal  named eBay Collective   which will feature high end artwork  furniture  and interior designs   in an attempt to curate a variety of products for its customers 
The company s new platform will apply an AI powered tool to assist shoppers in searching for items  which could help this initiative attain a good outcome by boosting conversion rates 
The new site is centered on rare and high end items  The company reviewed and partnered with particular dealers to participate in the program  and it is offering a  white glove managed shipping service  that grants flat rate on longer distance shipments in the United States  Despite a possible crossover with rivals  eBay seems to be promoting inventory from popular designers that carry rare and high priced products 
A  Shop the Room  feature is added to the new platform  This suggests specific items for purchase that mirrors generic items in a picture 
The success of the new eBay portal will depend on the performance of its artificial intelligence in driving conversions  eBay Collective may grapple to drive actual sales  as shoppers will likely be hesitant to purchase a vintage or rare item over the internet without seeing it in person  On the other hand  sales of larger items such as furniture  are moving to the web ",2016-10-20,Trade12,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-drops-on-low-q4-guidance-200159760,200159760
218358,439874,EBAY,The Week Ahead  Time For A Portfolio Transition ,opinion,"There is some important data on the schedule for this week  along with earnings and the expected doses of FedSpeak  None of that will attract much attention  Instead expect  all Trump  all the time   The slant in financial media will be the implications for investors  As we get news of the leadership transition  I expect the punditry to be asking 
Do investment portfolios need a transition  
Last Week
Last week s economic news was all good  but less important than the election 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted a focus on the election and the chances for greater economic and financial clarity  The election expectation was obvious  and there was indeed a focus on the implications for investors  That said  I embraced the consensus expectations which proved to be dramatically incorrect  I did correctly note that the crystal ball would remain cloudy  but that proved to be quite an understatement 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500 from Doug Short  He captures the post election rally as well as the Friday fizzling 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read his entire post where he adds analysis grounded in data and several more charts providing long term perspective  Here is one additional example 

The big story of the trading week does not show up in the stock market data  As the Trump victory became apparent  overnight trading in stock futures showed a massive decline  This chart shows the selling and the morning rebound 

The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
This week s news was quite good  If I missed something for the  bad  list  please feel free to suggest it in the comments 
The Good 
Election uncertainty ended  This was a known  market friendly event  although the amount of the reaction was a surprise 
Framing lumber demand drives higher prices  Those who prefer market data to other source should take note of the  
Earnings reports continue strength on all measures  Earnings growth  results versus expectations  sales versus expectations  and outlook are all solid     It is not getting much attention  but the  earnings recession  is over   provided the first alert on this dramatic shift  and now points to a possible expansion in multiples  Ed Yardeni shows the impact via changed expectations 

Michigan sentiment showed strength with a reading of 91 6  solidly beating the prior month and expectations  The survey was before the election 
JOLTS remained positive  This may be the most misunderstood indicator  Pundits use it to analyze job growth  because that is what they want to know about  Many other measures do that job better  JOLTS is about the structure of the labor market  How tight things are and whether employees freely leave jobs for others  If you do not understand the Beveridge Curve  you do not understand JOLTS 

Initial jobless claims declined to 254K  marking 88 consecutive weeks below 300K  This is the best record since 1970  Calculated Risk  and a helpful chart 

The Bad 
OPEC output jumped  This calls into question the planned production cuts  Whether you agree with me that stock prices should not be linked to oil prices  that continues to be the reality  Thus   this news is market unfriendly    
The Ugly 
Financial abuse of the elderly  Reshma Kapadia of Barron s has a great  on this topic  describing the various scams and consequences  Here are a few of the top ones 

The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  No award this week  Nominations are welcome 
Noteworthy 
Could you pass the U S  Citizenship Test  You might enjoy the   Example  Who was not one of the writers of the Federalist papers  John Jay  James Madison  Alexander Hamilton  or Thomas Jefferson  Mrs  OldProf tells me that this one is too easy if you scored a ticket to  and paid attention 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar 
We have an important week for economic data  with a special focus on housing 
The  A  List 
Housing starts and building permits  Th   Different directions in recent reports 
Retail sales  T   Continuing strength expected 
Initial claims  Th   The best concurrent indicator for employment trends 
The  B  List 
Philly Fed  Th   Continuing small gains expected in an early read on November 
Industrial production  W   Small growth expected despite recent weakness 
PPI  W   Still not a major market factor  but moving higher 
CPI  Th   Not the Fed s  official  inflation indicator  but it is moving beyond the target 
Business inventories  T   September data  but relevant for final Q3 GDP 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
There are still some earnings reports  including housing stocks  Once again we also have almost daily Fedspeak  We ll get to watch some dancing around the political questions 
Next Week s Theme 
In a different year  this would be a week for special attention to housing  The economic data feature some important forward looking indicators and earnings reports include important housing related stocks  Instead  the surprised investment community is scrambling to identify the implications of a Trump presidency and a GOP Congress  Regular media will have daily reports of transition plans  cabinet appointments  and shifting policy stances  Financial media will focus on what it means for investors  Expect this question to be a common theme 
Does your portfolio need a complete remake  
Here are the important issues 
Has the best asset allocation shifted  More stocks  less bonds 
Is the overall market more dangerous  Time for more cash 
What are the likely economic consequences  in both the short and long terms  The  has a nice general summary  loaded with charts  about the economy Mr  Trump will inherit 
Which stock sectors are likely to benefit  and by how much 
Are there specific stock favorites 
Traders rushed to act  frequently on hastily and ill formed ideas  The overnight futures trading is a spectacular example  but most of the other conclusions are also quite speculative  Consider how wrong many of the big names in investments have been  Citi  Goldman and Bridgewater Associates all expected declines of 3   10  on a Trump victory  Even after the market was rallying  many of the pros were expecting the story to end at any moment  As   the three errors included the event itself  the impact  and the aftermath 
I  in a message to my readers  the morning after    Clients got more detail   Check out the post for my list of four key points 
As one person noted in the comments  using patience left you behind on some day trading possibilities  True enough  if you guessed well  Would stocks down 6  continue to decline or stocks up 6  keep ascending 
I ll have a few ideas of my own about what comes next in today s  Final Thoughts

Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be the cool headed and accurate analysis from Liz Ann Sonders    This coverage of Schwab s IMPACT 2016  the largest conference in the investor business  Robert Huebscher continually brings the best analysis to advisors through special posts  I always read them along with many other advisors  but they are not a secret  You too can see what the advisor community is following  Here is a key quote on valuation 

 Valuation metrics can support any view of the market   she said  The metrics that are dependent on an inflation or interest rate component show that the market is cheap  she said  But metrics such as the forward P E ratio show a median valuation  Sonders said that valuations tend to be highest when inflation is 2 3   just above its current range   But inflation going higher is a risk for P E ratios   she explained 

A slavish devotion to valuation indicators that ignore low interest rates has been an expensive mistake for investors  Here is a chart of the ETF modeled on Prof Shiller s famous CAPE ratio  Despite the professor s repeated statements that he is personally invested and recommends a significant stock allocation  his work is most frequently cited as indicating potential for a market crash  That is not his personal interpretation  The Barclay s ETF uses CAPE to find the most attractive sectors  and it remains fully invested 
Suppose that each of the CAPE devotees who went to cash because of alarming valuations had allocated just 25  of the portfolio to the CAPE fund   Not that this has been the very best choice  but it illustrates the Shiller contrast very well

Personal Finance 
Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for over ten years  If you are a serious investor managing your own account  you should join us in adding this to your daily reading  Every investor should make time for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in his  There are always several great choices worth reading  My personal favorite this week is the advice on how to handle market volatility from Christine Benz     She easily clears the first hurdle   the temptation to give blanket advice  Each investor is different  She offers time frame as one important consideration  If investors want to copy what I do with clients  this article provides a good basic outline 

As you gauge whether to make any changes in light of the volatility  the really important concept to keep on your radar is risk capacity what sort of losses can you endure without having to rework a goal 


If you still have a reasonably long time until retirement say  10 years or more you have a fairly high risk capacity  That means that regardless of how you feel about near term losses  you re likely to recover from them during your time horizon  In fact  stocks have generated positive returns in more than 90  of rolling 10 year periods  For that reason  such investors ought to have aggressively positioned portfolios with at least 50  in stocks  given today s low bond and cash yields  a more conservatively positioned portfolio will barely preserve purchasing power  let alone grow 

Seeking Alpha Editor Gil Weinreich was one of the few to highlight the possibility of a Trump victory  and do so with confidence  He reasoned from the Brexit precedent and a sense of the popular uprising  In a helpful and constructive fashion  he disagreed with my highlighted sources in last week s WTWA  While his work is popular among investment advisors writing on Seeking Alpha  the topics are frequently important for active individual investors 
Out of the several helpful posts last week  my favorite was the   and appreciated the mention  to follow your plan rather than the election  This is especially persuasive from someone who called the election result  The money line from Gil 
But as we all know  investing is best accomplished unemotionally

Watch out for  
Dividend stocks  Many observers opined that this week s decline in the bond substitutes was only the start   I agree   The  have a different take  While they are looking for buying opportunities  here are the early returns 

Final Thoughts 
Last week I embraced the conclusions from the polling community  which was dramatically incorrect  They are preparing post mortems  They will try to figure out the sources of error and improve their methods  because that is what professionals do  Of the sources I cited last week  Nate Silver was the best  Even his methods gave Mr  Trump only about a 30  chance  That is not high enough to predict the outcome  but it should get one s attention  I will be doing my own review of what went wrong with the pollsters  and whether we gave them too much credit 
I was more accurate concerning what investors should be doing about the election  I have expected a market rally after the election  if only because a big element of uncertainty would be removed  I also have warned that plenty of uncertainty will remain 
If you allowed your political preferences to influence your investing  you probably have had poor results  If you have been sticking to the fundamentals   a solid portfolio of cheap stocks   you are doing well 
What s Next  
As I write this we have already seen a change in the Trump transition leadership and acceptance of some elements of ObamaCare  Each policy needs fresh scrutiny  using the following elements 
The possible difference between candidate Trump and President Trump
Which proposals were serious
The effect of actual responsibility
The influence of the team

The limitations of power  See this  on what Truman said about Eisenhower 
The potential for compromises
I will look at these questions on a policy by policy basis  discovering the changes in value in the related stocks  Many journalists and pundits are on this job  of course  but the instant conclusions are unreliable  Even the best journalists and financial analysts have little experience in analyzing the workings of the policymaking process

At this time  eBay s stock has a subpar Growth score of  D   a grade with the same score on the momentum front  However  the stock was allocated a grade of  B  on the value side  putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy  This solid grade on the value front does little for EBAY s overall picture though  as the company currently retains a  D  Grade for its VGM score  making it a poor overall choice from a fundamental look  
Outlook
While estimates have been trending upward for the stock  the magnitude of these revisions has been almost zero  Interestingly shares of EBAY have a Zacks Rank   3  hold   so we are looking for an in line return from EBAY in the next few months and no real upside for investors right now

218370,439886,EBAY,Facebook Takes On E Commerce With Marketplace ,opinion,"On Monday  social media giant Facebook Inc    NASDAQ FB   has launched what it calls Marketplace  a way for users to buy  sell  and discover items in their local community 
Marketplace will be rolled out to Facebook users 18 and older in the U S   the U K   Australia  and New Zealand in the coming days  To access it  users will need to open the Facebook app and tap the shop icon at the bottom  it opens up with pictures of items that people near your location have listed for sale  You can also search to find something specific  and results can be filtered by price  location  and category 

If you re a seller  the process is quite simple  take a photo of the item you are trying to sell  enter a product name  price  and description  confirm your location  select a category  and post 
If you re a customer  and end up finding something you would like to buy  the purchase process is also easy  you simply have to send the seller a direct message from Marketplace and make an offer  From there  any further details are worked out between you and the seller  Facebook s director of product management Mary Ku said in a  the company will not  facilitate the payment or delivery of items in Marketplace  
As  pointed out  Facebook has been trying to enter the commerce market for a while now  and Marketplace is a sort of evolution of its past efforts  including users  ability to use Messenger to send payments  Because of its huge user base it recently reached over 1 5 billion users Facebook s Marketplace has the opportunity to surpass e commerce stalwarts like eBay Inc    NASDAQ EBAY   and Craigslist 
There s also an element of trust with Marketplace that is absent from a platform like Craigslist  as your Facebook profile can be viewed by potential buyers  It will be much more difficult for scammers to be successful on Marketplace than on Craigslist  It s also a convenient way to shop  Instead of exiting the Facebook app and opening another shopping app  users can browse through a wide range of products after they scroll through their News Feed 

Image via  Facebook
 We found that the vast majority of people just like to browse  They don t have a specific item in mind  They are just scrolling through the feed and seeing if there s anything that might interest them   said Marketplace product manager Bowen Pan to TechCrunch 
 It mimics some of the offline shopping behavior of going to a Sunday market or to the mall  You might not know the items you want  but you re open to seeing them   Pan continued  And this is true  With Marketplace  Facebook has the opportunity to capitalize on shoppers  browsing habits online as well as in brick and mortar stores 
If Marketplace proves successful in the four initial countries  Facebook expects to continue to expand the service to additional countries via its iOS and Android apps over the next few months ",2016-10-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/facebook-takes-on-e-commerce-with-marketplace-200156848,200156848

218372,439888,EBAY,Facebook Blames  Technical Issue  For Illegal Listings On Marketplace,opinion,"Just one day after the launch of its new e commerce platform  Marketplace  was marred by listings for illegal products  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   is saying that a  technical issue  is to blame for numerous posts advertising drugs  animals  and adult services on the site 
Facebook director of product management Mary Ku told  that the company is  working to fix the problem  
The social media giant rolled out the new Marketplace platform to all users over the age of 18 in the U S   U K   Australia  and New Zealand this week after several months of testing in limited markets  A new shop icon was added to the Facebook app  allowing users to see pictures of items for sale near them 
Transactions are finalized through direct message communication between the buyer and seller  and all the other details  including payment method and delivery  are worked out without the help of Facebook 
If this business model sounds familiar  it s probably because you ve already heard of or used Craigslist  a location based online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers  Just like Craigslist  Marketplace is relatively hands off and users have to arrange meeting up on their own 
Marketplace actually seems to improve upon Craigslist s ideas by allowing potential buyers to view the Facebook profiles of sellers  which should deter scammers  Facebook s entrance into the e commerce business should also scare other reselling websites like eBay   NASDAQ EBAY

EBAY is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   where has PYPL is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   and below is a comparison between the two companies  showing why EBAY is a better buy than PYPL 
Ebay Inc    NASDAQ EBAY  
Ebay Inc  is one of the largest online trading communities  The company creates a powerful marketplace for the sale of goods and services by a passionate community of individuals and small businesses  eBay enables trade on a local  national  and international basis with local sites in numerous markets in the U S  and country specific sites in the UK  Canada  Germany  Austria  France  Italy  Japan  Korea and Australia 
As mentioned  eBay is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and it should be noted that it operates in an industry which is ranked in the top 40  of all industries by Zacks  The company also has a B for its Value Style Score  which is backed up by a PE ratio of 15 68  an earnings yield of 6 37   and cash flow per share of 2 17 
EBay has also seen positive EPS estimate revision activity as of late both for the current quarter and for the current year  which has raised the consensus estimate for both time periods  Recently the stock was upgraded to  outperform  by an analyst from Baird  who gave the stock a price target of  30

PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   and has a Value Style Score of a D  The low Style Score can be attributed to a high PE ratio of 31 97  cash flow per share of only 1 59  and a price to sales ratio of 4 45  Analysts have been lowering their EPS estimates for the company as of late  both for the current year and quarter  Estimates for next quarter and next year have been lowered recently as well

Bottom Line
Analysts revision activity and a stock s Zacks Rank are great indicators for the way a stock is likely headed  When analysts lower their earnings estimates  they are likely losing excitement in the stock s returns  but on the other hand  when they raise estimates  they become more bullish on the stock  With eBay s higher Zacks Rank  better Value Style Score  and rising EPS estimates  right now it s looking like the better buy when compared with PayPal  which has a lower Zacks Rank  decreasing EPS estimates  and a more expensive relative price tag ",2016-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-ebay-now-a-better-buy-than-paypal-200141950,200141950

SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    EBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  trimmed its full year revenue forecast on Wednesday  signaling a weaker than expected holiday shopping season for the e commerce company as it prepares to split from its fast growing payments arm  PayPal 

EBay s report comes as weak economic data from the United States and China fan fears of a global slowdown  forcing investors to re examine the world economy only just emerging from one of the worst recessions in history 

 We ve gotten indications from some luxury retailers over the last couple of days that times have been more challenging   said Scott Kessler  equity analyst at S P Capital IQ 

 There are a lot of question marks when it comes to the sentiment on spending of consumers as we approach the holiday shopping season  

EBay shares fell more than 3 percent in after hours trading 

U S  retail sales  which account for about one third of consumer spending  recorded their first decline since January last month 

Some analysts expressed concern over eBay s marketplaces division  which grew less than some forecast 

Kessler added that eBay s notable exposure to Europe might have also played a role in depressing its outlook 

EBay earned 68 cents per share in the third quarter  in line with the average analyst estimate of 67 cents per share  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 

The results comes weeks after eBay announced it was spinning off its PayPal payments unit in 2015 

EBay cut its full year revenue outlook to between  17 85 billion and  17 95 billion from its previous range of  18 billion to  18 3 billion 



The company also forecast fourth quarter revenue of less than  5 billion  falling short of the  5 2 billion expected by Wall Street  EBay expects fourth quarter earnings per share between 88 cents and 91 cents  while Wall Street expected 91 cents

In a Q A session at the company s annual shareholder meeting on 13 May  Donahoe said bitcoin is  a new  exciting and emerging technology  with lot of potential 

 We think bitcoin will play a very important role in the future  Exactly how that plays out  and how we can best take advantage of it and enable it with PayPal  that s something we re actively considering  It s on our radar screen  
This is not the first time Donahoe has spoken about his positive view of bitcoin 
In an interview with Bloomberg in February  he said that multiple digital currencies can be integrated into PayPal and are not posing a threat to his business 
Nothing holding us back
 There is nothing holding PayPal back from pursuing digital payments today  as part of eBay  In fact PayPal is pursuing digital payments and is the leading digital payments alternative in many different environments   Donahoe said 
 You can use digital currencies in the PayPal digital wallet  that s in fact what PayPal is doing   is building a digital wallet that can take multiple types of currency  
Last month eBay launched a virtual currency section of its US website  allowing users buy andsell digital currencies  as well as mining contracts and mining equipment 
In the UK  bitcoin owners would be able to list on the site s classifieds section  allowing the buying and selling of the cryptocurrency  Deals in classified ad formats mean actual transactions of bitcoins would take place outside of eBay 
EBay is still not accepting bitcoin or other digital currencies for payments  Its payment processing unit PayPal is facing stiff competition from bitcoin

on  or 66 cents per share  compared to  927 million  or 57 cents per share  a year earlier  Revenue is projected to be  4 55 billion  up 14 1 percent from  3 99 billion in the last quarter of 2012 
Excluding items  analysts expect earnings per share of 80 cents compared with 70 cents in the fourth quarter of last year 
Analysts appear underwhelmed as consensus earnings per share are even lower than the bottom range of the company s own earnings guidance of 67 to 69 cents  which was published at the time of its third quarter earnings release 

ChannelAdvisor  the third party traffic tracker  reported that in terms of eBay s Marketplaces  reported that eBay com s same store sales  SSS  grew by 11 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013  significantly slower than the 18 9 percent year on year growth in the third quarter  Though it is worth noting that correlation between ChannelAdvisor SSS data and eBay Marketplaces revenue has been lessening in the past year  as the company focused on growing relationships with larger merchants  according to a Goldman Sachs research note 
Two other factors may have some impact on revenue in the last quarter  The holiday season was six days shorter in 2013 compared to 2012  and eBay may have benefited at the margin from more shoppers moving online  However  eBay likely suffered from longer shipping times for many of its sellers  and also faces a tough comparison with its fourth quarter results in 2012  As such  the company provided a cautious holiday outlook  which appears to be in line with the ChannelAdvisor data and analyst forecasts 
 We are forecasting Marketplaces revenue of  2 26 billion   Goldman Sachs analysts wrote   We expect growth to be 10 2 percent in 4Q  which assumes a neutral to slightly positive FX impact

218454,439970,EBAY,Carl Icahn Goes After EBay s Board,news,"By    In a harshly worded letter dispatched to shareholders of eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  on Monday  billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn criticized the Internet company s management and its board over various aspects of corporate governance 
 The complete disregard for accountability at eBay is the most blatant we have ever seen  Indeed  for the first time in our long history  we have encountered a situation where we believe we should not even have to run a proxy fight to change the board composition   Icahn wrote in the open letter  and reiterated his demand that eBay should spin payment gateway PayPal off into a separate company 
EBay fired off a quick response to Icahn s letter  defending board members Marc Andreessen and Scott Cook  whom Icahn had singled out for criticism in the letter for investing in companies such as Boku  Bitcoin Wallet Coinbase  and Intuit  all of which  he said  compete directly with eBay 

 New eBay shareholder Carl Icahn has cherry picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context to attack the integrity of two of the most respected  accomplished and value driven technology leaders in Silicon Valley   the company statement said  adding   The overlap between Intuit and eBay is small  fully disclosed and within the SEC safe harbor for interlocking directorates  
Icahn also went after eBay CEO John Donahoe stating that Donahoe was  feeding information to competitors on the eBay board  and appeared to  lack awareness about what is going on around him  
 The CEO seems to be completely asleep or  even worse  either naive or willfully blind to these grave lapses of accountability and stockholder value destruction   Icahn said in the letter 
According to Icahn  eBay s board consists of two directors who hold stakes in companeies directly competing with eBay and another demanding to cease hiring at eBay  Icahn also accused other board members of funding competitors and looking for personal gains at the expense of eBay s shareholders 
 Regarding hiring  this is old news  any restrictions ended years ago  and Intuit historically had not been a source of talent for eBay Inc   eBay s statement said 
Icahn also raised fingers at Andreessen s support for the company s acquisition of Skype and its subsequent sale to Microsoft for  8 5 billion  He stated that the transaction had cost the stockholders hugely and only benefited private equity firms to the tune of  4 billion 
The 77 year old billionaire  who owns more than 2 percent of eBay and put two of his own employees on its board last month  also questioned Cook s stake in Intuit  a competing business with PayPal in which Cooke has a stake worth  1 billion 
 How can the board have a conversation about the strategy or performance of PayPal when a representative of a direct competitor who has so much at stake is in the room  Even worse  Mr  Cook also apparently believes he can tell eBay whom the company cannot hire   Icahn wrote in the letter 
Icahn also renewed his calls for the company to split PayPal and eBay into two separate companies and asked shareholders to vote for the two directors appointed by him to the board because eBay needs  fresh stockholder representation on the board to steer it towards long term success and away from becoming yet another example of a technology company with a management team and board that refused to adapt  
According to Forbes  PayPal s co founder Elon Musk also supports the plan to separate the two companies 
 It doesn t make sense that a global payment system is a subsidiary of an auction website  It s as if Target owned Visa or something   Musk said  according to Forbes  If PayPal were to be made a standalone business it could eventually have a valuation of  100 billion  according to Musk

  Adds comment  updates prices  changes byline 
 By Jessica Mortimer
 LONDON  Oct 22  Reuters    The dollar rose broadly on
Thursday  recovering from 14 month lows versus the euro and a
currency basket as weaker corporate earnings and falls in equity
and commodity markets dampened investor appetite for risk 
 Commodity linked currencies such as the Australian  Canadian
and New Zealand dollars fell  coming off recent multi month
highs versus the U S  dollar as European shares and oil prices
lost more than 1 percent 
 Disppointing earnings from eBay Inc on Wednesday were
compounded on Thursday by below forecast results from Ericsson 
cooling some of the recent optimism about prospects for a global
economic recovery 
  Dollar strength fits with lower risk appetite and falling
stock markets   said Johan Javeus  SEB currency strategist in
Stockholm 
  Currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars have
had a good run over the last few weeks and this is a good
opportunity to take some profit   he added 
 Earlier  the U S  dollar had also benefited from Chinese
growth data  Although growth accelerated the numbers
disappointed some in the market who had expected even stronger
expansion  prompting selling in higher yielding currencies 
 But the dollar stayed not far from multi month lows  with
the euro just below the  1 50 level it scaled on Wednesday  and
analysts expect its downtrend to resume on the view that U S 
interest rates will stay low while the global economy improves 
 By 1146 GMT  the dollar had gained 0 4 percent against a
basket of currencies to 75 258  pulling back from a 14 month low
of 74 940 touched the previous day 
 The euro was down 0 1 percent on the day at  1 4997  though
it was still within sight of  1 5047 hit on Wednesday  its
strongest since August 2008 
  The euro s proximity to  1 50 suggests that the market is
not taking the current correction as too serious   said Michael
Klawitter  senior currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt 
 Among riskier currencies  the Australian dollar fell 0 4
percent to  0 9229  the New Zealand dollar lost 0 5 percent to
 0 7549 while the U S  dollar gained 0 6 percent against its
Canadian counterpart to C 1 0490 
 Sterling also fell against the dollar and the euro  stalling
a dramatic rally in the past nine days  after UK retail sales
showed no growth in September  confounding expectations for a
rise 

 RIKSBANK HOLDS RATES
 The Swedish crown lost ground after the country s central
bank held interest rates at a record low 0 25 percent and
forecast they would stay near zero for another year
 The decision was broadly expected  but analysts said there
was some surprise at its move to pump another 100 billion
Swedish crowns   14 5 billion  into banks with 11 month
fixed rate loans 
 SEB s Javeus said one reason behind the crown s fall was
that market participants had speculated that the central bank s
tone could be more optimistic this time round 
  The market had perhaps been taking a small bet that the
Riksbank would deliver a more hawkish tone  saying that things
had improved a bit quicker   he said 
 The euro rose 0 4 percent against the Swedish currency to

 By Steven C  Johnson
 NEW YORK  Oct 22  Reuters    The dollar rose on Thursday 
rebounding from a 14 month low against the euro  as
disappointing corporate earnings dented demand for higher
yielding currencies and assets 
 Commodity linked currencies  such as the Australian and
Canadian dollars  retreated from around 15 month peaks while
European shares fell  and oil prices shed 1 percent 
 Disappointing earnings from eBay Inc on Wednesday and
Thursday s below forecast results from Ericsson  cooled some of
the recent optimism about a global recovery 
 That caused investors to take profits on recent gains in
the euro and other currencies  which have rallied against the
dollar on the view that U S  interest rates will stay at record
lows well into 2010  leaving Asia to lead economic recovery 
 Low rates make the dollar less attractive to investors than
higher yield currencies more closely correlated with recovery 
  We ve seen a big move across a host of assets lately and a
lot of people are looking for when we re going to top out  so
there s some profit taking today   said Camilla Sutton  senior
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto  But Sutton
also said the theme remains dollar negative 
 Michael Klawitter  senior currency strategist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt  said   the euro s proximity to  1 50
suggests that the market is not taking the current correction
too seriously  
 The euro was last down 0 1 percent at  1 4999 after hitting
a 14 month peak of  1 5046 Wednesday  The dollar rose 0 5
percent to 91 46 yen and sterling fell 0 3 percent to  1 6553
off Wednesday s one month high above  1 66 
 Sterling s dip stalled a nine day rally  and data showing
UK retail sales were flat in September helped slow the pound s
upward momentum 
 Against the Canadian dollar  the greenback rose 0 9 percent
to C 1 0517  off a 15 month low near C 1 02 last week 
 CHINA STIMULUS FEARS
 A rise in first time applications for U S  jobless benefits
showing the U S  labor market remains weak  further denting
risk appetite 
 Earlier  data showing China s economy grew 8 9 percent in
the third quarter prompted some concern that authorities may
start to unwind some emergency stimulus spending  giving the
dollar a modest boost 
 But other analysts said the data was not strong enough to
trigger policy tightening 
  There are fears that when there is a removal of stimulus
the underlying fundamentals won t be enough to drive global
growth  but the truth is there is a lot of growth coming out of
China and that whole region   Sutton said 
 The euro rose 0 4 percent to 10 315 Swedish crowns after
Sweden s central bank held interest rates at a record low 0 25
percent and forecast they would stay near zero for another
year 
 The decision was broadly expected  but analysts said there
was some surprise at its move to pump another 100 billion
Swedish crowns   14 5 billion  into banks with 11 month
fixed rate loans ",2009-10-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/forex-dollar-rebounds-vs-euro-as-risk-appetite-cools-96600,96600

 By Jeremy Gaunt  European Investment Correspondent
 LONDON  Oct 22  Reuters    Disappointing corporate results
knocked equities lower on Thursday  set Wall Street up for a
poor start and helped the dollar bounce off 14 month lows 
 Gold and oil both slipped as the dollar rose  Euro zone
government debt was stronger 
 Investors in Europe and Asia picked up on Wednesday s 
weakness on Wall Street where there was a late sell off of
banking shares and where a wider than expected loss from Boeing
 had hurt overall sentiment 
 After the bell  eBay Inc   the global e commerce
site  forecast fourth quarter profit and revenue at the low end
of analysts  estimates 
 The sour mood was compounded in Europe on Thursday when
Ericsson  posted lower than expected third quarter
core earnings and said sales in its key mobile networks market
were hampered by tough market conditions 
 World stocks as measured by MSCI  were down
0 7 percent with the emerging market component off around 1
percent  
 Europe s FTSEurofirst 300  lost 1 3 percent  Earlier
Japan s Nikkei  closed down 0 6 percent 
 Earnings results have generally been better than expected so
far in this reporting season  particularly in the United States 
but shares are also around year highs  making them susceptible
to a fall if something disappoints 
  The market was poised for a retreat  but I m not expecting
a major correction   said Christian Jimenez  president of Imene
Investment partners  in Paris   At these levels  if all
companies would report satisfying results  that would justify
further gains on the market  
 
 DOLLAR BOUNCE
 The dollar rose broadly  pulling back from a 14 month low
against the euro and a currency basket as global stocks fell 
 The currency has been trading in inverse correlation to
equities in recent months  based on shifting risk appetite among
investors 
 Analysts said the dollar was still on a downward trend
because of generally positive earnings and the view that U S 
interest rates will remain low 
  The euro s proximity to  1 50 suggests that the market is
not taking the current correction as too serious   said Michael
Klawitter  senior currency strategist at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt 
 The euro was down 0 1 percent at  1 4977  after
breaking the  1 50 level on Wednesday  The dollar was up half a
percent against a basket of major currencies  
 Euro zone government bonds were little changed 
 Longer dated paper remained close to near four week lows hit
on Wednesday as the penultimate Federal Reserve purchase of U S 
Treasuries reminded markets that support for government bond
markets from central bank buying may be nearing an end

  Recasts  adds spin off details  background  byline 
   Skype IPO expected by first half of 2010
   EBay shares rise 4 percent
 By Alexandria Sage
 SAN FRANCISCO  April 14  Reuters    EBay Inc said on
Tuesday it would spin off its Skype Web telephone services unit
through an initial public offering  cheering investors who had
prodded the online giant to unload the fast growing 
low revenue business and return cash to shareholders 
 Share of eBay rose 4 percent after hours 
 The move by eBay    which has given up trying to integrate
Skype into its main marketplaces business    could also seen as
placing a  for sale  sign on the unit to fetch offers from
potential buyers 
 San Jose based eBay  which acquired Skype in 2005 for  2 6
billion  has signaled it would be ready to unload the division
for the right price  Recent media reports said the business 
co founders were seeking to bid on the company  and
shareholders have pushed for a sale or spin off 
  We believe operating Skype as a stand alone publicly
traded company is the best path for maximizing its potential  
eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe said in a statement  adding
there were few synergies with the larger company 
 But the outlook for an IPO is still unclear  said
Commresearch analyst Gregory Lundberg 
  The very first thing that I have to say is market
conditions currently would not support an IPO of Skype  
Lundberg said   2010 will be equally questionable unless the
business completely changes course with the launch of the
Blackberry and iPhone applications  
 But  he added   Strategically  something else might happen
altogether  
 The announcement comes a year after Donahoe took the helm
at eBay and said he would evaluate whether the telephone
service was a good fit with the rest of eBay  which also
includes Web payments service PayPal along with its core
auctions business 
 Many on Wall Street raised eyebrows when former eBay head
Meg Whitman purchased Skype  skeptical of the high price tag
and eBay s claims that its customer base of buyers and sellers
would use Web phone calls and the company would benefit from a
strong Web brand 
 Last month at an analyst day  Donahoe said he would make
the right decisions to maximize Skype s value 
 Skype  which posted revenues of  551 million in 2008 
allows international and local calls through the Web  Fellow
Skype customers can call each other for free  a strategy that
has helped to spread the service

218494,440010,EBAY,Column  Ecommerce loses immunity to economy woes   Eric Auchard,news,"   Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist  The opinions expressed
are his own   
 By Eric Auchard
 LONDON  Nov 26  Reuters    For years  Web retailers have
touted their convenience and efficency over conventional
retailers  and enjoyed surging double digit sales growth 
especially in the crucial year end holiday shopping season 
 But the steady draining of consumer confidence reflected in
recent government data and the latest market research reports
suggest the online retail industry is bracing for a humbling
first ever year of flat or even contracting holiday sales 
 Ecommerce  for reasons tied to both the global economic
crash and Web specific factors  is poised to fall harder than
the much maligned retail store industry  itself struggling with
recent high profile bankruptcies and widespread signs that
consumers are looking to sharply curtail their spending 
   Retail spending has not really dropped   says Gian
Fulgoni  chairman of consumer audience measurement firm comScore
Inc   It s ecommerce growth rates that have fallen off a cliff  
 This week  comScore once again cut its forecast for U S 
holiday shopping  reporting that sales in the first 23 days of
November had fallen to  8 2 billion  down 4 percent from a year
earlier 
 Forecasts for online holiday shopping issued in October or
early November took the  glass half full  view of the coming
shopping season    predicting low double digit growth  That
would be below prior years  but healthy versus overall retail 
 The declining outlook comes after third quarter U S 
Department of Commerce data showed dismal October growth online 
Forecasters who had clung to the notion that online retailers
would prove an exception  have changed their tune recently 
 Nonetheless  the consumer tracking firm predicted online
holiday sales for November and December could end flat at around
 29 2 billion  in terms of year over year growth  but only if
there is no further decline in the economy in coming weeks 
 Until recently  comScore had forecast 6 percent growth in
U S  holiday sales  Fulgoni said  Similarly this week  eMarketer
cut its 2008 ecommerce forecast to 4 percent from 10 1 percent 
 Flat growth this season would compare with a 19 percent rise
in 2007 sales  24 percent in 2006 and 26 percent in 2005 
 Overall  the National Retail Federation forecasts total U S 
holiday sales to grow a tepid  but positive  2 2 percent to  470
billion  The includes both classic stores and Web storefronts 
 In statistical terms  online retailers just had farther to
fall than their distressed store based rivals 
 Similarly  in Britain  the exception that once applied to
ecommerce is losing steam fast  Visits to UK shopping sites this
month have declined by 14 percent as of Nov  24  according to
data from online market research firm Hitwise  Declining traffic
has come despite heavy Web discounting activity at big retailers
such as HMV Waterstones and Tesco 
 
 CYBER MONDAY  MISLEADING DATA
 The gloomy forecasts come out just ahead of Cyber Monday 
next week s symbolic start to the U S  online holiday shopping
season 
 Retail industry promoters of the Cyber Monday concept will
tell you this coming Monday is a crucial test of the American
consumer s waning appetite to spend at the holidays 
 Don t believe it 
 If anything  Cyber Monday is one of the worst days from
which to extrapolate year end holiday sales trends  Rather it s
a day of special  one off promotional discounts designed to
remind consumers they can shop online instead of in stores  A
survey by Shopzilla found 84 percent of retailers will have some
sort of Cyber Monday promotion this year  up from 72 percent a
year ago  with the biggest come on in the form of discounts 
 Despite the media hype that surrounds the occasion  Cyber
Monday ranked just ninth among heaviest shopping days in 2007
and is not expected to behave much differently this time around 
 ComScore says online shopping has a few remaining bright
spots  in categories like video games  sports and fitness
products and furniture and appliances 
 But apparel is off and  consumer electronics seems to have
lost its luster   Fulgoni said of falling demand for products
like big screen TVs among online buyers 
  When all is said and done  ecommerce is where disposable
income is spent   says Fulgoni  comScore s co founder 
 Everything has absolutely fallen apart in October and
November  
 Some facets of the online industry may be better positioned
than others  but none are immune  Not pure ecommerce players
such as Amazon com or eBay Inc  not gift card purveyors  nor
multichannel marketers that operate both stores and a Web site 
 Major ecommerce companies derive a disproportionate share of
their revenue from fourth quarter sales  Susquehanna Financial
analyst Marianne Wolk estimates companies such as Amazon com Inc
 or Overstock com Inc derive just over one third of their sales
in the final quarter of the year 
 GSI Commerce  which delivers ecommerce services to retailers
who lack their own Web presence  generates nearly 40 percent of
its annual revenue and a whopping 83 percent of its annual cash
flow in the current quarter  Wolk estimates 
 Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt says falling sales
forecasts have put in peril expectations for many online
retailers  who despite their advantages over offline retailers 
can t alter the fact that consumers are using this holiday
season to contemplate all the ways they can pare back spending

218496,440012,EBAY,Here s What Hedge Funds Are Expecting From EBay On Wednesday,opinion,"With the proliferation of smartphones  it seems inevitable that mobile payments will be the next big step forward in e commerce  Several apps are already competing to conquer the space in both consumer to merchant and peer to peer financial transactions through email and other forms of electronic transfers  eBay s  NASDAQ EBAY  subsidiary PayPal is one of the most established and well known mobile payment platforms out there 
While PayPal s growth has taken off in recent quarters  eBay s core online auction and shopping business has remained relatively quiet  Hedge fund manager and activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in eBay and demanded that eBay spin off PayPal into a separate business  eBay CEO John Donahoe stood his ground and insisted that eBay and PayPal have natural synergies and should be kept together  Icahn backed down from his aggressive stance in April and there is no reason to believe PayPal will be broken off from eBay any time soon 

eBay Inc   EBAY  is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday  July 16th  This quarter 49 contributing analysts on Estimize com have come to a consensus earnings expectation of 70c EPS and  4 390B in revenue compared to a consensus of 68c EPS and  4 378B from Wall Street  Over the previous 6 quarters crowdsourced forward looking financial estimates platform has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting eBay s earnings per share and revenue 5 times and twice resepctively 

Estimize com allows the ranking and sorting of analysts by accuracy  the analyst with the lowest error rate on eBay with at least 2 estimates scored is an information technology professional who goes by the username pedroos  Over 2 estimates  pedroos has averaged an incredibly small error rate of just 0 1   Estimize is completely open and free for anyone to contribute  and the base of contributing analysts on the platform includes hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  non professional investors  and students 
The Estimize consensus was more accurate than the Wall Street consensus 65  of the time last quarter on the coverage of nearly 1000 stocks  A combination of algorithms ensures that the data is not only clean and free from people attempting to game the system  but also weighs past performance and many other factors to gauge future accuracy 

Last quarter eBay reported an atypically large earnings beat  coming in well above the consensus from both Estimize and Wall Street  Over the past 2 years eBay has reported either in line or ahead of the Wall Street consensus in each period  This quarter contributing analysts on the Estimize com platform are expecting eBay to maintain its streak and come in a few cents per share ahead of the Street s consensus  Barring much higher consumer adoption of PayPal than anticipated  there s no clear catalyst to drive earnings too much higher 
On the other hand  two negative one time events from the quarter could threaten eBay s brand going forward  In early June  well respected PayPal chief David Marcus left his post to go take a place on the Facebook  NASDAQ FB  team  Perhaps worse  back in May eBay revealed it was the victim of a cyber attack and recommended that 145 million users change their passwords  Hacking and cyber attacks are an unfortunate reality of the 21st century  but if any company s brand is going to be affected by a cyber attack  it would be a mobile payments company like eBay  

 Graph above from ChartIQ Visual Earnings 
Although there have been a couple of one time events with potential negative consequences this quarter  the Estimize community has come to a consensus forecast that eBay will likely outperform the Wall Street consensus by a small margin this quarter  Contributing analysts are predicting that eBay will beat the Street s EPS projection by 2c  3   per share and edge past revenue estimates by  12 million   1    The Estimize community is also looking for year over year earnings and revenue growth of 11  and 13  respectively compared to FQ2 of last year ",2014-07-16,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here’s-what-hedge-funds-are-expecting-from-ebay-on-wednesday-219541,219541
218497,440013,EBAY,eBay Stock Soars On Rumors Of Possible PayPal Spinoff,opinion,"eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  stock is almost up 5  following a report stating that the company could spin off its cash cow PayPal payments units as early as next year  The stock is currently trading at  55 89 per share and up about 4 63  for the day   EBay has been telling potential recruits for the position of PayPal president that it s considering spinning off the payments business as soon as next year  according to two people briefed on the conversations    Reasons for Possible Spin Off  eBay is a massive company with a market capitalization valued at  69 45 Billion and generating annual revenue of about  17 05 Billion   They have a solid business plan that will continue generating high revenue for decades to come   So why would this multi billion dollar company decide to spin off one of its most lucrative divisions  Spin offs offer the opportunity for a division to trade independently of a parent company  and in theory  see value unlocked   In eBay s particular case  PayPal is the mobile payment system that customers have to use in order to buy items of eBay  It makes sense if an adverse news event  for example  impacts eBay s stock  PayPal in theory will not be impacted due to its independence from eBay and pure revenue generation from eBay s customer transactions  One potential reason for the split  according to The Economist  is that  companies seeking buyers for parts of their business are not getting good offers from other firms  or from private equity    Also according to The Economist another incentive of spin offs is called the  conglomerate discount   that  stock markets value a diversified group at less than the sum of its parts  What it means for investors Current shareholders of the parent company would receive equivalent shares in the new company in order to compensate for the loss of equity in the original stocks    Shareholders may then buy and sell stocks from either company independently potentially making investment in both companies more attractive  This spin off will be a good opportunity for new and current investors to invest in a new independent stock that is just focused on payments  and isn t tied to the failure or success of eBay   As of right now  many could argue that PayPal is the main reason to own EBAY  so it will be interesting to see how two separate companies perform 
Still  PayPal  while it does generate revenue from alternative methods  does get a great deal of business from eBay  The online auction side is a key source of free leads for the payment service  so it will be interesting to see what happens to that model in a split Bottom Line The potential spin off of PayPal from eBay is exciting news for investors because it could unlock the value in both companies  and allow both to prosper more than they might as a combined entity  Investors should note  however  that given mixed opinions on earnings estimate revisions as of late  eBay has a Zacks rank of  3  hold  and has an industry rank in the bottom 42   so as it stands right now  EBAY isn t looking too favorable  Still  the potential for a PayPal spin off is up in the air  though now it is leaning more toward the optimistic side  so investors should keep a lookout in the news to see if eBay actually follows through and if PayPal becomes its own company ",2014-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-stock-soars-on-rumors-of-possible-paypal-spinoff-223470,223470

Traders and investors that are trying to find a reason to own the stock will need to find other supporting factors  Watch for near term daily chart support around the  47 25  an area where the stock topped out in 2006  While that area was a resistance level in 2012  it will now become a support area if the stock goes lower in the coming days  It also has major support around the  40 68 level if  47 25 fails to hold ",2014-06-23,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oversold-ebay-nears-daily-support-217064,217064
218516,440032,EBAY,As Fed Pares  The Dow Steps Up,opinion,"The FOMC s positive assessment of the U S  economy and decision to scale back asset purchases by another  10 billion breathed new life into the stock market Wednesday after the dismal Q1 GDP revision threatened to halt Wall Street s two day winning streak  All major indices close with constructive gains with the S P 500 outperforming due to strength in telecom and utility stocks  The Dow Industrials rebounded off key support at 16 500 to close at a record high for the first time this year as the Nasdaq Composite recovered choppy trade to also end higher  
Blame It On The WeatherThe severe winter weather took a documented toll on the economy last quarter causing growth to come to near standstill  First quarter GDP was revised downward to only 0 1  from 2 6  initially  and much worse than an expected revision to 1 1   While it was obvious that the data was skewed by bad weather  the knee jerk reaction in the market sent stocks into negative territory  exacerbating an already defensive Nasdaq on disappointing results from Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   But the defensive tone was mitigated by an earlier bullish report on the job market from ADP which found that private payrolls rose by a greater than expected 220 000 in April  beating forecasts of  210 000 and following an upwardly revised 209 000 in March  This is expected to translate into upward revisions to Friday s non farm payroll report  currently at  215 000 new jobs in April

218547,440063,EBAY,eBay Vol Breaches Annual High Well Ahead Of Earnings Report,opinion,eBay Inc   EBAY  is a global technology company that enables commerce through three reportable segments  Marketplaces  Payments  and GSI I noticed eBay last night while perusing the market because of the vol    namely vol that has reached an annual high well ahead of earnings due out in mid Apr    very close to Apr expiry  It s certainly expected that vol will rise into the event  which is why the fact that the implied has breached its annual high already caught my attention The one year eBay Charts Tab is included  below   The top portion is the stock price the bottom is the vol  IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side  we can see the rather consistent move upwards over the last twelve months  One year ago  this was a  38 08 stock  so it s up 37  Y O Y  For those that haven t looked recently  this is nearly a  70 billion company    eBay  Whoa But  unlike so many posts I ve published recently  this is a stock that is seeing near annual highs in stock price and is also seeing new annual highs in vol  Let s turn to the one year IV30  chart in isolation  below We can see that hypnotic vol pattern into and out of earnings  like almost every other firm  But this time things are different  The implied has breached its annual high and we are several weeks away from earnings  As that event nears  unless there is some sort of pre announcement  the vol will continue to rise  In English  the annual high as of today will likely be shattered by the times earnings roll around in mid Apr  But the stock has been going up  so what s the happs  Honesty  I dunno    But I thought it was interesting enough to write about at 10 22pm EST Finally  let s look to the Options Tab  below  Across the top we can see the monthly vols are priced to 40 52  for Apr and 32 91  for May  Although it seems like there is some ambiguity as to when earnings will be announced  the option market reflects a date inside Apr expiry  The 52 wk high in IV30  is the current level  38 89   with Apr already priced to 40 52   My best guess is we could see 50  IV30  in a couple of weeks  not to mention Apr vol in and of itself  IV30  is a weighted average of two months  Disclosure  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation Images provided by Livevol ,2013-03-28,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ebay-vol-breaches-annual-high-well-ahead-of-earnings-report-160799,160799
218560,440076,EBAY,Cruising  What s Not To Like ,opinion,During uncertain economic times  true value becomes the consumer s guiding mantra  Getting your money s worth on whatever it s spent on is the definition of true value in this sense  Whether it s a great meal at a discount  a good deal on a luxury car or going on a first class vacation at a fraction of the expected price  true value for one s discretionary income has become a driving force in consumer culture     Evidence of the consumer seeking his money s worth is made clear in the success of discount coupon websites like Groupon  Nasdaq  GRPN  and Living Social as well as the proliferation of peer to peer deal auction businesses like eBay  Nasdaq  EBAY   But nowhere is the pursuit of true value followed as strongly as in the leisure travel business  Limited resources and uncertain economic times force consumers to seek out the most bang for their buck as possible     And I think I smell an opportunity for investors in this space      The growth in the cruise line business is proof of this search for true value  Once reserved strictly for the wealthy  cruising has become the go to vacation choice for the masses   Not only does a cruise vacation offer true value for one s money  it s also a very relaxing way to vacation  Modern cruise ships are truly floating resorts  with all the luxuries and entertainment of land based vacations  Not to mention the obvious appeal of moving from location to location without the hassle of packing and unpacking your belongings  No longer floating cafeterias and low end hotel type accommodations  as was offered at the start of the mass market cruise boom  today s ships have recruited the world s best chefs and designers to create an experience that is second to none     The best part of taking a cruise vacation is the price  Generally  cruises are all inclusive journeys  meaning that meals  entertainment and lodging are included in one price  This amount is often much lower than a comparable land based vacation due to the economy of scale provided by cruise ships  The lower price combined with luxurious surroundings and the benefit of seeing numerous locations add together to create true value for the consumer   Big Revenues Keep GrowingThe statistics reflect the popularity of the cruise industry  Annual revenue for cruise lines in the United States is over  38 billion  with more than 154 million passengers worldwide since 1990  The latest numbers indicate this industry is still growing  despite the worldwide economic slowdown    Just as consumers look for true value in their choices  investors seek value in their portfolios  Provided the macroeconomic drivers of the value oriented cruise industry and its surge in popularity  investment in this sector makes sense  Let s take a closer look at two of the major players    1  Carnival Cruise Lines  NYSE  CCL This Miami  Florida based company provides cruises to various vacation destinations with a portfolio of cruise brands comprising Carnival Cruise Lines  Holland America  Princess Cruises and Seabourn in North America  and AIDA Cruises  Costa Cruises  Cunard  Ibero Cruises and P O Cruises in Europe  Australia  and Asia  The company trades at 15 5 times last year s earnings and pays a 3 2  dividend  The sinking of their European based ship  Costa Concordia  in January 2012  knocked shares off of their  35 highs  The price has rebounded  however  recently trading in a tight  30  33 channel  I would be a buyer on a break above the  33 level 2  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd  NYSE  RCL  This is another multi brand  Miami Florida based cruise company  It owns five cruise brands  which comprise of Royal Caribbean International  Celebrity Cruises  Pullmantur  Azamara Club Cruises  and CDF Croisieres de France  The company boosts a P E ratio of 9 2 and has a dividend yield of 1 6   Shares have been beaten down recently because the company cut its full year profit forecast due to rising fuel costs  Royal Caribbean may have acted too fast by cutting their profit forecast  however  because fuel prices are actually decreasing  The sell off has set up a buying opportunity in the stock  Although the price is below the 200 day moving average  placing shares outside of my  value zone   opportunity exists by buying an upside breakout above  25   Risks to Consider  Due to the international nature of the cruise industry  there are political and economic risks in buying these companies  In addition  fuel prices and other costs may start to increase  hampering growth prospects    Action to Take     I really like the cruise industry on many fronts  Serious upside potential exists in the business  especially as the global economy recovers and the carriers can afford to raise prices  I will be watching both of these stocks closely  and suggest buying on the upside breakouts noted above  BY Dave
