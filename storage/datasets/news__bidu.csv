159170,380686,BIDU,Better Buy  Baidu vs  Alibaba,news,"Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  and Alibaba  NYSE BABA  are two of China s most well known tech companies  Baidu owns the country s top search engine  while Alibaba owns its biggest e commerce marketplace and cloud platform 
When I compared these two companies last August  I concluded that Alibaba s stronger revenue and earnings growth  insulation from macro headwinds  and reasonable valuation made it the better investment than Baidu  Both stocks rallied about 30  since that article was published  as the  phase one  trade deal allayed some concerns about Chinese stocks  But will one of these stocks outperform the other through the rest of 2020 

Baidu s strengths and weaknesses
Baidu controls 67  of China s online search engine market  according to StatCounter  Its closest competitors are Sogou and Alibaba s Shenma  which claim 19  and 7  shares  respectively 
Baidu generated 73  of its revenue from online ads last quarter  However  its ad revenue declined annually over the past two quarters as it struggled with slower ad spending amid the economic slowdown in China  as well as competition from Tencent s  OTC TCEHY  WeChat and ByteDance s TikTok and Toutiao 
Baidu partly offset that slowdown with the growth of its video platform iQiyi  NASDAQ IQ   which generates most of its remaining revenue  But iQiyi s growth also weighs down Baidu s operating margins  since the unit still can t generate a profit in China s competitive streaming video market 
Baidu s core turnaround plan is to expand into adjacent markets  including virtual assistants  smart speakers  artificial intelligence  cloud services  and driverless cars  It s also expanding its mobile app into a platform for mini programs  which mirrors Tencent s expansion of WeChat into a mini program ecosystem 
Alibaba s strengths and weaknesses
Alibaba s marketplaces controlled 56  of China s e commerce market last year  according to eMarketer  Its closest rivals were JD com and Pinduoduo  NASDAQ PDD   which claimed 17  and 7  of the market  respectively 
Alibaba s cloud platform controlled 47  of China s cloud platform market last year  according to Canalys  Its rivals Tencent  Amazon  and Baidu controlled 15   9   and 8  of that growing market  respectively 
Alibaba s core commerce business generated 85  of its revenue last quarter  The rest of its revenue came from its cloud  digital media and entertainment  and innovation initiatives businesses  Yet Alibaba only generates profits from its core commerce business    and those profits subsidize the growth of its three other unprofitable units 
Alibaba s core commerce revenue rose 40  annually last quarter  but its growth is decelerating  It s propping up the unit s growth with brick and mortar stores  overseas and cross border marketplaces  and investments in third party logistics  but those newer businesses are eroding the unit s operating margins 

Overlapping interests and shared challenges
Baidu and Alibaba compete across multiple markets  including advertising  cloud services  smart speakers  and AI  Alibaba is actually the largest advertising company in China  since Taobao and Tmall generate ad revenue  via product listing fees  for higher rankings  That business undermines Baidu s online search ads  since merchants could spend their ad budgets on Alibaba s listing fees instead 
However  Baidu overtook Alibaba in China s smart speaker market last year with cheaper speakers  Baidu s AI platform also recently bested Google s in an AI competition  and its Apollo platform for autonomous cars has secured over 100 partnerships from major auto and tech companies  In other words  Baidu is aggressively expanding its ecosystem beyond PCs and mobile devices 
Alibaba and Baidu both face intense competition from Tencent  Tencent s WeChat  the top messaging platform in China with 1 15 billion monthly active users  has evolved into an all in one platform for payments  e commerce  search  ride hailing services  gaming  and more    which gives it a wide moat against both tech giants  Gen Z oriented platforms like ByteDance s TikTok and Toutiao are also expanding their ecosystems in similar ways 
The growth forecasts and valuations
Baidu s prospects could brighten this year as waning macro headwinds allow Chinese companies to ramp up their advertising spending again  Its operating margins could also expand as it dials back discounts on smart speakers and iQiyi narrows its losses 
Alibaba will likely continue expanding its core commerce business with lower margin strategies to counter discount rivals like Pinduoduo  It could also face fresh antitrust scrutiny over allegations that it s forcing merchants into exclusive deals 
Based on those factors  Baidu s revenue and earnings growth could accelerate next year  while Alibaba s growth decelerates  Baidu s stock also looks cheaper relative to its earnings growth potential next year

159177,380693,BIDU,Here s Why Baidu and iQiyi Soared Today,news,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus in China has made plenty of headlines  and has affected companies in China and across the global stage in a variety of ways  Many public facilities have been closed  travel restrictions remain in effect  and many consumers have been instructed to stay in their homes and avoid public gatherings 
As the leading Chinese search engine  Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  has not been immune to the outbreak of that has ravaged the country  nor has its streaming video offspring iQiyi  NASDAQ IQ   In a press release late Friday  the company said that because of the coronavirus  its fourth quarter financial report    initially scheduled for Feb  6    was being postponed until Feb  27   in light of the evolving situation   iQiyi issued a similar statement 
The news wasn t all bad  however  as Baidu issued revised guidance that was surprisingly strong and sent both stocks soaring 

Increased guidance    and confidence
Baidu stock closed up nearly 6   while iQiyi gained more than 7   The catalyst for the move was the release of revised guidance that was much stronger than investors had expected 
Baidu said that for the fourth quarter  it expects revenue to be in the range of 28 3 billion yuan   4 06 billion  to 28 9 billion yuan   4 15 billion   which would represent an increase of between 4  and 6  year over year 
The move came as a surprise to investors  as Baidu s previous guidance range was much more subdued  It forecast revenue in the range of 27 1 billion yuan   3 89 billion  to 28 7 billion yuan   4 12 billion   which would represent a loss of 1  to a gain of 6  year over year  Baidu also indicated that its core revenue would grow between 4  and 6  year over year  compared to its previous guidance for flat to 6  growth 
Baidu also said it expects net income to be in the range of 6 2 billion yuan   890 million  to 6 7 billion yuan   970 million   which is assuming growth in the company s core business of between 83  to 90  year over year  On an adjusted basis  Baidu is forecasting net income in the range of 8 9 billion yuan   1 28 billion  to 9 4 billion yuan   1 36 billion   which would represent growth in Baidu s core of between 50  and 55  year over year 
Regarding the evolving health crisis  Baidu said that in an effort to  help control the epidemic  the Company is taking precautionary measures  including extending its employees  Chinese New Year holiday  which was originally scheduled from January 24  2020 to January 30  2020  and requesting employees to work from home for a time period after the holiday  
It s important to note that iQiyi left its guidance intact  which called for total net revenue to be between 6 86 billion yuan   960 million  and 7 28 billion yuan   1 04 billion   that range runs from a loss of 2  to a gain of 4   compared to the prior year quarter  Since iQiyi makes up such a significant part of Baidu s results  investors are hoping the revision in Baidu s guidance bodes well for both companies 
The turnaround continues
Baidu has been in the midst of a multiyear turnaround  after the stock plunged last year to its lowest level since 2013  The outbreak of coronavirus couldn t have come at a worse time for China stocks  they have already been hit hard by a slowing economy and the trade war with the U S   though the two countries recently reached a preliminary agreement to end trade hostilities 

iQiyi has been fighting to stay above the fray in a three way streaming video battle with Tencent Holdings  Tencent Video and Alibaba Group Holding s Youku Tudou  The company has been spending heavily on original content  impacting not only its results  but that of corporate parent Baidu as well

159180,380696,BIDU,Is It Finally Safe to Buy Baidu Stock ,news,"Baidu s  NASDAQ BIDU  stock recently jumped after the Chinese search leader unexpectedly hiked its fourth quarter guidance amid China s economic slowdown and the ongoing coronavirus outbreak 
The company raised the midpoint of its fourth quarter revenue guidance from 2 6  growth to 5 1  growth  and it lifted its revenue forecast for Baidu Core  which excludes its share of video streaming platform iQiyi  NASDAQ IQ  and other non core businesses  from 0  6  growth to 4  6  growth 
Baidu also expects the midpoint of its non GAAP net income  i e   measured without relying on generally accepted accounting principles  to nearly double as Baidu Core s non GAAP earnings rise 50  to 55   Analysts had anticipated just 16  earnings growth 
These rosy numbers suggest that the worst might be over for Baidu  which shed over 25  of its market value over the past 12 months as its core advertising business lost momentum  So is it finally safe to buy shares of this beaten down stock 

Tracking Baidu s decline
Baidu s core advertising business generated 73  of its revenue in the third quarter  It lost momentum over the past year  due to the economic slowdown in China and intense competition from rivals like Tencent  OTC TCEHY  and ByteDance  which overtook Baidu in digital ad revenue last year 

Source  Baidu quarterly reports 
Baidu s traffic acquisition costs  TAC  held steady at less than 16  of its ad revenue last quarter  but that tepid spending suggested that it wasn t aggressively countering its rivals as China s economy grew at its slowest rate in three decades 
Instead  Baidu relied heavily on the growth of iQiyi to offset its declining ad revenue  That strategy was a double edged sword    it boosted Baidu s revenue  but the unprofitable video platform also sapped its earnings growth 

Source  Baidu quarterly reports 
Baidu exacerbated that pressure by investing in the expansion of its ecosystem with its DuerOS virtual assistant  Xiaodu smart speakers  driverless cars  and other next gen technologies to expand beyond PCs and mobile devices 
All those factors caused Baidu s stock to tumble over the past year  as unresolved issues like the trade war  the economic slowdown  and the coronavirus spooked the bulls  However  Baidu s fourth quarter guidance strongly suggests that its declines are finally bottoming out 
Tracking Baidu s recovery
As analysts fretted over Baidu s tumbling revenue and profits  the tech giant planted its seeds for future growth  It divested non core businesses  including its investments in financial technology  meal delivery  and online travel  and invested more cash into the expansion of mini programs on its mobile app  its smart speaker business  its AI services  its Haokan short video app  DuerOS  and its Apollo platform for driverless cars 
The addition of mini programs to Baidu s mobile app  which allowed users to access e commerce  delivery  ride hailing  and other services without leaving the app  counters Tencent s  OTC TCEHY  addition of mini programs to WeChat  the top mobile messaging app in China  over the past three years 
Last quarter  Baidu noted that the total number of daily active users  DAUs  on its mobile app grew 25  annually to 189 million in September  as monthly active users  MAUs  for the app s mini programs jumped 157  to 290 million 
Baidu also overtook Alibaba  NYSE BABA  as the country s top smart speaker maker last year  Last quarter  it noted that monthly voice queries on its voice assistant DuerOS more than quadrupled annually to 4 2 billion  Voice queries on Baidu Maps also doubled 
Baidu s driverless unit also secured 150 autonomous driving licenses across Chinese cities and launched its first robotaxi fleet in Changsha  Hunan  It also recently dealt Alphabet s Google a significant blow when its ERNIE AI model beat Google s BERT AI model in a natural language processing competition 
Baidu s expansion of its ecosystem hasn t generated significant revenue yet  but it ensures its long term survival as online searches move beyond PCs and phones while widening its moat against Tencent  Alibaba  ByteDance  and other tech rivals 
What does Baidu s forecast tell investors 
Baidu didn t highlight any clear catalysts in its revised fourth quarter guidance  Instead  it noted that it would delay its full fourth quarter report till Feb  27 to account for the impact of the coronavirus outbreak 
However  Baidu s guidance suggests that its advertising business is rebounding from a tough 2019  iQiyi s profitability could be improving  and its mini programs and DuerOS are locking in more users  Those improvements could silence the bears  who consider Baidu an also ran in China s evolving tech sector 
Analysts expect Baidu s revenue and earnings to grow 11  and 27   respectively  next year    but those estimates could be raised after Baidu reveals its full report  Either way  Baidu s stock is historically cheap at 18 times forward earnings  so investors should consider buying some shares before the coronavirus fears fade ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/prgxt,2076881
159181,380697,BIDU,The 4 Biggest Risks Facing Baidu s Stock,news,"Baidu s  NASDAQ BIDU  stock recently rallied after the Chinese tech giant raised its fourth quarter guidance ahead of its full earnings report on Feb  27  It now expects its revenue to rise 5 1  annually at the midpoint  compared to its prior forecast for 2 6  growth 
It expects revenue from its core businesses  which exclude entertainment platform iQiyi  NASDAQ  IQ  and other non core businesses  to grow 4  6   compared to a previous forecast for 0  6  growth  It also expects the midpoint of its non GAAP net income to nearly double 
Those numbers sent analysts scrambling to revise their estimates  and indicated that Baidu s struggling ad business was improving and that its stock was finally bottoming out  But before investors load up on Baidu s stock  they should review the four biggest threats to its long term growth 

1  Tencent s WeChat
Tencent s WeChat  which hit 1 15 billion monthly active users  MAUs  last quarter  is the most popular messaging app in China  It added mini programs    which let users access online marketplaces  ride hailing platforms  and other services without leaving the app    in early 2017 
The platform s total number of mini programs exceeded 1 million in 2018  Last quarter  Tencent stated that its total number of daily active users  DAUs  on mini programs grew 45  annually to 300 million 
WeChat provides its own internal search engine for finding content across its platform  It also integrates Sogou  NYSE  SOGO   the second largest search engine in China after Baidu  into WeChat for external searches 
Baidu is fighting back by launching mini programs for its own mobile app  but that ecosystem still reaches fewer users than WeChat  If Tencent locks more users into WeChat s walled garden  Baidu s core search engine could lose its clout with internet users and advertisers 
2  ByteDance s TikTok and Toutiao
Beijing based ByteDance replaced Baidu as the second largest digital advertising platform in China after Alibaba  NYSE  BABA  last year  according to research firm R3 
ByteDance s entire family of apps reaches over 1 5 billion MAUs  Its meteoric growth was mainly fueled by two of those apps  the short video app Douyin  known as TikTok overseas   and Jinri Toutiao  a news app that aggregates clickable articles 
Douyin locks in Gen Z users with its short musical videos  and its total monthly active users  MAUs     including TikTok    topped 500 million in 2018  Toutiao mainly appeals to younger and lower income users across China with its short articles 
ByteDance launched an internal search engine  which lets users scour older articles and content  for Toutiao last year  This was a clear shot at Baidu  and indicated that ByteDance was following Tencent s  walled garden  strategy of locking users into its ecosystem  Baidu is fighting back against ByteDance with its news app and its short video app Haokan  but neither effort has throttled ByteDance s growth yet 
3  Alibaba s sprawling ecosystem
Baidu surpassed Alibaba as China s top smart speaker maker last year  but it did so by selling its speakers at rock bottom prices  If Alibaba retaliates with even cheaper speakers  a margin crushing price war could erupt between the tech giants 

But that s not all  Alibaba also owns Shenma  the second largest mobile search engine in China  Alibaba already integrates some of its e commerce search results into Shenma  and stronger ties with Taobao and Tmall could help its search engine gain ground against Baidu 
Alibaba also owns the largest cloud infrastructure platform in China  It controls nearly half of that high growth market  according to Canalys  while Baidu ranks fourth with an 8  share  Baidu is trying to stay afloat in this competitive market  but it could struggle to pull customers away from Alibaba Cloud and other rivals without aggressive promotions 
4  The Chinese government
Lastly  the Chinese government frequently throttles Baidu s growth with overbearing regulations  Back in 2016  a cancer stricken student died after trying an experimental treatment advertised on Baidu  In response  Chinese regulators forced Baidu to curb its sales of healthcare ads    which accounted for 20  30  of its revenue at the time 
The government has also tightened its regulations on the fintech and video game markets over the past two years  which caused Baidu s ad revenue from those two high growth markets to plummet  The Cyberspace Administration also temporarily suspended some of Baidu s news services in early 2019 as part of a six month crackdown on  vulgar  content 
The unpredictable nature of those crackdowns is a volatile headwind for Baidu  and it forces the search giant to hire more censors and tighten up its own algorithms  In other words  the government s actions could dent Baidu s revenue growth and cause its operating expenses to rise 
The bottom line
I own shares of Baidu  and I think its updated guidance indicates that the headwinds which battered the stock over the past year are finally waning  However  I m still keeping a close eye on these four long term challenges  since they could derail the tech giant s fragile recovery ",2020-02-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pssff,2079852

Shares of Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  sank 20 3  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence   Despite a year of strong gains for the broader Chinese market  the search leader s stock slumped because of weak performance for its advertising business  

GXC data by YCharts
The stock s biggest drop of the year occurred in May  after the company reported miserable first quarter results and an uninspiring outlook  The potential impact of the trade war between China and the U S  was already making shareholders nervous before the release  and the results confirmed that Baidu s advertising business was seeing deteriorating performance and prompted investors to lower their expectations for the stock  

So what
Baidu s advertising business faced multiple headwinds last year  With trade tensions pointing to the possibility that economic growth in China could remain sluggish  businesses were less interested in spending money on marketing  Baidu also took measures to remove ad partners from its platform and increase its overall standards to reduce the possibility of intervention from the Chinese government 
The stock did see some recovery in November after the company reported third quarter results that showed better than expected earnings results and solid sales and membership growth for its streaming video spin off  iQiyi  Shares continued to trend higher through the end of the year but still dramatically underperformed the overall Chinese market 
Now what
Baidu stock has posted significant recovery early in 2019 s trading  Shares are up roughly 14 1  in January s trading so far

Baidu is facing increasing competition  but it retains a leadership position in the Chinese search and advertising market  With signs that progress is being made on resolving the trade disputes between China and the U S   it s possible that the company could be operating against a more favorable backdrop this year  but the business s strong position in fields like artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology give it avenues to long term success even if more volatility hits in the near term

HONG KONG BEIJING  Reuters    China is working to finalize its first rules to cover online only banking operations in a push to minimize risk in the financial sector and attract players including foreign lenders  three people with direct knowledge of the matter said 
The guidelines could also bolster foreigners with existing China operations such as  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    HSBC Holdings   LON HSBA  PLC and  Standard Chartered   LON STAN  PLC by allowing them to set up separate digital banking platforms  two of them said 
The framing of rules come as companies  use of data as well as digital and artificial intelligence technologies have transformed China s financial services landscape  from processing payments to selling investment products 
But foreigners have struggled to make money in mainland retail banking  with many yet to break even despite years of onshore presence as they compete with the vast physical networks of domestic rivals 
About a dozen groups including foreigners are in talks with Chinese regulators over the new rules and have shown interest in launching digital banking operations  said one person who has been involved in such discussions with the banking watchdog 
The rules would allow them to partner tech firms for independent digital banking platforms  the person said 
Banks are expected to be allowed to own majority stakes in online only banking ventures  the people said  as the government pushes ahead with its strategy of easing access for foreigners to China s vast financial markets 
The framework  which will cover the existing online banking units of  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd among others  will form China s first comprehensive move to standardize oversight of the fast growing digital banking sector 
Other Asian economies including Hong Kong and Singapore are also ushering in digital only banks 
China has licensed four online only banks since 2014 including Tencent backed WeBank  Alibaba offshoot MYbank  and AiBank  backed by search engine operator Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  and China Citic Bank Corp Ltd 
The People s Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to Reuters  faxed requests for comment  The people declined to be identified as the regulatory plans are confidential 
A spokesman for Citi said the bank would review the rules when they are published  and that its own China consumer banking business had already been digitized

Things started looking up toward year end  however  as Baidu returned to growth  Excluding divested business segments  revenue grew by 3  year over year in the third quarter  helping the stock recoup half of its losses to close out 2019 down about 20   
Baidu has started the year on a high note  as two announcements related to its artificial intelligence  AI  program and one related a long awaited trade agreement sent the stock soaring nearly 8  on the first day of trading in 2020 

1  Autonomous cars  driving  the stock
Word emerged on Tuesday that Baidu had been granted a license to test its Apollo driverless cars in Beijing  one of the most traffic congested cities in the country  Baidu was issued 40 licenses to test its self driving cars while carrying passengers on specially designated roads around China s capital city    making it the first Chinese company to do so  
The company also announced its self driving cars had traversed more than 3 million kilometers  about 1 8 million miles  across 23 cities in China to date  adding more than 1 million kilometers and 10 additional cities to its tally since July  Baidu has been granted a total of 120 permits across China  by far the most of any autonomous driving system in the country  
2  Beating the competition in an AI language test
While Alphabet s  NASDAQ GOOGL   NASDAQ GOOG  Google and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  have been battling for bragging rights in the realm of AI  Baidu has surprised both by winning a competition that tests the ability of AI based algorithms to understand human language  
Baidu recorded the record breaking score of 90 1 on the General Language Understanding Evaluation  GLUE   which is widely regarded as the key benchmark for AI language understanding  The company s ERNIE  Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration  model beat out both Microsoft and Google  which achieved scores of 89 9 and 89 7  respectively  Baidu became one of only 10 AI systems thus far that have been able to surpass the human understanding baseline score of 87 1 and the first to ever top a score of 90  
3  A cooling of trade tensions
President Donald Trump announced the long awaited signing of a trade deal with China on Tuesday  with the event scheduled in Washington  D C   for Jan  15  The first part of the deal  titled  phase one   marks a significant turning point in a trade war that has raged for more than 18 months  Trump recently halted new tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect in December  while removing some levies that had already been placed on a wide range of goods manufactured in China 
The ongoing trade war has dented China s economy  as the country s gross domestic product grew by just 6 2  in the second half of 2019  marking its slowest rate of growth in more than 25 years  This has hurt China stocks and helped pinch Baidu s results  which caused the company to report a loss in the first quarter  its first since debuting on U S  markets in August 2005  An easing of the trade war will undoubtedly help boost China s declining growth rate    and improve Baidu s fortunes in the process ",2020-01-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pcknn,2051464

However  Baidu remains one of the most important tech players in the Chinese market  and the company will look to recover in 2020 and beyond  Is Baidu stock a buy today  or should investors keep their distance  
Competitive pressure
Baidu operates the largest search engine in China  and the company generates the bulk of its revenue from advertising  But there are other platforms challenging this core business  They include Tencent s WeChat  which is an app that offers several functions  such as messaging  payment services  and yes  a search function  WeChat s search engine is unlikely to topple Baidu as the top dog in this category in China any time soon  but the app s ecosystem of users    WeChat boasts more than a billion monthly active users  MAUs     is an attractive target for advertisers  

Baidu does have other competitors  including ByteDance  which launched a new search function last year via its popular app Toutiao  Note that during the third quarter  Baidu s online marketing services revenue was  2 9 billion  representing a 6  sequential increase but a 9  decline compared to the year ago period  Stiff competition will likely continue dragging Baidu s core business down  and the company is increasingly looking for ways to diversify its revenue base  
Baidu s opportunities for growth
Perhaps the most important weapon in Baidu s arsenal is video streaming platform iQiyi  NASDAQ IQ   The company is growing its user base at a rapid pace  During the third quarter  iQiyi s total subscribers increased 31  year over year to 106 million  and its membership services revenue was also up 30   Although iQiyi generates most of its revenue via its video streaming and original content businesses  there s also the company s licensing  content merchandising  and online games segments  However  iQiyi has faced some of the same competitive pressures as Baidu lately  and during the third quarter  iQiyi s top line only increased 7   Let s not forget that iQiyi is not consistently profitable yet  which means it s a dead weight on Baidu s bottom line 
Baidu is looking to other opportunities to spur top line growth  For instance  there is the company s  open source autonomous vehicle technology platform  Apollo  Baidu claims to have over 135 partners that support its self driving cars initiative  and while we are still in the early stages of the autonomous cars revolution  Baidu is looking to maintain an edge in this potentially lucrative market with a view to profit immensely in the future  Baidu recently became the first company to receive 40 licenses to test its self driving cars on designated roads in China  Lastly  there is Baidu s smart speakers business  which still generates a negligible amount of revenue  but where the company has been making serious strides of late  
Is it a buy 
The slowdown in Baidu s core business is a worry  and while the company is looking to diversify its sources of revenue  many of its initiatives to do so do not inspire full confidence yet  There is iQiyi  which is contributing to Baidu s top line but is still unprofitable  and there are Baidu s AI and Apollo initiatives  which won t make a material impact on the company s financials for some time 
Still  Baidu will remain a top player in its domestic market for many years to come  and the company s ventures have the potential to eventually pay off in a big way  For those reasons  I still believe Baidu is a buy  but investors looking to initiate a new position in the stock right now should do so prepared to ride out some volatility ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfh2l,2055074

159257,380773,BIDU,Alibaba Leaps 8  in a Major Boost for Hong Kong s Ambitions,news," Bloomberg      Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd  rose 7 7  in its Hong Kong debut  capping a landmark share sale that unfolded during violent anti government protests 
Chairman Daniel Zhang  lieutenants wearing Alibaba lapel pins and Hong Kong dignitaries were on hand to strike the opening gong Tuesday at a celebration of the city s biggest stock listing this year  The company presented a Chinese style painting to the exchange    a souvenir to go with the showy coming out party  The Chinese e commerce giant s shares rose to as much as HK 189 50  versus a HK 176 issuance price 
Asia s most valuable corporation raised about  11 billion in the financial hub s largest issuance of stock since 2010  a triumph for a stock exchange that lost many of China s brightest technology stars to U S  rivals  The blockbuster debut by one of China s most successful companies signals confidence in Hong Kong s future even as pro democracy protests rock the city  earning Alibaba goodwill in Beijing  It makes it easier for investors in the mainland to buy and sell Alibaba shares  which are primarily listed in New York 
It s also a homecoming of sorts for Alibaba  whose decision to hold its  25 billion initial public offering five years ago in New York dealt a blow to Hong Kong s ambitions  Listing closer to home has been a long time dream of billionaire co founder Jack Ma s  More broadly  his company has been trying to sustain growth at a time the engines of China s economy are sputtering  Like fellow internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd   Alibaba s exploring new markets as China clashes with the U S  over everything from trade and technology to investment 
 We came home  We came back to list in Hong Kong   Zhang said to applause   It helped make up for our regret five years ago   
Why Now  and Why Hong Kong  for Alibaba s Share Sale   QuickTake
A marquee name like Alibaba s could draw investors and boost trading liquidity for Hong Kong Exchanges   Clearing Ltd   which just saw its biggest profit slump in more than three years following a failed bid to buy its London counterpart in September  Efforts to court Alibaba emanated from the very top  with Chief Executive Carrie Lam  Hong Kong s leader  herself lobbying Ma  The Chinese company s decision to forge ahead despite a recent escalation in protest related violence pleased officials trying to persuade the world that the troubled city still has a future as a financial hub  Alibaba s sale could tempt Chinese tech unicorns from Didi Chuxing Inc  to ByteDance Inc  to opt for Hong Kong over the U S  if they eventually go public 
 Alibaba will be the leading light for bringing more companies in   Andrew Sullivan  a director at Pearl Bridge Partners  told Bloomberg Television   You may see some new money being allocated  The keen competitor is going to be Tencent  which has historically traded at a premium  
The new funds will now help Alibaba finance a costly war against homegrown rivals nipping at its heels  It could swell the company s cash pile to about  44 billion  more than any other internet company and roughly double that of arch rival Tencent s  The capital could bankroll competition with Tencent and Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   in cloud computing and entertainment  with Meituan Dianping in food delivery and travel  and with everyone in terms of investing in promising startups that yield technology  talent or market share  And it could divert investor cash from those rivals 
Demand for Alibaba s stock surpassed supply by several times and more shares were allocated to small investors  It s a feather in the cap for Zhang  who took over as chairman from Ma in September  The former accountant is now spearheading the company s expansion beyond Asia as well as into adjacent business lines from cloud computing to entertainment  logistics and physical retail  The stock trades under the code 9988 in Hong Kong  auspicious numbers in Chinese culture that connote prosperity

159258,380774,BIDU,Alibaba s Hong Kong Rally Is At Risk From Three Misconceptions,news," Bloomberg      Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd  s landmark  11 billion share sale and listing in Hong Kong on Nov  26 was galvanized by expectations the Chinese e commerce giant will attract a vast pool of capital from its home country  But some investors caution against unrealistic expectations  especially by mainland investors  and highlight certain restrictions that still govern    and potentially curtail    trading activity in Alibaba s Hong Kong shares 
The company s sheer size and the unprecedented nature of its secondary listing  the primary listing is still in New York  and unique management structure present challenges for investors hoping to gauge everything from Alibaba s inclusion in indexes    crucial because they direct the flow of capital from tracker funds    to its listing status 
Here s what we know 
1  Will Alibaba get added to the Hang Seng Index 
Not right now  Alibaba will be added to Hang Seng Composite Index on Dec  9  but it isn t qualified to join the benchmark Hang Seng Index or the Hang Seng China Enterprise Index because they comprise only primary listings and corporations without so called weighted voting rights  WVR  
Membership of the 50 member Hang Seng is coveted by corporations because it could trigger billions of dollars of inflows from funds tracking the 50 year old gauge  Hang Seng Indexes Co  plans a consultation in the first quarter to discuss issues including whether firms with weighted voting rights  like Alibaba  should be eligible for the HSI  Any conclusions should be published by May  Daniel Wong  its head of research and analytics  said in a statement  Even if the index compiler decides to overhaul its rules  the required process means it may not be until late 2020 before Alibaba could join the major Hang Seng benchmarks 
Representatives for HKEx and Alibaba declined to comment

2  Will Alibaba be included in the stock connect program 
Maybe  but a lot hinges on policy makers  China doesn t spell out criteria or qualifications for joining the program  which allows mainland investors to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong  Unlike the HSI  the program isn t limited to primary listings  It does require review by the China Securities Regulatory Commission  the stock market watchdog 
The first companies in stock connect with weighted voting rights were Meituan Dianping and Xiaomi Corp   which mainland investors got access to in late October through the program  That s after similarly structured Chinese firms started listing in July on Shanghai s new tech focused Star board  Many investors expect Beijing to ultimately allow Alibaba s Hong Kong shares to trade through the stock link with the city as well 
But it may not necessarily be in China s best interest to do so  That s because other U S  listed Chinese firms    among the country s largest corporations  from JD com Inc  to Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU      may be encouraged to follow in Alibaba s footsteps and conduct their own secondary listings in Hong Kong  bypassing the Shanghai or Shenzhen bourses  That may run counter to Beijing s longstanding ambitions of developing healthy  vibrant mainland exchanges  particularly as unrest grips Hong Kong 
3  Can Alibaba change its primary listing to Hong Kong 
It s possible    thereby attracting investors with a preference for main listings  and at the same time scoring brownie points with some in Beijing who could view that as supporting China s policy ambitions  Alibaba was given the green light to list in Hong Kong based on a new  Secondary Listing  rule  or Chapter 19C  It allows companies to conduct follow on share offerings without complying with more stringent rules laid down by Hong Kong Exchanges   Clearing Ltd  governing first time listees 
Alibaba may enjoy special status in having more freedom to comply with Hong Kong listing requirements  Under rules laid out in a consultation paper in April last year  Chinese firms that went public before Dec  15  2017 don t need to comply with  WVR  safeguards if they later switch their primary listing to Hong Kong  Alibaba  which debuted in New York in 2014  said in its Hong Kong listing prospectus it s a  WVR  company similar to Meituan and Xiaomi 
Meanwhile  Alibaba employs a fairly unique structure in which a group of partners have the right to nominate a majority of the firm s board    exerting outsized influence on Alibaba s direction 
In addition  Hong Kong listing rules say if trading volume there exceeds 55  of global turnover over an entire fiscal year  the stock has to adopt primary listing status in Hong Kong  HKEx gives such Chinese companies a year to comply  But with Hong Kong s stock registration office listing just 23  of outstanding Alibaba shares as of Nov  28  a majority of trading volume occurring there may be a tall order ",2019-12-03,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/alibabas-hong-kong-rally-is-at-risk-from-three-misconceptions-2032920,2032920

159260,380776,BIDU,Arsenal kit still on sale in China despite Ozil Uighur backlash,news,"By Sophie Yu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING SHANGHAI  Reuters    Stores in China said on Monday they were still selling Arsenal kit even after Mesut Ozil s Uighur comments  in a sign the soccer club may not be as heavily punished commercially as the National Basketball Association was over a pro Hong Kong tweet 
A chatroom on Ozil on online forum Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  Tieba was shut on Monday  and the state backed Global Times tabloid said that Ozil s online fan club had been  suspended  without providing further details  Some Chinese sellers on Alibaba s Taobao e commerce platform said they had stopped selling his shirts 
But even as the fallout from his comments blasting China s policy toward its Muslim Uighur minority continued   drawing criticism from China s Foreign Ministry  state media and some fans   merchandise from the London club was still on sale 
State broadcaster CCTV on Sunday had removed Arsenal s Premier League game against Manchester City from its broadcast schedule  Chinese video streaming website PPTV did the same 
Arsenal was quick to distance itself from their midfielder s comments  posting a statement on China s Twitter like Weibo platform saying it was his personal opinion 
But they prompted speculation the club would face a fate similar to the NBA  which says it has incurred substantial financial losses in China after a Houston Rockets official tweeted his support for the Hong Kong pro democracy protests 
Following the tweet by the Rockets  general manager  Chinese broadcasters stopped showing NBA games  while corporate partners in the country scrapped or suspended relations with the league  Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were also pulled from several  Nike   NYSE NKE  stores 
But checks by Reuters at stores selling merchandise by Arsenal s official kit supplier Adidas AG  DE ADSGN  in Beijing and Shanghai showed products related to the Premier League team were still on sale on Monday 
 We didn t receive any message that Arsenal s co branded products should be removed from the shelves  These co branded products were a collaboration with the whole Arsenal team  not with the player Ozil   said a staff at one of Adidas  Shanghai stores who would only give his name as Ben 
Adidas did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Arsenal branded merchandise was also still on sale on major Chinese e commerce platforms  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  and JD com on Monday  These platforms took Houston Rockets merchandise off their sales platforms in October after the comments 
 FAKE NEWS 
While some young Chinese  such as student Xiong Zexin  23  said  It is always like this  They must pay a price for this   much of the furor has centered on Ozil not the club 
 If you don t understand this matter then there s no need for you to make comments about politics  You re not a politician   student Li Yandong  29  said 
At least five sellers on Alibaba s domestically focused e commerce platform Taobao told Reuters that they were no longer selling jerseys emblazoned with Ozil s name and his number  10  due to the incident 
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people  mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims  have been detained in harsh conditions in Xinjiang as part of what Beijing calls an anti terrorism campaign  China has repeatedly denied any mistreatment of Uighurs 
Ozil  a Turkish Muslim  called Uighurs  warriors who resist persecution  and criticized both China s crackdown and the silence of Muslims in response 
China s Foreign Ministry said on Monday that Ozil had been  completely deceived by fake news and false statements  and said he was welcome to visit Xinjiang 
 We also welcome Mr  Ozil to come to Xinjiang if he has the chance  to take a walk and look around  as long as he has a conscience  is able to distinguish right from wrong and uphold the principles of objectivity and fairness  he will see a different Xinjiang   its statement said 
An executive at another Chinese broadcaster  who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation  said CCTV and PPTV s reactions were to be expected given the precedence set by the NBA  but said the timing and fact that Arsenal was British  and not American  could give it some leeway 
 The Arsenal incident is quite different from the NBA incident  because that happened just after  China s  National Day  when patriotic feelings were high   he said 
Still the Global Times  which is vocal in its criticism of companies whose behavior displeases Beijing  warned that Arsenal could still face further blowback  The newspaper s stance does not necessarily reflect Chinese government policy 
 The episode has destroyed Ozil s image and Arsenal and the Premier League may have to pay the price   the Global Times said on its official Twitter account

Spokespersons for Youku Tudou  iQiyi and Baidu did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
The Cyberspace Administration of China  which oversees internet governance  did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
The South Park statement followed an uproar in China and the United States over a weekend tweet  which was quickly withdrawn  by the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team that backed democracy protests in Hong Kong

about measures it could take to avoid divesting the Musical ly assets it acquired  the sources said  Details of those talks  referred to by CFIUS as mitigation  could not be learned  The specific concerns that CFIUS has could also not be learned  The sources requested anonymity because CFIUS reviews are confidential   While we cannot comment on ongoing regulatory processes  TikTok has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U S  Part of that effort includes working with Congress and we are committed to doing so   a TikTok spokesperson said  ByteDance did not immediately reply to a request for comment   By law  information filed with CFIUS may not be disclosed by CFIUS to the public   said a spokeswoman for the U S  Treasury Department  which chairs CFIUS  She added that Treasury  does not comment on information relating to specific CFIUS cases  including whether or not certain parties have filed notices for review   Last week  U S  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Tom Cotton asked for a national security probe in a letter to Joseph Macguire  acting director of national intelligence   They said they were concerned about the video sharing platform s collection of user data  and whether China censors content seen by U S  users  They also suggested TikTok could be targeted by foreign influence campaigns   On Friday  Schumer welcomed news of the probe in an emailed statement  calling it a  validation of our concern that apps like TikTok   may pose serious risks to millions of Americans and deserve greater scrutiny   TikTok allows users to create and share short videos with special effects  The company has said U S  user data is stored in the United States  but the senators noted that ByteDance is governed by Chinese laws  TikTok also says China does not have jurisdiction over content of the app  which does not operate in China and is not influenced by any foreign government  Last month  Musical ly founder Alex Zhu  who heads the TikTok team  started to report directly to ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming  one of the sources said  He previously reported to Zhang Nan  the head of ByteDance s Douyin  a Chinese short video app  It was not clear whether this move  which separates TikTok organizationally from ByteDance s other holdings  was related to the company s discussions with CFIUS over mitigation  In October  U S  senator Marco Rubio asked CFIUS to review ByteDance s acquisition of Musical ly  He cited questions about why TikTok had  only had a few videos of the Hong Kong protests that have been dominating international headlines for months   After the Reuters story of the CFIUS investigation appeared  Rubio tweeted   Any platform owned by a company in China which collects massive amounts of data on Americans is a potential serious threat to our country   U S  Senator Josh Hawley said in a tweet that TikTok should testify at a hearing scheduled next week about technology companies putting consumer data at risk in China   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  CEO Mark Zuckerberg  whose product competes with TikTok particularly for younger users  has also criticized the app over censorship concerns  The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle  especially if some of it involves U S  military or intelligence personnel  Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd said in May it would seek to sell its popular gay dating app Grindr after CFIUS approached it with national security concerns  Last year  CFIUS forced China s Ant Financial to scrap plans to buy MoneyGram International Inc over concerns about the safety of data that could identify U S  citizens  The panel also compelled

The Beijing office of the Cyberspace Administration of China  CAC  said in a post published on Monday night on its official WeChat account that the search engine s results show inaccuracies on Fang Zhimin  who is viewed as a revolutionary martyr by the party 
The move highlights the intense regulatory scrutiny Chinese internet platforms are under in China and how oversight  especially over how Chinese history is portrayed  is growing 
Last year  China passed a law making it potentially a criminal offense to defame or deny the deeds and spirit of the country s historic heroes and martyrs 
The CAC said it had asked Toutiao to  thoroughly clean up relevant information and punish relevant responsible persons   as well as  improve the search function  
The app should  prevent information dissemination that distorts  demonizes  blasphemes and negates the deeds and spirits of heroes   the regulator added 
Toutiao representatives were quoted in the CAC post as saying that it will carry out  rectification  in time  ByteDance did not offer an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters 
Toutiao is a popular AI driven news aggregator that recommends different news articles to users in China with different interests and is one of the flagship apps run by ByteDance  which also operates the short video app TikTok 
In August  Toutiao launched a Chinese language search engine that collates content within its app and the rest of the internet  becoming a competitor with Chinese search engine giant Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  
It is not the first time ByteDance has been rapped by regulators  In 2018  its joke app  Neihan Duanzi  was shut down by authorities after being criticized for  vulgar  content  Toutiao too has been temporarily taken down from Chinese app stores on previous occasions 
ByteDance  which was valued at  78 billion late last year  has ambitions to expand globally and its TikTok short video app is popular in the United States

WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump s administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U S  stock exchanges  three sources briefed on the matter said on Friday  in what would be a radical escalation of U S  China trade tensions 
The move would be part of a broader effort to limit U S  investment in Chinese companies  two of the sources said  One said it was motivated by the Trump administration s growing security concerns about their activities 
Major U S  stock indexes slipped on the news  which came days before China celebrates the 70th anniversary of the birth of the People s Republic on Oct  1  when the world s No  2 economy will shut down for a week of festivities 
Shares of  Alibaba  Group Holding  N BABA   JD com  O JD   Baidu  O BIDU   slipped between 4  to 7  in afternoon trading 
It was not immediately clear how any delisting would work 
In June  U S  lawmakers from both parties introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight  including providing access to audits  or face delisting 
Chinese authorities have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms   including member firms of the Big Four international accounting networks   citing national security concerns 
 Beijing should no longer be allowed to shield U S  listed Chinese companies from complying with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability   Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at the time 
A third source said the idea of delisting was the latest salvo in this longstanding dispute 
 This is a very high priority for the administration  Chinese companies not complying with the PCAOB  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  process poses risks to U S  investors   the source said 
Any plan is subject to approval by Trump  who has given the green light to the discussion  Bloomberg reported  citing a person close to the deliberations 
Officials are also examining how the United States could put limits on Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U S  firms  the agency cited three sources as saying 
As of February  156 Chinese companies were listed on the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchanges  according to U S  government data  including at least 11 state owned firms   https    NYSE declined to comment on Friday  while Nasdaq  MSCI  S P and FTSE Russell did not immediately respond to requests for comment

Trade talks between the United States and China are expected to be held Oct  10 11 after months of tit for tat moves by both sides which have weakened global growth and driven rollercoaster moves in markets 
While the idea of delisting could be a maneuver ahead of those talks  the main aim was to counteract the civilian military fusion of Chinese technology firms  the Made in China 2025 industrial development program targeting key industries for domination and a growing surveillance state in Xinjiang  one of the sources said 
The source said there are longstanding concerns about U S  capital enabling these activities  especially as the lines blur between state owned and private companies in China 
 It s all very disruptive  it just adds to uncertainty and it s a big negative for business investment   said Scott Brown  chief economist at investment bank Raymond James  He noted  however  that both sides have used aggressive moves in the past ahead of talks 
 You never know if it s a ploy to get some leverage   he said

159312,380828,BIDU,Trump Officials Play Down Reports of China Investment Limits,news," Bloomberg     Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars  Sign up here  
The Trump administration has issued a partial    and qualified    denial to the revelation that it is discussing imposing limits on U S  investments in Chinese companies and financial markets as China vowed to continue opening its markets to foreign investment 
Bloomberg News on Friday reported that Larry Kudlow  the head of President Donald Trump s National Economic Council  was leading deliberations inside the White House over what some hawks have labeled a potential  financial decoupling  of the world s two largest economies 
The options discussed have included forcing a delisting of Chinese companies from U S  exchanges  imposing limits on investments in Chinese markets by U S  government pension funds and putting caps on the value of Chinese companies included in indexes managed by U S  firms  according to people familiar with and involved in the discussions 
In a statement emailed to Bloomberg over the weekend  a spokeswoman for U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there were no current plans to stop Chinese companies from listing on U S  exchanges 
 The administration is not contemplating blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U S  stock exchanges at this time   Treasury spokeswoman Monica Crowley said  Crowley did not address any of the other options reported and declined to offer any further details of the discussions 
The response came after Friday s initial Bloomberg report  which was later matched by other news organizations including the Financial Times and New York Times  unnerved markets in the U S  and led to a slump in U S  listed Chinese firms  The S P 500 Index closed down about 0 5  on Friday with the U S  shares of companies like  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding and Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   tumbling  China s main share indexes were little changed on Monday morning 
New Talks
The Trump administration is also getting ready to host Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and other senior officials for trade talks expected Oct  10 11  just days before another threatened increase in U S  tariffs on Chinese imports is due to take effect 
While both sides are eager to secure at least a short term truce in what is now an 18 month old trade war that has started to drag on the global economy  national security hawks inside the Trump administration continue to push for the conflict to be broadened 
The desire by some inside the White house for new controls on the flow of capital to China reflects the multi dimensional economic war some Trump advisers are eager to wage against a rising economic rival  Beyond the tariffs on some  360 billion in imports from China imposed since last year  the Trump administration is pursuing strict new controls on exports of technology and has taken a skeptical approach to Chinese backed investments in the U S 
People close to the White House deliberations say they remain preliminary and that no final course of action has been decided on  They also insist the focus is on protecting U S  investors from ending up unwittingly with stakes in Chinese companies that do not have the same auditing standards as U S  listed firms 
One factor in that happening  they say  is the increasing presence of Chinese institutions on indexes such as MSCI s benchmark emerging markets index and a Bloomberg  Barclays   LON BARC  bond index  Both are used by many institutional investors to decide the composition of their funds 
The growing Chinese presence on international indices reflects China s economic rise and Beijing s decision to continue opening up its financial markets to outside investors  Earlier this month  China lifted long standing quantitative limits on foreign investment in mainland markets 
China on Sunday declared that the government would continue to open up its financial markets and encourage foreign investment 
 We will take further steps to promote high quality two way financial opening  encourage foreign financial institutions and funds to invest in the domestic financial market to boost the competitiveness and dynamism of the domestic financial system   read a summary from the eighth meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee posted on its website ",2019-09-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/trump-officials-play-down-reports-of-china-investment-limits-1988683,1988683

ByteDance  which was loss making in the first half  also posted a profit in June and was confident of making a profit in the second half of the year  one of the people said  declining to be identified as the company has not made a public announcement 
Robust growth has led the Beijing based startup to revise its revenue target for 2019 to 120 billion yuan from an earlier goal set late last year of 100 billion yuan  a second person said 
Earnings figures for last year were not immediately available  According to online tech news outlet The Information  ByteDance revenue for the whole of 2018 was  7 2 billion 
ByteDance declined to comment 
The seven year old startup  which separate sources have said was valued at  78 billion late last year  also owns Chinese news aggregator Jinri Toutiao  meaning  Today s Headlines   as well as a domestic version of TikTok  known as Douyin 
Most of the company s revenue is garnered in China  the second person familiar with the matter said  adding that while Douyin generates advertising fees  TikTok is still in the early stages of making money

159314,380830,BIDU,Explainer  What delisting Chinese firms from U S  stock markets could mean,news,"By John Ruwitch and Alun John
SHANGHAI HONG KONG  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump s administration is considering forcing Chinese firms to delist from U S  stock exchanges  according to sources  a move that would escalate U S  China tensions and could throw some of China s biggest companies into chaos 
It was not clear how the delistings might be done  but the idea is part of a broader effort to limit U S  investment in Chinese companies  two sources said  One source said it was motivated by the Trump administration s growing security concerns about the companies  activities 
HOW SIGNIFICANT WOULD DELISTING CHINESE COMPANIES BE 
Market participants say a forced delisting on this scale would be unprecedented  As of February  more than 150 Chinese firms are listed on the Nasdaq  New York Stock Exchange and NYSE American exchange for small cap firms 
Some of those listed are giants   Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  N BABA   Baidu Inc  O BIDU  and JD com Inc  O JD   for example  have a combined market capitalization of more than  500 billion 
Some prestigious older companies like oil giant PetroChina  N PTR   SS 601857   HK 0857  and China Life Insurance  N LFC   SS 601628   HK 2628  also have U S  listings 
WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE 
The proposals are likely to affect firms  willingness to list in the United States as well as provide rival bourses with a fresh and lucrative opportunity to woo Chinese companies  Other stock exchanges that might benefit include Hong Kong  London and China s newly launched STAR market for startups  analysts have said 
 The proposed measures would completely undermine the international  American Depository Receipt  market and would harm the U S  s role as a conduit for international capital   analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note on Sunday 
IPO bankers expect there will now be a pause in new Chinese listings in the United States as companies  advisers and investors wait for more clarity  Some might also wait to see whether Trump wins re election in 2020 
It is unclear how forced delistings could be implemented 
If the proposal goes ahead  Chinese companies which are already listed would have to find a way to buy out shareholders  One option would be a secondary listing elsewhere and giving investors new shares in exchange for the U S  stocks  said an equity capital markets banker  declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media 
This plan would come with a number of risks for both investors and the companies as well as significant technical challenges  the banker said 
HAS THE IDEA OF FORCED DELISTINGS COME UP BEFORE 
Individual delistings are not uncommon  Companies may take themselves private or move to other exchanges  while bourses regularly remove listings that fail to comply with requirements  However forced delistings for geopolitical reasons would be very unusual 
Several Russian companies are still traded on U S  exchanges even after the United States imposed sanctions following the 2014 dispute in Ukraine 
Pressuring at least some Chinese firms to delist has been raised previously 
For years  corporate governance advocates and politicians in the United States have complained about the lack of access to working papers from the audits of Chinese companies  In June  a bipartisan group of U S  lawmakers in June proposed a bill that would force U S  listed Chinese firms to submit to more regulatory oversight or face delisting ",2019-09-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainer-what-delisting-chinese-firms-from-us-stock-markets-could-mean-1988898,1988898

1 GO BIG  ECB  OR GO HOME
Bond markets have become accustomed to getting their own way  So on Thursday when the ECB holds one of its most anticipated meetings ever  they will be watching for Mario Draghi  in one of his final acts as ECB chief  to unleash more stimulus to boost the bloc s stubbornly weak economy and inflation 
On the table are interest rate cuts  a resumption of asset purchases  a pledge to keep rates low for longer and compensation for banks suffering from negative rates  Money markets are positioned for sizeable rate cuts between now and end 2020 
The risk is the package falls short   if markets see it as a damp squib rather than the necessary bazooka  Already yields have jumped off record lows after some ECB officials dampened expectations of an aggressive easing package and played down the need to resume bond buying 
But others argue that if the bank is serious about boosting inflation  below target since 2013  it needs to deliver more not less  Failure to do so could trigger a huge bond tantrum  one that makes the recent selloff look like a blip

But could it also be the P in a yet to be created acronym for a European tech grouping  Prosus will be tiny compared with the FAANGs  which are worth a collective  2 8 trillion  But it would still be Europe s second largest tech firm after Germany s SAP  Its listing will offer a boost to the pan European tech stocks index  which is currently worth about 430 billion euros   475 billion

China has just slashed banks  reserve ratios  meaning lenders will need to keep less cash in hand  That frees up around 900 billion yuan to shore up the economy  The move was anticipated and now the question is  do authorities think more policy easing is needed and when could more measures be deployed 
The upcoming data dump from Beijing could provide a clue  It will show how the trade war is hitting the world s No  2 economy and market expectations are not pretty  Export growth is seen slowing  imports falling and factory gate prices dropping for a second month running as manufacturers cut prices   and their own margins   to offset tariffs increases and faltering domestic demand  We also get an update on credit which could recover after last month s contraction in new loans and social financing 
A truly dire set of data could see the central bank open the monetary policy sluice gates  possibly even before the U S  Fed gets in another rate cut 
Bulls see Beijing unleashing a ride to the rescue infrastructure boom  Bears only see battle lines hardening and an already here slowdown that shudders through the global economy for years 
5 RETAIL RELIEF
Sept  1 saw U S  tariff increases kick in on  112 billion worth of Chinese goods imports  bringing the tax up to 15   Beijing has slapped on retaliatory levies  taking the trade war up another notch  News the two sides are to resume talks in October has soothed some fears but the tariffs will raise the prices Americans pay for some clothes  shoes  mobile phones and other consumer goods    just before the holiday shopping season  Given consumer spending is the U S  economy s main driver  that s a worry 
In the face of slowing exports and investment  shoppers remain a bright spot  U S  consumer retail sales increased 0 7  in July  surpassing the 0 3  pickup analysts had forecast  So the August figures   due Friday    will be of interest  Forecasts are for a 0 4  increase  But year over year growth is predicted at 3 2   slowing from 3 4  in July 
Ominously  U S  retailers have been warning investors not to expect too much when they post results in upcoming quarters  To date  33 companies have issued profit warnings for the third 2019 quarter  while only 15 have delivered positive messages 
Accordingly  analysts polled by Refinitiv have steadily lowered earnings estimates  For the S P 500  Q3 profits are forecast to decline by 2   before President Donald Trump s tariff escalation in early August  a 0 6  drop had been expected

159360,380876,BIDU,China s Baidu beats earnings expectations  shares rally,news,"By Yingzhi Yang and Ayanti Bera
 Reuters    Chinese internet search giant Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  beat quarterly earnings estimates on Monday after signing more people up to its video streaming service  sending its shares higher in a relief rally 
Baidu reported a small 1  bump in revenue and a 62  drop in net profit for the second quarter  but the result was welcomed by investors who had feared worse amid a slowing Chinese economy and stiff competition from rivals like ByteDance s TikTok 
Baidu s earnings update followed reports from  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  and JD com last week  which also beat expectations  showing how some tech giants  diversification strategies might be helping stave off macroeconomic pressures 
Baidu s video streaming service iQiyi was a key driver of the revenue bump as it crossed the 100 million subscriber mark in June  although there were some concerns about rising costs at the unit associated with winning and retaining viewers 
Baidu s total revenue for the three months to the end of June rose to 26 33 billion yuan   3 7 billion  from 25 97 billion yuan a year earlier  beating a forecast 25 77 billion yuan  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
Baidu earned 10 11 yuan per American depositary share  compared with expectations of 6 12 yuan per ADS 
 It makes sense that Baidu beats the estimates because analysts have lowered their expectations to the minimum   said Connie Gu  an analyst at BOCOM International  adding the market would need to see better than expected results for several consecutive quarters for more sustained confidence 
Baidu s Nasdaq listed shares rose over 9  in after hours trading  The stock has plummeted more than 50  over the past year 
But there were some red flags at separately listed Netflix like iQiyi  where shares tumbled by the same magnitude after a 20  jump in costs as the company spent more on content to entice subscribers undercut a 15  rise in revenue to 7 11 billion yuan 
STRUCTURAL PRESSURE
Baidu  whose search engine dominates the market in China  has been under pressure as factors such as U S  China trade tensions and tougher government regulation weighed on key revenue contributors like advertising 
Analysts said Baidu faced a longer term structural problem  especially with the rise of new media platforms seeking to lure away subscribers 
 Competition from recently rising large traffic platforms is becoming more and more fierce  with advertisers shifting budget to those platforms   said Natalie Wu  an analyst at China International Capital Corporation 
While Baidu has been expanding into other business lines such as cloud services and mini programs within its Baidu App  most of its success so far has been at iQiyi 
Revenues at its core search engine business dipped 2  during the quarter  while Baidu s net income more than halved to 2 4 billion yuan 
Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li warned employees in an internal letter on Tuesday that  severe external challenges and a weak macro environment  necessitated changes to the company s personnel and business strategy 
 These changes will bring pain in phases  but will also bring positive and far reaching effects  to allow Baidu to walk on more steadily and for longer   he said in the letter seen by Reuters

159381,380897,BIDU,China s robot censors crank up as Tiananmen anniversary nears,news,"By Cate Cadell BEIJING  Reuters    It s the most sensitive day of the year for China s internet  the anniversary of the bloody June 4 crackdown on pro democracy protests at Tiananmen Square  NYSE SQ   and with under two weeks to go  China s robot censors are working overtime   Censors at Chinese internet companies say tools to detect and block content related to the 1989 crackdown have reached unprecedented levels of accuracy  aided by machine learning and voice and image recognition    We sometimes say that the artificial intelligence is a scalpel  and a human is a machete   said one content screening employee at Beijing Bytedance Co Ltd  who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to media   Two employees at the firm said censorship of the Tiananmen crackdown  along with other highly sensitive issues including Taiwan and Tibet  is now largely automated   Posts that allude to dates  images and names associated with the protests are automatically rejected   When I first began this kind of work four years ago there was opportunity to remove the images of Tiananmen  but now the artificial intelligence is very accurate   one of the people said  Four censors  working across Bytedance  Weibo Corp and Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  apps said they censor between 5 000 10 000 pieces of information a day  or five to seven pieces a minute  most of which they said were pornographic or violent content   Despite advances in AI censorship  current day tourist snaps in the square are sometimes unintentionally blocked  one of the censors said  Bytedance and Baidu declined to comment  while Weibo did not respond to request for comment  SENSITIVE PERIOD The Tiananmen crackdown is a taboo subject in China 30 years after the government sent tanks to quell student led protests calling for democratic reforms  Beijing has never released a death toll but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand  June 4th itself is marked by a cat and mouse game as people use more and more obscure references on social media sites  with obvious allusions blocked immediately  In some years  even the word  today  has been scrubbed  In 2012  China s most watched stock index fell 64 89 points on the anniversary day   echoing the date of the original event in what analysts said was likely a strange coincidence rather than a deliberate reference   Still  censors blocked access to the term  Shanghai stock market  and to the index numbers themselves on microblogs  along with other obscure references to sensitive issues  While companies censorship tools are becoming more refined  analysts  academics and users say heavy handed policies mean sensitive periods before anniversaries and political events have become catch alls for a wide range of sensitive content  In the lead up to this year s Tiananmen Square anniversary  censorship on social media has targeted LGBT groups  labor and environment activists and NGOs  they say  Upgrades to censorship tech have been urged on by new policies introduced by the Cyberspace Administration of China  CAC   The group was set up   and officially led   by President Xi Jinping  whose tenure has been defined by increasingly strict ideological control of the internet   The CAC did not respond to a request for comment  Last November  the CAC introduced new rules aimed at quashing dissent online in China  where  falsifying the history of the Communist Party  on the internet is a punishable offence for both platforms and individuals   The new rules require assessment reports and site visits for any internet platform that could be used to  socially mobilize  or lead to  major changes in public opinion   including access to real names  network addresses  times of use  chat logs and call logs  One official who works for CAC told Reuters the recent boost in online censorship is  very likely  linked to the upcoming anniversary    There is constant communication with the companies during this time   said the official  who declined to directly talk about the Tiananmen  instead referring to the  the sensitive period in June    Companies  which are largely responsible for their own censorship  receive little in the way of directives from the CAC  but are responsible for creating guidelines in their own  internal ethical and party units   the official said   SECRET FACTS With Xi s tightening grip on the internet  the flow of information has been centralized under the Communist Party s Propaganda Department and state media network  Censors and company staff say this reduces the pressure of censoring some events  including major political news  natural disasters and diplomatic visits    When it comes to news  the rule is simple    If it is not from state media first  it is not authorized  especially regarding the leaders and political items   said one Baidu staffer    We have a basic list of keywords which include the 1989 details  but  AI  can more easily select those    Punishment for failing to properly censor content can be severe  In the past six weeks  popular services including a Netease Inc news app  Tencent Holdings Ltd s news app TianTian  and Sina Corp have all been hit with suspensions ranging from days to weeks  according to the CAC  meaning services are made temporarily unavailable on apps stores and online   For internet users and activists  penalties can range from fines to jail time for spreading information about sensitive events online  In China  social media accounts are linked to real names and national ID numbers by law  and companies are legally compelled to offer user information to authorities when requested    It has become normal to know things and also understand that they can t be shared   said one user  Andrew Hu   They re secret facts   In 2015  Hu spent three days in detention in his home region of Inner Mongolia after posting a comment about air pollution onto an unrelated image that alluded to the Tiananmen crackdown on Twitter like social media site Weibo  Hu  who declined to use his full Chinese name to avoid further run ins with the law  said when police officers came to his parents house while he was on leave from his job in Beijing he was surprised  but not frightened   
 The responsible authorities and the internet users are equally confused   said Hu   Even if the enforcement is irregular  they know the simple option is to increase pressure  ",2019-05-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/chinas-robot-censors-crank-up-as-tiananmen-anniversary-nears-1879014,1879014

159383,380899,BIDU,Tencent backed live streaming firm DouYu prices U S  IPO at low end of range,news,"By Joshua Franklin and Julie Zhu
NEW YORK HONG KONG  Reuters     DouYu International Holdings  Ltd  N DOYU   China s largest live streaming platform  on Tuesday said it sold  775 million in stock at a  3 73 billion valuation after pricing its U S  initial public offering  IPO  at the bottom of an indicative range 
DouYu  which is backed by Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   sold American depositary shares  ADS  at  11 5 each  compared with a previously stated target of  11 50 to  14 00  the firm said in a statement  Every 10 ADSs represent one ordinary share 
That makes the deal the largest Chinese IPO in the United States so far in 2019  eclipsing that of  Luckin Coffee  Inc  O LK  which raised  645 million  according Refinitiv data 
However the weak pricing opens questions about the necessity of DouYu s decision in May to put its IPO on hold amid a global markets sell off stemming from U S  China trade tensions 
The IPO was also a test of U S  investor demand for Chinese stocks after Anheuser Busch InBev NV  BR ABI  called off the Hong Kong listing of its Asia Pacific brewing business due to weak orders from U S   long only  fund managers 
DouYu  which primarily focuses on the live streaming of games  is one of several Chinese start ups in the growing market for live streaming in the world s second biggest economy  along with Huajiao and U S  listed Huya Inc  N HUYA  
DouYu has exclusive streaming rights to 29 major tournaments in China  including League of Legends  PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds and DOTA2  according to its IPO filing 
The rapid growth of the live streaming sector has seen China s tech heavyweights   Tencent   Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  N BABA  and Baidu Inc  O BIDU    open their wallets to back a slew of firms in the hope of boosting existing services in e commerce  social networking and gaming 
DouYu s losses in 2018 widened to 876 3 million yuan   127 43 million  from 612 9 million yuan a year earlier  its prospectus showed  The company did  however  report a profit of 18 2 million yuan for the first three months of 2019 
Of the shares on sale in the IPO  DouYu sold two thirds to raise  517 million  with the remainder sold by existing investors 
Shares of DouYu  which translates to  Fighting Fish   are due to start trading on Wednesday under the symbol  DOYU  on the Nasdaq stock exchange

159410,380926,BIDU,Baidu Inc   BIDU  Upgraded To Strong Buy  What Does It Mean For The Stock ,opinion,"Baidu Inc   NASDAQ BIDU  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Baidu Inc  basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Baidu Inc  imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Baidu Inc 
This web search company is expected to earn  5 59 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of  42  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Baidu Inc  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 54 3  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term 
You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here    
The upgrade of Baidu Inc  to a Zacks Rank  1 positions it in the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baidu-inc-bidu-upgraded-to-strong-buy-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-200500726,200500726

159428,380944,BIDU,On the autofarm  China turns to driverless tractors  combines to overhaul agriculture,news,"By Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton Xinghua  China  Reuters    A brand new combine harvester buzzes up and down a field in eastern China without a driver on board  chopping golden rice stalks and offering a glimpse of what authorities say is the automated future of the nation s mammoth agricultural sector   The bright green prototype was operating last autumn during a trial of driverless farm equipment as the government pushes firms to develop within 7 years fully automated machinery capable of planting  fertilizing and harvesting each of China s staple crops   rice  wheat and corn  That shift to automation is key to the farming sector in the world s No 2 economy as it grapples with an ageing rural workforce and a dearth of young people willing to endure the hardships many associate with toiling on the land  Other countries like Australia and the United States are taking similar steps in the face of such demographic pressures  but the sheer scale of China s farming industry means the stakes are particularly high in its drive to automate agriculture   Automated farming is the way ahead and demand for it here is huge   said Cheng Yue  general manager of tractor maker Changzhou Dongfeng CVT Co Ltd  which provided an autonomous vehicle that was also used at the trial in the rice field in Xinghua  a county in the eastern province of Jiangsu  However  the road to automation is long and littered with obstacles such as high costs  the nation s varied terrain and the small size of many of its farms   I have heard of driverless tractors  But I don t think they are practical  especially the really large ones   said Li Guoyong  a wheat farmer in China s northern Hebei province   Most farms in his area are only a few hectares in size  he said by phone  GOING LOCAL To try to achieve its ambitious 7 year goal  Beijing is supporting trials of local technology across the country organised by industry group Telematics Industry Application Alliance  TIAA    Members include state owned tractor maker YTO Group  navigation systems producer Hwa Create and Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science   Technology Co Ltd  SZ 000157   which helped develop the combine harvester used in the Xinghua trial along with Jiangsu University  The next trials are slated for the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and for the hills around the southwestern city of Chongqing in the first half of this year   Those come after a string of automated developments in the sector  YTO developed its first driverless tractor in 2017 and is aiming to start mass production soon  depending on market demand  said Lei Jun  an executive at the firm s technology center  without giving a more detailed timeline  Lovol Heavy Industry Co Ltd signed a deal with Baidu  O BIDU  in April to apply the tech giant s Apollo automated driving system to its agricultural machinery   China is expected to climb the autonomous technology ladder very quickly  mainly because Chinese companies can access the local navigation satellite system  which gives them an advantage over their international peers   said Alexious Lee  Head of China Industrial Research at Hong Kong brokerage CLSA   He was referring to China s  Beidou  homegrown satellite navigation system  a rival to the U S  Global Positioning System  GPS   Beijing has included agricultural machinery in its  Made in China 2025  campaign  meaning the vast majority of its farm equipment should be produced at home by that time   Semi automated technology is already fairly common on farms in places such as the United States  but fully automated tractors and combines have yet to be mass produced anywhere  TOO SMALL But with many Chinese farms still too small for a regular tractor  driverless ones that could be as high as four times more expensive at around  90 000 will be a long way out of reach for many in the short term   More than 90 percent of farms in China are less than 1 hectare  while in the United States nearly 90 percent are larger than 5 hectares    It is not about whether you have the product  It is about the entire system  It is about commercializing agriculture   said Lee  Although analysts and industry officials said that the underlying trend would be for farms to get larger as ongoing reforms to land rights should allow farmers to lease more space    GRAPHIC  China vs U S  crop area  production and farm size    Sensors in equipment that help monitor crop conditions also need to be improved so that machines can adjust more quickly to different situations  said Wei Xinhua  deputy director of the school of agriculture equipment engineering at Jiangsu University    GRAPHIC  China vs United States corn area  output and yield    China s  60 billion farm machinery industry has been burdened by overcapacity and low profit margins after a years long subsidy scheme to promote mechanization in farming led to mass production of low quality tractors  Analysts said it was too early to say how much the automated farming machinery sector could eventually be worth   Automated farming machines are also useful in recording data on details such as volumes of fertilisers or other materials used in churning out crops  potentially helping farmers target consumers demanding higher quality produce as some of that information could be included on food labels   Take a bowl of rice  I want to know exactly how it was planted  and how much fertilizer or pesticide was applied to it   said Cheng at Changzhou Dongfeng

design studio  is overflowing with game magazines  figurines and boxes of sci fi novels  The 30 year old game developer is a child of the county s tech boom  she studied at one of China s top universities and her company hit it big with an award winning game that was published on Nintendo s Switch console and the PC gaming platform Steam  with plans for roll out on other game platforms   Now her ambitions   and those of many others across China s giant tech industry   are facing a reckoning  amid rising state control over the sector  tightening regulation and a biting trade war with the United States stymieing growth    In 2015  doing a start up was popular  So many young people set up small businesses  like developing games  and dreamed of making big money as well as being free   she said   But they found out now it s really unrealistic   Wang says she has had to abandon for now hopes of releasing the game on new platforms in China  closing the original studio that developed it and working instead on updates with a skeleton crew of freelancers  She has moved from the Beijing tech hub of Zhongguancun to the city s cheaper far west outskirts to cut costs  She is not alone  Reuters interviewed a dozen tech industry insiders  from gig economy workers to investors  who said that the boom days of easy returns looked to be over  Until last year  China s tech industry had enjoyed years of breakneck growth  Firms including  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd almost doubled in value in 2017 alone  making big ticket investments as part of a multi billion dollar expansion into cloud  offline retail and finance  But now the market is feeling the pinch  Hiring numbers are down  company margins are thinner and tumbling technology stocks have wiped nearly half a trillion dollars this year from the value of China s top listed tech firms  The biggest names in tech have flagged concerns  including Alibaba and Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   who revised down their full year sales forecasts in recent weeks on the weaker outlook   Investments into the tech space have definitely cooled down  measured by almost every metric  number of deals  deal size or fund raising   said Zhang Chenhao  Shanghai based Managing Partner at technology focused Prometheus Fund   I think this year is the first time over the last 30 years when greed yields to the fear   HAND OF THE STATE The technology sector is facing challenges on all sides  A broader economic slowdown saw China s third quarter GDP slow to its weakest pace since the global financial crisis  The currency has slid against the dollar and domestic markets are down sharply   Alongside a series of tit for tat trade tariffs  the United States has accused China of stealing technology  barring tech acquisitions by Chinese firms and blacklisting others  At home  tech companies from social media to gaming and fintech have seen tightening regulation and a heavier hand from the ruling Communist Party  Gaming and social media giant Tencent has seen its stock price dive by more than 25 percent this year amid a temporary ban on licenses for games  its top revenue driver  At the country s top internet forum in Wuzhen this week  officials signaled they would look to rein in the country s tech giants    They can be big but we should also be well regulated   said Gao Xiang  vice minister of China s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Thursday  China s regulators have already cracked down on everything from rude joke apps to livestream bloggers disrespecting national anthem   sending a chill through the free wheeling and innovative online arena    The people who worry about technology is first older people  second government and third successful people  they hate it and worry about it   Alibaba s billionaire executive chairman Jack Ma said at an event in Shanghai last week   Normally businesses do innovation and governments talk innovation  In order to protect yesterday s interests    they will say please don t do it   This year Alibaba has lowered its revenue forecast for the first time since listing in 2014  Meanwhile  local ride sharing giant Didi Chuxing  backed by Japan s SoftBank Group Corp  has cut the subsidies it pays to drivers after being forced to shutter its car pooling services under a plan agreed with regulators following criticism over the murders of two young female passengers in separate incidents    In 2015  I bought my first vehicle because you could earn almost 800 yuan a day with the subsidies   says Huang Sun  who used to drive full time for the company but now says he only takes rides when he is bored   Now maybe you can t even earn 200 yuan if you drive all day   HIRING FREEZE The chill across the tech industry is reflected in hiring data  According to statistics released by leading local job website Zhaopin com  job demand in the IT and internet sector has dropped by 51 percent as of September compared with a year earlier  Companies have slowed hiring in certain fields  including sales and software development  recruiters and human resources staff at Alibaba and Tencent said  asking not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to press  Tencent did not respond to a request for comment  Alibaba had no immediate comment   In general  they are all reducing headcount  or they re not preparing a very big budget for headhunting   said Mocca Wang  who is the director of the IT industry unit at international recruitment firm Spring Professional  which works with companies like Alibaba  Tencent and Baidu   Smaller start ups  a key driver of growth in the sector  are also being squeezed by tighter access to credit   These companies can t get capital and can t invest   said Wang   They re going bankrupt   China s tech firms are  to be sure  still posting sales growth rates above overseas peers  Tencent chief Pony Ma told state television in a recent interview that there was still  tremendous potential  in the market  though admitted  there are challenges of various kinds right now   But the numbers suggest tougher times lie ahead   a worry for China s steeply valued private tech start ups and newly listed firms such as smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp and Tencent backed food deliver giant Meituan Dianping   Before the feeling was that anyone can get funding  that if you throw out words like blockchain  AI  big data and machine learning that would get you funding   said Benjamin Speyer  managing director at Hangzhou based consultancy Serica   Now everyone is a bit more nervous about potentially making a mistake with their money   Alibaba  whose China commerce sales growth dropped to its lowest rate since 2015 in the last quarter  said it would take less income from its platforms for the near future  effectively subsidizing merchants  in an effort to retain brands on its platform   Competitor JD com Inc  which posted a loss last quarter  is seeking to revive profits by outsourcing some of its 2 5 million square meters of warehouse space  The country s upstart technology workforce are even more keenly aware of the slowdown  Even as property and living costs continue to rise sharply in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai  tech workers say salaries can t keep up   Beijing based Liu Wangwei works as a software engineer at one of the country s highest valued start ups and rents a two bedroom apartment because his partially disabled mother often stays with him  He said his rent has risen by almost 50 percent since they moved to the area in 2014 and says he is considering moving to another of the company s offices in a smaller city where the government subsidizes housing for technology workers

violating user data protection in Brazil  per a Reuters  Reportedly  Brazil s Ministry of Justice has levied a fine of 6 6 million reais or  1 6 million on Facebook for improperly sharing user information Brazil s Ministry of Justice and Public Security  that it examined  the violation of the personal data of the Facebook platform s contracting consumers  as well as whether someone had obtained improper access to such data  taking into account the user s consent form  where sharing is the default  and automatic data sharing with application developers of this user s friends  In issuing the fine  the Department of Consumer Protection stated that the data of 443 000 Facebook users was improperly made available to the developers of a Facebook app named  thisisyourdigitallife  Notably  the  thisisyourdigitallife  app was built by Cambridge Analytica in the run up to the 2016 U S  presidential election  This was aimed to gather information about Facebook users in order to target them for political advertisements Additionally  the agency ruled the data was used for questionable purposes  Moreover  Facebook also failed to provide appropriate information to their users with regard to privacy settings on the social media platform  and how user data  particularly that of friends and friends of friends on Facebook was shared with third party apps Facebook has 10 days to appeal the fine  If it does not appeal  the company has 30 days to pay the fine Facebook  Inc  Price and Consensus   Facebook s Expensive Penalty Payments in 2019Earlier this month  the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  had issued a unanimous ruling against Cambridge Analytica  Approved by FTC commissioners in a 5 0 vote  the agency officially  that Cambridge Analytica violated federal law by deceiving Facebook users about what data would be collected and how it would be used This is not the first financial penalty for Facebook  following the scandal in which Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of around 50 million Facebook users without their permission Notably  Facebook settled with the FTC in July 2019  The company was  with a fine of  5 billion for privacy violation Moreover  Facebook was   645 000 by the British government in October for related data security concerns involving Cambridge Analytica  The fine comes as part of a settlement between Facebook and the U K  government in which the company will not admit any liability over its data practices  per a CNN  Nevertheless  Facebook s recent privacy friendly initiatives are noteworthy  The company is working on making its products and services end to end encrypted and ephemeral so that user information is not available for long Initiatives to Help Regain User TrustFacebook has been undertaking a number of

developers Apps associated with 400 developers were suspended for a variety of reasons including the inability or failure of response to Facebook s request for information  The company has suspended apps in testing phase and also banned a few completely Moreover  the company also rolled out a tool called Off Facebook Activity  which enables users to better control their privacy  The tool helps users to see apps and websites that share information related to their activities on Facebook However  if users decide to clear Off Facebook Activity from their accounts  it is expected to reduce the

159503,381019,BIDU,Chart Of The Day  Will Improved Trade Sentiment Reverse Baidu s Slump ,opinion,"Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  CEO Robin Li Yanhong  back in March that the trade war with the U S  has no meaningful impact on the Chinese internet search provider 

Seven weeks later  on May 17  the stock plunged 16 5 percent  despite having shown solid  21  growth in revenuein the first quarter  Investors sold it off specifically because of the trade war  Baidu makes its revenue from advertising and March marked a full year since the start of the trade spat  prompting the company s clients to cut back on advertising 

On Monday we featured  Caterpillar  Inc s  NYSE CAT   our favorite among the 25 companies listed on CNBC s China Trade Index  We believe Baidu had the biggest upside potential among that group  though earlier in the week we wanted more evidence the stock had bottomed  The chart below helps provide additional clarity on where the company s shares are headed 



The 16 5  plunge on May 17 created a falling breakaway gap  as it dropped below the long term uptrend line since January 2009  After that fateful day  investors deepened the plunge by another 26   till the Aug  15   93 39 bottom  A  58 96 plunge from the closing price on May 16 of  153 70  All told  the price was slashed by 38 46  
However  the company has been steadily climbing since  rising  30 04  or 32 17   Has it bottomed  Not just yet  but it could be close 
The stock has been struggling to break free of a falling channel since mid May 2018  The 200 DMA has been tracing the channel top and is now providing resistance  turning yesterday s candle into a doji  below the Nov  7 highs  It s threatening a fall back below the July 1 high  above which the price has been unable to break free since then 
The 50 DMA has been rising toward the 200 DMA  toward a possible golden cross  on positive trade sentiment  Investors are likely to wait to see which way the wind blows in the back and forth trade talks and whether they might lead to an actual agreement between the world s two mightiest economies  A close above  130 would suggest that the way is paved till the next major resistance  the  160 area   the congestion before the fall 
Trading StrategiesConservative traders should wait before entering a long position for a close above  135  with a return move that demonstrates support above the November December range 
Moderate traders might be content with a close above  130 and a pull back for a better entry  not proof of demand 
Aggressive traders may enter a contrarian trade  relying on the quadruple resistance  July 1 high  Nov  8 high  the 200 DMA and the doji  The proximity to resistance provides an attractive risk reward ratio

159512,381028,BIDU,Data dump  China sees surge in personal information up for sale,news,"By Engen Tham SHANGHAI  Reuters    When William Zhang s car insurance was about to expire in March  he didn t need to look far for renewal options  In the two months before the policy was up Zhang received calls almost daily from insurers trying to sell him a new one  Since his initial policy was from Ping An Insurance Group  SS 601318   it was natural the company had been in touch   What confuses me is how other insurance companies knew about it   said Zhang  a 26 year old government employee from Shandong  Three other car owners told Reuters that they had experienced the same problem  Personal data has become widely available in China and can be scooped up for pennies by insurance companies  banks  loan sharks  and scammers alike  according to sellers and financiers interviewed by Reuters  In May  China introduced its most comprehensive data protection laws to date  tightening restrictions on the sharing of private data held by financial institutions and other firms   Personal information leaks are risky   said Susan Ning  a partner at the law firm King   Wood Mallesons in Beijing   Such information can facilitate other crimes   she added  DATA TRADE Insurers often buy numbers from shadowy online data sellers  who themselves have acquired the information illegally  according to people in the industry  Some companies illegally buy information from the department of motor vehicles  car licensing authorities  car sellers  or from police stations  said Michelle Hu  a partner at Boston Consulting Group who has been a consultant on insurance deals  By entering keywords like  personal data  or  cellphone data   in Chinese  Reuters found more than 30 groups created for the purpose of selling and buying personal information on Tencent s  HK 0700  instant messaging service QQ and Baidu Inc s  O BIDU  forum site Tieba  Baidu declined to comment  In a statement emailed to Reuters  Tencent said it was  committed to the protection of user privacy and maintaining data security   Information sellers post ads in the online groups and negotiate with buyers through private messages on QQ or WeChat   Five sellers offered to sell Reuters lists from financial institutions of  people who need loans    people who need insurance   and  Shanghainese men aged between 30 to 50   The price of such information varied among sellers  ranging from 300 yuan   43 64  to 2 800 yuan for 100 000 people  A sample list included individuals  birth dates  car and home ownership status  and mortgage information  in addition to names and telephone numbers  Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the information   Three loan agents who sell mortgages for three leading Chinese lenders said customer information was often sold by bank employees  Some internet companies also provide access to sensitive personal information for a fee  according to Reuters  communications with two such platforms   Duoku Technology  a Wuhan based firm  for example  operates a personal information search platform   For 5 yuan  Duoku returns the ID picture of any Chinese citizen whose name and ID number are provided  For 3 yuan  the site returns data about a person s cellphone usage  Reuters verified that both services worked  The person whose ID picture was requested did not know how the services obtained his photo or telephone bills  When asked where Duoku collected or purchased the information  a spokeswoman at Duoku Technology who identified herself as Ms  Li  said much of the data was bought from online merchants and sold to banks and insurance companies   Financial institutions use our service for risk management purposes only   she said   Hours after Reuters first published the story Duoku Technology emailed to say their website has removed the products set out above and in future will not be selling to individuals  LAW AND ORDER Data privacy has also become a major issue around the world  with companies like Facebook  NASDAQ FB  criticized for harvesting and selling users  personal data without their explicit consent  Online scammers are also common in other countries  In China  a proliferation of online financial platforms and users has led to a surge in the sharing of personal data  despite legislative efforts to protect consumers in recent years  experts say  Under current laws  personal information sellers can face up to seven years in prison and a fine  while buying personal data can be punished by fines and up to three years in prison  Corporations are subject to similar legal punishments   Despite such censure  around 90 percent of phone scams stem from personal information breaches  according to a Union Pay report in May   Central to this problem is the high economic benefits associated with personal information trade and the low costs of violating relevant laws   said Ning    For some individuals with authorization  others  personal information is just a few clicks away    Other reasons behind personal data breaches include a lack of security measures on some websites  and ambiguous terms in certain contracts regarding the use of personal information  said Ning   China has a large population and data privacy cases cover a broad range  so it can be quite difficult to investigate   Ning said   New guidelines for companies on handling personal data were issued by regulators in May that included the hiring of compliance officers and getting explicit consent from consumers when collecting personal information  The European Union s new rules on privacy protection   the General Data Protection Regulation   took effect the same month  
The EU regulations   which will impact Chinese firms whose products or services are sold in the European Union   appears to be more restrictive than the Chinese ones  The Chinese guidelines allows for silent or implied consent  for example  whereas the European rules do not ",2018-08-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/data-dump-china-sees-surge-in-personal-information-up-for-sale-1584118,1584118
159513,381029,BIDU,Alibaba s Sales Surge as Jack Ma s Free Spending Bears Fruit,news," Bloomberg      Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd  reported its fastest pace of growth in more than four years by wringing more revenue from newer arenas such as cloud computing and entertainment  avoiding the disappointments that hit rival tech giants 
Billionaire Chairman Jack Ma s free spending ways helped the e commerce heavyweight side step a Chinese economic slowdown and best its rivals this earnings season  Arch foe Tencent Holdings Ltd  posted its biggest profit drop in a decade after it ran afoul of regulatory tangles  while internet stalwarts from  Facebook Inc   NASDAQ FB   to  Twitter Inc   NYSE TWTR   grappled with fundamental issues such as waning user growth 
Shares of Alibaba rose 3 4 percent to  183 89 at 9 39 a m  in New York as investors cheered the result  plus more than  3 billion in new funding for its newly acquired food delivery arm as it does battle with Meituan Dianping 
 A lot of growth is coming through acquisitions   Kim Eng Securities analyst Mitchell Kim said   With Alibaba investing in retail and having outside investors getting in  that could establish the valuation that investors need to account for  
Revenue at China s biggest e commerce company climbed 61 percent to 80 9 billion yuan   11 8 billion  in the three months ended June  matching the average estimate  Alibaba s mounting spending  such as on acquisitions and expanding its Hema supermarket chain  is hurting margins though  Adjusted earnings per share of 8 04 yuan fell short of the 8 19 yuan estimate 
Net income slid 41 percent to 8 7 billion yuan  though that s after taking into account an increase in the valuation of affiliate Ant Financial  which boosted the expense of shares awarded to employees  That topped the 7 6 billion yuan projected 
 We remain confident on the company s revenue growth given its diversified product offerings   Mae Huang  an analyst at SWS Research Co   said in a report   Despite the short term costs incurred by the company  we believe Alibaba is building a stronger ecosystem  
Alibaba s been busy expanding its Hema supermarket chain and now operates 35 of those stores    a mix of sit down dining and groceries plus delivery hub  Much cash also is flowing into China s  1 3 trillion food retail and services industry  where it s trying to hold its own against delivery giant and super app Meituan  Alibaba said Thursday it s teaming with SoftBank to put more than  3 billion into Ele me  Alibaba now intends to merge Ele me with Koubei  another unit focused on connecting restaurants to the internet 
Ma is also spearheading an expensive foray into the  4 trillion retail sector  Alibaba acquired a department store chain with 29 stores and 17 shopping malls last year and also bought a slice of China s largest hypermarket chain  It s been shelling out on content for its Youku video streaming service to stay abreast of Tencent and Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   And heavy investment in datacenters for its cloud computing arm helped almost double revenue in that division to 4 7 billion yuan 
However  those burgeoning businesses may be helping mask a slowdown in Alibaba s bread and butter business  said Steven Zhu  an analyst with Pacific Epoch 
Customer management revenue    the lucrative fees it charges for helping merchants with marketing    grew just 26 percent in the quarter  from 35 percent in the previous three months  That reflects how rivals such as JD com Inc  and Pinduoduo Inc  are siphoning off Alibaba s merchants and may affect the bottom line in coming quarters  Zhu said 
 This is probably the slowest growth ever   he said   They are swapping high quality revenue with low quality revenue

159567,381083,BIDU,JD com s finance affiliate raises  2 billion  more than doubles valuation,news,"By Kane Wu and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG  Reuters    JD com Inc s finance affiliate said on Thursday it has signed binding agreements with investors to raise 13 billion yuan   1 96 billion  in fresh equity at a valuation of nearly  20 billion 
The fundraising underscores investor enthusiasm for big  privately held Chinese technology companies even as public valuations falter  This week  smartphone maker Xiaomi completed the world s largest tech IPO in almost four years  but saw its shares fall on debut in Hong Kong even after pricing its deal at the low end of its offered range 
JD Finance will reach a valuation of 133 billion yuan   19 8 billion  after the closing of the fundraising  it said in a statement 
The valuation is more than double the roughly 60 billion yuan JD Finance was estimated to be worth after it was split from JD com  China s second largest e commerce firm  in mid 2017 
Investors in this round include CICC Capital  a unit of investment bank China International Capital Corp  CICC   brokerage China Securities  private equity firm Citic Capital and BOCGI  Bank of China s investment arm  JD Finance said 
The fundraising is expected to close in the third quarter  it said  Reuters first reported the fundraising details on Wednesday 
JD Finance s fundraising follows that of Ant Financial  ANTFIN UL   the affiliate of its arch rival  Alibaba   NYSE BABA   which last month was valued at  150 billion when it raised  14 billion in the world s largest ever single fundraising by a private company 
The investments suggest investors remain keen to put money into online payments and lending services in China  especially those backed by large companies such as Alibaba and JD com which already have stable user traffic  JD com itself is backed by U S  retail giant Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc and Chinese gaming behemoth Tencent 
Earlier this year another tech heavyweight  Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   raised  1 9 billion from a consortium led by U S  private equity firms TPG and  Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG  in the spin off of its finance unit 
JD Finance  whose financial offerings include consumer credit and wealth management products  is expected to seek a domestic initial public offering at some point although there is no firm time table for a listing  according to the sources 
JD Finance said on Wednesday it currently doesn t have an IPO plan 
The firm plans to use proceeds from the fundraising to invest in domestic financial institutions and buy securities and banking licenses  among other areas  sources with knowledge have previously told Reuters 
In mid 2017  JD com spun off the unit  making it a fully Chinese owned entity  a criterion needed to obtain licenses to manage certain financial products in China 
Under that deal  it sold 28 6 percent for 14 3 billion yuan   2 3 billion  to undisclosed investors  JD com receives 40 percent of the restructured entity s pre tax profit and has an option to convert that back to a 40 percent equity stake should the regulatory environment change

159582,381098,BIDU,BIDU Vs  SHOP  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Internet   Services sector have probably already heard of Baidu Inc   NASDAQ BIDU  and Shopify  SHOP   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Baidu Inc  has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Shopify has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that BIDU s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
BIDU currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 82  while SHOP has a forward P E of 522 44  We also note that BIDU has a PEG ratio of 7 53  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  SHOP currently has a PEG ratio of 22 07 
Another notable valuation metric for BIDU is its P B ratio of 1 47  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  SHOP has a P B of 16 85 
These metrics  and several others  help BIDU earn a Value grade of B  while SHOP has been given a Value grade of F 
BIDU sticks out from SHOP in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that BIDU is the better option right now ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bidu-vs-shop-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200474527,200474527

159585,381101,BIDU,All You Need To Know About Baidu Inc   BIDU  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"Investors might want to bet on Baidu Inc   NASDAQ BIDU   as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Baidu Inc  basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Baidu Inc  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Baidu Inc 
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this web search company is expected to earn  5 20 per share  which is a change of  46 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Baidu Inc  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 16 7  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Baidu Inc  to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/all-you-need-to-know-about-baidu-inc-bidu-rating-upgrade-to-buy-200475595,200475595
159601,381117,BIDU,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Softbank  Skechers And MasTec,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  September 10  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Softbank   OTC SFTBY    Skechers   NYSE SKX   and MasTec   NYSE MTZ   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Will Mario Draghi Disappoint Us  Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead  the center stage is set  For Thursday  A major act is about to play Will the European Central Bank  the ECB  meeting disappoint traders or not  We expect an aggressive easing package from the ECB   said Priya Misra  head of global rates strategy at TD Securities in New York   saying this to the Financial Times TD thinks the ECB will cut rates twice  by 0 1 percentage point this Thursday and again at Christine Lagarde s first meeting as president in December  while announcing  40 billion of new monthly bond purchases That should be enough to drive key European bond yields lower still  Ms  Misra expects Germany s 10 year yield to end the year at  0 8  compared with  0 61  currently A smaller package of purchases could disappoint bond investors In light of that  here are Reuters  five world market themes for the Global Week Ahead  These are kept in order of importance to equity markets  1  A big ECB meeting ends on Thursday   Draghi s last Bond markets have become accustomed to getting their own way  So on Thursday when the ECB holds one of its most anticipated meetings ever  they will be watching for Mario Draghi  in one of his final acts as ECB chief  to unleash more stimulus to boost the bloc s stubbornly weak economy and inflation On the table are interest rate cuts  a resumption of asset purchases  a pledge to keep rates low for longer and compensation for banks suffering from negative rates  Money markets are positioned for sizable rate cuts between now and end 2020 The risk is the package falls short   if markets see it as a damp squib rather than the necessary bazooka  Already yields have jumped off record lows after some ECB officials dampened expectations of an aggressive easing package and played down the need to resume bond buying But others argue that if the bank is serious about boosting inflation   below target since 2013   it needs to deliver more  not less  Failure to do so could trigger a huge bond tantrum  one that makes the recent selloff look like a blip  2  Haven t heard of the Prosus IPO in Amsterdam  It owns 30  of Tencent Some good news for investors starved of a high growth European internet stock   on Wednesday South African e commerce giant Naspers will float its newly created subsidiary  Prosus  in Amsterdam  an entity valued at over 100 billion euros Currently  no European listed company is able compete with the meteoric earnings growth of the U S  and Asian tech giants grouped under the FAANG and BAT  LON BATS  acronyms  But Prosus  main asset is a 30  stake in Tencent  one of China s biggest social media and gaming groups  Tencent is also the T in the BATs cohort  the other two are Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  and Alibaba  NYSE BABA    So Prosus could in theory emerge as a Europe based proxy for Tencent But could it also be the P in a yet to be created acronym for a European tech grouping  Prosus will be tiny compared with the FAANGs  which are worth a collective  2 8 trillion  But it would still be Europe s second largest tech firm after Germany s SAP  Its listing will offer a boost to the pan European tech stocks index  which is currently worth about 430 billion euros   475 billion   3  Watch the U K  Pound for a bottom  And watch the U K  for Brexit drama It s been a dreadful few days for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson  He has vowed to die in a ditch rather than delay Brexit but now a three month postponement looks increasingly likely  His attempt to get Brexit done by Oct  31 by suspending    or proroguing    parliament for a period has effectively been foiled by furious lawmakers and his brother Jo has quit the government over its approach towards policy On Monday  parliament returns in force to block Johnson s second bid to call a mid October general election Then there s the economy teetering on the edge of recession  The Bank of England sees a one in three chance the economy will be shrinking in year on year terms by early 2020  All other indicators  from car sales to business investment  have slumped to multi year lows So alongside Brexit developments  markets will be eyeing upcoming data   Q2 growth data are published on Monday  along with figures on industrial output  construction and trade  Tuesday brings employment figures  Any sign of a floor under sterling and the economy will be welcome news for Johnson  4  The People s Bank of China  PBoC  cuts its reserve ratio China has just slashed banks  reserve ratios  meaning lenders will need to keep less cash in hand  That frees up around 900 billion yuan to shore up the economy  The move was anticipated and now the question is  do authorities think more policy easing is needed  and when could more measures be deployed The upcoming data dump from Beijing could provide a clue  It will show how the trade war is hitting the world s No  2 economy and market expectations are not pretty  Export growth is seen slowing  imports falling and factory gate prices dropping for a second month running as manufacturers cut prices   and their own margins   to offset tariffs increases and faltering domestic demand  We also get an update on credit  which could recover after last month s contraction in new loans and social financing A truly dire set of data could see the central bank open the monetary policy sluice gates  possibly even before the U S  Fed gets in another rate cut Bulls see Beijing unleashing a ride to the rescue infrastructure boom  Bears only see battle lines hardening and an already here slowdown that shudders through the global economy for years  5  Fresh U S  retail sales data out this Friday Sept  1st saw U S  tariff increases kick in on  112 billion worth of Chinese goods imports  bringing the tax up to 15   Beijing has slapped on retaliatory levies  taking the trade war up another notch  News the two sides are to resume talks in October has soothed some fears but the tariffs will raise the prices Americans pay for some clothes  shoes  mobile phones and other consumer goods   just before the holiday shopping season  Given consumer spending is the U S  economy s main driver  that s a worry In the face of slowing exports and investment  shoppers remain a bright spot  U S  consumer retail sales increased 0 7  in July  surpassing the 0 3  pickup analysts had forecast  So the August figures  due Friday  will be of interest  Forecasts are for a 0 4  increase  But year over year growth is predicted at 3 2   slowing from 3 4  in July Ominously  U S  retailers have been warning investors not to expect too much when they post results in upcoming quarters  To date  33 companies have issued profit warnings for the third 2019 quarter  while only 15 have delivered positive messages Accordingly  analysts polled by Refinitiv have steadily lowered earnings estimates  For the S P 500  Q3 profits are forecast to decline by 2   before President Donald Trump s tariff escalation in early August  a 0 6  drop had been expected Top Zacks  1 Rank StocksSoftbank This is a  93B

Definition of a Value Trap
Value trap stocks look like value stocks with low P Es and other low fundamentals like P B and P S ratios  They may even have all the classic low valuations

3        YY   NASDAQ YY   is another cheap Chinese stock with a forward P E of 10 2 and a PEG ratio of 0 7  It has that rare feature of both growth and value  And while shares have rebounded in 2019  they are still down 36  over the last year  Is it on track to grow earnings this year 
4        Ctrip com   NASDAQ CTRP   has a price to book ratio of just 1 4  putting it in value territory but year to date the shares have soared 36   How is the travel industry holding up in China

The State Council unveiled the plans on Friday  less than a month after the idea was first made public    underscoring how keen authorities are to see foreign listed firms come home  A pilot of Chinese depositary receipts would apply to companies that went public overseas and have a market value of more than 200 billion yuan   32 billion   Firms can use corporate structures that aren t permitted on the mainland  and monies raised can be moved offshore  Some private companies will also find it easier to list shares 
While China has been a breeding ground for some of the world s fastest growing and highest valued tech businesses  companies such as e commerce giant Alibaba and search engine firm Baidu have headed offshore  leaving the local market reliant on state run industries  The CDR trial and easier listing rules may change that  analysts at China International Capital Corp  estimate that 35 foreign listed and private companies may qualify  with prospects that they ll raise as much as 1 5 trillion yuan in financing 
 There s a strong desire to see local champions  these technology companies  come back onshore    and CDRs is one way of doing this   said David Smith  Asia head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Standard Investments

Regulators first mooted the prospect of a CDR program at last month s meeting of China s rubber stamp national legislature  The State Council didn t say in the statement when the trial program would start 
The news could have global implications  While the likes of Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd  have headed to New York and Hong Kong  respectively  the prospect of at least a secondary listing in the world s second biggest equity market could significantly boost their valuations and set an example for other companies  And Hong Kong Exchanges   Clearing Ltd  stock suffered its worst month in more than a year in March  partly due to the increased threat from exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen 
Reconsidering Plans
 High tech and other innovative enterprises may  in light of the new CDR regime and ongoing competition between onshore and offshore equity exchanges  be reconsidering their IPO plans   said John Xu  a Shanghai based at the law firm Linklaters LLP  For example  a dual listing in China and an offshore market may now be realistic  he said 
That s partly because the plans released Friday signal a loosening of a ban in mainland equity markets on variable interest entity structures  which have been used by many of China s tech entrepreneurs to set up their companies  If VIE and dual class structures are used for CDRs  that information should feature prominently in company prospectuses  the State Council said  The securities regulators should consult with other agencies and handle IPO applications from VIEs  prudently  based on varying circumstances

With these changes  CDRs may be establishing new norms  said Aberdeen s Smith 
 If these VIE companies are available onshore  what does that mean for the structure   he said   While we won t know for sure  it would seem to be one step closer to normalization  and this is something investors are watching closely  
Expressed Interest
While no companies have said they will take part in the trial  the chiefs of several firms have previously expressed interest  Zhou Haibin  an analyst at Essence Securities  identified six foreign listed companies that meet the plan s thresholds  Alibaba  Baidu  JD com Inc   NetEase Inc     which are all in New York    and Hong Kong listed China Mobile Ltd  and China Telecom Corp  CICC analysts led by Hanfeng Wang named Xiaomi Corp  and Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial among unlisted firms that may qualify 
Private companies valued at more than 20 billion yuan and with revenue of 3 billion yuan or more in the past year will be eligible for the program  the State Council said  along with fast growing unlisted companies that work in the field of advanced technology and have a leading advantage in their sector

159658,381174,BIDU,China s Shiniest Tech Stars May Ignite a Feeding Frenzy at Home,news," Bloomberg     China s push to get its fastest growing companies to list shares at home could trigger a feeding frenzy from investors chasing the flashiest securities in a market dominated by old economy stalwarts 
Beijing is trying to stem an exodus to American markets    and that s good news for U S  investors as it may bring a valuation boost  From  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd  to Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU    the country s brightest tech stars have for years chosen to debut in New York despite once richer valuations at home  drawn to abundant capital and the prestige of a marquee international listing  But executives say Beijing is now pondering regulatory changes to catch the next wave of debutantes like Xiaomi Corp   while helping U S  listed companies create Chinese Depositary Receipts to tap trillions of dollars in domestic savings 
Officials haven t divulged specifics or even what a CDR would look like  But this week  the chief executives of Baidu  Netease Inc  and 58 com Inc  were among those who expressed interest  Xiaomi is now said to be considering a mainland listing as part of a much anticipated 2018 coming out party  The stock exchange in the southern city of Shenzhen is said to fast tracking tech IPOs in 2018  Regulators have even reached out to Alibaba and Hong Kong listed Tencent Holdings Ltd   Caixin reported  together worth almost  1 trillion 
However it shapes up  the process is likely to transform the country s stock markets by hiking tech sector representation  Companies that choose CDRs may enjoy higher valuations because of a paucity of celebrated names  and because the individuals that make up four fifths of trading will back brands they know 
Consider  artificial intelligence play iFlytek Co  trades at 156 times earnings    several times the U S  market average  When security business Qihoo 360 delisted from the U S  and re floated in Shanghai as 360 Security Technology Inc   its value leapt more than five times  Hong Kong traded PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd  changes hands at a two year earnings multiple of about 10 times  a third the valuation of Shenzhen listed rival Inspur Electronic Information Industry Co 
 The U S  ADRs are relatively the best companies in China and the domestic listed companies have much less quality  so you re going to see a higher valuation   said Blue Lotus Capital Advisor Ltd  founder Eric Wen   This is also a good way for Chinese citizens to enjoy the growth of these companies without converting their RMB into U S  dollars  which the government doesn t like

Regulators first need to untangle issues both legal and financial before going ahead with the idea  MCM Partners senior analyst Ryan Roberts said   The market in China is just not as mature as the U S    he said 
But Beijing wants to address what it views as a severe imbalance  at a time Xi Jinping is hawking the  China Dream   a concept that embodies the country s ascendancy and the privileges it confers upon citizens  The courtship coincides with an effort by Hong Kong to also rework regulations to enhance its attraction to the tech sector 
It s galling to the government that there re just nine tech companies worth more than  10 billion on local exchanges    versus 78 in the U S 
Chinese investors    for whom dabbling in stocks is akin to a national pastime    now have no easy way to share in the record breaking growth of the consumer internet because buying U S  securities is near impossible for them  Alibaba has surged 170 percent since its 2014 IPO  but most locals haven t gone along for the ride 
Tech companies of  10 billion value or more trade in Shanghai and Shenzhen at about 80 times historical earnings  about 50 percent higher than their U S  peers  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Apart from the mania that China s biggest names are likely to inspire  that too suggests tech corporations can command a premium 
 Think about it  900 plus million people who use WeChat on a daily basis have a limited exposure to Tencent  or the 400 plus million people who use Alibaba on a monthly basis don t have a way to buy it   said Brendan Ahern  chief investment officer for Krane Funds Advisors in New York   An advance in the local market will be supportive of the valuations in the U S

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from BIDU as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be May 16  2019  In that report  analysts expect BIDU to post earnings of  0 54 per share  This would mark a year over year decline of 79 23   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  3 61 billion  up 8 42  from the prior year quarter 
BIDU s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  7 61 per share and revenue of  17 75 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  21 06  and  15 83   respectively 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for BIDU  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability

159701,381217,BIDU,Tencent Borrow s Big In US Currency,opinion,"Tencent Taking Advantage of the Borrower s Market
Tencent   OTC TCEHY    the second largest public tech company in China  just debuted a  6 billion bond auction today  The auction consisted of bonds with maturities ranging from 5 30 years  The sale is Asia s largest bond auction in US dollar for over a year and Tencent s largest bond auction ever  The Fed s recent dovish verbiage has plummeted bond yields the past few months making this a prime opportunity to take advantage of  cheap  money in US currency  Tencent was able to achieve a 10 yr bond yield that was only 145 bps above the  risk free  10 yr US Treasury yield 
Tencent Overview
Tencent is best known for its communication application called WeChat  Weixin   which had over 1 billion monthly active users  MAU  at the end of 2018  making it the largest social community in China  WeChat saw MAU growth of 11  year over year  Tencent also owns QQ and Qzone  which are social networking applications each with over 500 million MAU  Total revenues for the business jumped 32  from last year 
One third of Tencent s revenue is driven by online games  with the primary growth driver being smartphone games  The largest dollar figure top line growth driver is their social networking sites apps which grew 30  this year  Online advertising revenue is also quickly growing at a 44  rate from last year  You can see below that Tencent s top line has more than quadrupled in the past 5 years 
 
Tencent Growth Potential 
China s freeze on current video games and a ban on new video games into the market took a hit on Tencent s profits this year  deteriorating margins  The Chinese government cited the video game criticism of its addictive attributes as well as inappropriate content as the reason for the new ruling  The freeze was finally lifted in December  and the Chinese government is slowly approving some of Tencent s most lucrative smartphone games  The approvals should expand both top line growth and margins for them in 2019 
It isn t clear what Tencent is going to do with this  6 billion surge in cash  but given its historical and projected growth rates  I would wager the return on this additional capital will be sizeable  Annual earnings for 2019 and 2020 are expected to be 24 79  and 29 45   These growth rates are unprecedented for any firm  especially one that has been around for over 20 years  Tencent is given a PE to growth valuation of 1 4  which is in line with the industry average  A US China trade deal could provide this stock with substantial gains  I would continue to keep an eye on this stock  with an annualized 2 year return of 28   TCEHY could offer some strong diversification in your portfolio adding to any international growth allocation   TCEHY Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
BATs and The Trade War
China s biggest tech companies make up the acronym BATs  Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    Alibaba   NYSE BABA    and Tencent   OTC TCEHY    The combined market caps of these three tech powerhouses is approximately  1 trillion  with Alibaba and Tencent making up 95  of that value  The ensuing trade war between the US and China hit these stocks hard pulling around  300 billion in value completely out of the market by the end of 2018  As you can see below these three stocks have recovered a bit since there downward trajectory last year but only Alibaba is showing positive 52 week growth 
 
Keep an eye on all these stocks as trade negotiations continue  Positive reformation to US s trade agreement with China will likely give these Chinese Tech stocks a sizable boost

The venture capital firm is already looking for investors to participate in its Fund VI  Tan said in an interview 
 It s not so soon  but  we are soft marketing right now  looking for anchor investors for our new fund   he told Reuters 
At  500 million  Fund VI will be one of the largest venture capital funds to be raised in Southeast Asia 
Singapore based venture capital firms  which benefit from government incentives  have enjoyed robust fundraising in 2017  Fundraising in the island city has attracted foreign investors ranging from family offices to corporate backers who want a finger in the technology investment space 
Vickers adopts a largely non thematic strategy globally but is keen to ride on the growth it sees in biotechnology  nanotechnology and AI  Tan said 
 In these three megatrends  if you follow them and invest in them  the growth will be exponential   he said 
The firm closed its fifth fund of  230 million in October  Of that  it has committed to about  130 million in deals and expects another  20 million worth to be closed soon 
 We still have some reserves for follow on investments  and we probably have space for perhaps another seven new deals   he said 
Biotechnology is the best performing sector in Vickers  portfolio  achieving a multiple of more than 10 times for the firm  Tan said  due largely to an investment five years ago in San Diego based regenerative medicine technology company Samumed LLC  a unicorn startup valued at  12 billion 
The current average valuation multiple across its first four funds is 5 8 times  with a net internal rate of return of 37 percent

159732,381248,BIDU,Consumer loan securitization boom put on hold as China clamps down on leverage,news,By Shu Zhang and Elias Glenn BEIJING  Reuters    A boom in asset backed securities issued by micro lenders aiming to expand in China s fast growing online credit market looks set to slow this year amid growing regulatory scrutiny  Micro lenders have raised billions of dollars packaging consumer loans into securities for sale to institutional investors on China s nascent market for asset backed securities in order to rapidly expand their loan books  Many of China s largest internet and technology companies have issued securities backed by micro loans  Ant Financial Services Group  an affiliate of  Alibaba  Group Holding  N BABA   dominates the market and the finance arms of JD com Inc  O JD   Baidu Inc  O BIDU   VIPShop Holdings  N VIPS  and Xiaomi Technology have also raised funds through the products   But the market for the securities is set to slow this year  industry sources say  as regulators target lenders  high debt levels and limited asset disclosure  Rules announced on Dec  1 limited the amount of lending backed by the products the companies can make  They were also required to consolidate them on their balance sheets  China s exchanges and the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors  NAFMII  have suspended the issuance of securities backed by consumer loans by Internet based micro lenders  said Guo Yonggang  general manager of the structured financing department at Golden Credit Rating International Co  NAFMII last week amended its disclosure requirements for consumer loan securities to reflect the central bank s higher transparency standards  The volume of securities backed by consumer loans has surged over 35 fold in the last two years  with the proceeds used to finance loans to individuals looking to buy the latest iPhone or finance overseas holidays  About 489 4 billion yuan   75 36 billion  of the securities were issued in 2017  compared with 98 9 billion yuan in 2016  according to China Securitisation Analytics  Repackaging the loans as asset backed securities has allowed lenders to transfer the loans off their balance sheets  bypassing government rules stipulating how much they can lend in proportion to their equity capital  LARGEST ISSUER Ant Financial is the largest issuer of consumer loan securities  accounting for 60 percent of all issues in 2017  according to Reuters calculations based on data from China Securitisation Analytics  Its two Chongqing based micro loan companies had total net capital of 10 6 billion yuan  but issued 265 1 billion yuan in loans by the end of June  according to CIB Research  a unit of Industrial Bank Co  SS 601166   Outstanding loan securities issued by the two units have exceeded 250 billion yuan  it said   The ratio of total financing to total capital is far beyond the 2 3 times leverage requirement set by the Chongqing banking regulator   CIB Research said in a December report  As Beijing issued its new rules  Ant Financial has quietly withdrawn plans to issue asset backed notes worth billions of dollars  two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters   Officials from the People s Bank of China have met with Ant Financial to discuss the high debt levels of its consumer finance business  said one of the sources  The source said the central bank may prevent Ant from issuing new consumer loan securities until it reduced its leverage level  Ant said the program s cancellation was due to  tight funding conditions and rising pricing on the bond market  at the end of 2017  The company plans to increase registered capital in two consumer loan units   Chongqing Mayi Micro Loans Co and Chongqing Mayi Shangcheng Small Loans Co   to 12 billion yuan  from 3 8 billion yuan at present  the company said in an email  The central bank did not respond to a faxed request for comment  SHORT HISTORY  WEAK DISCLOSURE The short history of micro loan companies and China s asset backed securities market raises significant challenges for ratings agencies and investors trying to gauge risk   The hypotheses or parameter estimations we use for data analysis could differ from the actual situation to some degree   said Zheng Kaiwen  senior analyst at China Chengxin Securities Rating Co  pointing to loan companies  short business histories  There has yet to be a default from a consumer loan securitization product  according to China Chengxin   But the likelihood of default may be  underestimated   said Guo of Golden Credit Rating  citing incomplete credit ratings data and the rapid expansion of consumer loans   Before the government cleanup  small and mid tier Chinese banks  as well as private funds with high risk tolerance  were among the most active buyers of micro loan securities  loan companies said  In March  Bank of Jiangsu Co  SS 600919  and Debang Securities launched a 20 billion yuan investment fund focused on loan backed securities  the first of its kind in China  Despite government efforts to control consumer loan backed securities  reining them in will be difficult as many transactions take place  off market   company sources said   Those private sales take place on local financial exchanges and equity trading centers  as well as internet based financial trading platforms powered by Chinese tech giants  making them difficult for the government to track  Several ratings agencies and loan companies said they were unable to accurately estimate the total of such private transactions due to limited information disclosure  Some loan companies choosing private sales have weak operating quality  aggressive strategies and incomplete risk control systems  said Guo at Golden Credit Rating   Due to the weak information disclosure of off market product issues  borrowers could have taken out loans from multiple platforms  or these loans could just be non compliant campus loans or housing down payment loans   he said ,2018-01-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/consumer-loan-securitization-boom-put-on-hold-as-china-clamps-down-on-leverage-1065720,1065720
159733,381249,BIDU,Tencent Music Prices IPO At Low End Of Range Amid Uncertain Market,opinion,"Tencent Music  the music streaming arm of Chinese tech behemoth Tencent Holdings   OTC TCEHY    will price its U S  initial public offering at  13 per share  the low end of its range   cited by The Wall Street Journal 
The Tencent spin off will likely raise around  1 1 billion  making it one of the largest U S  IPOs by a Chinese company this year  Video streaming site iQiyi   NASDAQ IQ   raised  2 4 billion on its debut  while online retailer Pinduoduo   NASDAQ PDD   generated about  1 6 billion from its offering 
The sheer magnitude of Tencent Music s IPO will likely garner attention from investors  but the muted listing reflects uncertainty in the music streaming industry as well as for Chinese tech stocks and the company itself 
The music streaming giant draws plenty of comparisons to Spotify  SPOT   the world s largest music streaming platform by way of paid members  Spotify shares have lost roughly 9  since debuting on the New York Stock Exchange in an unusual direct listing this April  underscoring concerns about profitability and royalty fees in the business 
Nevertheless  Tencent Music  unlike its Swedish competitor  is profitable  The Chinese company is not only able to cash in on its streaming apps QQ Music  Kugou  and Kuwo but also its popular karaoke app  WeSing  which generates commission revenue through the exchange of digital gifts 
Still  Tencent Music is preparing to IPO at the same time that it is facing legal questions from one of its early investors  Hanwei Guo  The respected Chinese investor is accusing Tencent Music of misinformation and intimidation in an effort to force a sale of his stake in the company 
Meanwhile  nearly all of China s top tech stocks have been battered by trade war fears and concerns about an economic slowdown in the country 
Shares of Tencent Music s parent company have dropped more than 22  over the past year  E commerce behemoth Alibaba   NYSE BABA    which owns competitor AliMusic  has shed 13  in that time  while search leader Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU   is down about 23  
Tencent Music s profitability and strategic advantages might explain why it is forging on with its plans to hold an IPO despite these uncertainties  but one can only speculate that its low end pricing will soften some of the hype around the soon to be stock

159755,381271,BIDU,Alibaba Earnings Preview  Will China Concerns Weigh On Tomorrow s Results ,opinion,"China s largest tech company  Alibaba  NYSE BABA   is slated to report fiscal second quarter earnings before market open on Friday  Nov  2 
This ll be BABA s first report since chairman and CEO Jack Ma announced in September that he would be stepping down from his roles in 2019  although he indicated that he still plans to stay involved in the company past then 
As the company s leadership shuffles  analysts have increasingly expressed concerns about the potential for economic slowdown in China thanks to ongoing trade battles and signs of softening consumer spending  particularly in the luxury segment  When it reported this week  Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   another one of the tech giants in China  cautioned that its future revenue growth could be negatively impacted by diminishing confidence in the economy there 
Whether or not that has been impacting BABA seems to be a question that s top of mind for many analysts and investors  When BABA reports tomorrow  adjusted EPS is expected to come in at  1 06  down from  1 23 in the prior year period  on revenue of  12 4 billion according to third party consensus analyst estimates  Revenue is projected to increase 56 2  from last year s  7 94 billion 
The expected decline in earnings has apparently resulted from BABA s aggressive investments across industries  something management has previously said will continue in the foreseeable future  Some of its investments acquisitions in 2018 have been in logistics companies ZTO Express  NYSE ZTO  and Huitongda  bike sharing startup Ofo and food delivery company Ele me  to name a few 
Another likely cause is a move the company made earlier this year with Ant Financial  the company s payments affiliate that operates Alipay  BABA traded a 37 5  profit share agreement it had with Ant for a 33  equity stake in the company  which put Ant s share based compensation expenses and bottom line results on BABA s books 
Core Commerce
In fiscal Q1  BABA reported that Core Commerce revenue increased 61  year over year to  10 46 billion  accounting for a significant portion of the company s  12 23 billion in total revenue 
When BABA last reported  mobile monthly active users hit 634 million in June 2018  up by 17 million users from the quarter before  Annual active consumers on its China retail marketplaces climbed to 576 million  an increase of 24 million over the 12 month period ending in March 
The company s annual shopping event  Singles  Day  is also coming up on Nov  11  so analysts might be looking for more information about how management thinks everything will go given the current macro backdrop 
Cloud Computing
Outside of Core Commerce  BABA s Cloud Computing segment is another primary focus among analysts  When it last reported  Cloud Computing revenue increased 93  year over year to  710 million management attributed the growth to both an increase in paying customers and value added services 
This division has been operating at a loss and BABA has invested heavily in expanding the number of data centers it operates to be able to reach new customers  Most recently  BABA announced it would open two new data centers in the U K 

A Tough 2018  While tech stocks have been hard hit in recent selloffs  Chinese tech has had a rougher go  BABA has shed about  67 from the all time high of  211 70 it hit at the start of June  Some perspective is in order though  as shares are still up substantially over the past several years

159758,381274,BIDU,Opportunities For Both Bulls And Bears In Baozun Inc And Baidu Inc ,opinion,"Two well known Chinese stocks traded in Nasdaq are Baozun Inc  NASDAQ BZUN  and Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   Both shares have enjoyed tremendous upside performance  Baidu has been trading in Nasdaq for more than 9 years while Baozun Inc  is trading for the last 2   years  The multiyear bullish trend in stocks has been very good for shareholders of both of these companies  However since the start of the year the risk off sentiment across equity markets and specifically Chinese stocks has hurt both of these two stocks  Shareholders have lost between 30  and 50  if they did not liquidate their positions 
Using technical analysis and tools like the Ichimoku clouds  we now take a look at each stock separately  Has the long term bullish trend ended  Has a big correction started this year  What are the price levels bulls need to hold and what are the resistance levels that bears do not want to see broken 
Baozun Inc  share price traded in Nasdaq has been in a bullish trend for more than 2 years and price has risen more than 1500   Price has recently made a pull back from approximately 67  to 35   a correction of nearly 50   Technically price remains inside the bullish channel from 2016  On a weekly basis price has pulled back towards the Kumo  cloud  support and bounced  This was a bullish sign  If bulls manage and break out and above the short term magenta downward sloping channel  then we should be more optimistic for the next few months  Breaking above 46 47  and holding above the weekly Kumo  cloud   will be a sign that would imply the uptrend is intact  and the share price could soon see new all time highs  However we should also keep an eye for the bearish scenario  In case we see the long term channel being broken and price fall below 35   we should expect more downside to come 

 Concluding  The share price of Baozun Inc has made a considerable correction over the last few months and the decline has stopped and reacted positively once support was reached  There are high chances of a new uptrend starting for the share price of Baozun Inc 
The share price of Baidu Inc  traded in Nasdaq has been running in a bullish trend for more than 10 years resulting in more than 6000  gains  However since past June the share price of BAIDU Inc  has been sold off and lost more than 30  of its value relative to the recent highs  In Ichimoku cloud terms price is still above the monthly cloud support at 177 167   On a weekly basis  price is below the cloud and resistance is at 226 230   Baidu Inc  share price is in danger of a major correction as price has broken down and out of the long term wedge pattern  Breaking below 167 160  on a monthly closing basis will increase the chances of a move much lower  Maybe towards the 85 100  price area and previous support  green rectangles   If on the other hand price manages to stay above 177 167  support and we see a weekly close above 230   we can assume that the uptrend is not finished and we should expect new all time highs 
 Concluding  having closed last week just below 200  and taking into consideration the major long term support and the prevailing long term trend  any move above 206 207  would be considered a short term bullish sign supporting the longer term bullish trend  Inability from bulls to retake the 210 230  area over the coming weeks  would be a bearish sign 
Both stocks have been recently trading in a discounted price relative to the recent highs of early 2018  The recent correction could be an opportunity to open positions in these stocks with lower prices  Taking into account the important support levels that should not be broken and the resistance levels that will need to be broken in order to strengthen the bullish scenarios  one can create a strategy and with the correct risk and money management take advantage of this opportunity  The rise in volatility in risky assets gives us the chance to trade the price fluctuations and the deep pull backs in a lasting bullish trend are a gift for long term investors  All this assuming that you remain optimistic about risky assets like stocks 
Even if you are a pessimist when it comes to markets  the increase in volatility brings also opportunities for short sellers  A 9 year bull trend cannot be followed by only a 6 month risk off period  So if you believe a multiyear correction is due  the important trading levels bulls need to break can also be taken advantage by bears as selling levels with stops close by

159777,381293,BIDU,7 China Based Company Stocks For High Growth At A Reasonable Price ,opinion,"Introduction
China has rapidly become the second largest economy in the world   second only to the United States  and by some calculations the largest  As a result  China also has some of the fastest growing publicly traded companies on the planet  Moreover  tariff negotiations between the United States and China have recently become a political football that has resulted in a softening of prices on several prominent China domiciled American depository receipts  ADRs   With this article  I will be covering 7 prominent China based ADRs listed on either the New York Stock Exchange or the NasdaqGS Exchange  Autohome  NYSE ATHM   Alibaba  NYSE BABA   Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   JD com  NASDAQ JD   Weibo  NASDAQ WB  58 com  NYSE WUBA  and Yirendai  NYSE YRD  
Some of these companies have experienced significant stock price corrections so far this calendar year  and others have corrected more modestly  However  in recent days most of these companies have become rather hot commodities  Therefore  the question I m going to attempt to answer is whether these stocks have become attractive after the dip  but unattractive after the recent rallies  Nevertheless  my true motivation behind producing this article is to also offer an important lesson on value investing that is often overlooked by many investors when dealing with volatile stock prices 
The Geometry of Winning and Losing
There is a geometric phenomenon that occurs during volatile stock price action  Instead of thinking in arithmetic terms  investors are best served by understanding the geometry of stock price action  A few simple examples will illustrate the important lesson that I am attempting to highlight  If you invested  1 and your investment fell by 25  you would now have an investment worth  0 75  At this point it s important to note that this  0 75 now represents the money that you have available for investment  More importantly  you must also recognize that your future returns must be calculated on that  0 75 and not your original investment of  1 
As a result  for you to recover your loss and grow your  0 75 back to  1  you must earn a return of 33   This geometric phenomenon becomes more dramatic the greater your percentage loss  To simplify for clarity  if you invested  1 and lost 50  of your investment  you would now only have  0 50 available to invest  To grow that  0 50 back to  1  you would have to earn 100  return on your  0 50  This geometric exposure to loss explains why Warren Buffett has been quoted as stating that the number 1 rule in investing is  never lose money   Or as my own personal mentor often preached    to win you must not lose  
In my previous article titled  Are Fang Investors Playing the Role of Greater Fool s     I addressed the power of compounding by presenting and discussing the Rule of 72  Compounding future growth is also a geometric concept  and the 7 China based stocks I am covering in this video are expected to grow at very high rates  However  the power of compounding also works in reverse as I illustrated above  The point is simple and straightforward  at the end of the day investing is all about understanding and correctly dealing with the dynamics of the numbers  In other words  it s equally as important to understand the geometric phenomenon of loss as it is to understand the power of compounding at high rates of growth 
As this discussion relates to the 7 China based stocks I am covering in this article  my point is that although they have been moving rather briskly to the upside recently  it has not changed the longer term return opportunity I believe they offer  However  it is also important to understand that these high rate of return opportunities also come with higher risk  When analyzing and or considering investing in growth stocks  the investor must also be cognizant of how difficult it is for companies to grow at the high rate you re going to see with these 7 China based companies  As previously stated  and as I will point out in the following analyze out loud video  these 7 companies trade at higher multiples of earnings  cash flows and other metrics than average growing companies do  But most importantly  to support those high valuations  they must continue to deliver high rates of growth 
Portfolio Review  7 China based ADRs 
I have placed the 7 China based companies I am covering in this article into a portfolio which I ve customized to include the following  the ticker  name  country  P E ratio  estimated earnings growth  long term trend line earnings growth  price to cash flow  estimated cash flow growth  long term trend line cash flow growth  market cap and debt to capital 
The areas I suggest the reader focus on are the current valuations based on blended P E ratios or price to cash flow  P CF  in relation to estimated growth rates of earnings per share  EPS  and or estimated growth rates of cash flow  CF   As you evaluate these valuations and growth rates  try to keep the power of compounding  the Rule of 72  in the back of your mind to obtain a clear perspective of potential future returns these companies offer

The following video will clearly illustrate the attractive valuations and long term growth potential that each of these China based companies currently offer  Moreover  I do think it s important to recognize that since they are all ADRs  investors can have confidence that their financial results are consistent with US accounting standards and rules

Summary and Conclusions
Investing in high growth stocks is not for everyone  and certainly not for the faint of heart  In my opinion the biggest risk associated with investing in growth stocks is the likelihood that their growth will eventually slow down  If and or when this happens  valuations will undoubtedly reset as well  Although it s virtually impossible to forecast the precise moment that happens  the inevitability of this occurrence should not be overlooked  Nevertheless  if you re looking for the opportunity to make high rates of return and willing to take on the associated risk  these 7 China based companies might be worthy of the time and effort of conducting a more comprehensive research and due diligence process

159798,381314,BIDU,Leaving nothing to chance  China increases security  social control before Congress,news,"By Christian Shepherd and Ben Blanchard
BEIJING  Reuters    China is tightening security for next month s twice a decade Communist Party Congress  cancelling police leave in Beijing  limiting tourism to Tibet  and clamping down on the spread of political rumors 
High level meetings in China are typically accompanied by a security crackdown   as well as uncharacteristically smog free blue skies   with the stability obsessed party not wanting to run the risk that anyone or anything offers a distraction 
Thousands of policemen from other provinces have been sent to the Chinese capital to reinforce  a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters  A second source  with ties to the country s security forces and citing conversations with senior police officers  said all police leave in Beijing had been canceled starting from early September 
Beijing Communist Party chief Cai Qi on Wednesday asked the city for  120 percent  effort to ensure safety for the congress  the official Beijing Daily said 
 We must hold the line for social control  eliminate all destabilizing factors  hold the line for cyber security and resolutely crack down on political rumors and harmful news   Cai said 
MARKET SHUT
Beijing s largest market for metal building materials will be shuttered from Friday and is being relocated to Hebei province taking with it more than 10 000 industry workers and stall owners  according to the Beijing Daily 
The market s unceasing growth had created a  messy environment  where migrants congregate  the paper said  without mentioning the crucial party gathering 
Many of the tightened security measures target migrants  with ID checks at metro stations and patrols outside government ministries to ensure any petitioners from out of town are rounded up immediately should they attempt to make a scene 
Some 2 000 delegates will converge on Beijing for the Congress  staying at hotels across the city  and security will only get tighter as its opening nears  meaning any protests will be quickly shut down 
China s ongoing clampdown on cyberspace has seen WhatsApp  the messaging service run by Facebook  NASDAQ FB   periodically unavailable in the past few weeks  while certain gifs using images of President Xi Jinping cannot be posted to group chats on messenger app WeChat 
China s Internet regulator  in a statement to Reuters  said the government had the legal right to prevent the spread of  violent  terrorist and other illegal information  
 As a well known global app  WhatsApp should really proactively take steps to block the dissemination and spread of illegal information   it said  without elaborating or making a specific mention of WeChat 
New limits have been placed on discussion in private group chats  Rules released at the beginning of September make companies and group owners accountable for breaches of content rules 
China s cyber watchdog on Monday also imposed the largest possible fines of 100 000 yuan   15 110  on tech giants Tencent Holdings Ltd  Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  and Weibo Corp for failing to censor online content 
MOVIE RELEASE DELAYED
The measures are far from restricted to just keeping Beijing secure  Measures have also been introduced in strategically sensitive places in other parts of China 
Security has been heightened at ports along the Yangtze River  with the Maritime Safety Administration saying last week that it was considering curbs on loading and unloading hazardous or flammable chemicals from Oct 11 to Oct 28 
Travel for foreign tourists to Tibet is also being restricted  some travel agents said  Tibet is always sensitive for Beijing given the opposition to Chinese rule that exists within the Tibetan community  and even in normal times foreigners need permission to go there 
An official at China International Travel Service Ltd said the government had told it that no foreigners were allowed to visit Tibet from Oct  18 28 because of the Congress  Three other travel agencies confirmed a ban would be lifted in late October 
Organizers of a discussion on politics in the Middle East canceled the event in Beijing because they were worried about potential pressure from the authorities  a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters   The word  democracy  was only used once in the adverts  not in a sensitive way  but still they thought it was best to cancel   the source said  declining to be named 
Feng Xiaogang  a famous Chinese film director known for work that brushes against sensitive issues and the limits of censorship  announced last week that the Sept 30 release of  Youth   his latest film  had to be delayed  Feng gave no explanation 
However  a source with ties to the censors told Reuters that the authorities had considered it risky to screen the film before the congress  as it is partially set during China s 1979 war with Vietnam   a touchy subject  The fear was that it could spark debate about the morality and necessity of the conflict 
POLLUTION CRACKDOWN
In and around Beijing  efforts have also been ramped up to ensure the skies remain blue over the Congress and not polluted by the city s notorious smog  The city of Handan  near Beijing  has ordered steel mills to halve output a month earlier than the usual mid November cutbacks aimed at curbing air pollution  according to media reports 
Rounds of inspections by the authorities to check up on health and safety or environmental requirements have left small businesses closed for days  weeks or months  owners and employees say 
Factories on the outskirts of Beijing  even those that make luxury goods  have been closed for days while inspections are carried out  according to one employee who declined to be named 
Some low end  fast food type restaurants in Beijing have also been ordered to close  ostensibly to prevent fire risks and to limit pollution  residents say 

 There s so many inspections at the moment   said a pancake seller who gave her family name as Liu   What am I supposed to do if they make me shut  ",2017-09-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/leaving-nothing-to-chance-china-increases-security-social-control-before-congress-533965,533965

References to President Xi Jinping are scrutinized  As are funny nicknames for state leaders  And any mention of the Tiananmen protests in 1989 is immediately excised  as is sexual innuendo and violent content 
Welcome to China s new world of online censorship  where Orwell s  Nineteen Eighty Four  meets Silicon Valley start up

Workers scan into bright offices using iPads  There are team building sessions typical of start ups the world over  And the dress code is casual 
 Our corporate culture is really good  every afternoon  for example  we get together for tea   said one censor at the Toutiao office  A  horizontal  management structure means  ordinary employees can send messages about their issues straight to the CEO

Toutiao s Tianjin  auditing  center is at the heart of a vast Chinese censorship effort that is growing fast as official scrutiny of online content intensifies 
According to figures released by the state media outlet Beijing News  China had roughly 2 million online content monitors in government departments and private companies in 2013  Academics estimate that number has since risen sharply 
The government has been tightening control over videos  chat platforms and social media ahead of a Communist Party congress in October at which Xi is expected to bolster his leadership 
Under Xi  the government has stepped up efforts to control discourse online as a growing array of web platforms give people new channels for self expression 
 They control a lot already but are really cleaning up for the Party congress   said Lokman Tsui  a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong  He said the clampdown would last well beyond the congress and was having a widespread  chilling effect  
Companies like Toutiao are responding  hiring armies of workers to police videos  blogs and news articles available to its 120 million users across China 
 We had about 30 40 employees two years ago  now we have nearly a thousand reviewing and auditing   said the Toutiao censor  who  like other censors Reuters spoke to  asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic 
A guard and receptionist at the building said the Tianjin office had expanded rapidly 
 Everyone here is doing auditing work   the receptionist said   One year ago there was one floor  now we have ten  
Toutiao  which Reuters reported last month was raising at least  2 billion   1 49 billion  in a new funding round that would value it at around  20 billion  said it had been expanding its teams rapidly  including in content  auditing  
 We have invested in developing sophisticated AI analytical tools and stringent content management processes to weed out low quality and fake content   the company said in a statement  referring to artificial intelligence  The company declined to say how many censors it employed 
LOVE NEWS  POLITICALLY SAVVY 
Reuters spoke to four Toutiao censors and four other staff  who described the company s censorship work  which they said spiked during periods of activity by the country s political leaders 
The censors rotate between day and night shifts  the peak time for censoring content is from 6pm to 9pm  Workers review videos  users  posts and news  rooting out political criticism 
They also target topics ranging from violence and drug addiction to extramarital affairs and religious cults  all of which were blacklisted in lengthy guidelines issued in June 
 You can t have anything that is too vulgar  too violent  too bloody  or anything that makes people feel disgusted   said a second Toutiao censor based in Beijing  where the company has its headquarters   There s no set rules  more it s the discretionary judgment of those on duty  
Some topics are particularly sensitive   anything to do with President Xi is automatically flagged by computers  Others are
totally off limits  The  6 4 tank event    a reference to the date of the crackdown on student protests in Tiananmen Square  NYSE SQ    and  various nicknames for state leaders  are automatically blocked  the censors said 
Most of the censors said they were doing a public service 
 There is a lot of evil and pollution on the internet that people don t see  and we are helping protect people  a third Toutiao censor said in Tianjin 
But the efforts of the censors are often met with intense vitriol online by those whose posts are removed and others who decry the growing censorship in China 
 Looking for my friends  posts  I find they ve all been erased   one Weibo user posted under the handle  Jue Nian    I m afraid in a few years that history will have been rewritten so many times there ll be no space for opposing points of view  
PARTY TIES
Beijing has tightened rules this year for Internet companies to self censor content on their platforms  and has fined web giants like Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   Baidu Inc  O BIDU  and  Weibo Corp   O WB  for not doing enough to clean up content 
In house censors work separately from government censors  who operate within state media and local propaganda units and liaise with private companies 
Weibo and Tencent  which operates the popular chat platform WeChat  did not respond to requests for comment 
Baidu declined to comment  but pointed to a statement from August saying it was committed to dealing with malicious information on its platforms 
Zhang Lijun  chairman of the online news and video portal V1 Group  said between 20 30 percent of his company s labor costs went on content auditors   a necessary business expenditure 
 Without doubt you need to maintain close ties with the ruling Party   Zhang said   Party building  setting up Party units properly  these can ensure your news goes out smoothly and keeps your business operations safe  
ARTIFICIAL AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
The Beijing based censor said Toutiao used artificial intelligence systems to censor content  though these don t always understand the tone of posts 
 We are training the AI  They are not as smart  Hopefully they will learn to handle all this eventually  
For now  though  real humans are still in demand 
An advertisement Toutiao posted on Tianjin Foreign Studies University s career page for students this month sought 100 fresh graduates to work in  content audit   earning between 4 000 6 000 yuan   447  670  per month 
Successful candidates need to  love news and current affairs  but also be  politically savvy  and  understand the laws and regulations governing Internet supervision  
One advertisement  for a  forum auditor  posted on the recruitment site Lagou com in September  said the person would be responsible for working with direction from China s powerful Internet regulator  the Cyberspace Administration of China 
The CAC did not respondent to requests for comment 
Most postings are for young graduates  generally seen as more receptive to the job s demands 

 People who have just graduated from college are clean like a white piece of paper  and will accept our corporate culture more easily   said one Tianjin censor ",2017-09-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/tea-and-tiananmen--inside-chinas-new-censorship-machine-534492,534492

159825,381341,BIDU,Venture fundraising in yuan soars as investors target Chinese tech firms,news,"By Elzio Barreto HONG KONG  Reuters    China focused venture capital funds are increasing their bets on local technology companies and a further opening of Chinese domestic capital markets  raising money in the yuan at the fastest pace in five years   Fund managers have raised 95 8 billion yuan   14 54 billion  this year through late September in funds denominated in the Chinese currency  which is also known as the renminbi  compared with 56 7 billion yuan in all of 2016  That puts 2017 on pace to be the biggest year since 2012  when 145 8 billion yuan was raised  according to data provider Preqin   There are currently 78 funds looking to raise as much as another 1 15 trillion yuan over the next couple of years  Preqin said  most of it coming from mammoth sized state owned entities and so called government guidance funds  which seek to foster domestic innovation in different industries from advanced engineering and robotics to biotechnology and clean energy      Those include the 350 billion yuan sought by the China Structural Reform Fund  200 billion yuan targeted by the China State Owned Capital Venture Investment Fund and a proposed 150 billion yuan for the state owned Enterprise National Innovation Fund  The enormous size of the fundraising ambitions of the Chinese state backed funds means it may take some time before they reach their final goals  The China Structural Reform Fund  which was launched in 2016  has raised 20 percent of its registered capital and its president said in an interview with Caixin Global that funding will be completed by the end of 2018    We re at the all time highest of capital raising high water marks  with a tsunami of government backed entities seeding incubators  VC funds  locally  provincially  nationally   said Peter Fuhrman  CEO of China focused investment bank China First Capital   China has a lot of money in its government apparatus  It wants to seed innovation and entrepreneurship and this is how it s doing it   The surge contrasts with the slowdown in seed financing for start ups in the United States  which is down for the past two years  It also compares with flat growth expected for U S  venture capital fundraising in 2017  according to estimates from the National Venture Capital Association  NVCA   CATCHING ENTREPRENEURS Firms such as Lightspeed China Partners  Morningside Venture Capital  GGV Capital and investment and merchant bank Ion Pacific that previously only had U S  dollar funds are launching their first funds in yuan  Others like Hillhouse Capital  Sequoia Capital China and China Renaissance that have raised funds in both currencies are adding to their yuan cash pile with new funds  Key to those firms is to not lose potential investment opportunities in sectors closed to foreign investors or miss out on investing with the Chinese entrepreneurs who now want to list their companies locally instead of in the United States   Catching the right entrepreneurs in the ecosystem is our number one priority  so currencies to us are just tools  those are the tools that I need to catch these entrepreneurs   said Harry Man  partner at Matrix Partners China  which has funds in both currencies   That s why if you don t have RMB in your hand  ultimately you ll be missing 50 percent of the deals  Then you ll be forced to raise an RMB fund and that s why everybody is doing it   Sequoia Capital China  which backed top Chinese technology firms such as  Alibaba  Group  N BABA   is looking to raise at least 10 billion yuan for a new fund  while Hillhouse Capital  an early investor in companies including Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   Baidu Inc  O BIDU  and JD com Inc  O JD   is targeting about 8 billion yuan for its fund  sources told Reuters    The investment management arm of securities firm China Renaissance is also adding to its yuan reserves with a new fund worth about 6 billion yuan  according to a person familiar with the plans who couldn t be named because details of the fundraising aren t yet public  Ion Pacific is raising 1 billion yuan for its debut fund in the Chinese currency  while GGV Capital is about to close fundraising for its first yuan denominated fund   Some sectors don t allow foreign investors  so for example  in the culture and media industry you need to apply for certain licenses like video licenses and you need to be a local investor   said Helen Wong  a partner at Qiming Venture Partners   Now the IPO window is open for the local stock market  so that encourages a lot of companies to go for a local listing   she added  in reference to the increase in IPO approvals by regulators in 2017 that is prompting more companies to start preparations to go public  Previously  a slow approval process and long line of companies waiting for clearance dissuaded many from those plans  The shift would give an added boost to the Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses  China has had 322 new listings this year  raising a combined  22 9 billion  Thomson Reuters data showed  This already surpasses the 252 for all of 2016  even after the country s securities regulator slowed the number of weekly IPO approvals in May   It could also reduce the influence of the Nasdaq and New York stock exchanges  where many Chinese technology companies previously flocked when they went public  
 For the RMB side  you see more companies in restricted sectors like healthcare and media and certain parts of cleantech that needs government support to get started   said Hans Tung  managing partner at GGV Capital   You also see companies in the fintech space and a lot of them need a license to operate a business in the financial services industry  so they tend to want to list in China  ",2017-09-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/venture-fundraising-in-yuan-soars-as-investors-target-chinese-tech-firms-531697,531697

159832,381348,BIDU,3 Top Tech Stocks That Just Crushed Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Stocks moved slightly lower on Monday as traders grow increasingly cautious about range bound indexes and fresh volatility in the healthcare and oil sectors  but overall  investors have remained optimistic in recent trading periods thanks to better than expected earnings results and strong guidance 
Heading into the week  total Q1 earnings for the 154 members of the S P 500 that had already reported were up 25 4  from the year ago period on 10 3  higher revenues  About 80  of these companies surpassed EPS estimates  and 72 1  managed to top sales estimates 
Among these reporting companies  many have been some of the world s top technology firms  underscoring the sector s ability to maintain the strength it has presented over the past few years  Overall  earnings growth expected to surpass 20  in the technology sector 
But which technology bellwethers have led the charge so far this report season  Make sure to take a look at these three companies that recently crushed estimates 
1  Amazon com  Inc     NASDAQ AMZN   
E commerce behemoth Amazon helped round out another strong quarter for the FANG stocks last Thursday  The company reported adjusted earnings of  3 27 per share  crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22 per share  Meanwhile  total revenue was up 43  year over year and forecasted Q2 revenue was on the high end of our prior consensus estimate 
Amazon also notched net sales of  5 44 billion in its Web Services unit  marking growth of 49  from the prior year period and coming in ahead of our consensus estimate  Further  the company reported first quarter physical stores sales of  4 26 billion  underscoring the scope of the Whole Foods acquisition 
Amazon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
 
2  Western Digital Corp     NASDAQ WDC   
Memory solutions giant Western Digital also reported its latest quarterly results last week  The company notched adjusted earnings of  3 63 per share  comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 31 per share  WDC also posted revenue of about  5 billion  edging out our consensus estimate of  4 94 billion and improving 7 5  year over year 
Western Digital s strong results helped relieve some tension in the memory space  with many investors assuming cyclical trends had likely run their course and predicating a pullback soon  Still  the stock has struggled to generate much momentum since its report  indicating that volatility is still lingering 
Nevertheless  an improving earnings outlook has earned the stock a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
 
3  Baidu Inc     NASDAQ BIDU   
Chinese internet powerhouse also cruised past earnings estimates recently  reporting adjusted earnings per share of  2 60 that comfortably outpaced our consensus estimate of  1 73  The company saw revenue figures of  3 33 billion  also topping our consensus estimate of  3 26 billion  Total revenue was up 31  from the prior year quarter

On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Q2 Holdings has a Value Score of F  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 316 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 713 9X versus its peer group s average of 24 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 15 81  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective Q2 Holdings  Inc  Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Q2 Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Q2 Holdings meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though QTWO shares could still be poised for more gains ahead 
How Does Q2 Holdings Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Q2 Holdings have been moving higher  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks  including Cognizant Technology Solutions   NASDAQ CTSH    CACI International   NYSE CACI    and Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
However  it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking  so it isn t all good news for Q2 Holdings  Still  the fundamentals for QTWO are promising  and it still has potential despite being at a 52 week high ",2018-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/q2-holdings-qtwo-hits-fresh-highs-is-there-still-room-to-run-200312332,200312332
159835,381351,BIDU,Facebook Roundup  F8  Earnings  WhatsApp Co Founder Leaves,opinion,"It s hard to beat Facebook   NASDAQ FB   at what it does well  i e  capturing users  imagination in an innovative way and making them see ads in the process  That s what they proved from their stellar quarterly results and F8 developers  conference  Here are some highlights 
F8 Developers Conference
Facebook had some BIG announcements at its F8 conference for developers  covering a wide range of topics including a dating service  new features for WhatsApp  Instagram and Messenger  Oculus Go and measures to protect people s privacy 
The privacy factor has been the biggest concern for developers because they simply can t have people leaving the platform  But while addressing that issue  Facebook made sure to get across its key message  that it s a platform to connect people  that it isn t easy to create  that it will likely make mistakes  that it will have to correct those mistakes and that most importantly  it will continue to build 
On that note  let s jump to the hottest development  Facebook is getting into the dating business in a hopefully big way  There s something weird about it though because your dating profile will only be shared with people that aren t on your friends list to protect your privacy  Facebook could ultimately make that optional to give you more choice 
But it s interesting that the announcement came at this time  almost as if to create a distraction from Facebook s current privacy related problems  people s growing distrust in really big platforms and the CEO s grilling in congress  Facebook will get even more personal data in this way  which isn t cool  On the other hand  the company being the giant that it is  may still attract enough users to have a very successful business 
For instance  if 20  of its 2 2 billion monthly users opt into the service  that is 440 million people   compare that to the 7 million people using the very popular range of dating services that Match Group  NASDAQ MTCH  offers and you get a good idea of the potential  No wonder Match shares plunged on the news 
WhatsApp  Facebook said that 450 million people are now using Status  so it is dressing it up a bit with stickers and group video calling 
Instagram   The upgrade introduces video calling  bully comment weeding and Explore feature enhancing 
Messenger  Facebook is removing the clutter of the camera and games tabs and adding translation to facilitate doing business 
Moreover  it is facilitating the sharing of videos and photos from Spotify  SoundCloud  GoPro and other apps directly to Stories inside Facebook and Instagram that will make Facebook s stories so much more interesting than what Snap   NYSE SNAP   has on offer  No wonder Snap investors are freaking out 
Oculus Go  The standalone device with a 2 hour battery life is now on sale for  199 for the 32GB version and  249 for the 64GB version  Facebook gifted a 32GB device to all attendees in a publicity drive  So if you re tired enough of connecting your phone to the VR headset you re using currently that you d rather Facebook controlled that experience for you  it s a good buy 
Privacy  Other than repeating how it will dedicate 20K employees by year end  continue its app review process and give you more options when you re likely reading something fake  Facebook explained how its new AI tools will do most of the weeding work in the future  Note that AI tools are built on your data and get better by eating more data  But hey  it s all in the interest of your security and privacy 
Earnings
Revenue of  12 0 billion grew 49  over last year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 45 billion by 4 5   Per share earnings of  1 69 grew 62 5   beating our estimate of  1 36 by 24 3   The results were a huge relief for investors because of uncertainties related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the fear that users could exit the platform en masse 
Overall  1 45 billion users signed in daily while 2 2 billion signed in monthly  Daily active users  DAUs  and monthly active users  MAUs  were both up 13   Average revenue per user  ARPU  was up 30 7   so Facebook is doing an extremely good job of monetizing its user base  ARPU increased across geographies  U S  and Canada up 38 2   Europe 49 8   Asia Pacific 24 2  and Other 32 3    with North America remaining the highest ARPU region by far 
Mobile represented 91  of advertising revenue and ad revenue was 98  of total revenue  so most of the business was generated on mobile devices 
On the expense front  cost of revenue jumped on account of video content acquisition and the increase will continue through the rest of the year  The change in the way Instant Articles revenue is recognized from a net to a gross basis  also contributed  Other expenses dropped as a percentage of sales 
Operating cash flow was up 55 4  from last year  Capex was up 121 2  
Advertiser defections related to Cambridge Analytica and GDPR implementation are the two big concerns for investors at the moment  While management is taking measures to protect privacy of all parties  we won t actually know if it materially impacts results until at least the next quarterly report 
Management expects that as a result of the GDPR rollout  European MAU and DAU will be flat to slightly down sequentially in the next quarter  They didn t provide an estimate of the impact on advertising revenue although it isn t currently expected to be material   
2018 opex guidance was narrowed and raised from 45 60  to 50 60   attributable to significant investments in areas like safety and security  it is adding 20K employees to deal with recent concerns   content and R D  Full year capex is expected to be  15 billion  previous  14 15 billion   driven by investments in data centers  servers  network infrastructure and office facilities 
The WhatsApp Double cross
WhatsApp co founder Jan Koum is finally leaving the company and resigning from its board on disagreements with Facebook management about the deliberate weakening of its encryption system to access its users  personal data  according to the Washington Post 
Jan Koum and Brian Acton sold their messaging service to Facebook in 2014 when the service had 500 million users  Today the number of users has more than doubled  and Facebook is looking to monetize the platform 
The business was sold on the condition that it wouldn t be used as a platform to sell ads  but Facebook did away with the 99 cent annual charge soon after the acquisition and sometime later  started sharing users  contact information and analytics with the Facebook platform  breaking another condition of sale  On Koum s initiative and insistence  it did however implement a network wide encryption that it s now apparently thinking of breaking down 
After all  Facebook paid  19 billion for the company  so obviously  a 99 cent annual fee won t cut it 
In any case  Acton left in November and publicly criticized Facebook for the double cross and now  Koum is leaving on a quieter note to collect  rare air cooled Porsches  working on my cars and playing ultimate frisbee  
Koum and Acton were critical of the targeted advertising model  In a WhatsApp blog post in 2012  they wrote that  no one wakes up excited to see more advertising  no one goes to sleep thinking about the ads they ll see tomorrow   They described online advertising as  a disruption to aesthetics  an insult to your intelligence  and the interruption of your train of thought   I couldn t agree more  Especially since a lot of advertising is dishonest and nothing in the world is free

who warns about the debt bubble or  shadow banking  in China is bound to be right    eventually My goal is not to be right  but to take another look at some of the signs as they might affect my investments  And I was prompted to do this as Chinese stocks struggle this year worse than the US Here are the YTD performances  as of 4 10 18  of some Chinese consumer tech stocks that are popular among investors in the US   Tencent   3 14 Alibaba   2 71 Baidu   1 16 JD com   1 74 YY Inc    13 06 These showings don t look too bad  But among broad Chinese stocks indexes  here s the worst view in this 1 year chart of the Shanghai Composite   Is It  Slowing Global Growth  or Just Debt Since I own shares of Alibaba for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio  I was looking for clues to its weakness when I had assumed it was immune from US market troubles  My investing thesis since we first bought shares near  100 in early 2017 was that the  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  of China  would continue to build a consumer and technology platform that rivaled what Amazon  AMZN  had achieved  but with a bigger middle class consumer base I found three data points about credit debt conditions in China that gave me pause First  this note from research firm Hedgeye   The instability of China s credit fueled  investment focused growth strategy is  without doubt  one of the greatest systemic risks facing the global economy  Chinese credit outstanding amounts to CNY 181 2 trillion  or  28 7 trillion  as of February 28  2018  data released 3 8 2018   which is up CNY  18 1 trillion or  11 1  year over year  Month over month  credit is up CNY  1 135 billion or  0 6   Note  this data is only updated monthly Second  this look at the financial subsidiary of Alibaba from Bloomberg   Financing from an obscure part of the debt market that the company has relied heavily on for its key consumer lending business is drying up  It s sold only 22 8 billion yuan   3 6 billion  of asset backed securities tied to consumer lending in the first quarter  down 74 percent from the previous three months  according to data compiled by Bloomberg and China Securitization Analytics China s tech giants led by Ant Financial have been ramping up consumer lending to meet surging demand from cash strapped millennials buying everything from iPhones to hairdryers on online shopping platforms  The firms then package the lending into ABS  complex financial products that they sell on to investors  The micro lending driving such debt sales  though  has increasingly been in the crosshairs of regulators as the industry is criticized for sometimes high interest rates and underhanded lending practices Third  this article today from Bloomberg   A challenge for investors all over the world  corporate governance is becoming a particularly thorny hurdle for investors in China s bond market as the amount of low or unrated borrowers swells I will remain an investor in Alibaba  but it s always good to check in on

The watchdog held a meeting with representatives from firms including Tencent Holdings Ltd  Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  and Sohu com Inc  on Tuesday where it gave them a list of specific errors  the Cyberspace Administration of China  CAC  said in a statement on social media 
The violations include distorting Chinese history  spreading fake news  misinterpreting policy directives and failing to block content that subverts public stability 
  The sites  must adhere to the correct political line and moral norms   the statement said 
Chinese authorities have recently cracked down on platforms that allow users to share media from outlets that are not sanctioned under state issued licenses  amid a wider censorship campaign spearheaded by President Xi Jinping 
On June 1 the CAC ushered in new regulations requiring all offline and online media outlets to be managed by Party approved editorial staff  Workers in the approved outlets must receive training from local propaganda bureaus  nL4N1I42ID 
In the wake of the new regulations several sites have been targeted with fines and closures under the watchdog s orders 
In specific examples  the CAC criticised one platform that failed to censor articles that  seriously deviated from socialist values  by saying China benefited from U S  assistance during conflicts with Japan during World War II 
Other examples included a story detailing alleged affairs by party officials  an opinion piece that decried China s death penalty and an article that urged readers to invest in speculative real estate projects

159895,381411,BIDU,Exclusive  Baidu  JD com to join others investing  12 billion in state owned China Unicom   sources,news,"By Julie Zhu
HONG KONG  Reuters    Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  and JD com will join other big Chinese technology firms to jointly invest about  12 billion in the Shanghai listed unit of China Unicom  the weakest of three big state owned telecoms firms  two people with direct knowledge of the matter said 
The move is part of the Chinese government s drive to rejuvenate state behemoths with private capital  Beijing added China Unicom last year to a first batch of state owned enterprises to see mixed ownership reform 
China Unicom  formally known as China United Network Communications Group Co Ltd  is one of the world s largest mobile carriers by user numbers  but its recent earnings have struggled in a fiercely competitive market 
The carrier is widely seen as over staffed  inefficient and slow to develop key technologies  It already lags state owned China Mobile and China Telecom  and private firms have moved ahead in developing cloud and big data services  and mobile software 
Reuters reported last month that  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holdings and Tencent Holdings would be among new investors putting a total of about  10 billion into China United Network Communications Ltd  China Unicom s Shanghai listed unit 
That total is likely to rise to about 80 billion yuan   11 8 billion   with Baidu  China s biggest internet search provider  investing about 10 billion yuan   1 48 billion   and JD com  the country s second largest e commerce company  putting in about 5 billion yuan  one of the people said 
The China Unicom unit is likely to raise 15 billion yuan from Tencent and 7 billion yuan from Alibaba  while China Life Investment Holding Co Ltd would be the biggest new investor  with a 20 billion yuan commitment  that person added 
Overall  it would be the largest capital raising in the Asia Pacific region since insurer AIA Group s 2010 initial public offering  according to Thomson Reuters data 
The majority of the capital would be raised through new share issues  while China Unicom would also sell part of its stake in the Shanghai unit  the two people said 
Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are not public 
Baidu and JD com declined to comment  and China Unicom  Alibaba and Tencent didn t respond to Reuters requests for comment  China Life Investment Holding could not immediately be reached for comment 
China s State owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission  SASAC   which oversees state enterprises  also did not respond to requests for comment 
5G PUSH
After the share sale  China Unicom s stake in the Shanghai listed business would fall to just above 40 percent  from 63 percent currently  one of the sources said  and top investors  including China Life Investment and Tencent  would likely have seats on the firm s board to engage in its operations and improve its management 
Both sources said teaming up with China s big tech companies  particularly Tencent and Alibaba  would help revive China Unicom by lowering the cost of attracting new users and shifting its focus from traditional telecoms services to digital information services 
The share sale also comes at a time when Beijing is pushing to build the world s largest fifth generation  5G  mobile network   bringing a significant speed upgrade from today s 4G network 
China s 5G market could be worth 1 1 trillion yuan  or 3 2 percent of GDP  by 2025  according to a recent research paper from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology 
The capital raising would give China Unicom the firepower to boost its spending on 5G 
Share trading in China Unicom s Shanghai listed unit has been halted since it said in early April it would be part of the government s mixed ownership pilot  It gave no further details at that time  Prior to that suspension  the unit s market value topped  23 billion 
A week ago  the unit said it was waiting for regulatory approvals over details of the mixed ownership plans  and trading in its shares would remain suspended for another month 

The sources said the share sale plan is likely to be finalized by late August ",2017-07-21,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-baidu,-jd.com-to-join-others-investing-$12-billion-in-state-owned-china-unicom---sources-508349",508349

159902,381418,BIDU,Should You Buy PayPal  PYPL  Stock On The Dip ,opinion,"Shares of PayPal   NASDAQ PYPL   sunk nearly 3  on Thursday morning amid what has otherwise been a stellar run for the online and mobile payments powerhouse  With no new stock moving headlines to speak of  let s take a look at some of the company s current fundamentals to see if now might be a good time to buy this slight dip 
Latest Earnings Results
PayPal has moved higher since its latest earnings report in late January  so it is clear that investors liked what they saw 
PayPal s Q4 revenue popped 26  to reach  3 74 billion  while adjusted earnings surged 30  to hit  0 55 per share  The company s widely popular Venmo payment app saw an 86  jump in payment volume  PayPal also expanded its business into new international regions that have the potential to drastically increase revenues PayPal s Q4 and FY 2017 Financial Earnings Results     PayPal   PayPal  More Fundamentals 
Looking ahead to the first quarter  PayPal is projected to see its revenues climb 20 3  to reach  3 58 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  PayPal s top line is expected to grow at a similar rate the following quarter and hit  15 25 billion for the full year  which would mark 16 4  growth 
PayPal s Q1 and full year earnings are projected to surge 22 7  and 20 5   respectively  The payment firm is also expected to see it adjusted earnings expand at an annualized rate of 17 5  over the next three to five years 
But what could have caused today s small sell off 
One possible answer is that some of PayPal s earnings estimates have been trending downward recently  Within the last 60 days  PayPal has earned six downward revisions against just four upward revisions for the first quarter 
On the other hand  earnings revisions have favored the upside 12 to two for PayPal s current full year within this same timeframe 
Investors should also note that PayPal seems to focus on satisfying earnings expectations  which is something growth based firms can neglect  The company has beat earnings estimates every quarter since it split from eBay   NASDAQ EBAY    and a positive earnings surprise has sometimes resulted in an immediate surge in share prices PayPal Holdings  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Value
PayPal doesn t necessarily scream value  but when compared to the  Internet   Software  industry s average P E of 61 7  the company looks outstanding  PayPal is currently trading at 35 5x forward earnings  which also marks a massive discount compared to the 55x it traded at in the beginning of January 
PayPal is also currently trading at a discount compared to its new age payment rival Square   NYSE SQ    which sports a Forward P E of 123 8  This should please PayPal investors because both companies operate a similar service and have expanded far beyond their initial business models into new growth areas  so investors are able to get similar exposure with PYPL at a more attractive earnings multiple 
Bottom Line

159921,381437,BIDU,China s bloggers  filmmakers feel chill of internet crackdown,news,"By Pei Li and Adam Jourdan BEIJING SHANGHAI  Reuters    China s latest maneuvre in a sweeping crackdown on internet content has sent a chill through a diverse community of filmmakers  bloggers  media and educators who fear their sites could be shut down as Beijing tightens control   Over the last month  Chinese regulators have closed celebrity gossip websites  restricted what video people can post and suspended online streaming  all on grounds of inappropriate content   On Friday  an industry association circulated new regulations that at least two  auditors  will  with immediate effect  be required to check all audiovisual content posted online   from films to  micro  movies  documentaries  sports  educational material and animation   to ensure they adhere to  core socialist values   Topics deemed inappropriate include drug addiction and homosexuality  said the government affiliated China Netcasting Services Association  which represents more than 600 members  People flocked online at the weekend to criticize the move  with most saying it was a step backwards that would hamper creativity  Some noted it could be near impossible to enforce   According to these censorship rules  nothing will make it through  which will do away with audiovisual artistic creation   Li Yinhe  an academic who studies sexuality at the government run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  wrote in an online post  Under the government rules  such works as Georges Bizet s opera  Carmen  and Shakespeare s  Othello  would technically have to be banned for depicting prostitution and overt displays of affection  she said   The rules  which affect social media giants like  Weibo Corp   O WB  as well as small platforms that have thrived in China s buzzing creative online space  are the latest step toughening oversight ahead of the Communist Party Congress later this year  when President Xi Jinping is expected to consolidate power   China s online video market  including revenue from advertising and content purchases  had been expected to more than quadruple to around 96 2 billion yuan   17 6 billion  by 2020 from 2015  according to 2016 data from IHS Markit   We used to describe the constant drip of regulation as boiling a frog in warm water  Now it is outright scalding with boiling water   Wang Xiaoxiao  a talent agent who represents several actors who have gained fame online  told Reuters   Zhao Jing  the founder of Yummy  a site that specializes in education on gender topics  said she would be using euphemisms for genitalia and avoid banned topics such as one night stands and extramarital affairs to get around keywords that will trigger the censors  She fears her site could be thrown off Tencent s WeChat instant messaging application otherwise  ENTERTAINMENT IN FOCUS While censorship of creative content in China is nothing new  the internet has generally been a more permissive arena because of the gray areas around regulation   The atmosphere has become more tense since Xi called for stricter regulation last year   In June  China s cyberspace authorities ordered internet firms like Baidu Inc  O BIDU  and Tencent Holding Ltd  HK 0700  to close 60 popular celebrity gossip social media accounts  including  China s Number One Paparazzi  Zhuo Wei  an account that had more than 7 million followers  The government said it aimed to  create a healthy and uplifting mainstream media environment  and actively spread socialist core values    This focus on online entertainment content   an extension of the government s well established control over politics and news   is aimed at a largely younger audience  said Qiao Mu  a Beijing based media scholar known for criticizing censorship    This is a return to ideology   Qiao said in a phone interview   To the Party  entertainment will make people lose their revolutionary spirit    One of the main focuses of online scorn was the inclusion of homosexuality on the list of banned topics  underlining a long standing conservative attitude in China towards same sex relations despite often thriving gay scenes in major cities   Two filmmakers interviewed by Reuters said the latest ruling closed one of the remaining channels for uninhibited creative works  Films shown in cinemas or on television already go through thorough censorship processes before being given the go ahead    Many filmmakers know they could never get their film approved for cinemas  and so put them online   said Fan Popo  a gay activist and film director  The only hope for such filmmakers left was that censors would struggle to implement the new rules  he said  The crackdown is also being felt in the country s top internet firms  Shares in Weibo Corp  the operator of China s top microblogging site  are down around 10 percent since restrictions were imposed on its audiovisual content in mid June   The company said last week it would work closely with state media to promote  mainstream  ideas  For some platforms  investors have pulled funding and advertisers have jumped ship because of the uncertainties  industry insiders told Reuters  Dushe Dianying  or  poison tongue movie   a popular movie review site known for its acerbic critiques  had its account on WeChat shut down last month by regulators citing  socialist values    
The site  backed by German media group Bertelsmann  was valued at 300 million yuan   44 17 million  last year   A person familiar with the site s operations said some of its business tie ups and advertising deals had been hit  Others in the industry also said investment had suffered    It is now just too risky   said the person  who asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media    1   6 7919 Chinese yuan renminbi ",2017-07-04,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/china's-bloggers,-filmmakers-feel-chill-of-internet-crackdown-501707",501707

159952,381468,BIDU,U S  weighs restricting Chinese investment in artificial intelligence,news,"By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States appears poised to heighten scrutiny of Chinese investment in Silicon Valley to better shield sensitive technologies seen as vital to U S  national security  current and former U S  officials tell Reuters  Of particular concern is China s interest in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning  which have increasingly attracted Chinese capital in recent years  The worry is that cutting edge technologies developed in the United States could be used by China to bolster its military capabilities and perhaps even push it ahead in strategic industries  The U S  government is now looking to strengthen the role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   the inter agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U S  companies on national security grounds  An unreleased Pentagon report  viewed by Reuters  warns that China is skirting U S  oversight and gaining access to sensitive technology through transactions that currently don t trigger CFIUS review  Such deals would include joint ventures  minority stakes and early stage investments in start ups   We re examining CFIUS to look at the long term health and security of the U S  economy  given China s predatory practices  in technology  said a Trump administration official  who was not authorized to speak publicly  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis weighed into the debate on Tuesday  calling CFIUS  outdated  and telling a Senate hearing   It needs to be updated to deal with today s situation    CFIUS is headed by the Treasury Department and includes nine permanent members including representatives from the departments of Defense  Justice  Homeland Security  Commerce  State and Energy  The CFIUS panel is so secretive it normally does not comment after it makes a decision on a deal  Under former President Barack Obama  CFIUS stopped a series of attempted Chinese acquisitions of high end chip makers   Senator John Cornyn  the No  2 Republican in the Senate  is now drafting legislation that would give CFIUS far more power to block some technology investments  a Cornyn aide said   Artificial intelligence is one of many leading edge technologies that China seeks and that has potential military applications   said the Cornyn aide  who declined to be identified   These technologies are so new that our export control system has not yet figured out how to cover them  which is part of the reason they are slipping through the gaps in the existing safeguards   the aide said  The legislation would require CFIUS to heighten scrutiny of buyers hailing from nations identified as potential threats to national security  CFIUS would maintain the list  the aide said  without specifying who would create it  Cornyn s legislation would not single out specific technologies that would be subject to CFIUS scrutiny  But it would provide a mechanism for the Pentagon to lead that identification effort  with input from the U S  technology sector  the Commerce Department  and the Energy Department  the aide said   James Lewis  an expert on military technology at the Center for Security and International Studies  said the U S  government is playing catch up   The Chinese have found a way around our protections  our safeguards  on technology transfer in foreign investment  And they re using it to pull ahead of us  both economically and militarily   Lewis said   I think that s a big deal   But some industry experts warn that stronger U S  regulations may not succeed in halting technology transfer and might trigger retaliation by China  with economic repercussions for the United States  In Beijing  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Chinese investment should not be  politically overinterpreted  or  interfered with politically    We hope the United States can provide a good environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States   Lu told a regular news briefing on Wednesday   China made the United States the top destination for its foreign direct investment in 2016  with  45 6 billion in completed acquisitions and greenfield investments  according to the Rhodium Group  a research firm  Investment from January to May 2017 totaled  22 billion  which represented a 100 percent increase against the same period last year  it said   There will be a significant pushback from the technology industry  if legislation is overly aggressive  Rhodium Group economist Thilo Hanemann said   AI S ROLE IN DRONE WARFARE Concerns about Chinese inroads into advanced technology come as the U S  military looks to incorporate elements of artificial intelligence and machine learning into its drone program   Project Maven  as the effort is known  aims to provide some relief to military analysts who are part of the war against Islamic State   These analysts currently spend long hours staring at big screens reviewing video feeds from drones as part of the hunt for insurgents in places like Iraq and Afghanistan   The Pentagon is trying to develop algorithms that would sort through the material and alert analysts to important finds  according to Air Force Lieutenant General John N T   Jack  Shanahan  director for defense intelligence for warfighting support   A lot of times these things are flying around and     there s nothing in the scene that s of interest   he told Reuters  Shanahan said his team is currently trying to teach the system to recognize objects such as trucks and buildings  identify people and  eventually  detect changes in patterns of daily life that could signal significant developments   We ll start small  show some wins   he said   A Pentagon official said the U S  government is requesting to spend around  30 million on the effort in 2018  Similar image recognition technology is being developed commercially by firms in Silicon Valley  which could be adapted by adversaries for military reasons   Shanahan said he was not surprised Chinese firms were making investments there   They know what they re targeting   he said  Research firm CB Insights says it has tracked 29 investors from mainland China investing in U S  artificial intelligence companies since the start of 2012   The risks extend beyond technology transfer   When the Chinese make an investment in an early stage company developing advanced technology  there is an opportunity cost to the U S   since that company is potentially

159953,381469,BIDU,Goldman backed startup Circle launches no fee foreign payments service,news,"By Jemima Kelly and Anna Irrera
PARIS NEW YORK  Reuters    Blockchain based payments startup Circle Internet Financial on Thursday launched an international online money transfer service that allows people in the United States and Europe to send money to each other instantly and at no cost as it seeks to tear down borders in the payments world 
The new service is part of a push by the  fintech    or financial technology   sector to compete with established financial institutions  by using digital technologies to offer cheaper and more user friendly services  often via smartphones 
Boston based Circle Internet operates its app based peer to peer payment network using blockchain  the technology which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin 
One of the most well funded blockchain startups  its investors include  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  and Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  
Circle Internet s international money transfer service  built on a type of blockchain called Ethereum  will allow customers to send payments between U S  dollars  British pound sterling or euros on their mobile phones  There are no fees or foreign exchange mark ups 
International payments  according to Circle s chief executive officer and founder  Jeremy Allaire  should not take days to be processed and should be as easy and frictionless as sending an email 
 When s the last time you sent a  cross border email    Allaire said in an interview   The idea of cross border payments is going to completely go away      Our vision is for there to be no distinction between international and domestic payments  
Circle  which processed over  1 billion in transactions in 2016 and whose customer base increased more than 10 fold in the year up to last month  does not make money from its payments service  nor does it plan to  as it reckons consumers expect these services to be free 
 We don t think there is any money to be made in payments anymore   said Allaire   The entire business model of extracting a toll or having time delays around the movement of value is going away completely  
Instead  the company makes money by trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  both on digital currency exchanges and over the counter  at a time when the value of such web based currencies has reached record highs  Last month alone  Circle traded over  800 million in digital assets  it said in a statement 
In May the company appointed trader Daniel Matuszewski to take over its trading division  following the departure of former treasury and trading operations chief Joshua Lim  the company s head of marketing confirmed ",2017-06-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/goldman-backed-startup-circle-launches-no-fee-foreign-payments-service-495588,495588
159954,381470,BIDU,HK s new board seen a big draw for startups  not secondary listings,news,"By Elzio Barreto HONG KONG  Reuters    Hong Kong stock exchange s plans for a new board to allow sweeping changes to its listing rules could lure a slew of technology startups  though they are less likely to attract Chinese firms already listed overseas  Major Chinese firms including  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  N BABA   search giant Baidu Inc  O BIDU  and e commerce platform JD com Inc  O JD  all picked New York over Hong Kong for initial public offerings  IPOs   So the new rules offer Hong Kong a chance to bring the tech titans closer to home with a secondary listing  But bankers say these companies are not likely to get a big pickup in valuation or trading activity to justify the cost and regulatory burden of a secondary listing   The appeal for unlisted companies is more obvious than for already listed companies  especially for the non giants  If your market cap exceeds  10 billion  your liquidity and valuation is global   said Kai Fang  head of equity capital markets at boutique investment bank China Renaissance  which has advised on some of China s top technology deals  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing  HKEX   HK 0388   which operates the stock exchange  unveiled a proposal on Friday for a new board that would allow companies with share structures providing special voting rights  and those yet to make a profit  to list  They were the two key hurdles that prompted Chinese startups to choose New York instead of Hong Kong for IPOs  If approved  the changes could be implemented at the beginning of 2018  HKEX chief executive Charles Li said on Friday  Potential new business for the exchange could be significant  Chinese companies targeted by the new board raised IPO funds of  49 billion in the past 10 years  including  34 billion raised by mainland companies that listed in the United States with weighted voting rights structures  the HKEX said  Those included Alibaba  Baidu and JD com  Another  15 billion was raised by Chinese companies that had yet to make a profit  Such a voting rights structure is critical for many unlisted Chinese firms such as ride hailing company Didi Chuxing  Ant Financial and food delivery provider Meituan Dianping  The three companies  with a combined valuation of about  130 billion  have different classes of stock to give founders control of the companies   They re trying to attract some of the high profile companies that have dual class structures and wouldn t list here otherwise   said an investment banker who worked on recent Chinese technology listings in the United States and who declined to be identified   Without those changes  these companies just won t come to Hong Kong  full stop   Still  some companies with little turnover or low valuations overseas might seek a secondary listing in Hong Kong to bolster their prospects  including Chinese firms that had been considering a delisting from New York  Manchester United  N MANU   which scrapped a Hong Kong IPO because of its dual share structure  could get a boost from Asian investors appetite for sports related assets  the bankers said  
 If you re looking at some companies that have relatively low liquidity in the U S   then the dual listing could make sense   Fang added   The Hong Kong stock exchange is trying to find a way to lure some companies that might originally achieve a premium valuation in Hong Kong  but due to the voting rights issue they choose to list somewhere else  ",2017-06-20,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hk's-new-board-seen-a-big-draw-for-startups,-not-secondary-listings-497149",497149
159955,381471,BIDU,Tencent And Baidu Challenge Alibaba In Retail And Financial Services,opinion,"Shares of Alibaba   NYSE BABA   gained more than 2 5  in morning trading Wednesday  despite news that the company will face fresh competition from its Chinese rivals in two key businesses  retail and financial services 
The first headline to emerge this week concerned Tencent s   OTC TCEHY   plans to expand its brick and mortar shopping operations through a stake in Carrefour s China unit  Along with local retailer Yonghui Superstores  Tencent recently signed a term sheet for an undisclosed stake in Carrefour  PA CARR  China  the French retailer revealed on Tuesday 
Carrefour currently operates about 200 of its so called  hypermarkets  large retail facilities with both grocery and department store features in China  but its share of the market has slipped as shoppers continue to move online 
Tencent s partnership with Yonghui would allow the social media and mobile gaming giant to pair its technology with the domestic retailer s shopping expertise in order to improve Carrefour s mobile payments and data analysis  Tencent previously signaled its intention to enter the Chinese retail market with its  638 million investment in Yonghui 
For Alibaba  Tencent s investments in the brick and mortar industry mean tougher competition in a market that it is still fighting to control  Last year  the e commerce behemoth partnered up with both Sun Art Retail Group and Auchan Retail in an effort to stake its claim on what is a  4 trillion sector in China 
Alibaba has also launched HeMa  its own chain of grocery stores that focus on fresh food and double as fulfillment centers 
 The e commerce penetration ratio in China is quite high  but the offline retail market is much larger and they want to capture that   Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Naoshi Nema said  via    They also want to connect traditional commerce with technology  
Both Alibaba and Tencent view brick and mortar retail not only as a large potential new revenue stream  but also as a means to spread their other projects  Tencent wants more retailers to implement its WeChat branded mobile payments system  while Alibaba could benefit from learning more about the shopping tendencies of its core customer base 
And as if new competition on the retail front was not enough for Alibaba  Jack Ma s company is also gearing up to take on a fresh foe on the financial services side of things 
According to a new report from   sources with knowledge of the company say that Chinese internet search giant Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU   is in the process of recruiting investors for its wholly owned finance unit  The firm apparently wants investors to either buy some of its existing shares in Baidu Financial Services Group  FSG   or buy new stakes in the unit which is currently valued at about  2 8 billion 
Baidu FSG operates Baidu Wallet  a digital wealth management platform and online credit service  An expansion of this unit would be a direct blow to Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial  which operates the Alipay mobile payments service and offers wealth management and insurance products  Ant Financial is currently sporting a  60 billion valuation 
Baidu FSG reportedly plans to use its new cash to invest in Chinese financial institutions  including some trust firms  The funding round comes amid a large strategic shift that has seen Baidu focus on several projects outside of its traditional search engine business

Corporation  Upon successfully completing the acquisition of TiVo Inc  in early Sep 2016  Rovi adopted the iconic TiVo brand name The company s revenues from the Licensing  services and software

160091,381607,BIDU,Baozun And Momo Display Rare Weakness In Chinese Internet Industry,opinion,"Second quarter earnings season has  for the most part  proven that China s internet space remains strong  However  the latest reports from Baozun   NASDAQ BZUN   and Momo   NASDAQ MOMO   have sent both of these stocks crashing on Tuesday morning  signaling a rare moment of investor hesitation in this booming Chinese market 
Earnings Results
For Baozun  a provider of e commerce and web design solutions  it was an earnings miss that sent shares tumbling today  Baozun reported adjusted profits of 8 cents per share  falling short of the 10 cents forecasted by Street analysts  The company said quarterly revenues were  131 million  just slightly ahead of the  130 7 million analysts expected 
These revenue results marked impressive growth of nearly 27  from the year ago period  but investors seem to also be reacting to Baozun s third quarter forecast  which calls for this growth rate to slow significantly  Indeed  the company said that it expects Q3 revenues to be between  130 63 million and  136 64 million representing year over year growth of roughly 16  to 21  
It s also worth noting that Baozun is calling for a 50  growth rate in its rapidly expanding services unit next quarter  down from the 59  expansion posted in today s report  Investors may also be weary that the company has burned through about 9  of its cash pile so far this year  primarily due to investments in logistics space  Shares of Baozun were down more than 15 4  through early morning trading hours 
Results were even stronger for Momo  but investors were equally unimpressed  The mobile gaming company reported earnings of 29 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents  Revenues were  312 million in the quarter  ahead of our consensus estimate of  291 million and up more than 215  from the year ago period 
This growth came at a steep price  of course  Momo said that cost and expenses climbed a staggering 189  to  246 million  which is perhaps helping fuel today s slump  The company now expects third quarter revenues to be between  337 0 million and  342 0 million  well beyond our current consensus estimate of  318 million but representing slower growth than displayed in the latest quarter 
Despite these relatively strong results  shares of Momo slumped more than 17  in morning trading hours Monday  The stock had gained more than 23  in the two months prior to the report  so it could be that investors were simply looking for a stronger earnings beat than Momo was able to post today 
Industry Trends
Today s movement from Baozun and Momo comes in stark contrast to the most recent trends in the Chinese internet industry  Thanks to strong beats from industry leaders like Alibaba   NYSE BABA    Tencent   OTC TCEHY    and Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    among others  this space has been soaring recently 
In fact  the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF   which tracks China based companies whose primary business or businesses are in the Internet and Internet related sectors  has moved more than 7  higher in the past month

160114,381630,BIDU,Didi s China dominance over Uber offers roadmap for ride hailing rivals,news,"By Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    China ride hailing service Didi Chuxing s dominance of Uber Technologies in the China market may provide a playbook for regional rivals to fend off the biggest U S  ride hailing company  especially in Southeast Asia and India  The two companies on Monday confirmed the sale of Uber China to its bigger rival  ending a two year  money losing effort to break into one of the world s toughest markets  Uber leaves with around a one fifth stake in Didi  but will give up control of its China operations  Didi had a head start and maintained the lead on Uber with a strategy that other rivals may emulate  analysts and investors said  Didi counts two of the most powerful  best capitalized Chinese Internet companies as backers  has tight connections with local government  made an ally of local taxi drivers and expanded into services such as buses that Uber ignored  and exploited its knowledge of local culture and consumers  Uber and Didi declined to comment  Among those closely watching Didi s acquisition is Grab  the dominant Southeast Asia ride hailing start up that competes with Uber in countries including Singapore and Vietnam  Grab says it has 95 percent market share in third party taxi hailing services  while its private car business has about half of the Southeast Asian market   Our investor and global partner Didi has effectively won the battle for market share dominance in China   Grab CEO Anthony Tan wrote in an Aug  1 memo to staff seen by Reuters   We have seen that when the local champion stays true to their beliefs and strengths they can prevail   he wrote  Grab and Didi formed an alliance with India ride service start up Ola and U S  operator Lyft last year  and the Asian companies operate in what could be the next battlegrounds for Uber  said Jeremy Carlson  principal analyst in autonomous driving and mobility at IHS Markit   Grab knows very well what Didi is doing in China and is replicating that   such as offering transit options beyond personal car services  said Hans Tung  managing partner at GGV Capital  which has invested in both Grab and Didi  Grab also has powerful regional backers that include Japan s SoftBank Corp  T 9984   sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp  CIC UL  and an arm of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings  TEM UL   DIDI S ROAD MAP Because China is a unique market   in population  regulatory complexity and concerns about foreign ownership of big companies   some lessons learned there may not transfer to other regions  Still  Didi made moves that may serve as a guide for other Uber competitors on its way to building a juggernaut that gives customers more than 14 million rides each day   It s an encouraging sign for local competitors that they can  in fact  compete and that local strategies are required for local markets   said Dane Anderson  a vice president at research firm Forrester   For Southeast Asia  the key message they can take away is that they can compete with Uber and that Uber will have to prioritize as well    Didi consolidated local competition  forming from a merger of China s top two ride hailing firms  and it had the backing of Internet companies  Alibaba   N BABA  and Tencent  HK 0700    Those connections enabled Didi customers to hail a ride and pay for it through Alipay  Alibaba s payment system  and social media platform WeChat  owned by Tencent   Didi had a much bigger presence on China social media   said David Chao  general partner at DCM Ventures  which invests in China  Uber eventually got backing from Chinese conglomerate Baidu  O BIDU   but by that time Didi had overtaken it    Uber joined the party a little too late   Chao said  Didi also started its business focused on taxi hailing  allowing it to overtake Uber China in its number of drivers  since Uber relied on privately owned cars in China  where vehicle ownership has historically been low  Didi has expanded to buses  chauffeurs and other services  LOCAL KNOW HOW Other companies have played up their local knowledge  Ola recently acquired a local payments service Qarth  with connections to Indian banks  to expand the ways passengers can pay  Uber has been criticized for launching in China in early 2014 without fully understanding the local culture  business dynamics and consumers  such as its focus on private cars   Uber was trying to import some of those ideas that might have worked well in other markets and adapt and move that stuff and apply it to China   said IHS Markit s Carlson  In Indonesia  a country of 250 million people  it faced similar hiccups  Uber angered Jakarta s governor last year by rushing to announce it had approval to operate in the capital  denied by the governor at the time  Still  Uber s loss in China could make it a greater threat elsewhere  as it focuses its efforts and money  The billions of dollars it was spending to compete in China can now be aimed at other markets   Our engineering efforts are going to be deployed to India and Southeast Asia  Manik Gupta   Uber s head of maps  was in India recently  we re going to be making that product better   said a person close to Uber  who didn t want to be named  Rivals are wary already

160159,381675,BIDU,ABX Set To Explode Higher With Gold,opinion,"Good day to all  I would like to share with you some of my trading ideas and very interesting actionable setups I see in some popular shares for the immediate future  Lets start with my favorite Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  


Topping formation and a break below 15  could push price below 13   Key resistance at 17 50  and multiple Head and shoulders pattern in the daily chart  Even as we speak with DAX near new all time highs  there is clearly a divergence between MI DBK and DAX 
Interested in gold  Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  is about to explode higher with gold  An inverted head and shoulders pattern that bulls need to break above  21  neckline resistance  


VIX is so much pressured lower that eventually it will bounce strongly upwards like a spring  That is why XIV is already providing a nice reversal signal and a possible strong bounce in VIX to come   68 50 is key support  My wave count is as follows 



Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  may very well have already completed 5 waves up and expecting a correction towards 800  

A break below 861  will confirm my view that at least a short term pull back is in place that could reach between  835 810 if we have more up waves  Otherwise a break below the daily cloud support at  800 could signal a bigger correction 
Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  continues to trade inside a long term triangle respecting its boundaries  Traders should better wait and act after the breakout 


Here are just of a few of my setups and stocks I closely monitor  Thank you for taking the time to catch up on my thinking

The balance of U S  economic data was positive on Friday showing better than expected growth in the economy with a consumer that was more optimistic and willing to spend more 
The second estimate of fourth quarter GDP was revised upward to quarter on quarter growth of 1 0   beating expectations for a downward revision to 0 4  
Additionally  a U S  Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed that personal spending ramped up a seasonally adjusted 0 5  in January  compared to the consensus forecast for a 0 3  rise 
The final reading of the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment also showed buyer confidence rose to 91 7 in February  beating expectations for a reading of 91 0 
Each positive reading seemed to pare the gains in U S  stocks as investors appeared to read the good economic news as support for the Fed to embark on more rate hikes in 2016 
Indeed  Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester said on Friday that the underlying U S  economy remains strong and that an increase in interest rates at the next policy decision meeting should remain in the cards 
According to this FOMC member  with the right to vote   the final decision would depend on the data  but my forecasts  and the risks around those forecasts  suggest we still want to see gradually rising interest rates   Mester told Bloomberg in an interview   March should be on the table  We want to have a full discussion of the options  
Fed governor Jerome Power also stated on Friday that the fact that the central bank s decisions were data driven was  likely to surprise markets from time to time

160187,381703,BIDU,Global funds tiptoe from share slump into China s  new economy  firms ,news,"By Nichola Saminather
SINGAPORE  Reuters    Global funds are cautiously venturing back into Chinese equities after prices collapsed to 4 1 2 year lows in February  taking advantage of cheaper valuations to buy stocks they believe will benefit from China s shift to a consumption led economy 
Foreign investors are tentatively buying in sectors linked to the main themes of the 13th Five Year Plan released earlier this month  including urbanization  consumption  internet growth  green development and innovation 
The MSCI China index has gained 17 percent since Feb  12 and while foreign investors are still net sellers the scale of net selling has shrunk to  272 million from March 1 to March 25 versus an average of  2 1 billion over the previous four months  according to EPFR Global data 
Most investors are focusing on specific  new economy  industries  which make up only a small proportion of the market  while avoiding those sectors linked to the  old economy  
 China s transition to a consumption and service led economy is likely to be a bit painful  and it s worse for the stock market because 70 80 percent of the market is highly dependent on the infrastructure and investment led economy   said Tan Eng Teck  senior portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management in Singapore 
 But the remaining 20 30 percent is growing  and we like those sectors because they re in a multi year growth phase  
Beijing s five year plan aims to create at least 10 million urban jobs  boost research and development investment to 2 5 percent of gross domestic product by 2020  develop alternative energy sources and reduce emissions  and expand internet penetration 
Tan s prefered sectors include tourism  insurance  environment and healthcare  Among the biggest holdings in Nikko s China equity fund and Shenton Greater China Fund are Ping An Insurance   internet firm Tencent  HK 0700  and China Traditional Chinese Medicine Co   HK 0570  
M G Investments combines the internet and consumption growth themes  with recent purchases including an online travel agency listed in the U S   said Matthew Vaight  M G portfolio manager for global emerging markets in London 
Internet firm Baidu  O BIDU  and mobile operator China Unicom  HK 0762  are among the top 10 holdings of M G s Global Emerging Markets fund 
However  Vaight cautions that some  new economy  stocks are overvalued  and sees opportunities for value investors in  relatively dull but under appreciated areas of the market   such as some packaging and plastic pipe companies 
Banks and commodity sectors are seen as value traps  Vaight warns that banks are keeping many struggling  old economy  companies going when they should not 
Tan cautions overcapacity in commodities sectors such as steel and aluminium means that prices  despite very low valuations  could yet fall further 
Barings Asset Management also favors  beneficiaries of rising consumption and technological outfitting as Chinese companies move up the value chain   investment director William Fong said in a note last month 
For instance  Barings is investing in China s population expansion and improving environmental standards through a utility company that supplies water to Hong Kong  Shenzen and Dongguan  he said

The company s initial public offering raised  75 million after its American Depository Shares were priced at  10 each  the midpoint of the expected range of  9  11 
Yirendai  founded in 2012  is growing rapidly by filling a demand for credit from individuals who find it difficult to obtain loans from traditional Chinese lenders

The company  which has about 6 7 million registered users  says it facilitated  984 million of loans in the nine months ended Sept  30  up from  41 million in all of 2013

The result comes as Zomato seeks  200 million in funding  a source close to the group said  in an increasingly tough environment for start ups

Zomato is set to start its  200 million funding round in April  the source close to the company said  adding it is in discussions with Chinese internet conglomerates  Alibaba   N BABA  Group and Baidu Inc  O BIDU  for investments  The source declined to be identified because the discussions are private

160228,381744,BIDU,Wary investors eye China s back door entry into MSCI indexes,news,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Michelle Price HONG KONG  Reuters    MSCI  N MSCI  will begin to add overseas listed Chinese shares to its emerging market indexes this month  drawing billions of dollars into such stocks  which could eventually lead to mainland listed companies finding their way into global equity portfolios  The index provider s decision in June not to include domestically listed China stocks  known as A shares  in its global indexes  which are tracked by equity funds holding trillions of dollars  contributed to a sharp sell off  prompting Chinese authorities to launch a heavy handed rescue operation  The inclusion of overseas listed China shares  known as American Depositary Receipts  ADR   will be the first test of foreign demand for greater exposure to China since its markets returned to an even keel after a stormy summer  Beijing wants to encourage more overseas capital into the mainland s financial markets  but foreign investors took a dim view of the market distortion caused by the government directed intervention  Chinese shares listed on overseas markets  however  are not affected by such measures   Not only do they offer a great way to get into China businesses that are geared towards the consumption story   but also  being listed in the U S  means they are prevented from the kind of manipulation we have seen in the China markets over the summer   said Marc Chandler  global head of FX strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman  Analysts estimate the index rebalancing will trigger up to  70 billion in total flows into these stocks over the next six months and increase China s weight in the MSCI Emerging Market  MSCI EM  index  which only includes Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong  to more than 26 percent from just over 23 percent  NEW ECONOMY STOCKS Investors welcomed the move  which will give them exposure to U S  listed tech giants like  Alibaba   N BABA  and Baidu  O BIDU   which are more geared to China s domestic consumption  which is still rising even as other parts of the economy  such as manufacturing  struggle   These are new economy  creative companies  and investors will be excited about that  in stark contrast to many Chinese listed shares that are more traditional state owned enterprise type firms   said Arthur Kwong  head of Asia Pacific equities at fund manager  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  Investment Partners in Hong Kong  who manages  1 8 billion in assets  About a tenth of the potential  70 billion investment would flow in automatically via passive funds that track the indexes  but the rest depends on active fund managers  who are more circumspect after the events of the summer and wary of China s slowing economy  About  1 6 trillion tracks the MSCI EM index  which is going to be most affected by the ADR inclusion   A lot of investors we speak to are watching this development very closely from the sidelines on what will be the ultimate impact for investors   said the head of global index strategy and ETF research at a European Bank in Hong Kong  Some investors might buy stocks that will be included in anticipation of the extra demand  but he said he had not seen any substantial flows so far  MSCI will be the first index compiler to make such a move  and some market strategists say it could be a significant step towards the inclusion of mainland listed stocks  For the MSCI EM index  the inclusion of Chinese ADRs will reduce the weighting of stocks listed in India  Taiwan and Korea  which can therefore expect to see some selling  The inclusion of ADRs in the second most affected index  the MSCI China Index  which tracks Hong Kong listed Chinese companies and Shanghai and Shenzhen shares traded in U S  and Hong Kong dollars  will come largely at the expense of financials  including ICBC  601398 SS   Bank of China  601988 SS  and China Construction Bank  601939 SS

160242,381758,BIDU,Why Is Baidu  BIDU  Stock Down Today  ,opinion,"Shares of Chinese internet search giant Baidu Inc    NASDAQ BIDU   fell about 3 2  in morning trading Tuesday following a handful of new reports about the company  While some investors will be interested in Baidu s possible new sports venture  others are more concerned about two harsh pieces of regulatory criticism that have hit the company this week 
Let s first start with Baidu s potential entrance into the world of professional sports  According to   Baidu has purchased the Italian soccer team AC Milan for an estimated  437 million  The deal is expected to be for at least a majority stake in the team 
This move would definitely be an eye raiser from Baidu  a company with no prior experience in the sports world  While Chinese competitor Alibaba   NYSE BABA   established a sports media group last year  Baidu has not yet indicated what it plans do with its new sports team   
Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced his intention to transform China into a global soccer powerhouse by 2050  a long term project for a country that hasn t had a historic interest in the sport  Nevertheless  soccer has grown in popularity in China over the past several years as teams from the Chinese Super League have showed a new interest in making big money signings of foreign stars 
It s unclear exactly what Baidu would do with the team  and it is uncertain whether the reports of the deal are even true  According to   Baidu denied that the company  or its Chairman Li Yanhong  are involved in the deal to buy the team  However  former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  whose family currently controls the team  insists that a Chinese group is close to a purchase 
In other news  regulatory forces seem to be cracking down on Baidu in a tough way  As  reports  China s internet regulator is launching an investigation into Baidu after media reports claimed that illegal gambling websites used the search engine to advertise themselves 
This regulatory probe comes in the wake of last month s news that China was increasing its regulatory oversight on search engines following the death of a 21 year old college student that died after seeking medical treatment that was advertised on Baidu 
Increased regulatory oversight from a country already notorious for its control of mass communication is certainly not good news for China s largest search engine 
Furthermore  Baidu is receiving flak from investors concerning the sale of its video unit to a group led by Chairman Li  Private Investment firm Acacia Partners LP  which owns over 2 6 million shares of Baidu  is accusing the company of considering an offer for Baidu s video streaming service that is  far too low  
Acacia is citing valuations for the video unit of  5 8 billion  while Li s group offered just  2 8 billion  Baidu has not yet confirmed or denied the offer ",2016-07-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-baidu-(bidu)-stock-down-today-200142767,200142767

160257,381773,BIDU,Uber to enter 100 more Chinese cities in next 12 months  CEO,news,"By Jake Spring
BEIJING  Reuters    U S  ride hailing service Uber Technologies Inc  UBER UL  will enter 100 more Chinese cities over the next year  doubling a previous goal set just three months ago  Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said on Tuesday 
Uber s China unit currently operates in almost 20 cities  Kalanick said at an event in Beijing held by Uber investor Baidu Inc  O BIDU  
The speech comes a day after Kalanick said the China unit had raised  1 2 billion during ongoing fundraising  while people familiar with the matter told Reuters that larger local rival Didi Kuaidi had brought in  3 billion 
The two firms are spending heavily to subsidize rides and gain market share  betting on China s Internet linked transport market becoming the world s biggest and most lucrative 
 When we started this year  we were about one percent market share  Today  nine months later  we re looking at about 30 to 35 percent market share   Kalanick said  He did not specify whether that market was for all ride hailing services including taxis  where Didi Kuaidi dominates  or just for private cars 
Uber also welcomes new regulations expected later this year governing ride hailing services in China  Kalanick said 
At the event  Baidu  China s Internet search leader  demonstrated a voice operated artificial intelligence smartphone assistant for finding nearby offline services  which could also control a robot reminiscent of Disney s WALL E 
After the Baidu slot  Kalanick spoke of the importance of Uber s relationship with the Internet firm 
 We can get introductions to the city governments  the government officials that want to shepherd our kind of innovation and our kind of progress into their cities   he said 
During the speech  Kalanick adopted the language of Chinese officialdom  riffing on favored Communist Party subjects such as harmony and stability 

 Progress is something we see the government be incredibly open to  whether it be about more jobs and less pollution  less congestion on the streets  better utilization of infrastructure  that kind of progress always has to be in harmony with stability and that is one of the big things that we partnered with the government on   he said ",2015-09-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/uber-to-enter-100-more-chinese-cities-in-next-12-months:-ceo-360461,360461

Markets were closed on the last two days of the trading week because of the Dragon Boat Festival Holiday  During the holiday shortened trading week  investors switched their focus to the state of the economy  Trade balance figures suggested that exports had stabilized  However  investors continued to remain wary since this did not immediately imply that a bull run would follow

The Shanghai Composite index rebounded on Tuesday  gaining 0 3   Meanwhile  volatility jumped to a three month high ahead of MSCI s call over including mainland stocks into its global indexes  Disappointing fixed asset investment data and an aversion for Asian stocks ahead of the Brexit vote added to the volatility for the day

The Shenzhen Composite Index jumped 3 1  and the small cap heavy ChiNext index surged 3 4  following speculation that a date for the commencement of the trading link with Hong Kong will soon be announced  Market watchers felt that the start date for the trading link would be brought forward in order to negate the effect of MSCI s decision    
The Shanghai Composite Index declined 0 5  on Thursday as investors dumped risky assets amid fears about global growth and the fallout of a possible pro Brexit vote next week  Meanwhile  chances of the Fed hiking rates this year declined after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the referendum on Britain s relationship with the EU was a major reason behind the decision not to raise rates  The Hang Seng declined 2 1   Meanwhile  the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slumped 2 3  after only two stocks ended in the green

Baidu  Inc  lowered its revenue guidance for the second quarter of 2016  Following this announcement  the company s shares fell more than 5  in after hours trading on Jun 14 to  163 55 
The Internet giant now expects second quarter sales in the range of RMB18 100 billion   2 807 billion  to RMB18 200 billion   2 823 billion   down from its earlier view of RMB20 110 billion   3 119 billion  to RMB20 580 billion   3 192 billion  
Management said that the guidance cut was on account of two reasons  First  increased scrutiny into healthcare and related ads by regulatory authorities has led to a reduction or delay in spend from a large number of Baidu s medical customers  This will likely impact its sales in the near term  However  the company expects these new regulations to bring in more transparency and build trust among Baidu users  thus increasing profits in the long run 
Second  Baidu has reduced the number of sponsored links across the platform  which will definitely hurt its advertising revenue and thereby impact total revenue over the short term  However  better standards related to customer requirements and sponsored links will enhance user experience and benefit Baidu going forward

If the report is correct  Ant Financial is now the second largest shareholder in Shanghai Suntime  after the data provider s Chairman Liao Bing  The new move could add a wide gamut of financial products to Alibaba s portfolio  helping it to fetch more revenues  It will also push the company to expand beyond e commerce

160298,381814,BIDU,J M  Smucker  Baidu  Altria Group  Reynolds American And Philip Morris International Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 17  2016    highlights J M  Smucker Company    as the Bull of the Day and  Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU      as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Altria Group  NYSE MO  Inc      Reynolds American Inc  NYSE RAI      and Philip Morris International Inc  NYSE PM       

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

The J M  Smucker Company    just reported one of the best years in the company s history  But the good times are expected to keep going 

This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is forecast to see double digit earnings growth again in fiscal 2016 

Founded 120 years ago  Smucker makes some of the most iconic consumer food and beverage products in America  Its well known brands include Smucker s  Folgers  Jif  Crisco  Pillsbury  Hungry Jack and others 

It also makes pet food and pet snacks including the famous brands Meow Mix  Milk Bone  Kibbles  n Bits  Natural Balance and 9Lives 

Huge Earnings Beat in the Fiscal Fourth Quarter of 2016

On June 9  Smucker reported its fiscal fourth quarter 2016 earnings and blew away the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 56   Earnings were  1 86 compared to the consensus of  1 19 

Net sales rose 25  thanks to the contribution from Big Heart Pet Brands which had been acquired in the fourth quarter of the prior year  But growth of US retail coffee also boosted the quarter 

The company saw record sales  earnings and cash flow for the full year 

Strong Growth Expected to Continue

The company is bullish on fiscal 2017  It is looking to have another record year thanks to its sponsorship of the US Olympic and Paralympic Teams in Rio as well as the synergies from its recent acquisitions  including the Big Heart Pet Brands 

The analysts are agreeing as the estimates have jumped for both fiscal 2017 and 2018 

5 estimates were raised for fiscal 2017 in the last week  pushing the Zacks Consensus up to  7 70 from  6 39  That s eanrings growth of 17  

4 also moved higher for fiscal 2018  with another 5 5  earnings growth expected 

Shares at New All Time Highs

Since the Great Recession  the shares have been on a fantastic run  They hit new all time highs on the recent earnings beat and solid guidance 



  



Baidu Inc     recently lowered full year guidance  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is seeing a revenue shortfall as healthcare providers hold back on advertising 

Baidu is China s largest Internet search provider 

Revenue Guidance Cut

On June 13  Baidu surprised Wall Street by cutting its second quarter revenue guidance to a range of  2 807 billion to  2 823 billion from the prior guidance of  3 119 billion to  3 192 billion 

Healthcare providers have delayed advertising while they wait for clarity on recent regulatory actions 

Baidu itself has also taken steps to implement new measures requested by regulatory authorities  such as modifying paid search practices 

Healthcare accounts for about 20  of search revenue 

Estimates Cut

The analysts responded by cutting their earnings estimates for this year and next 

2 cut for 2016 which lowered the Zacks Consensus Estimate to  4 85 from  5 51 

3 estimates were cut for 2017 as well  The 2017 Zacks Consensus fell to  6 98 from  7 61 in the last 7 days  That s still year over year earnings growth of 43   however 

While Wall Street was surprised that the regulatory review was taking this long  its not expected to impact Baidu for the long term 

Baidu continues to be the top Internet search portal  Once the regulations are clarified  the healthcare companies really have nowhere else to advertise so they will return  It s just a short term slowdown  not a fundamental change to the business

Altria vs  Reynolds  Tobacco Stocks on Fire

The U S  market is on a roller coaster ride with recent events spiking up volatility  Speculation surrounding the Fed rate hike and volatile gasoline prices triggered by  critical  gas supply are now accompanied by the debate on  Brexit  

Uncertainties Persist  Brexit Fear and Fed Decision 

The recent buzzword in the global economy is Brexit or Britain s exit from the European Union  Recent polls indicate that the  Leave  campaign is stronger than  Remain   A Brexit will start a long and complicated process resulting in a fundamental change in U K  s relationship with the other EU members  This is also expected to increase the cost of trade and services for Britain across international borders  For the world economy  Brexit may be followed by prolonged uncertainty that could dent growth and trigger losses in the global financial market 

Meanwhile  the Fed did not increase interest rates in its recently concluded two day long meeting following lower than expected U S  non farm payroll data  Moreover  the upcoming Presidential elections are likely to stall Fed s decision of raising the interest rate until Nov 2016 

The looming uncertainty has made investors jittery about investing in high risk profile stocks  Moreover  they are resorting to government bonds and gold  But little did anyone guess that tobacco would send smoke signals of safety in investment 

Tobacco  A Safe Haven

Even though a little unorthodox  tobacco seems to be a relatively safer sector to invest in at present  These companies stand to benefit from the addictive nature of tobacco  Smoking rates have  in general  been declining in the developed countries  while rising in the developing ones  This figure is expected to grow and translate into steady sales and attractive yields for investors 

Let us consider two tobacco stocks   Altria Group Inc     and Reynolds American Inc      with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    and decide on the one to bank on in this volatile market 

Altria s Start to FY16 

Altria made a strong start to fiscal 2016 with both its top  and bottom lines improving year over year backed by higher shipments and retail share gains by its flagship brand Marlboro  Supported by lower excise tax  gross profit and operating income increased year over year during the period 

Altria upgraded its shopping website      which provides engaging content directly to adult smokers through mobile devices  Further  in first quarter 2016  PM USA  the subsidiary of Altria expanded the distribution of Marlboro Midnight Menthol nationally  offering adult smokers a strong menthol flavor  The variant has already received favorable response in the test market  These initiatives helped Marlboro gain a leadership 

Further  during the quarter  Altria s subsidiary Nu Mark LLC  Nu Mark  stepped up the distribution of MarkTen XL and Green Smoke e vapor products across several lead markets  Altria s joint venture with Philip Morris International Inc      to develop a modified risk tobacco product is on track and the companies are scheduled to submit application for launching the product to the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  by the end of 2016 

How is 2016 Going for Reynolds  

Reynolds also reported higher year over year earnings and sales in first quarter 2016 backed by increased cigarette and moist snuff pricing  It s impressive brand portfolio of tobacco products helps it to maintain strong business momentum and generate decent profits  Further  the company invests continuously in innovation and brand building  which have helped it to maintain its leading position in the industry 

What do the Numbers Say

In terms of share price  Altria is racing ahead with a 12 23  appreciation year to date in 2016 against Reynold s appreciation of almost 11 79  

However  with regard to long term growth  Reynolds seems to have the lead  Its estimated long term growth rate is 12 20   which is way ahead the industry growth rate of 9 10   Also  it is better than Altria s long term growth rate of 7 5   which is behind the industry growth rate 

As per our   Altria has better growth prospects than Reynolds  Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company s financial statement to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth  Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space 

Altria has a Growth Style Score of  A  while Reynolds carries a Growth Style Score of  D  

But both stocks are overvalued as is evident from their unfavorable P E and P S ratios compared with the homebuilding industry 

Reynolds  P E ratio is 21 50 while that of Altria is 21 41  On the other hand  the P E ratio of the industry is 19 43  Altria s P S ratio is 6 55 while that of Reynolds  is 5 66 compared to the industry average of 5 01 

Tobacco stocks reward investors with attractive yields  While Altria s dividend yields 3 46   Reynolds American has a dividend yield of 3 32

As expected  Baidu  O BIDU  reported its earnings for the fourth quarter before the opening bell today  However  what wasn t expected was the fact that the company would show strong mobile user growth  Here s what we saw from the earnings report   
Top Line Revenue   In terms of top line revenue  BIDU came in ahead of expectations  For the fourth quarter  it was expected that the company would report revenue in the amount of  2 84 billion  However  the company actually produced revenue in the amount of  2 89 billion 
Earnings Per Share   As far as earnings per share goes  the company didn t do horrible  but didn t do great either  In fact  BIDU narrowly missed analyst expectations  While analysts expected that the company would produce earnings in the amount of  1 19 per share  the company actually produced earnings in the amount of  1 18 per share 
Users   While neither earnings nor revenue were enough to really excite investors  there was one part of the report that generated quite a bit of excitement  That part of the report was mobile user growth  Mobile is the next big thing for tech  and it s arguable that tech companies in some ways are gauged by the amount of mobile users they have  In the case of BIDU  mobile active monthly users grew in a big way year over year  In fact  year over year growth in the figure was up 21   now totaling 657 million  Also when it comes to mobile apps monthly active users  we saw year over year growth in the amount of 43  
All in all  as you can see from the information above  BIDU had an incredibly positive report  Revenue beat  earnings came in just under expectations and mobile users skyrocketed  In a statement  BIDU CEO  Yanhong Li had the following to say   
 2015 was a touchstone year for Baidu  we made significant progress in broadening our online marketing platform and further extending our reach into transactions services  
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we ve learned that any time positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see growth in the value of that company s stock  While earnings and revenue weren t quite enough to excite investors  mobile users growth definitely was  and that excitement led to strong growth in the stock today  Currently  10 49   BIDU is trading at  173 55 per share after a gain of  15 33 per share or 9 69  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively bullish expectation of what we can expect to see from Baidu  The reality is that the company is seeing tremendous growth in mobile users and branching into more and more industries that are likely to lead to strong profits in the long run  All in all  I believe we re going to see strong growth from BIDU moving forward ",2016-02-26,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baidu-(bidu)-stock-soars-on-earnings-|-what-to-expect-moving-forward-200119634,200119634

Baidu is the clear leader in Chinese search and is also emerging as a major player in mobile and video technology
Baidu is scheduled to report first quarter earnings today  Thursday  after the market closes  Baidu is commonly referred to as China s Google  as it controls a dominant position in search engine traffic in the region  Like Google  Baidu has successfully pursued ventures outside of its core search business including online video and recently  self driving cars  Search continues to be the company s biggest growth driver  both through its mobile app and desktop platform 
Given its stranglehold on the space  it s not surprising that Baidu continues to top expectations  In fact  the company has beat on both the top and bottom line in each of the past 2 quarters  Last quarter was highlighted by increases in key areas such as monthly active users  mobile users  revenues and operating profits  Mobile search MAUs equaled 657 million for the quarter ending in December  reflecting a 21  increase from the year prior  Unfortunately  Baidu s robust growth has not translated to the market  In the past 12 months  shares of the search giant have dropped 13 1  
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 81 on  2 30 billion  3 cents higher that Wall Street on the bottom line and  8 million on the top  Since its last report  EPS estimates have come down 24  with sales dropping 13   Compared to a year earlier  profits are expected to fall 33  while revenue could rise as much 13   
Baidu is the clear leader in the Chinese search segment  but like its peers in U S  they have begun to expand their offerings  Mobile and video technology have been Baidu s fastest growing segments  The company has continued its policy of spinning off promising business units and its video business has been no different  The independent Baidu Video service recently raised  155 million with the hopes that it could reach YouTube s status in China  Meanwhile  mobile technologies continue to be its fastest growing segment  Baidu has already made substantial investments to build out these offerings and will continue to do so over the next three years  Baidu s biggest news however  was their announcement that they would be opening a self driving car unit right in Silicon Valley 
That said  Baidu faces a number of risks to earnings  which is apparent from the downward revisions for Q1  including higher promotional expenses  heavy spending on mobile and video  and increasing competition for its search platform  While Baidu remains the largest player in the space  they have lost some market share to Qihoo 360  NYSE QIHU   which entered the market in 2012 ",2016-04-28,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-strong-q1-earnings-boost-baidu-share-prices-200126667,200126667

Despite general weakness in China  Alibaba has consistently delivered robust growth in many of its key metrics  Alibaba was early to capture a stake in the Chinese e commerce space and hasn t looked back since

160363,381879,BIDU,2 Ways To Play Chinese Growth Now,opinion,"The  recently featured an article about the silver lining in Chinese growth  Even though the GDP growth rate had fallen below 7  to 6 9   there was evidence of rebalancing away from the same old same old lending based model of infrastructure spending to the household sector  emphasis added  
There is robust growth in China if you know where to look  some contrarian investors believe  Monday s gross domestic product report offered the latest sign that the world s second largest economy is slowing  But the gloom is overdone  said some portfolio managers who are focusing on the nation s booming service sector 

Their purchases amount to a bet on Beijing s efforts to engineer an economic rebalancing  toward a consumer led  service driven economy from one dominated by manufacturing and trade  While slowing Chinese economic growth and declines in the country s use of materials such as copper  nickel and cement have rippled through financial markets  some traders say some less publicized metrics paint a more upbeat picture 
To name a few  box office sales are up more than 50  this year  Internet traffic through mobile devices has nearly doubled and railway passenger traffic and civil aviation are increasing steadily  government data show 
The most recent numbers highlighted the Chinese economy s increasingly dual nature  China reported its economy expanded at a 6 9  annual rate in the third quarter  its slowest pace since the global financial crisis  At the same time  the services sector expanded 8 4   accounting for more than half of China s GDP growth for the first time  according to official statistics 

For years  US investors have either bought iShares China Large Cap  N FXI  or commodity related vehicles as a way to play Chinese growth  Now that there is growing evidence of growth rebalancing  those vehicles may not be the most appropriate anymore 
Consider this chart of two  New China  vs   Old China  pairs  New China  Global X China Consumer  N CHIQ  Global X China Financials  N CHIX   Old China PowerShares Golden Dragon China Portfolio  N PGJ  FXI   

 The first is a long position in PGJ vs  a short position in FXI which is depicted in black  The Golden Dragons Index is far more heavily weighted in consumer services and technology  which are also consumer e commerce oriented  think Baidu  O BIDU   etc    while the FTSE China 50 Index is tilted towards financials  which represent  Old China  finance and infrastructure plays 
The second pair is a long position in CHIQ  Global X China Consumer ETF  and a short position in CHIX  Global X China Financials ETF  depicted in green 
In both cases  these pairs tell the story of progress of growth rebalancing towards the consumer sector of the economy  Even if you don t want exposure to China  monitoring these pairs is a useful way of seeing how rebalancing is progressing in real time

Commentary
The S P 500  SPDR S P 500  N SPY   started November with another strong showing as the index picks up where it left off with October s extraordinary performance  It closed with a 1 2  gain and a level last seen during the heights of August  Incredibly  the index can now see fresh all time closing highs just over the horizon  2130 82  

The S P 500  SPY  has produced a steady and very bullish staircase pattern onward and upward toward fresh all time highs 
Despite this strong and bullish breakout  I cannot flip the trading bias from neutral to bullish  T2108  my favorite indicator  closed at 67 5   So it is STILL churning below overbought territory and indicating that the on going rally is not able to push new stocks over the hump  This churn is closing in on one month in duration  I am patiently waiting to see how the market behaves once this occurs  will the market finally lose momentum and reverse or will it get new life and launch into one of those epic oversold rallies 
T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  is more interesting  While T2108 has stalled  T2107 has marched along with the S P 500  It is a slower moving index that has just now reversed all the angst from August  At 36 0   T2107 is at a 2  month high  Left in the rearview mirror are a W bottom and a 50DMA breakout that defines the end of a primary downtrend 

The percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs is progressing along with the S P 500  This indicates that a lot of healing is still happening well below the surface of the market 
The volatility index  the VIX  continues along its own path of churn  It continues to trade just below the 15 35 pivot  In this position  it is not providing any clues to future direction  The VIX s stasis mainly confirms the market s general state of contentment  Oh how the August Angst is such a distant memory 
Caterpillar  N CAT  is one of the most bullish developments among the stocks I follow  As readers know  I like to buy put options against CAT as a hedge on bullishness  When CAT is powering higher  I consider it a confirmation of bullishness  I blinked and suddenly realized that CAT broke out above its 50DMA and is now following through 

Caterpillar  CAT  is breaking out  It has left the disastrous post earnings gap down far behind 
Some additional charts to consider while waiting for resolution of this tap dance with overbought status 

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  O IBB  confirmed its 50DMA breakout and apparently will not provide a dip to its 20DMA as my next buying opportunity

LinkedIn  N LNKD  clears the hurdle again  October earnings closed the gap from July earnings and formed a 200DMA breakout 

Rackspace Hosting  Inc   N RAX  is starting to turn the corner  Last year s M A talk is long forgotten  this could be the time to grab a steal under the radar 

It STILL hurts to have no Baidu  O BIDU  in my pockets  A 200DMA breakout that closes the previous earnings gap down adds insult to injury 
My bonus chart is McDonald s  N MCD   A little over a year ago I suggested accumulating shares of McDonald s to take advantage of all the negativity surrounding the venerable chain at the time  It was very fashionable to talk about   The menu was stale and unappealing for the more hip youth of today  Behind the times  Etc  etc One new CEO later and here is MCD making a very bullish breakout to new all time highs 

Who said McDonald s was dead

We should breakout towards 212 50 Monday at the latest and then I ll have to reassess the action at 212 50 and decide to either lock in gains in anticipation of another small correction or if all goes well  we will setup to breakout on very high volume and spark the next major rally in this ongoing bull market ",2015-11-20,Warren Bevan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/v-bottom-these-are-my-thoughts-271976,271976
160366,381882,BIDU,China s Equity Market Stabilizes,opinion,"Investors in China equities have been on a roller coaster ride this year  The Shanghai market soared 60  to a seven year high in mid June and then tumbled 43  over the following two months to a trough reached on August 26th  Since then there have been periods of recovery followed by reversals  However  a number of recent developments have improved prospects going forward 
The overall slowdown in the Chinese economy is looking more moderate than many have feared  Third quarter GDP growth was 6 9  year on year  The annual figure for 2015 is likely to be 6 8   The government is guiding the economy through a major transition from a heavy emphasis on exports and industrial growth towards increased emphasis on domestic consumption  services  and movement up the value chain  The results are evident in the strong 8 6 annual growth in the services sector and accelerating retail sales fueled by robust wage growth  These factors account for the surprisingly strong GDP growth despite the manufacturing industry s continued overall weakening and a sharp decline in fixed asset investment  Both fiscal and monetary policy are said to be directed at assuring that growth is maintained close to the current rate and not less than the 6 5  officials say is needed  But an outcome closer to 6  looks likely in view of the headwinds still facing the economy  which include continued excess capacity  excess supply in the real estate sector  high corporate and local government debt burdens  and export weakness 
A positive development was the announcement by the International Monetary Fund  IMF  that its staff has concluded that China meets the requirements to have its currency  the yuan  added to the IMF s Special Drawing Rights  SDR  basket  joining the dollar  yen  euro  and pound  In doing so  the IMF staff judged that the yuan is  freely usable  and that all the operational issues raised by the staff in July have been addressed  Final approval by the IMF board on November 30th is assured  The new SDR basket will come into effect next September  This action by the IMF means the yuan will have the elite status of a  reserve currency   However  the yuan s actual use as a reserve asset  now limited to an estimated 1  of total global reserves  is expected to increase only very gradually  The near term effects will be the increased prestige and standing of the Chinese economy and the recognition that China has become more closely integrated into the global economy 
China s capital outflows  which surged after China devalued its currency moderately in August  reversed in October  signaling some success in China s efforts to restore investor confidence  The central bank reported an increase in foreign exchange reserves  Another positive signal was the November 6th announcement by the China Securities and Regulatory Commission  CSRC  that it has lifted its four month embargo on IPOs  This move appears to reflect Beijing s growing confidence that markets may have finally stabilized after the government s unprecedented  and in our view rather ham fisted   rescue efforts in response to the market meltdown that started in early summer  Having taken this step  the CSRC is unlikely to extend its ban on stock sales by shareholders with more than 5  stakes beyond the ban s scheduled January 8 end date  This evidence of CSRC confidence in the market s stabilization is a positive consideration  which investors need to balance against the prospect of greater equity supply coming onto the market 
As the Chinese equity market seeks to recover in fits and starts from its August 26th trough  the major China ETFs are showing great diversity in performance  We will look at just the top ten  ranked by assets under management  AUM   of the 31 China ETFs available to US investors  TheiShares China Large Cap  N FXI   has by far the largest AUM  almost  6 billion  and includes only the 50 largest and most liquid Hong Kong listed Chinese companies  It has declined 2 63  during the past month and is still down 8 14  for the year to date  YTD  through November 19th  The iShares MSCI China  N MCHI   has the largest AUM among the total market China ETFs  almost  2 billion  It holds so called H shares  P chips  and red chips of Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong but has not been able to hold N shares listed in the US  This is about to change  as MSCI has announced that starting next month it will include companies in its indices according to the countries they operate in rather than just by the countries in which they are listed  In the case of the MSCI China ETF  this change means that at least 14 important  US listed Chinese consumer and tech firms  including Alibaba  N BABA  and Baidu Inc  O BIDU   will be included in MCHI  This ETF is down 1 23  for the past month and 4 86  YTD  The SPDR S P China  N GXC   does include N shares  and this structure is reflected in their better performance  up 2 28  over the past month but still down 2 67  YTD 
The PowerShares Golden Dragon China Port  N PGJ   has a very different approach  as it holds only N shares  This restriction to just companies listed in the US means that the four largest Chinese state owned banks are not included and the ETF is heavily weighted towards consumer and tech companies  Its performance is also very different  up 10 96  over the past month and 13 46  YTD  Among the top ten Chinese ETFs  this performance is exceeded only by the KraneShares CSI China Internet  O KWEB   the biggest China technology ETF  which selects holdings from all investable Chinese shares  including A shares listed in the mainland China markets  It is up 12 52  over the past month and a remarkable 15 25  YTD  Note that KWEB does trade at wide spreads  Another alternative is the Guggenheim Invest China Small Cap  N HAO   which is up 0 86  over the past month but down 0 96  YTD  Focusing on consumer cyclicals has produced somewhat better results  the Global X China Consumer  N CHIQ   registered a 3 88  over the past month and is up 6 10  YTD 
For investors wishing to focus on the mainland China markets  the largest ETF that invests just in A shares is the Deutsche X trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A Shares  N ASHR   It is up 9 74  over the past month but just 2 07  YTD  But for investors that have held the ETF for 12 months  the return is 38 56   That compares with a 12 month return for MCHI of a mere 0 12   The other A share ETC in the top ten is the Market Vectors ChinaAMC A Share  N PEK   which is up 11 25  over the past month and 4 61  YTD ",2015-11-22,Bill Witherell,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china's-equity-market-stabilizes-272114,272114

160391,381907,BIDU,At China online coming out party  Beijing spells out Internet control ambition,news,"By Paul Carsten WUZHEN  China  Reuters    China showed governments and the planet s biggest tech firms last week its vision for global Internet governance   clean  controlled and choreographed 
Public officials and firms worth  2 5 trillion in market value  from Apple Inc to Facebook Inc  got first hand exposure in the postcard perfect town of Wuzhen as China showcased its first  World Internet Conference   WIC  
 This place  Wuzhen  is crowded with tourists  who are perfectly orderly   Lu Wei  China s Internet czar and director of the Cyberspace Administration of China  said at the opening ceremony   Cyberspace should also be free and open  with rules to follow and always following the rule of law  
Many attendants saw China hosting the summit as a step forward  Yet for skeptics  the controlled environment of the summit reinforced industry concerns that Beijing s lip service to a  free and open  Internet rings hollow  with the government s iron grip on the online industry intact 
At a summit hosted by government leaders  nothing was left to chance and reporters were not allowed to ask questions directly in numerous events  a common practice at industry conferences in China 
After one panel discussion was filmed with an official moderator  state media reporters were then given the cue to address empty chairs on a podium as cameras rolled 
That footage was set to be spliced into the TV broadcast of the panel  featuring big industry names  in late November  said a person with direct knowledge of the matter  giving the impression that the reporters had carried out a dialogue with the industry leaders 
Telephone calls to state broadcaster CCTV  which the person with knowledge said was meant to broadcast the show  met with refusals to make officials available to comment 
Everything displayed at Wuzhen  about 120 kilometers  75 miles  southwest of Shanghai  was meant to convey a specific message to the international community  attendees said 
China s leaders spoke of an Internet that should be free and open   and controlled on its own terms 
 China has made  at the top level  a decision that it needs to be part of a global Internet   said Fadi Chehade  president and chief executive of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers  a non profit organization which manages the infrastructure of the Internet 
 China is also telling the world    We re no longer going to be bystanders in how the Internet is governed    Chehade said 
The country has the world s largest population of Internet users  more than 630 million  Chinese firms like Tencent Holdings Ltd  Baidu Inc and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd are in the world s top 10 online companies by market value 
Increased sway over the global Internet could also help Beijing promote its economic policy interests  as the private Chinese online heavyweights that play by its rules make more investments abroad 
 GREAT FIREWALL 
 China wants to participate further in Internet governance and also in a certain sense it wants to advocate the China model of Internet regulation  including Internet control and censorship   said Fu King Wa  an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong s Journalism and Media Studies Centre 
China has the world s most sophisticated online censorship system  known elsewhere as the  Great Firewall   a degree of control reflected in Wuzhen itself 
The University of Hong Kong s Fu said comments on the WIC on Chinese social media were censored  Authorities also detained a small group of students demonstrating outside the town seeking access to Facebook  attendees said 
Conference organizers didn t immediately respond to questions about censorship surrounding the event 
WIC guests were often able to use websites not usually accessible in China  But that openness did not extend off line 
 Please do not ask questions to guests during sessions in order not to cause disturbances   the WIC s media handbook said 
Summit staff  many of whom wore tracksuits similar to Chinese school uniforms  also reflected the oddness of an event on global internet governance constrained by local concerns 

 It feels very weird   said one volunteer  sporting the summit uniform

160410,381926,BIDU,Dancing Around Oversold As China Flirts With Dysfunction,opinion,"Commentary Tuesday s trading  on July 7  2015  featured a near perfect combination of the S P 500  ARCA SPY  breaking 200DMA support as T2108 approached oversold conditions  T2108 dropped as low as 21 2  around 11 30am  Eastern   The S P 500 first broke through 200DMA support around 10 10am and again around 10 30am  The index hit its low of the day around 11 40am  This is my favorite setup for a reversal as stops get taken out at support  washing out sellers  and oversold conditions  in this case  close enough   trigger my buying rules  While I was optimistic  I was amazed that the the S P 500 actually closed UP for the day  The move put my oil related buys  purchase of CyberArk  NASDAQ CYBR   and Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  call options well into the green  I was also relieved to have closed out my put options on Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  which served as my favorite market hedge 

The close was so strong that I suppressed my urge to lock in profits on BIDU  Even the currency market was giving me some reassuring signals  If I were a true daytrader  I might have closed out everything 

As it turns out  the market angst is far from over  First  charts of the S P 500 and T2108 show the dance around the 200DMA and oversold respectively 


The S P 500 s dance around the 200DMA has tripped into a breakdown


T2108 has matched the sharp churn in the market and creeps ever closer to oversold levels
Volatility is on the edge of making a fresh run up and threatens to kill off my fade on volatility  Again  as a daytrader  the current chop would have been just fine and very profitable  Both bears and bulls have had good opportunities to cash in  Yet  it seems the bears are on the edge of winning the battle soon 

The volatility index has churned mightily  The new closing high puts bears back in charge 
The VIX has closed at a new high for this recent churn  A close above the intraday high and THEN follow through makes me a lot more bearish  On the other hand  T2108 should firmly plant itself in oversold territory at that point  My compromise on the dueling signals will be to execute the more conservative T2108 oversold strategies  wait to make the first buy when the VIX makes another large percentage move  preferably the largest of the current cycle  If no spike comes  then wait to make the first buy when T2108 first closes ABOVE oversold territory  It will be hard to execute such a strategy since my preference has always been to play oversold conditions aggressively 
The Australian dollar  NYSE FXA  versus the Japanese yen  NYSE FXY  presents another large concern  When AUD JPY confirmed its breakdown on June 26th  the S P 500 also confirmed a 50DMA breakdown  It has been all heck sine then  AUD JPY has once again become a good indicator for the S P 500 

The Japanese yen has pounded the Australian dollar into submission over the past two weeks
The most amazing thing about this chart is the speed and depth of the sell off  The selling pressure is intense and nearly unrelenting as traders have been able to keep AUD JPY below its lower Bollinger Band  BB  for long stretches  AUD JPY is immensely oversold based on the constant breaks of the lower BB  but the trend is definitely down under these conditions 
Also note how the breakdown in AUD JPY coincided in timing with the breakdown of the Shanghai Composite Index  SSEC   This is a new and surprising development and correlation that bears watching as the yen has clearly won the prize for  safety currency   In the meantime  SSEC has reached another critical juncture   200DMA support  Given the intensity of its sell off  I cannot imagine any kind of support holding for long especially when a barrage of desperate measures from the Chinese government to intervene and control its markets have utterly failed 

The Shanghai Composite Index has led the way in panic selling
 is that the government has banned major shareholders from selling stocks for SIX MONTHS  This measure is about as draconian as it gets  It makes the market extremely illiquid and extremely unattractive whenever the market opens up for real business again  At least from my outsider s perspective  China is now borderline dysfunctional  Even after our markets finally get a good oversold bounce  I will have little confidence in its sustainability given how the dysfunction from China will likely loom ever larger over financial markets 
Finally  here is a chart of the United States Oil Fund LP  NYSE USO   I have finally become convinced that sellers are panicking out of oil because of a perceived implosion in demand from China  I am sticking to the strategy outlined in earlier posts  Oil volatility continues to rise and makes me more and more bearish on oil for the short term  even as I am greedily eyeing very select oil companies to buy on the cheap amid this latest sell off   I am going to ride out my current tranche of call options on USO 

Oil s rapid sell off now puts the recent bottom in United States Oil Fund LP  USO  into play 
There are many  many other charts and follow ups that I could do  The market situation is very dynamic and fluid  so it is best that I not over commit to reading a snapshot of charts on any given day  Moreover  the U S  has now entered earnings season which layers on yet more potential for trouble and churn  I will continue to count on T2108 to assess the odds for the bear and bull cases 

Oh yeah  I did not even need to mention Greece once  The Global X FTSE Greece 20  NYSE GREK  STILL has not made a new low in this cycle  It may not even matter anymore in the larger scheme of things given the drama from China

160418,381934,BIDU,8 Things You Should Know About Alibaba s Yu E Bao,news,"By    A big money migration is under way in China  as depositors loosen their long held ties to traditional banks and start parking their hard earned money in Yu e Bao  an Internet money market fund that looks and smells pretty much like bank deposits but offers consumers higher returns than Chinese banks will 
Here are eight things you need to know 

1  What is Yu e Bao  
Yu e Bao       is an investment product offered through the Chinese e commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd  s third party payment affiliate  Alipay com Co 
Alipay began offering Yu e Bao  which means  leftover treasure   last June  Alipay users can put their money into the product  which invests in funds  There is no minimum amount  and customers can withdraw their cash anytime  Yu e Bao funds are managed by Tianhong Asset Management Co 
2  Why is everyone talking about it 
Launched just nine months ago  Yu e Bao now has more investors than China s equity markets 
The mainland s biggest online money market fund had attracted more than 81 million investors by the end of February  a figure that represents an increase of nearly 20 million users within half a month  according to Tianhong data  By comparison  China s A share market boasts about 67 million investors after 23 years of development 
Senior Chinese financial officials told the Financial Times that Yu e Bao had accumulated at least 500 billion yuan   81 billion  in deposits by the second week of March 
3  Why is investing in Yu e Bao better than putting my money in a shoebox  or in the bank  
When an ordinary demand deposit in savings accounts at major banks offers an interest rate of just 0 35 percent a year  and Yu e Bao offers an annual interest of about 6 percent and still allows depositors to withdraw their money at any time  the answer is pretty simple 
Even if investors are willing to give up the right to withdraw on demand for a year  traditional banks are subject to the government imposed upper limit of 3 3 percent interest that banks can offer on one year deposits 
4  What does Yu e Bao do with the deposits  and is this high yield sustainable 
Up to 90 percent of Yu e Bao funds are invested in interbank deposits at 29 large banks  including the big state owned ones  Interbank deposits are banks  wholesale businesses with each other 
Unless those banks default on a loan they took out from Tianhong  the investment is safe  But there is a liquidity concern 
Wang Dengfeng  a Tianhong fund manager who oversees the money market fund connected with Yu e Bao  explained in a recent interview with China s major business paper Caixin how Tianhong allocates Yu e Bao funds 
We allocate investments and match maturities based on data analysis  At different stages a bank s ability to take deposits varies  On one hand  there are banks that can only take  say  10 billion yuan  but we have 11 billion yuan that needs to be taken care of  That is when we hit the limit of their deposit taking ability  We can deal with other banks or lower the interest rates we charge  On the other hand  a larger size brings greater negotiating power  We can ask for higher interest rates 
We pay the most attention to liquidity management  So far  we have seen a net increase in Yu e Bao investment  That means we face the pressure of finding investment opportunities for new funds every day 
Aside from the seemingly ever increasing fund size  traditional banks are also lobbying to have the terms of the loan agreements changed  which could force Tianhong to either cut yields or make withdrawals more difficult  In the worst case scenario  this could trigger a run on Yu e Bao accounts 
A similar fund offered in the U S  by payments processor PayPal grew quickly when it offered a high yield but eventually closed in 2011 as investors fled when the returns dropped 
Prior to March 1  Yu e Bao s 7 day annualized return held above 6 percent  It dipped below 6 percent on the next day  and had slipped to 5 7160 percent Monday 

Tianhong was quoted in the Chinese media as saying that they have  made it clear to investors that a 6 percent yield is not the norm  it could drop further  
5  Is Yu e Bao a threat to traditional banks 
China s financial sector has long been dominated by state owned banks that have enjoyed high government guaranteed profits for years  thanks to strict controls on lending and deposit rates that have helped fund China s booming investment led growth at a high cost to savers 
Now  technology companies have begun to enter their turf by using online platforms to push innovations in the sector  Upon seeing Alibaba s success with Yu e Bao  China s Tencent Holdings Ltd  HKG 0700  and Baidu Inc   NASDAQ BIDU  have since launched similar products 
For now  funds invested into these new online financing platforms are equivalent to a little more than 1 percent of the state controlled banking sector s roughly 74 2 trillion yuan in consumer deposits  But the platforms are growing rapidly  and the story could be vastly different a mere three years from now 
A report issued in February by Chinese International Capital Corp   a domestic brokerage  said that in three years the online money market funds could manage funds comparable to 8 percent of all bank deposits and shave 0 15 percentage point from banks  net interest rate margin  which is the difference between the interest paid on deposits and the interest received on loans  Banks  average net interest margin stood at 2 68 percent at the end of 2013 
The report pointed out that at their peak  money market funds in the U S  were comparable in size to 60 percent of bank deposits as the country liberalized interest rates 
Li Lihui  the former president of Bank of China  HKG 3988   told reporters at a briefing on Monday that online finance products are speeding interest rate liberalization  He predicted that interest rates could be fully liberalized in one or two years  and that a deposit insurance program would likely be in place within one year to ensure protection in case of a bank failure as competition intensifies 
 The online funds have become a significant challenge to traditional banks   Li said   They will certainly cut into the banks  interest income   he added  that noting this is the key source of profit for most domestic banks 
Traditional banks now face the prospect of real competition from sophisticated investment platforms that are operated by some of China s most competitive private conglomerates 
6  Are the banks doing anything to fight back 
Yes  they are urging tougher supervision  launching similar products and raising their deposit interest rates  but with little success so far 
Yu e Bao and its rivals remain effectively unregulated as of now  The real constraint on their growth is the limits imposed by banks on the amount of assets that can be digitally transferred from bank accounts in a single day and a single month 
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China  HKG 1398  is limiting its depositors monthly transfers to Alipay to 50 000 yuan per month  Last month  12 Chinese banks imposed transfer limits on Tencent s Licaitong wealth management 
7  Who regulates Yu e Bao 
It is not clear  The People s Bank of China and the regulators of the securities and banking industries should all be concerned  according to Caixin  The central bank oversees Alipay  The securities regulator supervises Tianhong and the funds it manages  The banking regulator must pay attention as well because banks play a key role in Yu e Bao investment 
8  Is the Chinese government supportive of the new phenomenon 
So far  yes  Beijing appears eager to continue with rapid financial reforms  unveiled at the Third Plenum of the Communist Party last November 
In his annual  state of the union  address to China s ersatz parliament last week  Premier Li Keqiang pledged his government would  promote the healthy development of Internet banking  
Zhou Xiaochuan  governor of the People s Bank of China  told journalists last week that the regulators would not close down funds like Yu e Bao but changes in their supervision were in preparation 
 Financial business on the Internet is a new thing  so the current policy  supervision and coordination could not adapt to and need to be completed   he said   But in general  financial policy supports the application of technology  so it needs to follow the footsteps of time and technology  ",2014-03-11,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/8-things-you-should-know-about-alibaba's-yu'e-bao-271390,271390
160419,381935,BIDU,Fund managers look to make room for Alibaba,news,"By Deepa Seetharaman and Ryan Vlastelica
SAN FRANCISCO NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors are looking over portfolios to make room for Chinese e commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Inc s market debut next month   and that means some less attractive stocks that funds are holding might be shown the door 
The initial public offering  which could top  16 billion to become the largest ever IPO by a technology company  is expected as early as next month after Alibaba management kicks off a two week investor road show after the Labor Day weekend 
As investors take a hard look at their portfolios  it may trigger a veritable garage sale of names that are failing to impress Wall Street  including U S  e commerce rival Amazon com Inc  fund managers said 
 Any company that didn t meet expectations and give a rosy outlook is probably being considered as a sale candidate to make room for a name like this   said Jim O Donnell  chief investment officer of Forward  which has  5 billion in assets under management 
 There won t be wholesale turnovers of portfolios  but I imagine Amazon is being looked at   he added 
Chinese rivals like Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd also may be pressured if fund managers view Alibaba  which powers 80 percent of all online commerce in China  as a better path to tap into growth in the world s second largest economy 
Next month s roadshow is likely to attract interest from a wide range of funds  including those focused on emerging markets and technology  Alibaba may garner a valuation of  200 billion or more when it goes public  analysts say  which would make it one of the 20 biggest companies listed in U S  markets 
 It is the 8 000 pound gorilla coming for the stock market   Michael Reynal  portfolio manager at San Francisco based RS Investments  said of Alibaba 
YAHOO ARBITRAGE
How investors act also depends on whether they gain a toehold in the highly anticipated IPO at all  One topic of debate is how investors who are boxed out of the IPO will play Yahoo Inc  which holds a 22 5 percent stake in Alibaba 
The U S  web portal has struggled to reinvent its core business  but has nonetheless seen its shares more than double in the last two years on the strength of its Alibaba ties  Some investors say Yahoo Inc could be sold to clear room for Alibaba  By some measures  the company carries a high valuation  with its enterprise value to sales ratio surpassing 90 percent of the U S  stock market  according to Starmine  a Thomson Reuters company 
On the flip side  investors boxed out of Alibaba s IPO could snap up Yahoo to capitalize on the Chinese company s growth  That argument could also help buoy shares in Softbank Corp  which has a 34 percent stake in Alibaba 
 I bet a lot of people are playing Yahoo for Alibaba and once the IPO is gone  they may exit Yahoo completely   said Paul Meeks  senior analyst and portfolio manager of the  42 million Sextant Growth Fund at Saturna Capital  which has  4 billion assets under management 
 A lot of people know they re not going to get IPO shares  so they hold Yahoo and Softbank   said Mark Yusko  who manages  4 5 billion as CIO of Morgan Creek Capital Management and has invested in Alibaba through private placements   They want to capture the IPO pop  
TRADE OFFS
Alibaba s debut comes at a time of growing dissatisfaction on Wall Street for Amazon s record of thin profits and heavy spending on developing television shows and hardware initiatives including aerial drones and smart phones 
The expected boom in e commerce in China may also drive some U S  based investors in Chinese search company Baidu toward Alibaba 
More than 60 funds hold Amazon  Yahoo and Baidu shares  according to Lipper  a Thomson Reuters company  about 20 of which are target date funds from Wells Fargo and AllianceBernstein  designed to favor more conservative investments as an investor s retirement approaches 
Amazon shares have fallen about 17 percent so far this year  while shares in rival eBay Inc  which also could be sold in favor of the Chinese e commerce company  has been flat as the tech heavy Nasdaq has risen almost 9 percent 
Amazon s operating margin over the last 12 months is about 0 8 percent while for eBay  margins are roughly 20 percent  according to Thomson Reuters data  By contrast  Alibaba boasted a 47 5 percent operating margin in fiscal year 2014  ending in March  according to its IPO filing 
Still  some analysts say Amazon is not easily replaced by Alibaba because of their relative geographic strengths 
 Amazon has a stranglehold on the U S  market just as Alibaba has a stranglehold on the Chinese market   said Daniel Kurnos  analyst at Benchmark Co   It will be hard for one to penetrate the other  
In 2013  Alibaba handled more online transactions than Amazon and eBay Inc and had 231 million active buyers  or the equivalent of 17 percent of China s population

160428,381944,BIDU,Alibaba prints jumbo deal without China premium,news,"By Lianting Tu SINGAPORE  IFR    Alibaba Group Holding  N BABA  sold the largest bond by an Asian company last night via a  8 billion six tranche offering  The tight pricing achieved on the deal led many to believe the US listed Chinese ecommerce giant got away without paying a Chinese premium 
 The pricing on Alibaba s bonds did not reflect a China risk premium in our view  and was priced more like a US credit  given the solid demand from the US investor base and hype around the IPO   said Raymond Lee  Sydney based portfolio manager at Kapstream Capital  one of Australia s largest fixed income managers 
Over the course of the 24 hour three timezone bookbuilding  orders topped at US 57bn before settling at close to US 55bn  US investors anchored the trade by taking about three quarters of the notes  two sources familiar with the transaction said  The company hasn t disclosed the distribution statistics  
 It is a defining trade not just for the sheer size  but the fact that it got priced against a peer group in a developed market   said a person familiar with the matter  
Alibaba bonds priced through some of the US blue chip tech giants such as Amazon  O AMZN  and eBay  O EBAY   Its US 1 5bn 7 year tranche  priced at 115bp over Treasuries  came inside Amazon s 2022s  quoted at a G spread of 116bp  Its US 2 25bn 10 year  priced at 128bp over  also easily pierced through eBay s interpolated curve 
 The company achieved the tight pricing as it was clear in positioning away from China   the person said 
In fact  Alibaba s three  and five year tranches were priced 30bp 35bp tight to Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc and 40bp 50bp inside the country s web portal and social media leader Tencent Holdings 
Asian interest
Asian investors  whose orders exceeded US 11bn across the tranches  were allocated a mere 15  20  of the notes  the two sources said  
Asian investors generally found Alibaba bonds expensive as they have many other Chinese credits that offer higher risk adjusted premiums  According to a research note published by Nomura yesterday  Chinese credits typically pay a 20bp 50bp premium to their US peers due to the  China Discount  driven by the headline risk of the country and other technical factors 
 For the Asian credit market  the Alibaba bonds are rich although they were priced fair for the US  Alibaba is a US credit  as it s listed in the US and trades on US technicals  and unfortunately it will not provide the Asian market with a free ride premium   said Owen Gallimore  Singapore based head of credit strategy  Asia  for ANZ 
For those reasons  a number of Asian investors didn t play in Alibaba  Instead  they bought Tencent and Baidu as they believed the Alibaba curve would make them look cheap  a third person familiar with the trade said  As expected  the Alibaba deal repriced the Asian tech space as the curves for Tencent and Baidu have been tightening since Thursday afternoon   
Some funds also find better value in paper from similarly rated Chinese state owned enterprises  
 We prefer to allocate our Chinese exposure to opportunities with better relative value like China National Petroleum Corporation  a AA rated government owned SOE  which priced their three year bonds almost 40bp wider versus Alibaba   Lee said 
The wholly state owned oil major in China  rated Aa3 AA  A   priced a US 500m three year tranche at 107 5bp over Treasuries  compared to Alibaba s  A1 A  A   70bp over   
Gallimore concurred   Asian investors have more options to buy higher yielding paper such as the state owned oil names in China and proxy sovereign export import bank  
The US 8bn deal  to repay a syndicated loan of the same size  was split into US 1bn 1 625  three year fixed rate notes at 70bp over Treasuries  a US 300m three year floater at 52bp over three month Libor  US 2 25bn of 2 5  five year at 95bp over  US 1 5bn of 3 125  seven year at 115bp over  US 2 25bn 3 6  10 year at 128bp over  and US 700m 4 5  20 year at a spread of 148bp 
The 20 year was a clear outperformer in the secondary market  tightening more than 10bp in the Asia morning  The other tranches were around par or a couple of basis points wider by early afternoon in Asian hours

160432,381948,BIDU,Why Baidu s Q4 Matters To China,opinion,"Baidu remains behind on mobile monetisation
Baidu Connect service expected to boost mobile revenues
Content costs an issue for online video

Chinese search giant Baidu Inc   NASDAQ BIDU  is set to release its fiscal fourth quarter results tonight after the close of the US markets  Along with Alibaba  Baidu is a closely followed firm because its dominant market position will likely give a good indication of what investors can expect from the rest of China s tech firms during this earnings season  Ahead of the release  here are the four key points that investors should focus on 
Mobile traffic and revenue growth The third quarter saw mobile traffic exceed PC traffic for the first time in the firm s history  although this was aided by management s classification of traffic from tablet devices being classed as mobile as of the third quarter  However  mobile only contributed 36  to total revenues  as the firm is still in the process of effectively monetising its mobile user base  The cause of this is the difference in search behaviour between PC and mobile users  and Baidu is learning that PC monetisation methods don t necessarily work on mobile 
Along with the Baidu Connect service that I will discuss later  2015 should be the year when mobile revenues exceed PC revenues  and it will be interesting to see how Baidu intends to do this  
As the firm s mobile ecosystem grows  its focus on big data analysis should see mobile advertising become a lot more targeted  which will boost advertising revenues and the advertising conversion rate  
Baidu Connect Baidu has been unable to maintain steady growth for its active online marketing customer figures and revenue per online marketing customer  One of the main reasons for this is that as Baidu focuses more of its resources towards mobile  merchants were becoming more disappointed with the conversion of online traffic into offline sales  because the traditional advertising model is more suitable for PC  
This has caused merchants to bid less for advertisements on mobile  and hence mobile search revenue growth is stunted  This is why PC search revenues were higher than mobile search revenues in the third quarter  despite mobile traffic exceeding PC search traffic for the first time in the company s history   Source  Baidu Investor Relations
In the third quarter  Baidu announced a new O2O advertising strategy that works in parallel to the traditional keyword and ad bidding service  Baidu Connect is intended to boost online traffic into offline sales for mobile search  as firms can build their own mobile app style page within Baidu  
So taking the example of the large restaurant chain Haidi Lao       below  users who search for the      handle in Baidu will be taken directly to the restaurant s Baidu Connect page  where users can view the menu  make reservations and find the nearest location  
More importantly for merchants  if a user searches for a broader topic  such as  restaurant   Baidu Connect pages will appear at the top of the search results based on the merchant s location relative to the user  
This is much more effective on mobile than on PC  because PC users are more willing to view several pages of search results  whereas mobile users tend not to  Therefore it can be expected that mobile search revenues will see a significant increase in 2015 as Baidu Connect becomes more popular among merchants  Baidu Connect should be key to the firm maintaining strong growth in advertising revenues as the firm focuses more on mobile  It was released at the start of September  and by the end of October  it already had 400 000 merchants signed up  I expect that the fourth quarter will have seen a notable increase in advertising revenues due to Baidu Connect  
Content costs continue to rise Content costs are a growing concern for the online video industry in China  as intense competition and government restrictions on foreign content has seen the price of TV shows and films grow exponentially  
When considered as one  Baidu s iQiyi and PPStream platforms are the market leaders in China s online video industry  closely followed by the Alibaba backed Youku Tudou  and in order to maintain this position Baidu has to keep investing in top quality content  which is becoming ever more expensive In Sohu s fourth quarter conference call  the excessive cost of content once again caused investors to be disappointed with its earnings  Management cited that 2015 is set to be just as intense as 2014 was in terms of competition  and was the cause of Sohu Video s operating loss growing by 20  annually Sohu differs from Baidu because it is smaller and can t afford to compete financially with the BAT tech trio  However  with Alibaba and Tencent both having significant market share in online video  Baidu will continue to face the pressure of rising content costs  One of the main strategies that firms have pursued in order to mitigate these costs is to produce their own content  This is likely to become more common in the industry as the government places further restrictions on foreign  particularly American  content in order to promote Chinese shows and Chinese values  If management discusses that its video platforms are pursuing this strategy  then I expect that investors would be pleased   Source  Baidu Investor Relations
Development of the mobile ecosystem As I discussed last week  Baidu is rumoured to have partnered with Lenovo Group  HK 0992  for its new smartphone brand ShenQi  in a move that would likely see the smartphone be sold with Baidu s services installed as default applications Lenovo s ShenQi smartphones are set to be launched at the start of April  and will see Lenovo build a new online platform  so that users can buy the phones direct from the firm  This would allow Lenovo to grow its internet business  and help to drive its  Internet of Things  products  services and apps in China  It would present a very interesting opportunity for Baidu  which has had little success in entering the ecommerce business  With its BAT trio rivals Alibaba and Tencent both making a significant amount of revenues from their respective ecommerce platforms  Baidu has failed to capitalise on the tremendous growth in China s ecommerce market  
If the rumoured investment with Lenovo is true  however  then it would mark another passive investment in ecommerce from Baidu  which has recent invested in the ecommerce project of real estate giant Wanda Because of the ecommerce element  this deal would add an extra dimension to the trend that we ve seen in the industry  and contrast from two other deals that have recently been announced  
Qihoo has partnered with domestic smartphone manufacturer Coolpad  which will see Qihoo s apps installed on the Dazen smartphone range as standard  whilst Alibaba s investment in Meizu will see its YunOS mobile operating system being launched on the smartphones  as well as Alibaba s apps being installed as default  
Whilst I wouldn t expect either company to comment on a rumoured deal before it s officially announced  I do expect Baidu management to discuss its mobile strategy for 2015  Rivals Alibaba and Tencent are expanding their mobile ecosystems towards financial services  with the launch of their respective credit rating systems  
Baidu is unlikely to have the user data to be able to compete  so it will need to find new ways to diversify its revenues away from search  
Earnings history Baidu management s revenue guidance for the subsequent quarter tends to be very accurate  with the reported revenue deviating slightly from the guidance midpoint  Likewise  analysts  consensus for revenue also tends to be very accurate   Source  Baidu Investor Relations   Yahoo Finance
Baidu has a strong record of beating EPS consensus  with only one miss in the past 15 quarters  and has seen a positive reaction in the share price on the day after the previous six earnings releases  
The February Week Two  220 straddle  which expires on February 13  closed on Tuesday at a mid price of  11 72 on the screen  This suggests that the market is pricing a 5 3  move from earnings  which seems in line with the share price reaction to previous earnings releases   Source  Baidu Investor Relations   Yahoo Finance

Commentary The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   finally closed at a new all time high on Friday  February 13  2015  but T2108 is still failing to cooperate  T2108 tentatively closed at 64 5   still short of overbought status  This  reluctant  behavior of T2108 relative to the S P 500 was also evident on Wednesday when T2108 notably declined even as the S P 500 closed essentially flat 

The first all time high of 2015

Surprisingly  T2108 is still not overbought
I am wary about this reluctance because the S P 500 was trading at the top of the 2015 trading range when T2108 last flirted with overbought status  With the S P 500 now around 1 5  higher  T2108 should be overbought by now  if not at least retesting that boundary  This failure means that the recent surge has left some stocks behind  at least for now  As a result  I remain very wary of the market overall even as I switched the trading bias from bearish to neutral  This is a very difficult juncture for making short term trading calls because the S P 500 and T2108 could combine to flash a bullish signal that quickly turns into a fakeout  Here are my current trading rules for trying to cope with these tricky circumstances 
Stay neutral as long as the S P 500 is rallying and T2108 has not yet obtained overbought status 
Flip bullish once T2108 becomes overbought  looking for the elusive extended overbought rally 
Flip bearish as soon as the S P 500 closes below today s low  around 2086  I will be MORE bearish if this occurs after T2108 achieves overbought status 
The last rule is particularly important because the recent history of overbought periods has produced sell offs and pullbacks in their immediate wake  The last extended overbought rally was two years ago  The S P 500 even managed to keep rallying after T2108 dropped from overbought status  As regular readers know  trading through overbought periods is a LOT tougher than oversold periods  So  we will have to stay on our toes 
The volatility index  the VIX  adds to the intrigue  I have been writing that the volatility index is likely to remain elevated for the foreseeable future  On Friday  the VIX fell below the 15 35 pivot  Traders can argue that this could set up the next bounce in volatility  especially given what happened in late December  If the VIX closes above the pivot  I will consider the move supportive of the bearish case  In the meantime  a falling VIX and a rising S P 500 are VERY bullish one two punches  I wish I still had an active anti volatility trade in place 

The VIX continues to fall   certainly surprising many bears
In the last two T2108 Updates  I produced some very tradeable charts  Most have produced some good follow through  Here  I provide two updates and some new charts of interest 
FireEye 
Fireeye Inc  NASDAQ FEYE  got back on my radar because of pending earnings and technicals that suggested a big breakout could be on the way  Sure enough  FEYE reported earnings that sent the stock to an 11  gain on Thursday  On Friday  the stock gained another 7  to crack the breakout point  With the bullish confirmation of the earnings response  I aggressively bought call options on the first post earnings dip  timed for a pullback to the upper Bollinger  Band  BB   I was prepared for an extended and slow trade off or around that support  When the stock immediately bounced  I locked in my profits soon after FEYE made a fresh post earnings high  If I had held on another day  those profits would have increased almost 4x 
Interestingly  the previous 4 earnings for FEYE all had negative responses  three are shown in the chart below   So it is very possible this positive response to earnings will deliver a sustained breakout 

FireEye  FEYE  is apparently breaking out from an extended bottoming pattern
Baidu
Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU was also on my post earnings radar  The stock suffered a tremendous hit  In after hours trading the stock dropped as far as  193 or so for a 10  loss  So imagine my surprise when BIDU managed to open 10 points higher  Given what I saw with Google  NASDAQ GOOG  last month  I interpreted this bounce as very bullish  My order of call options triggered as BIDU dropped toward  200  I held my breath as BIDU hit  200  Fortuitously  that round number held up this time as support  Unlike FEYE  I held onto the position into Friday  I was rewarded with a gap up  I locked in profits soon after that as I expected an extended fight with 200DMA resistance  Amazingly  BIDU continued soaring to completely close its post earnings loss  I do not even want to calculate the missed profit opportunity on that one 
I think it is safe to say that BIDU is primed to rally even with a declining 50DMA that has proven itself as tough resistance since December 

While the post earnings gap down technically confirmed the current downtrend from November s high  the quick recovery suggests that buyers are finally interested in returning BIDU to former glory
Google
Speaking of GOOG  the stock s post earnings recovery continues  The stock is now right below its 200DMA  A breakout from here will be VERY bullish  I will have to assume that the selling that has preceded the last two earnings has finally shaken out the GOOG bears  Accordingly  note the convincing strength in on balance volume  OBV  

Google  GOOG  is on the edge of a major breakout
Cisco 
Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  was not on my post earnings radar  The gap up to levels last seen in late 2007 caught my attention  As in the case of FEYE and BIDU  I moved quickly to load up on call options  Like FEYE  CSCO gave me an opportunity to buy on a pullback to the top of the Bollinger Band  For whatever reason  it was CSCO that I thought could have sustained follow through  so I held onto my call options even as the stock rapidly bounced back and delivered profits  My position is now back to flat  and I am counting on a resumption of the buying enthusiasm in the coming week 

A BIG week for Cisco  CSCO 
Ambarella  Inc 
 Here is a more bearish setup so you do not get the impression I am actually an aggressive bull despite all the wariness I expressed earlier about the general market  Ambarella  NASDAQ AMBA  broke through its 50DMA on high volume but on no publicly reported news  Many times in these cases I will wait for the news before making a move  Sometimes I will even try to fade the move if it is a stock I know and like  This time  I automatically made the move consistent with the breakdown and loaded up on put options  With the stock trading below its lower BB  I was definitely tempted to quickly lock in profits  With memories of trades closed too quickly fresh on my mind  I decided to hold on and see at least what Tuesday brings 

An ominous breakdown for AMBA
United States Steel Corp 
Now back to bullish developments  An apparent bottoming in oil has likely helped United States Steel Corp  NYSE X  churned its way into a bottoming pattern  I took a tentative position call options on X last week after it seemed to confirm the bullish gap up from earnings  Friday s breakout above 50DMA resistance seems to add a bullish confirmation of a bottoming process 

United States Steel Corp  X  has suffered mightily since heady highs last September  A bottom may finally be underway 
iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond
A week ago I was looking to the iShares Barclays 20  Year Treasury fund  ARCA TLT  holding support at its 50DMA  I even started buying call options ahead of confirmation of support  No dice  On Friday  TLT broke through that support  This is a chart of GREAT interest because a continued decline in bond prices could help confirm the current bottoming of commodities like oil  In other words  we can interpret increasing yields as the market s  reluctant   acceptance that prices are more likely heading higher than lower from here  Since rates move for a lot of different reasons  I am not talking about a direct correlation  just something to give strong consideration 

Is the run up finally ending for TLT

Return to net lossJD com posted positive non GAAP net income in the third quarter  but management was quick to state that the firm doesn t target profit at this stage  because it is focusing on growing market share throughout China  Therefore investors shouldn t expect continued profit in the coming quarters 
In addition  the fourth quarter tends to see lower gross margins because of the higher marketing expenses related to heavy promotional activities  such as the Single s Day and 12 12 shopping events  While this is in contrast to great rival Alibaba  investors shouldn t be disappointed by negative profit margins  Management has stated that by building market share and developing its business model during 2014 and 2015  the firm will be in a strong position to target profit within a few years  JD com s gross margins are likely to be lower in the fourth quarter because of the higher marketing expenses related to events such as Single s Day

The key theme from the earnings of China s tech giants is that as mobile becomes a growing component of total revenues  the overall monetisation rate has been decreasing  The reason for this is because PC is an established platform  and effective monetisation strategies have been developed over several years 
However  the migration of mobile essentially began in 2013  and firms focused heavily on mobile during 2014  Therefore monetisation strategies have yet to be optimised  meaning that the monetisation rate for mobile is lower than that of PC  Hence as the proportion of revenues from mobile increases  the overall monetisation rate decreases 
In the third quarter  29 6  of orders fulfilled came from mobile  and during the Single s Day festival on November 11  mobile contributed to 40  of orders  In addition  JD com is becoming more integrated into the Tencent social media network  and the direct links from QQ and WeChat should continue to drive mobile user growth 
CEO Richard Liu commented that the firm is seeing growing conversion rates from these Tencent social media platforms  and this should continue in 2015  I expect to see overall mobile contribution for the fourth quarter reach 36   but this will likely contribute to lower profit margins  However  I don t think that the market s reaction will be as great as we saw from Alibaba and Baidu  because these two firms have eliminated the surprise factor 
Investors will be expecting higher mobile contribution to revenues and lower profit margins  and they understand that this is a necessary stage of China s transition from PC centric to mobile centric strategy 
Growth of marketplace to complement merchandise in 2015
While JD com is known as China s biggest online direct retailer  it has been expanding its third party business  known as Marketplace  This is where JD com acts as a retail platform for third party suppliers to sell their products to consumers  As JD com has been expanding the marketplace business  investors should expect to see much stronger growth than from its established direct selling merchandise business 
It should be noted that the marketplace business has a higher risk of counterfeit products than the merchandise business  because the products come from third party suppliers  Therefore while JD com has built its reputation on the back of product quality  emphasising the contrast to Alibaba  the growth of GMV from third party suppliers will likely see the risk of counterfeit products increase 
JD com is notorious for taking every opportunity to criticise Alibaba  and the fourth quarter conference call should see many references to product quality  particularly after the SAIC report that targeted Alibaba s lapses on anti counterfeit controls  I expect that management will discuss its warehousing and logistics services for third party merchants  which allows suppliers to use JD com s infrastructure in order to improve delivery times 
Not only does this generate revenue for JD com  but it allows the firm to test product quality from third party suppliers  By the end of the third quarter  JD com s proprietary logistics network delivered about 30  of parcels for third party sellers  and this is expected to increase throughout 2015  JD com has been developing high quality warehousing infrastructure  and the first of which was opened in Shanghai prior to the Single s Day festival in November  Three more are under construction  and should be online in 2015  JD com s state of the art warehousing infrastructure 
Could VIPshop finally see genuine competition 
JD com has always been known as a consumer electronics retail platform  but it has been growing its product line up  Non electronic merchandise has seen strong growth over the past few quarters  and Richard Liu stated that GMV from non electronic merchandise will exceed that of electronic merchandise in 2015 
The firm sees the apparel and shoes product category as very promising  While a substantial part of this revenue comes from the third party marketplace business  JD com is looking at expanding the direct selling merchandise business through flash sales  putting it in direct competition with flash sales leader VIPshop 
This is a very interesting strategy by JD com  because Vipshop  NYSE VIPS  has consistently shown that the flash sales model is a very profitable business  VIPshop s management recently discussed how its position in the market allows it to essentially have first refusal on inventory from many brands  which should help it to stave off competition from the likes of JD com 
Nevertheless  JD com should be able to provide strong competition for VIPshop  because it is a much bigger firm  In the third quarter  VIPshop had 9 5 million active customer accounts  while JD com had 46 million  and even despite VIPshop s fourth quarter active customer accounts growing 28 4  to 12 2 million  JD com should see strong growth from the fourth quarter  due to the seasonal promotions 
While I wouldn t expect significant revenues from its flash sales model over the coming quarters  continued growth in flash sales would put serious pressure on VIPshop in 2015 ",2015-02-27,Saxo Bank,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/daily-report:-dollar-rose-on-inflation-data-and-fed-comments,-stays-firm-243306",243306

Commentary T2108 closed the day at 59 1   Looking back  T2108 looks like it has nearly steadily marched higher since the last closing low on March 10th  The uptrend is even more clear on the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   although it diverged slightly from T2108 with a marginally lower close  Incredibly  the index has neatly alternated between up and down days on this march higher 

The S P 500 is stair stepping back to all time highs
The volatility index  the VIX  managed a minor gain as it now struggles to hold its 2015 low 

The VIX is on the defensive again
Finally  the Australian dolalr  via the Rydex CurrencyShares AUD Trust ETF  NYSE FXA   has conquered 50DMA resistance against the Japanese yen  Rydex CurrencyShares Japanese Yen ETF  ARCA FXY    At the time of writing AUD JPY is toying with 2 month highs 


Is the Australian dollar in the early stages of a major relief rally 
Put it all together and the writing on the wall is giving bulls and buyers plenty of reason to continue exhaling sighs of relief from the technical dangers I started noting earlier this month  As a result  I have switched the trading call from bearish to neutral  The S P 500 is  close enough  to fresh all time highs  Moreover  T2108 is still 10 percentage points away from overbought  this setup gives the market plenty of room to keep motoring higher  However  I am too cautious to flip to bullish on the overall market here  The neutral rating frees me up to give equal weight to bullish and bearish setups on individual stocks 
Also giving T2108 room to run is the duration over which it has failed to enter overbought territory  T2108 has now gone 176 trading days without going overbought  This is rarefied territory from the historical record  going back to 1986   The chart below shows we can count on one hand the number of times T2108 has avoided overbought territory for a longer duration  The chart also suggests that the S P 500 should deliver about 8  in gains by the time T2108 flips to overbought territory  The last overbought day was July 3  2104  The S P 500 is up 6 0  since then 

The duration of the current T2108 70  underperiod is exceptionally long compared to the historical record
T2108 has also spent 106 days above oversold territory  The historical record suggests T2108 and the S P 500 are at a critical juncture here  The projections below show a steady ramp in expected performance from here to the time T2108 ends the 20  overperiod  The S P 500 was last oversold on October 16  2014  The S P 500 is up 11 5  since then  To hold onto this gain by the next oversold period  T2108 will need to stay above oversold territory for around 100 more trading days  Such an achievement will require a healthy extension of the current rally  T2108 can also align with historic behavior by trading all the way back to oversold territory over the next few weeks  Not likely

Here are some charts to occupy the time until T2108 reaches its next milestone 
Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ ICPT 
Buy the rumor  sell the news  That seems to be the case for Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc   ICPT   Buyers of the secondary stock offering have made surprisingly easy money  Perhaps they are finally locking in profits after the company announced results of a drug trial  Note the consistency of the post news selling in ICPT  I may have missed a few other important news evets  

Time for ICPT to cool off 
iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB 
It is very possible that ICPT is suffering more from a general industry pullback than anything company specific  The biotech ETF  iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB   has been on an absolute tear  IBB is up about 500  since the March  2009 lows  It is up about 243  since the end of 2011  It is already up 18  year to date  On Friday  IBB  gapped and crapped  along with ICPT  It also followed through with high volume selling on Monday  just like ICPT  The bio tech sector now has a lot more of my attention 

A VERY consistent and very strong uptrend may be taking a pause here 
Coach  NYSE COH In an earlier post  I promised to buy Coach  COH  when I was felling more bullish  I think flipping from bearish to neutral is close enough  Last week  I bought the dip that seems to have conveniently found support at the lower part of the first Bollinger  Band  BB  

Coach  COH  continues to maintain an uptrend from its recent lows that is following the 50DMA with multiple dip buying opportunities along the way
Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Venture capitalist Bill Gurley made a lot of noise about Facebook  FB  and the risk it faces in the new fearless Silicon Valley  He is particularly worried about a  risk bubble  expressed in the rapid growth of mobile app install ads  So of course  in response  FB bounced neatly off 50DMA support and soared to new all time highs  FB has now invalidated what looked like a triple top 

Facebook achieves new all time highs
iShares MSCI Germany  ARCA EWG  The breakout for iShares MSCI Germany  EWG  above its 200DMA continues  albeit in choppy form  I continue to like EWG as the best play on an eventual comeback for Europe  Regardless  I am trying to get more disciplined about buying 200DMA breakouts as they tend to usher sustained and extended rallies 

The breakout continues for iShares MSCI Germany  EWG   It is now at 8 month highs 
Baidu  Inc   NASDAQ BIDU I expressed hestinacy last week about buying back into the Baidu  Inc   BIDU  move  The stock is already working to reassure me with a fresh post earnings closing high and a push above 50 and 200DMA resistance

   Selling 57 48 mln shares at HK 19 80 20 30 each
   Price is a 4 6 4 pct discount to Monday closing price
   Yahoo to still hold 40 pct stake in parent company
  Adds Yahoo statement  analyst comments  changes dateline 
 By Alison Liu and Alexei Oreskovic
 HONG KONG SAN FRANCISCO  Sept 14  Reuters    Yahoo Inc is
selling its 1 14 percent stake in Chinese Internet marketplace
Alibaba com for about  150 million  nearly two years after the
company went public 
 Yahoo still holds a 40 percent stake in the unlisted parent
company  Alibaba Group  and reiterated in a statement on Monday
that it believes the investment is an important  long term way
to participate in the China market 
 Speculation about whether Yahoo planned to unwind its ties
with Alibaba arose after Jerry Yang stepped down as chief
executive of the U S  Internet company 
 Yahoo paid more than  1 billion in 2005 as part of its
investment in Alibaba Group  which was co founded by Chinese
entrepreneur and former English teacher Jack Ma  Yang  a native
Taiwanese  was a strong supporter of the deal and used to
travel frequently to China and appear with Ma 
  Yahoo regularly evaluates its financial investments and
the value of its 1 percent direct IPO investment in Alibaba com
has increased substantially  This increase is why Yahoo sold
this financial position   Yahoo said  noting that it would
result in pretax proceeds of about  150 million 
 Yahoo is selling 57 48 million shares of Alibaba com at
HK 19 80 20 30 each  according to a term sheet obtained by
Reuters on Monday  The price range represents a 4 percent to
6 4 percent discount to the stock s closing price of HK 21 15
on Monday 
 After dropping steadily in 2008  Alibaba shares have come
charging back this year  nearly quadrupling since January 
 Analysts said Yahoo s move would put pressure on
Alibaba com s stock  amid signs that its valuation has
stretched well beyond its peers 
  I think it is negative for the share price not just
because this is a profit taking activity  but it reflects some
heightened risks  they may have  about the fundamentals of the
business   said Steven Liu analyst with DBS Vickers 
 Despite Yahoo s move  analysts did not think the company
was changing its strategy in China  the world s largest
Internet market by users 
 Carol Bartz  who succeeded Yang as CEO  has been clear that
 the way she wants to play China is through Alibaba   said
Sanford Bernstein analyst Jeff Lindsay 
 Bartz doesn t want to get into operating a business in
China itself  Lindsay added   It s too expensive  too much of a
drain on capital  
 Under the 2005 deal  Yahoo handed over exclusive rights to
the  Yahoo China  brand to Alibaba Group  While the Yahoo China
site has struggled to gain share against Baidu com  Alibaba
Group owns other attractive units including the fast growing
Chinese online auction site Taobao 
 Alibaba Group is one of the dominant players in China and
is still showing strong growth  so Yahoo wants to be careful
about selling too early  said Kaufman Brothers analyst Aaron
Kessler 
 With more than  3 billion of cash and short term
securities  Yahoo doesn t need the cash  Kessler said 
 And analyst said the illiquid nature of Yahoo s investment
in the Alibaba Group would also make any efforts to sell it
extremely complex   Not only do you have to find a buyer  but
you d have to make sure the Chinese government will approve
it   said Cowen   Co analyst Jim Friedland 
 Alibaba com raised  1 49 billion in its October 2007 IPO in
Hong Kong  pricing the issue at HK 13 50 per share  with Yahoo
buying a portion of the offering at the time 
Ma also sold 13 million of his shares  or less than 5
percent of his total direct and indirect holding  in the
company for about  35 million last week

The Chinese B2C retailer filed with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission to raise  1 5 billion on Jan  30  in what would be the biggest IPO by a Chinese Internet company in the U S  in history  according to Bloomberg  According to a December speech by Richard Liu  who founded the e commerce company in 1998  the company plans to invest in technology research and development  the development of financial services and online to offline operations  expanding into low tier Chinese cities and abroad in 2014 
The Beijing based e commerce giant has 35 8 million active customer accounts  and controls 38 8 percent of the Chinese B2C market  making it the largest e commerce operator in the country  JD also posted  8 billion in revenue during the first nine months of 2013

Jack Ma s Alibaba has been gearing up for an IPO for the past year  while the exact date is still not set  experts expect the Chinese Internet giant will file for an IPO later this year with an estimated value of more than  150 billion  possibly making it the largest IPO ever  The company serves 618 million Web users with its e commerce sites like Alibaba com and Taobao com  and posted sales of  160 billion in 2012  according to the NASDAQ 
In preparation for the IPO  Alibaba has been purchasing stakes and complete ownerships of more than 10 smaller companies in the past year  spending in excess of  2 billion  The companies include map makers  social media sites  Web browsers and logistics companies  and were bought to shore up areas of weakness for Alibaba  the Financial Times reported

Commentary Going into and during the October sell off  bears were fond of noting that the top in the S P 500  at the time  coincided with the IPO of Alibaba  NYSE BABA   It was a neat and convenient story of buyer s exhaustion and a peak in complacency  I saw this milestone  top on twitter  Now that BABA is making fresh all time highs day after day  I am wondering whether these same bears are leveraging this nifty technical signal to either get out of the way of the uptrend or hop aboard 

Alibaba  BABA  is sprinting along its upper Bollinger Band  as post earnings momentum continues apace
The BABA uptrend is quite impressive  strong and persistent  I really missed big on that one  The Ali Blah Blah top has turned into what I will now call the  Ali Rah Rah pop  until the name no longer applies  The Ali Rah Rah pop now features a resumption of upward momentum that seems unperturbed by the jeers and derision of market detractors who keep calling for a market top with each step higher  The S P 500 is oblivious to scandalized bears and is instead blithely pushing along to the  rah rah  cheers of the momentum and trend following crowd 

The S P 500 keeps marching along in a well defined uptrend between Bollinger Bands
T2108 is also trundling along higher  At 65 1   T2108 is just barely higher than it was a week ago  My favorite technical indicator is starting to make me wonder whether a coiled spring is getting ready to pop  Either way  overbought conditions seem almost certain at some point in the coming days  I was hoping for overbought to coincide with Friday s jobs report   However  if T2108 takes a notable dive before returning to overbought conditions  I will stand up and take notice given this is exactly how the selling in September began  A descent below the 60  level might make me give the bearish case more serious consideration 

Volatility continues its descent  The volatility index  the VIX  has essentially completed a roundtrip from late September s breakout that came the trading day after  Monday  September 22  the BABA IPO  Funny how these things can seem so interconnected 

Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   my favorite bulldozer in the coal mine  may have the  final  say on whether we go breakout or go bust from here  Surprisingly  it is already pushing against resistance at the 200DMA and now looks ready to break out higher  Just as I could not get with the bearish program with transports   a CAT bulldozing higher simply fortifies my bullishness on the market  CAT is also my favorite hedge on bullish sympathies  so I will still look for an opportunity to rebuild put options  just in case  

Caterpillar  CAT  is on the edge of a significant breakout from stiff resistance
Finally  in trading action  I sold my call options on Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  into today s very cooperative 4 7  move off support from the first Bollinger Band   click here to see the discussion of this setup   The options essentially doubled off this one move   a great reminder of what I love about trading options for short term positioning  I also shorted Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  ARCA XLE  as it faded off 50DMA resistance  This is NOT a hedge  just a trade following very simple technical rules 

Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   falls back in what looks like a notable failure at 50DMA resistance

160463,381979,BIDU,T2108 Update  A Healthier Bounce From Oversold Conditions,opinion,"T2108 Status  21 0   broke to oversold intraday for second day in a row  as low as 19 1  VIX Status  15 1General  Short term  Trading Call  Selective buying for short term trades  Fade rallies  preferably at or near resistance  Nuances explained in past two T2108 Updates Active T2108 periods  Day  271 over 20   Day  3 under 30  and 40   underperiods   Day  7 under 50   Day  18 under 60   Day  21 under 70 
Commentary For the second day in a row  T2108 dropped into oversold territory only to bounce back without closing oversold  This time around  the bounce was healthier by every dimension  the S P 500 closed with a 0 7  gain  T2108 surged 16  higher  and volatility was smashed hard enough to dive under the 15 35 pivot line   By the way  I continue to be amazed at how well this line works as a pivot point   
Second day is a charm  the S P 500 rises from quasi oversold conditions on its second attempt


Volatility gets smashed with a 11  decline that takes the VIX under the pivot line


While the first quasi oversold condition did not precede a gain for the S P 500  the second did  I will update the T2108 Trading Model  TTM  with these new data points  This episode is still a lesson for over eager bears that chase over extended selling downward  The chances of a retest of the 50DMA  as resistance this time  just increased by some amount 
However  bulls should not uncork the champagne to shout  bottom   just yet  The test at resistance will likely be tough  More importantly  the apparent bottoming in volatility opens up higher odds of deep sell offs at any time  The channel shown above even suggests we should expect HIGHER volatility over time  
I also did not like the  lazy  way in which this quasi oversold condition unfolded  There was no real washout event for sellers even though volume picked up a bit from the selling  There was no gap down no cause the weakest hands to shake loose and no gap up to trap over eager bears  In other words  there were no clear  definitive trading bursts  This of course does not guarantee a bottom did or did not happen   just that my preferred scenario for a bottom did not come to pass  Otherwise  I would have been even more aggressive than I already was in buying ProShares Ultra S P500  ARCA SSO  call options and ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY  put options 
For today s trading action  I included last week s script to ride UVXY puts on the house s money  The plunge in the VIX sent UVXY tumbling 9 2  and as large a loss as 11  or so  I added to my UVXY shares even as I doubled down on my puts earlier  As a reminder  the point of the shares is to pay off the puts  It worked last week  and I am pressing my luck here again as I strongly suspect UVXY has at least one more good pop in its blood before resuming its typical downward spiral 
I also reloaded on Yelp com  NYSE YELP  puts to fade another rally toward its 50DMA  On the bullish side  I made a play for Joy Global  NYSE JOY   The best trade of the day was a call spread on Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   The stock has faded in orderly fashion since gapping up 11  post earnings on Friday  July 25th  I have been eyeing the stock like a hawk for an entry  Quasi oversold conditions combined with a pause on the first Bollinger Band  BB  generated a good risk reward entry  I watched for the first sign of  buying  life in the stock and it came right from the open  Intraday volatility got me into the play at my limit price  This was fortunate because the stock continued to race upward from there  I was VERY tempted to close out the position and lock in profits  but instead I decided to hang in there and see whether BIDU can now resume its post earnings momentum  The clock is on a 12 day timer  the spread allows me to worry a lot less about the erosion of time premium  


Baidu looks ready to resume its uptrend and confirm the bullish post earnings reaction


Note that all these trades remain very consistent with the current trading call  The growing complexity of the trading environment will make sticking to the rules more important than ever

160482,381998,BIDU,Baidu Inc  China s Most Visited Web Site Up 8000 ,opinion,"Chinese search engine  Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  crushed estimates again and its stock is trading at new all time highs near  220 this morning 
BIDU IPO ed in 2005 at  27 per share  which is 2 70 on a split adjusted basis  They had a 10 1 split in 2010  It was considered the hottest IPO of the year   BIDU gained 350  on its first trading day  finishing at  112 5  12 25 split adjusted  


Over the past decade  BIDU never looked cheap  It was trading at a high P E multiple all the way from 2 70 to 220  Don t be afraid to pay up for high growth stocks with great potential  In many cases  they are expensive for a reason  Over time  earnings could more than catch up with people s expectations and justify high valuations 
This is exactly what happened with Baidu  In the quarter before its IPO  it earned  8 million  In its latest 2014 quarter  Baidu earned  571 million 
The market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term  Valuation matters in the end only if earnings don t catch up  you plan to hold forever and you don t have an exit strategy  If price gets you in a trade or investment  price should get you out  If you don t know why you are in the trade  you won t know when to exit

160542,382058,BIDU,Baidu Breakout Redux  Watch The Volume,opinion,Baidu  BIDU  is a Chinese internet company specializing in search  and it has a huge fan base  Unfortunately  the stock peaked in July  2011 and has been on a roller coaster ride downward ever since  The long term  weekly chart below shows how the 50 week moving average has defined the overall downtrend  The longer term 200 week moving average is rushing up to meet it  I have no special insight on how 50 and 200 week moving averages tend to interact to define future trends  but I strongly expect we are about to get a great lesson about it Any longer term holder in BIDU has to be worried about more than the near 2 year downtrend in BIDU  Even more ominous is the complete lack of volume in the stock ever since the recession and financial crisis  The disappearance in volume is not just about the large absolute share price either  Note the huge surge in volume in 2007 and 2008 ranging from 200M to as much as 500M at times when the stock peaked out around  41  Starting in 2009  with the stock scraping bottom between  11 and  14  trading volume MAXED out around 100M  Volume has shriveled up on a consistent basis ever since then  BIDU now averages around 4 2M shares in trading volume per day with a  103 share price  This paltry volume is 98  below BIDU on a slow day in its pre recession peak  The stock price then is about 40  lower than today s stock price  So even on a price weighted basis  trading volume has considerably declined in BIDU  It is amazing that the stock has been able to climb as much as it has on such a collapse in volume   Note that    so shares have been removed from the market  Even so  the severe decline in volume still looks significant   Even after putting aside the overall collapse in volume  I find volume may still matter relative to recent trading  On Friday  June 7th  BIDU broke out above its 200 day moving average  DMA  on better than average volume  This move is typically a very bullish sign  indicating that buyers are convinced of higher prices to come and are trying to sign up early for the potential gains and a much welcome end to the current downtrend  Yet  BIDU also broke out above its 200DMA at a higher point back in August  2012  Unfortunately  volume immediately dried up on that breakout  What followed was a breakdown with heavy selling  After stabilizing for two months  the selling picked up pace again  The stock has been periodically breaking down ever since The charts below show the current breakout and a close up with last year s breakout Ultimately  I think the lesson with BIDU is to watch the volume  Bulls want to see volume maintain at least average levels on this breakout  A fade in volume should be treated as a bright red warning sign  Another breakdown below the 200DMA will be a second warning sign  A surge in selling volume will be your last warning before prices eventually tumble to lower lows  At that point  I would have to wonder whether BIDU is on a slow  grinding  and volatile decline to much lower levels Be careful out there Disclosure  long BIDU call options,2013-06-09,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baidu-breakout-redux:-watch-the-volume-170502,170502

160696,382212,BIDU,Baidu Inc  High Priced Or Valued To Buy  ,opinion,Baidu Inc  BIDU  is most commonly referred to as the Chinese version of Google  Not unlike Google  Baidu Inc has generated an extraordinary record of earnings growth over its short history as a publicly traded company  Furthermore  even though Baidu Inc is trading at one of its lowest price earnings ratio as a public company it has still managed to provide shareholders with lavish returns  Finally  just like Google  the company s future earnings growth rate is expected to slow dramatically against the backdrop of its historical results  On the other hand  future earnings growth is still expected to be among the highest of any company you can find Growth stocks are defined as companies with high rates of change of earnings growth of 15  to 20  or better  Growth stocks offer the potential for share prices to rise in lockstep with their profit growth in the long run  Therefore  the PEG ratio formula  price equals growth rate  tends to be the most appropriate formula used to value growth stocks  However  due to the exponential nature of compounding large numbers  PEG ratio forecasts are capped at 40  Because of the higher valuation typically awarded to fast growth  growth stocks offer the potential for greater capital appreciation  On the other hand  they also offer higher risk  First of all  they tend to command much higher than average PE ratios  and second  achieving very high levels of growth is very difficult to sustain  Consequently  forecasting future earnings growth is more important with high growth stocks than any other class of stock  Also  the average growth stock typically ploughs all of its profits back into the company to fund its future growth  instead of paying dividends Baidu Inc    Large cap Growth at an Attractive Price Baidu  Inc   Baidu  is a Chinese language Internet search provider  Baidu serves three types of online participants  which include users  customers and Baidu union members  The Company offers a Chinese language search platform on its Website Baidu com  It provides Chinese language Internet search services to enable users to find relevant information online  including Web pages  news  images  documents and multimedia files  through links provided on its Websites  It designs and delivers its online marketing services primarily on its Baidu com Website to its online marketing customers  During the year ended December 31  2011  it had approximately 488 000 active online marketing customers  Its online marketing customers consist of small and medium enterprises  SMEs  throughout China  large domestic companies and Chinese divisions or subsidiaries of large  multinational companies  On July 20  2011  the Company acquired 62 01  of the interest of Qunar Earnings Determine Market Price   The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings   and fully functioning graph on Baidu Inc  We suggest running graphs over numerous time frames as part of a more comprehensive fundamental analysis   Baidu Inc   Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 2007 Performance Table Baidu Inc    The Two Keys to Long Term Performance   Years of research and experience have taught us that there are two critically important keys to achieving above average  long term shareholder returns at reasonably controlled levels of risk  The first key is earnings growth  or what we like to call the rate of change of earnings growth  The faster a company can grow its business  i e  earnings   the larger the income stream it can produce with which to reward shareholders  This is because of the power of compounding  which Albert Einstein was alleged to have called  the most powerful force on earth   Ultimately  both capital appreciation and dividend income will be a function of a company s ability to grow its profits    The second key is valuation  When a company can be purchased at its intrinsic value based on earnings and cash flow generation  the shareholders  rate of return or long term capital appreciation will inevitably correlate to and or equal its earnings growth rate  Overvaluation will lower that rate of return and conversely  undervaluation will increase it  Consequently  paying strict attention to the valuation you pay to buy a stock is a critical component of both greater return and taking lower risk to achieve it  Because  ironically  when you overpay for even the best business  you simultaneously lower your return potential while increasing your risk of achieving the lower return    The associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two keys to long term performance  Notice the impact that valuation  black line above or below orange earnings justified valuation line  had on the following performance results  The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2007 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Baidu Inc is 17 41 which is historically low  Looking to the Future   Extensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants    1   The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings 2   The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings   Forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance    Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  Baidu Inc is clearly an industry leading superior business  which based on the consensus estimates from leading analysts  appears to be capable of growing earnings at an above average rate for the foreseeable future  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Baidu Inc represents an opportunity for growth at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Baidu Inc  with its strong balance sheet and potential for future earnings growth  has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for outsized future returns    The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions    The consensus of 22 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Baidu Inc s long term earnings growth at 43   Baidu Inc has low long term debt at 12  of capital  Baidu Inc is currently trading at a P E of 36 1  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 48  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Baidu Inc s True Worth  valuation would be  1083 87 at the end of 2017  which would be a 45 4  annual rate of return from the current price  Earnings Yield Estimates   Discounted Future Cash Flows   All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stake holders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay    Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any perspective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Baidu Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Baidu Inc s expected earnings would be 14 4 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component  Summary   ConclusionsThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although  with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative that the reader conducts their own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not Baidu Inc is expected to grow earnings over the next five years at over 40  per annum and can currently be purchased at a PE ratio that is lower than its forecast growth rate  Therefore  the case could be made that the company is currently cheap on that basis  On the other hand  its current PE ratio of over 36 would be considered very high relative to the average company  Consequently  this fast growing internationally based large cap represents a dilemma for the aggressive investor seeking maximum capital appreciation On the one hand  the stock is cheap relative to expected growth  While on the other hand  its current valuation is more than twice the average company  Therefore  we believe that although the company appears attractively valued based on earnings growth  it should be recognized that it is only appropriate for the aggressive investor seeking maximum capital appreciation  Furthermore  there are additional risks that the discerning investor should consider before investing in Baidu Inc  As always  we recommend you do your own thorough due
