220303,441819,AMD,AMD Earnings  50  Sales Growth  Earnings Quadruple  Shares Fall 6 ,news,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  reported fourth quarter results on Tuesday evening  and the graphics and system processor designer managed to exceed analysts  estimates across the board  The company set conservative revenue targets for the next quarter and fiscal year  Here s a closer look at AMD s results and upcoming growth prospects 
Advanced Micro Devices  fourth quarter results by the numbers

Data source  Advanced Micro Devices  GAAP   generally accepted accounting principles 
These results were roughly in line with AMD s fourth quarter guidance  where the company aimed for revenue near  2 1 billion and adjusted gross margin of roughly 44   Reported non GAAP gross margin stopped at 45   boosted by AMD s rising volume of chips produced via the more cost effective 7 nanometer manufacturing process 
Sales rose 69  year over year in the computing and graphics division  driven in roughly equal parts by the Ryzen CPU and Radeon gaming GPU products  Average selling prices per unit increased in both of these product lines 
The enterprise  embedded  and semicustom segment posted a 7  revenue increase  boosted by double digit percentage growth in the data center market but held back by lower sales of semicustom chips  The semicustom business is primarily driven by AMD s presence in the Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation gaming consoles  and both of these console families will launch brand new models for the 2020 holiday season  As such  fading sales of the current console generation are dragging AMD s semicustom revenue down  The company will power the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X machines as well 

What s next for AMD 
Looking ahead  AMD set its first quarter revenue guidance at roughly  1 8 billion  42  above the year ago period s result and just below the analyst consensus at  1 86 billion  Full year sales should increase by approximately 29  to roughly  8 7 billion  just a hair above the average Street view at  8 6 billion 
Semicustom revenue will ramp up ahead of the new console launches in Q4  starting in the second quarter but heavily weighted toward the end of the year  Other operations should follow AMD s normal seasonality  apart from potentially stealing market share from larger rival Intel in the data center space as the year moves along 
 In terms of rate and pace of server share gain  it is primarily for cloud customers   said CEO Lisa Su on the earnings call   I m quite encouraged actually by the strength of the pipeline that we see  the number of customers that are engaged  and then just  you know  how they re deploying  So  I think we re going at a good pace  and we ll continue to accelerate that as we go through 2020  
AMD s shares fell more than 6  on this report  but the stock has still gained 150  over the last 52 weeks  Call it profit taking  call it a lack of razzle dazzle surprises  but there was nothing fundamentally wrong with AMD s performance in the fourth quarter  For high octane growth stocks like AMD  a small earnings surprise isn t always good enough to sustain a skyrocketing share price 
I m still impressed by Su s turnaround efforts  transforming AMD from a perennial also ran to a legitimate Intel alternative in five short years  Over that period  AMD s shares have returned a market crushing 1 630  ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/powi3,2071590
220304,441820,AMD,What You Need to Know About AMD s Earnings,news,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  reported its fourth quarter results Tuesday evening  and the numbers looked good  Revenue and earnings soared  and the company s guidance called for solid double digit growth in 2020 
But AMD s guidance was a little problematic  enough so to drive the stock lower on Wednesday  Here s what investors need to know about AMD s results 
1  Revenue soared
Thanks to a full slate of product launches throughout 2019  AMD managed to grow its fourth quarter revenue to  2 13 billion  up 50  year over year  Sales in the computing and graphics segment  which includes PC CPUs and GPUs  soared 69  to  1 66 billion 
AMD launched its third generation Ryzen PC CPUs last July  alongside its first graphics cards based on its Navi architecture  Both product lines were home runs  Ryzen essentially closed the performance gap with Intel chips  and Navi made AMD competitive with NVIDIA in the graphics card market at price points below  400 
AMD s EPYC server chips helped the cause as well  but the enterprise  embedded  and semi custom segment was dragged down by game console chips  With both Sony and Microsoft launching new consoles this year  sales of current generation consoles have declined  The segment posted 7  revenue growth  with EPYC more than offsetting the weak semi custom business 

2  Profits jumped  too
AMD reported non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share of  0 32  up from just  0 08 in the prior year period and  0 01 higher than analysts were expecting 
Robust revenue growth was part of the equation  Also contributing was an improved gross margin  Adjusted gross margin was 45   up from 41  in the prior year period  Operating expenses were another factor  Adjusted operating expenses rose by 15   much slower than revenue  The net result was a surge in the bottom line 
3  Guidance for the first quarter wasn t that great
On the surface  AMD s first quarter guidance seems pretty good  The company expects to produce revenue of  1 8 billion  plus or minus  50 million  That s down 15  from the fourth quarter  but up 42  year over year 
Here s the problem  The first quarter of 2019 was a disaster  so the comparison is about as easy as it gets  An oversupply of graphics cards wreaked havoc on AMD s results in the first quarter last year  driving revenue down 23  on a year over year basis  The expected 42  growth rate is far less impressive when put into context 
Two years ago  in the first quarter of 2018  AMD generated  1 65 billion of revenue  So AMD s guidance calls for growth of just 9  from that higher figure  Given all the new products AMD has launched since then  the guidance is a little concerning 
4  Solid full year growth expected
For the full year  AMD expects to grow revenue by 28  to 30   driven by growth across all businesses  AMD should be able to win market share in the PC CPU  server CPU  and graphics markets  However  for a stock that s valued at more than 70 times adjusted full year earnings  that may not be enough to satisfy investors 
AMD s results this year will also benefit from the launch of the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X  AMD chips power both new consoles  so the company will get a revenue boost once those semi custom chips begin shipping  The third quarter is usually the strongest for AMD s console chip business  as inventory is built up for the holidays 
AMD stock was down more than 6  on Wednesday afternoon  as the market digested a somewhat complicated report  The revenue and earnings beats were offset by so so guidance  and a lofty valuation raised the stakes 
AMD could outperform its outlook this year if it can turbocharge its market share gains  but the stock may have gotten out ahead of what the company can realistically deliver ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poz5b,2071788
220305,441821,AMD,Advanced Micro Devices  Has the Stock Reached Its Peak ,news,"Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  cruised its way to the top in 2019  with the stock up nearly 150   Since the start of 2020  the chipmaker s stock continues to advance  with its shares reaching an all time high of  52 81 in January  
Propelling AMD s extraordinary growth in 2019 was its progress in gaining additional market share  roughly 5  year over year  from long term rival Intel  NASDAQ INTC  and a rise in its graphics card business  Although these catalysts show promise  the stock is trading lower after reporting fourth quarter earnings on Jan  28 
What are the differences between a chip  a processor  and a graphics card  A graphics card facilitates the display of images from computer data  It s different from a chip  or a microchip  which is a wafer of semiconductor material that stores the processor and the memory unit called Random Access Memory  RAM   The processor is the central processing unit  considered to be the  brain  of the computer  

Not so flawless quarter
AMD narrowly topped Wall Street s earnings expectations to close out 2019  The chipmaker reported quarterly revenue of  2 13 billion   20 million higher than analysts estimates  and adjusted EPS of 0 32  topping projections by  0 01  
Although top  and bottom line results were stellar  a few segments of AMD s business missed estimates  The positives came from its computing and graphics segment  reporting revenue of  1 66 billion   160 million higher than analyst expectations  This segment focuses on graphics cards and chips  featuring products including Ryzen processors and Radeon graphics cards 
Growth in this segment helped AMD offset lower revenues from its enterprise  embedded  and semi custom segment  which had mixed results  This segment contributed to  465 million revenue   142 million lower than projected  This segment focuses on chips for servers and custom made chips including EPYC processors  The key area of declining revenue from the semi custom sales were partially offset by the success in EPYC processor sales  This breakdown shows that the chipmaker faces some difficulties in its enterprise  embedded  and semi custom business  especially with sales of its semi custom product 
With these difficulties presented  investors may want to pay close attention to the outlook for clues on the trajectory of the stock 
Light optimism in 2020
AMD expects revenue in its first quarter to be  1 8 billion  plus or minus  50 million  suggesting a 42  annualized growth from the prior year  driven by growth in the computing and graphics segment from sales of Ryzen processors  Radeon graphics cards  and EPYC processors  However  this quarterly revenue target would represent a 15  sequential decline  softened by semi custom revenue slowing as the company advances its next generation products as well as impacts from seasonality 
This light forecast implies that the chipmaker may not successfully achieve its targets  especially from a declining product line such as semi custom  When considering the full year forecast  AMD expects about 28  to 30  revenue growth over the prior year  This growth rate seems like an achievable target for the chipmaker considering the successful year it just had reporting full year revenue of  6 73 billion  thanks to increased sales in its computing and graphics segment  
Competition is fierce
Investors should consider potential risks that could weigh on the stock s value  AMD s major region of international business is China    the chipmaker s largest market for desktop and notebook PCs  An economic slowdown or imposed tariffs affecting China could create unfavorable risks for AMD  
When considering the competitive landscape between AMD and Intel  Intel dominates 82  of the market for desktop processors  Although AMD has an 18  market share  the company can win business and generate more revenue from companies focused on large data centers that use processors for servers 
AMD shows strength over Intel in the development of smaller transistors  with the chipmaker able to develop chips at seven nanometers  while Intel failed to bring a 10 nanometer chip to the market  The smaller the transistor  the more efficient and faster the chip  AMD s ability to develop chips with smaller transistors shows promise for the company longer term as it moves to focus on sales from PCs  data centers  and new gaming consoles 
However  Intel seems to be a better investment over AMD in the short term because Intel beat estimates for data center revenue by 13 8  in its Q4 2019 earnings  Although the cloud and data center businesses are unpredictable  Intel could possibly leverage its strengths over AMD s declining segments  
With that in mind  investors should consider the current valuation of AMD through its PEG ratio  This metric provides an accurate valuation measure  and investors should understand that a value of 1 is a perfect correlation between P E ratio and projected earnings growth  A value greater than 1 implies overvaluation  while a ratio less than 1 suggests undervaluation  AMD has a PEG ratio of 0 99  implying that it s approaching overvaluation 
To get a better sense of analyst expectations  it s helpful to make a comparison of the trailing and forward P E ratios  A higher forward P E implies that the market thinks the company is likely to see growth  AMD s forward P E ratio  a measure of share price relative to per share earnings  is 31 05  When comparing this metric against its trailing P E  158 37   this suggests that the market expects AMD will see less growth compared to the prior year  
In 2019  the annual results showed that gross margin  a metric that measures efficiency toward making goods and services  was driven by sales of key products such as Ryzen processors and EPYC processors  While sales of these products will keep growing  other business segments may offset revenue  These financial metrics suggest AMD s stock could fall as its valuation is corrected 
Peak position  peak profits
Investors who currently own AMD may want to consider the short term risks and take some profits off the table  The recent earnings report  future outlook  and current valuation offer clues to potential investors  suggesting the stock may have reached its peak and is not an attractive investment for the long term 
Investors should consider buying Intel because recent success shows it s a tech stock that s better positioned to capitalize on the data center business in the near term ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppjgs,2073233
220306,441822,AMD,Why AMD Stock Has Further to Run,news,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  stock has surged by more than 110  over the last 12 months  as of this writing  as the company continues to win business and grow revenue  
Guidance that came in slightly lower than what analysts were expecting helped send the stock down 6  after the recent fourth quarter earnings report  CEO Lisa Su blame slowing sales of GPUs as consumers await the release of the next generation of gaming consoles  Since the new releases will begin in July  this likely amounts to delayed more than lost revenue  Rather than signaling that the rally has ended  the sell off is more than likely a hiccup in a stock surge set to continue  
The numbers
In the just reported quarter  AMD beat earnings estimates by  0 01 per share  as the company reported  0 32 per share in quarterly profits  It also reported a 50  year over year increase in revenue and came in  20 million ahead of Wall Street s revenue expectations 
As of now  the forward P E measured with 2021 earnings estimates stands at 30 9  Taken by itself  that may appear high  However  this is lower than chipmaker NVIDIA  NASDAQ  NVDA   which trades at around 33 times earnings estimates  But AMD stock remains more expensive than that of longtime rival Intel  NASDAQ  INTC   which sports a forward P E ratio of about 13 75 
Still  when looking at expected profit increases  Intel may appear less appealing   Analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo  Finance predict that Intel will grow earnings by an average of 9 06  per year over the next five years  
This pales in comparison to the five year estimate for AMD  which is at 36 29   Analysts also see a profit increase of 79 7  for the current year for AMD  whereas the current year estimate for Intel is around 3   With this expected growth  AMD s price to earnings to growth  PEG  ratio comes in at just over 1 13  according to Yahoo  Finance  when comparing the forward P E ratio to the five year growth rate Considering the massive profit growth expected in the near future  this seems like a reasonable PEG ratio  


Despite the stellar numbers in its earning report   AMD stock declined by almost 6  following the release of results  The company reported that it expects  1 8 billion in revenue in the first quarter  Since analysts were aiming for  1 86 billion  some investors sold  However  the company s estimate represents 42  revenue growth from the year ago level 
AMD has spent most of its history playing  little brother  to Intel  One of the few ways AMD still lags Intel now favors its investors 
For the upcoming quarter  analysts forecast revenue of  19 02 billion for Intel  While that would mean 18 4  revenue growth  it s still less than half of the expected growth rate of AMD s revenue  AMD is starting from a smaller base  so it s easier to see big jumps in its revenue   
AMD grew into one of the better performing tech stocks over the last five years  Despite a run up from a 2015 low of  1 65 to the roughly  48 per share price of today  AMD remains about one fifth of the current size of Intel  AMD s market cap stands at around  56 billion versus about  278 billion for Intel  There is room to grow 
AMD continues to win
As AMD stock fell below  2 per share  many had left it for dead as it struggled to find its way following the end of the PC era 
Under Su s leadership  AMD became a viable alternative to what looked like NVIDIA s continued dominance in graphics chips  Moreover  it has taken a significant technological lead over Intel in the CPU race  At CES  AMD introduced the 7nm Ryzen 4000 chip  This means yet another 7nm offering at a time when Intel only produces 10nm chips  Smaller transistors tend to offer faster processing and higher power efficiency  AMD has the potential to not only catch but possibly surpass Intel  
The company signed some crucial contracts in 2019  Among its victories was winning the contract to power Sony s  NYSE  SNE  upcoming release of the PS5 gaming console  Microsoft  NASDAQ  MSFT  will also use AMD chips in its Xbox console  AMD also won a deal  along with Cray  a subsidiary of Hewlett Packard Enterprise  NYSE  HPE   to power the world s fastest supercomputer  which is expected to bring in more than  600 million 

Is the stock a buy 
Despite a substantial move higher over the last five years  AMD stock still looks like a bargain from a PEG perspective  Moreover  its size compared to Intel implies the company could continue its growth  Furthermore  under Su s leadership  AMD has not only caught its rivals technologically  in many cases  it has surpassed them 
A slightly lower revenue forecast led to some selling of the stock  However  revenue should look up once Microsoft and Sony release their new gaming consoles  Rather than running away  investors should see this as an opportunity to buy into this juggernaut at a slightly lower price ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pre55,2076660

Executive Officer Thank you  Laura  And good afternoon to all those listening in today  2019 marked another major milestone in our multiyear journey  We delivered record annual revenue of 6 73 billion and significantly increased both gross margin and net income as we successfully introduced and ramped the strongest product portfolio in our 50 year history  We grew clients and server processor annual revenue by  1 5 billion in 2019  driven largely by the strong demand for our seven nanometer Ryzen and EPYC processors  powered by our Zen 2 processor core  Looking at the fourth quarter  we ended the year very strong  with quarterly revenue increasing 50  year over year to a record 2 13 billion  while also significantly increasing net income  Turning to our computing and graphics segment  fourth quarter revenue increased 69  year over year to 1 66 billion  Ryzen processor adoption accelerated sharply in 2019  helping to drive significant double digit percentage increases in client processor annual unit shipments  ASPs and revenue  We ended 2019 with our highest quarterly client processor unit shipments in more than six years  based on strong demand for Ryzen desktop and mobile processors  In desktop  we had a very strong holiday season  as our second and third generation Ryzen processors consistently held top sales spots at the largest global e tailers and retailers  We launched our Horizon 3950X processor  and the 24 and 32 core versions of our third generation Ryzen Threadripper processors in November  Our 16 core Ryzen 3950X processor is the world s fastest mainstream desktop processor  while our latest Threadripper CPUs offer unmatched performance for the high end desktop market  In January  we expanded our leadership position in the ATDT market with the launch of our flagship 64 core rising Threadripper processor  which is the world s highest performance desktop processor  In mobile  we had our eighth straight quarter of strong double digit percentage year over year revenue growth as we expanded the number of AMD powered laptops available for major OEMs  We began shipping our Ryzen 4000 mobile processors  powered by our Zen 2 core at the end of the fourth quarter  These new processors double the performance per watt of our prior generation and deliver leadership single threaded  multi threaded  and graphics performance for thin and light notebooks  While enabling the industry s first ultra thin laptops with eight cores  Initial systems featuring the Ryzen 4000 processors are expected to launch later this quarter  and more than 100 AMD based consumer and commercial laptops are planned for 2020 from Acer  ASUS  Dell  HP  Lenovo  and other major OEMs  In graphics  fourth quarter unit shipments grew by a strong double digit percentage year over year  driven by sales of our Radeon RX 5000 series GPUs  featuring our new RDNA architecture  We further expanded our portfolio of RDNA GPUs with the introductions of the 5500XT and 5600XT desktop graphics cards  Highlighted by strong third party reviews that clearly established 5600XT as the most powerful gaming GPU available for under  300  We launched our Radeon 5000M mobile GPUs in the quarter as well  and we are seeing solid design win momentum based on their strong performance and power efficiency  The first laptops powered by the new GPUs are available now  including the recently updated Apple Macbook Pro  and we expect many more notebooks featuring our Radeon 5000M GPUs to launch throughout 2020  Data center GPU revenue increased sequentially  driven by cloud  VDI  and game streaming deployments  We announced a major update to our open source GPU computing software stack in the fourth quarter  featuring performance optimizations  expanded development tools  and support for the most popular machine learning frameworks  We continue making strategic software investments to make it easier for developers to tap into the full capabilities of our Radeon instinct accelerators for HPC and AI applications  For the year  data center GPU revenue grew by a strong double digit percentage  as we continue to make progress growing our presence in this important part of the market  Turning to our enterprise  embedded  and semi custom segment  revenue of 465 million increased 7  year over year  as EPYC processor revenue growth offset declines in semi custom revenue  Semi custom sales continued to soften in the quarter in advance of the next generation console launches from Sony and Microsoft planned this year  For 2020  we expect first quarter semi custom revenue to be negligible  and the ramp of next generation semi custom products to start in the second quarter  with revenue to be heavily weighted toward the second half of the year  In server  revenue grew by a strong double digit percentage as unit shipments and ASPs increased sequentially  driven by demand for our second gen EPYC processors  Our second gen EPYC processors are ramping significantly faster than the first generation  as we see particular strengths for our higher core count models where our performance and TCO advantages are the most significant  Cloud adoption with the largest providers continues to accelerate  driven by the expanding use of EPYC processors to power their critical internal workloads  as well as a significant increase in the number of AMD powered instances publicly available  Shipments to cloud providers increased sequentially by a significant double digit percentage to support expanding build outs at Amazon  Google  Microsoft  Oracle and Tencent  Microsoft announced the availability of four new virtual machines  and AWS announced two new EC2 instances powered by second gen EPYC processors  In the enterprise  Dell began shipping their full portfolio of servers powered by our latest epic processors  We have doubled the number of EPYC processor platforms in market to more than 100 offerings in the quarter  These new platforms are driving increased enterprise customer engagements  broadening our sales pipeline considerably  In HPC  we secured multiple large wins in the quarter based on our unmatched performance and scalability  highlighted by French  German and U K  national supercomputing center deployments  as well as the San Diego supercomputing center  We are pleased with the significant traction and momentum in our server business and remain on track to achieve our goal of double digit percentage unit share by midyear based on the growing demand for our second gen EPYC processors  I am very proud of our 2019 accomplishments  as the successful ramps of our latest Ryzen  Radeon  and EPYC processors resulted in record annual revenue and substantial increases in gross margin and net income  I want to take a moment to recognize the more than 11 000 AMD ers around the world  whose focus and determination enabled us to achieve these results  We entered 2020 well positioned to continue gaining share across the PC  gaming and server markets  based on having an unmatched portfolio of leadership products  spanning from desktops to laptops  data centers and game consoles  With more than 27 nanometer designs in production or development  we are very excited about our next wave of products that can accelerate our growth in 2020 and beyond  We are still in the early stages of our journey and remain focused on meeting our commitments as we establish AMD as the high performance computing and graphics leader  Now  I d like to turn the call over to Devinder  to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer Thank you  Lisa  and good afternoon  everyone  2019 was an outstanding year for AMD  Our competitive product portfolio and market share gains drove the highest annual and highest quarterly revenue in AMD s history  We achieved our highest annual gross margin percentage and annual free cash flow since 2011  And we improved non GAAP earnings per share by 39  year over year  In short  we are very pleased with our financial performance  Fourth quarter revenue was 2 13 billion  up 50  from a year ago and up 18  from the prior quarter  driven by strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon GPUs  partially offset by softer semi custom sales  Gross margin was 45   up 360 basis points from a year ago  driven primarily by sales of our leadership seven nanometer products  Operating expenses were 545 million  with increased investments in go to market activities and R D  compared to 474 million a year ago  Operating income was 405 million  up 296 million from a year ago  driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin  Operating margin was 19  as compared to 8  a year ago  Net income was 383 million  up 296 million from a year ago  and diluted earnings per share was  0 32 per share compared to  0 08 per share a year ago  Now  turning to the business segment results  Computing and graphics segment revenue was 1 66 billion  up 69  year over year  driven by Ryzen processor and Radeon gaming GPU sales growth  Computing and graphics segment operating income was 360 million  or 22  of revenue  compared to 115 million a year ago  driven by higher revenue  Enterprise  embedded  and semi custom segment revenue was 465 million  up 7  from 433 million in the prior year  The continued growth of EPYC process sales was partially offset by softer semi custom revenue  EPYC processor revenue grew by a strong double digit percentage sequentially  driven by robust shipments of our second generation EPYC processors  EESC segment operating income was 45 million or 10  of revenue  driven by EPYC processor sales  compared to an operating loss of 6 million a year ago  During the quarter  we reduced gross debt by 524 million  which resulted in a GAAP loss of 128 million  These debt reductions result in an annualized interest expense saving of approximately 16 million  Free cash flow was positive 400 million in the fourth quarter  and cash flow from operations was 442 million  Inventory was 1 billion  down 6  from the prior quarter  Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was 469 million  compared to 152 million a year ago  driven by higher quarterly earnings  Now  let me cover the full year results  2019 revenue was 6 73 billion  up 4  year on year  driven by strong growth in computing and graphics segment and sales of second generation EPYC process  partially offset by a decline in semi custom sales  Excluding semi custom  revenue was up more than 20  year over year  Gross margin of 43  was up 420 basis points from the prior year  driven by our current generation of Ryzen and EPYC products  Operating expenses were 31  of revenue as we increase go to market activities and investments in R D  2019 operating income was up 33  from a year ago  to 840 million or 12  of revenue  Net income was 756 million  up 46    47  from the prior year  Turning to the balance sheet  I am extremely pleased with our progress on the strengthening balance sheet  Cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 1 5 billion at year end  while gross debt was 563 million  This represents our highest net cash position since the third quarter of 2006  Full year free cash flow was 276 million  We reduced principal debt by almost 1 billion in 2019  and ended the year with less than  600 million of gross debt  On a trailing 12 month basis  adjusted EBITDA was 1 1 billion  resulting in gross leverage of 0 5 times down from 1 9 times at the end of 2018  Now  turning to the outlook for the first quarter of 2020  We expect revenue to be approximately 1 8 billion  plus or minus 50 million  an increase of approximately 42  year over year  and a decrease of approximately 15  sequentially  The year over year increase is expected to be driven by strong growth in Ryzen  EPYC  and Radeon product sales  The sequential decrease is driven primarily by negligible semi custom revenue  which continues to soften in advance of the ramp of next generation products in addition to seasonality  In addition  for Q1 2020  we expect non GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46   non GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 580 million  non GAAP interest expense  taxes and other to be approximately 18 million  and the first quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1 22 billion shares  For the full year 2020  we expect revenue growth of approximately 28 to 30   driven by strength across all businesses  We expect non GAAP gross margin to be approximately 45   non GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 28  of revenue  and a non GAAP tax rate of approximately 3  of pre tax income  In closing  we had an excellent fourth quarter and an excellent 2019  Our full year financial results highlight the strength of our business model  I look forward to what we have installed for 2020 as we expect to further expand and ramp our leadership portfolio of high performance products to drive revenue growth  gross margin expansion  market share gains  and financial momentum  With that  I ll turn it back to Laura for the question and answer session  Laura Laura Graves    Corporate Vice President  Investor Relations Thank you very much  Devinder  Operator  we re ready to begin polling for questions  Questions   Answers  OperatorCertainly   Operator instructions  One moment  please  while we poll for questions  Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities  Your line is now live Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Thanks for taking my question  and congratulations on the strong growth and execution  Lisa  for my first one  you mentioned the goal to get to kind of this double digit market share in servers by the middle of the year  I m just wondering how the visibility is around in achieving this target  What s driving it  Is it just more instances at existing cloud customers  And as part of that  do you also have a share target for exiting this year Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  Vivek  thank you for the questions  So  look  we are very pleased with how Rome is ramping  We ve been in market now four to five months  and the visibility that we have is  with the cloud guys  we have visibility to the public facing instances  as well as what they re doing in terms of internal workloads  And what we see is just the breadth of the overall workloads that they re using Rome with is expanding  And then  on the enterprise side  you know  with the full portfolio of our partners  HPE  Dell  Lenovo  and the ODM partners  you know  we see just a significant increase in the overall enterprise pipeline that we have for Rome  So  we re very focused on continuing to grow share in the data center market  and we feel good about our mid year market share targets  In terms of our market share targets  Vivek  I think we ll talk a little bit more at our financial analyst day about some of the longer term targets  But certainly  for 2020  we re very focused on growing our overall data center share Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Thanks  And for my follow up  Lisa  how should we interpret the impact of capacity shortages at your main competitor  Have you seen any benefit from that  If not  why not  And then  kind of Part B is  Intel did say that they plan to expand capacity later this year  and they ll focus it more on the PC client side and try to reclaim market share  What effect will that have on the pricing in the market  And does your full year outlook kind of bake any potential impact of that competition Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So  when we look at the PC market  we finished 2019 very strong in the overall PC market  both mobile and desktop  I think that s primarily on the strength of the product portfolio and the expanding customer platforms that we have  There are some discussions about  let s call it  pockets of shortages  But  you know  as I said before  I don t believe    we ve been on this steady increase in market share now for the last eight quarters  and we believe we ve gained share in Q4 as well  so  I think what we see is just the portfolio getting a lot stronger  As we go into 2020  I think we are again enthusiastic about our products  In addition to the Zen 2 based desktop products  we ve added Zen 2 now in the notebook portfolio  and we ll have that for the full year of 2020  So  I think our outlook expect growth in all businesses  including the PC business  And we remain very focused on expanding our market presence in both consumers  as well as commercial PCs Vivek Arya    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Thank you  Miss Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs  Your line is now live Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Hi  Congrats on the strong results  and thanks for taking the question  Lisa  this may overlap a little bit with the next question  but I was hoping to better understand some of the key assumptions behind your full year guidance  For both your PC business  as well as the server business  can you talk to some of the TAM assumptions that you re making in the market share assumptions for the full year  And then I ve got a quick follow up  Thank you Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Sure  Sure  So  let me talk first about the market  and then talk a little bit about how we re seeing the full year  So  if you look at the PC market  I think  the  you know  discussion so far has been  let s call it  2020  flat to maybe down slightly  There have been some concerns raised about the second half of  20 perhaps be a weaker than normal seasonality just due to some of the enterprise refresh cycles that are strong in the first half  We re viewing it as flat  flattish  maybe down very slightly  That being the case  back to the comment I made with Vivek  I think we feel very good about our product portfolio  and especially when we look at sort of our notebook share and our relative opportunity to gain market share  The strength of our Ryzen 4000 series products is significantly stronger than previous generations  and the platforms are also significantly broader  so we feel good about that  In the data center market  again  I would say that the growth of computing continues  You know  from our standpoint  we see it as a good market environment for data center in both clouds  as well as enterprise  When we look at our full year revenue guide of approximately 28 to 30  for the year  the highest growth  you know  from a percentage standpoint will  obviously  be server  just given the expectations in that market  But we expect all of our businesses to grow nicely in 2020  and that s just  you know  again  based on where we are in the product cycle and the visibility that we have with customer design wins  as well as just overall competitiveness Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Great  And then I had a quick follow up on gross margins  One probably for Devinder  You guys are guiding Q1 gross margins to 46   and then 45  for the full year  I appreciate your semi custom business is at a low point in Q1  and a ramp in Q2  and more so in the second half  it s probably dilutive to corporate margins  But if you can kind of walk through some of the puts and takes from a gross margin perspective for the year  that would be helpful  And then related to that  if you can compare and contrast the gross margin profile of your semi custom business going into the next cycle versus the past cycle  product cycle  that would be helpful  Thank you Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer Yeah  let me start  and then Lisa can chime in  Overall  from a margin standpoint  you got it right  We are guiding to the 46  in the Q1 quarter  And then the semi custom business  as we ve said  typically  is lower than corporate average  So  as that product ramps in the second half  obviously  will have an impact on gross margin  The guide for the year is at 45   so we feel good about that having ended 2019 at the 43  level  And from a puts and takes standpoint  it s certainly product mix  And then Lisa talked about the business is ramping and growing in 2020 with the 28 to 30  growth in revenue  Data center  as we ve said before  is above corporate average  The client gross margin is around corporate average  and some graphics  And then the semi custom business has below corporate average gross margins  And that mix of revenue  as it ramps throughout the year  will obviously have an impact on a quarterly basis  From an annual standpoint  we feel pretty good with the guide at 45   in particular  with the seven nanometer products ramping as we get to the year  And that  obviously  benefits the gross margin  Semi custom business  Lisa  you want to chime in on the difference between generation to generation Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  No  I think as you said  Devinder  the semi custom margins tend to be below corporate average on a gross margin basis  Although  on an operating margin basis  given the contribution from our customers for the R D  is actually quite good  As it relates to generation to generation  the way to think about it is  in the first year of a console ramp  you would expect the margins to be on the lower side  and that s  you know  that s true no matter what  just because you re just starting the product ramp  and you should expect that the margins will get better as that ramp continues over time Toshiya Hari    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Thank you for the color OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen  Your line is now live Matt Ramsay    Cowen and Company    Analyst Thank you very much  Good afternoon  Lisa  I wanted to just start with a question about the  I guess  comparing and contrasting it a little bit  maybe a little weaker than we had    some of us had modeled  And  I guess  due to the console stuff for Q1 in the guidance versus a really strong  so 28 to 30  growth for the year  Maybe you could just sort of lay out the year a little bit at a high level  And just how you guys are sort of thinking about it coming together from the point of Q1  Thanks Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Sure  So with that  we re pretty excited about 2020  It s a strong year for us  certainly  with  you know  the expectations of being around 28 to 30  revenue growth  We do expect all of our businesses to grow  I think  relative to the Q1 guide  if you look at Q1 as an absolute number  it is up over 40  year on year  even with semi custom revenues  you know  very low in Q1  And so  that should give you an idea of the strength of the rest of the business  From a sequential basis  Q4 to Q1  it s what we said on the call  There is some bit of normal seasonality  just as we are consumer focused in our PC portfolio  So  you expect that that would go down from Q4 to Q1  And then we do have the factor that the semi custom profile  when we re doing a product transition  has the revenue very low in Q1  You know  it starts ramp in Q2  but it s very heavily weighted in the second half of the year  So  you should think about semi custom for this year  again  it s a ramp year  so it s a little bit different  that over 80  of the revenue for semi custom will be in the second half of the year  compared to the first half of the year  So overall  we think a very strong year  A little bit of reprofiling of revenue  particularly as it relates to semi custom  And you know  we look forward to executing it Matt Ramsay    Cowen and Company    Analyst No  thanks for that  As a follow up  I guess  for both of you  but maybe for Devinder  just a couple of little pieces  For me  it looks like  on the operating expense side  you re going to be up in the neighborhood of mid 20s for the full year in the annual guidance that you outlined  Maybe you could talk a little bit about the focus of that  Is it branding and marketing in the PC and server spaces as you grow  or is it in other areas in R D  And then  secondly  I think you guys had disclosed the data center revenue mix  So  GPU plus server in prior quarters  And if you have that number handy  that would be really helpful  Thank you Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer Yeah  let me take the second one first  You know  data center  it s as  you know  we said in the past  mid teens of revenue  And this quarter  it is around the same  mid teens of the total revenue  And I ll point out that it is record revenue in the quarter  so that s pretty good  And we feel pretty good about that  having mid teens revenue in the data center  combined server  and data center GPU on revenue of  2 1 billion  As far as opex is concerned  you know  our guide for the year is about 28  of the revenue guide that we provided  And you are right  fundamentally  the investments are  you know  R D and go to market  and obviously  the business is growing  So obviously  there s investments needed to go ahead and grow the business from an absolute standpoint  but we feel we can manage it to about 28  of our revenue overall for the year Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Matt  the only thing I ll add to that is for the data center revenue  particularly in Q4  it was very heavily weighted toward server CPU  just given some of the lumpiness of the data center GPU revenue Matt Ramsay    Cowen and Company    Analyst Thank you both  Congrats OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies  Your line is now live Mark Lipacis    Jefferies    Analyst Great  Thanks for taking my question  I had one for Devinder  and one for Lisa  For Devinder  the    I think it s impressive that the cash that you generated 10 years ago  you were at  4 billion in net debt  Now  you re net cash positive  I didn t think back then we d expect you to be here  But how should we think about capital structure going forward  And the    and for the  400 million    440 million in cash flow from operations  I had a challenge reconciling it  Can you share the biggest two or three sources of cash  And then for Lisa  the last time AMD had a product cycle in servers  I think you were gaining    once you hit 5  share  you started to gain share at two or three or 4  400 basis point clip per quarter  How should  you know  what is the right kind of cadence or pace of share gains in servers this cycle  And maybe you could just talk about  structurally  what gates your ability to    or the pace of your ability to gain share  Is it capacity from your suppliers  is it your own engineering support infrastructure  or is it your customers testing and importing workloads  If you could give us a framework to think about that  I think that would be helpful  Thank you Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer Yeah  let me get started  Mark  You do have a long memory  and so do I  I do remember the days when we had the challenge on the balance sheet  And one thing we feel good as we end 2019 is the strength of the balance sheet  and in particular  the net cash position  We haven t been in many  many years  as we pointed out in the prepared remarks  You know  From a capital structure standpoint  the priority is investing in the business  The revenue is growing significantly in 2020 is what we re projecting at 28 to 30  over 2019  And also  we want to invest in the roadmap  the go to market and everything that s needed when the revenue ramps as significantly as it is going from year over year  so that s really the allocation priorities  From a viewpoint of where the 440 million comes from  you know  higher revenue  especially when you look at the revenue in Q3 and Q4 of 2019 compared to the first half of the year  We did go ahead and buy the inventory to go ahead and support the higher revenue  And as you know  when you sell that revenue  in particular  when it ramps up  you know  as it did on better margins  it generates the cash  and that s why you have the 440 million plus operating cash flow from an overall standpoint  Lisa  would you Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So  Mark  as it relates to  you know  just server rate and pace  I think the most important thing for us is when we look at  you know  from time of announcement or time of shipment to  you know  how customers actually deploy and trying to shorten that cycle  So  when I look at the difference between  let s call it  Rome and Naples  we ve seen that time to deploy actually significantly shortened with Rome  And so  in terms of rate and pace of server share gain  it is primarily for cloud customers  It is having them deployed  not just  you know  sort of a set of instances  but ensuring that they get fully built out across all regions in the world  and also adding additional workloads  So  it s just  you know  time  is what I would say  And then  as it relates to enterprise customers  I think the platform coverage that we have with Rome is significantly broader than it was with Naples  And so  I m quite encouraged actually by the strength of the pipeline that we see  the number of customers that are engaged  and then just  you know  how they re deploying  So  I think we re going at a good pace  and we ll continue to accelerate that as we go through  you know  2020 Mark Lipacis    Jefferies    Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research  Your line is now live Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    Analyst Hi  guys  Thanks for taking my question  I had  first  a question on gross margin  especially in Q1  You said consoles are negligible  Gross margins are 46   so that suggests that that 46  is basically indicative of the business as it stands without consoles  So  does that represent kind of the peak of the business on the current mix  I m a little surprised it s not higher  given all the new products in aggregate  we re supposed to have gross margins in excess of 50   and most of the mix today should be new products  So  I guess  how do we think about the Q1 gross margins in the context of that  And what are the drivers that take it higher from here  Is it basically just server mix  or is there something else that can help with that  Thank you Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer Let me get started  and Lisa can add  But  you know  Stacy  as we talked about product transitions  the 46  guide in Q1  we recently introduced the next generation notebook products  And as product transitions go  you still have legacy product that you sell before you get  you know  converted over to the new technology and the new generation products  The desktop products were ahead of that from that standpoint  and that did benefit our margin in the 2019 timeframe  And you are right  the console being negligible revenue in Q1 of 2020  it does benefit  and then the margin is 46   And from an overall standpoint for the year  it is 45   and that s because the semi custom business  which is lower than corporate average  does come back  And as Lisa said earlier  we re expecting 80  of that in the back half of the year  But by that time  also  the new generation products and the other businesses  including data center and client reramping all on seven nanometer  and that should help the gross margin to offset some of the impact that we have on the semi custom business Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    Analyst Thank you  Oh  go ahead Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer No  that s OK  Stacy  I was just going to add to what Devinder said  So  we don t expect the client notebook mix to fully cut over to the new seven nanometer products until later in the year  And in terms of  you know  opportunities to improve margins  it is definitely product mix  So higher mix of server  as well as higher mix of  let s call it  Ryzen 7s and Ryzen 5s versus some of the legacy products Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    Analyst Got it  Thank you  For my follow up  if I sort of squint at the second half  it seems to me you re probably guiding it implicitly  call it  800 million to  1 billion over the second half of 2019  How much of that do you think is consoles versus non consoles  because it s not hard to get a console number  especially in the beginning of a ramp that s not that far off that number  which doesn t leave all that much room to ramp the rest of the business  So  is this just conservatism  or what else are you expecting here  How much of that second half do you think is consoles versus non consoles Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  I think  as I perhaps answered to one of the earlier questions  when I look at the full year at 28 to 30   you know  sort of revenue growth  expect server to be significantly above that  and then  the rest of the businesses are all going to grow nicely  And so  you would expect significant double digit growth in the client business  as well as  you know  in the semi custom business  and overall  we see the aggregate of it to be a very strong year  So  it is not all console weighted  if that s what you re asking Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    Analyst OK  Wouldn t you get that just from the nature of the ramp that we saw in 2019  we ll be doing the compare already  I guess that s why I m trying to sort of normalize second half to second half  I think we get strong double digits in second half versus second half growth across all the businesses Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer I would say  in aggregate  you will see  So let me help you this way  So  what we said in 2019 is  2019  overall  we grew 4   On an annual basis  but  excluding semi custom  we grew over 20  through all the rest of the businesses  If I do that same type of calculation  excluding semi custom for 2020  we would still say the rest of the businesses would grow greater than 20  Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    Analyst OK  Thank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from David Wong from Instinet  Your line is now live David Wong    Nomura Instinet    Analyst Thanks very much  Devinder  you said the sequential decrease in the March 2020 quarter is driven primarily by the drop in game console chips  Does that mean that you expect your microprocessor and graphics revenues will be flattish sequentially  Or if not  roughly  what does your guidance assume in terms of percentage sequential drop for  say  PC processors and GPUs  Do you get server processors sales rising sequentially Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer No  I don t think I said specifically that Q4 to Q1 is all due to semi custom  That obviously helped the margin  but there is a product mix underneath that helps  especially with the notebook products  that we talked about  that are moving to seven nanometers  And then  I think your second question s about sequential from Q1 outwards  is that right  David David Wong    Nomura Instinet    Analyst No  no  I was talking about revenues from December into Q1  the sequential drop  Can you give us some idea of    I mean  there s a big chunk that s game consoles  right  But what about the non gam console part of it Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer It is seasonality  Seasonality in the business  We have the consumer weight from a revenue standpoint in our CG segment  And we go from Q4 to Q1  you do have the seasonality coming into play  and typical seasonality is what driving the other portion of the decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1 Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  David  I think what you re asking is  you know  we would expect that the computing and graphics segment would be down sequentially due to seasonality  and we would expect that server CPUs should be up  because  you know  we re continuing to ramp those processors sequentially David Wong    Nomura Instinet    Analyst OK  great  And can you give us some idea of what new GPUs you re expecting to launch through the rest of 2020 for PCs and for data center Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So in 2019  we launched our new architecture in GPUs  It s the RDNA architecture  and that was the navy based products  You should expect that those will be refreshed in 2020  and we ll have a next generation RDNA architecture that will be part of our 2020 line up  So  we re  you know  pretty excited about that  and we ll talk more about that at our financial analyst day  And on the data center GPU side  you should also expect that we ll have some new products in the second half of this year David Wong    Nomura Instinet    Analyst Great  Thanks so much OperatorThank you  Next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley  Your line is now live Joe Moore    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Great  Thank you  Devinder  you had talked about consumer graphics as being below corporate gross margin  I guess  I was thinking that    I know you ve historically had a high cost structure because of high bandwidth memory  but as the product portfolio increasingly doesn t use high bandwidth memory  is there the prospect to improve that for consumer GPU to be closer to where your competitor s gross margins are Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer I don t think I specifically said that  I said some of our graphics products are below corporate average from a gross margin standpoint in addition to the semi custom being below average Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer And I think  Joe  maybe just to answer your question in terms of what we expect in consumer graphics  I think    look  we re investing in consumer graphics  We think gaming is a very important segment  whether we re talking about consoles or discrete graphics  And the work that we re doing around the RDNA architecture and the future generations of our DNA architecture  we believe  will continue to improve our offerings for both consumer graphics  as well as data center graphics Joe Moore    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  great  Thank you  And then with the new console builds  you mentioned that that starts in Q2  but it s mostly in the back half of the year  I guess  as you think about that opportunity from a unit standpoint  is it the right way to look at it  you know  sort of a similar number of units to what we had in the first year of the current console cycle  Or is there  you know  does the compatibility that you bring when you have an 886 CPU still  and there s probably a little bit more similarity between the consoles  could that point us to a sort of a better console unit market in 2020 than we saw six years ago  Like  how are you thinking about it  just the size of opportunity Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So  we do think there s some pent up demand for the next generation of consoles  you know  without forecasting what our customers are planning  I would say they re both   we re planning for a strong first year  and we ll have to see how things develop as we go through the ramp  But the overall sentiment is that  you know  there has been  let s call it  a lull in console sales in the second half of 2019 going into in 2020  sort of  you know  for some of this anticipation of the next generation Joe Moore    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Great  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question today is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays  Your line is now live Blayne Curtis    Barclays    Analyst Thanks for taking my question  Maybe just following up on Joe  I just want to make sure I heard you right  I thought you said the semi custom as well  we grow double digit  I just want to confirm that  And then just following on  I don t know if the units are going to be  but is there a content or ASP story to layer on top of that equation as well Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So I did say that semi custom should grow double digit as well  And again  it s a strong year for us  And then as it relates to content  again  it s fair to say that there is additional content in this generation versus previous generation Blayne Curtis    Barclays    Analyst Gotcha   And then maybe just on the gross margin equation  Is there a way to talk about the mix of seven nanometer  that s a big tailwind still seems early days  at least across a couple of your products  Is there a way to kind of think about the whole company and what the mix of seven is Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So  we just completed the fourth quarter  and it was a very strong quarter for us  record revenue for the company  And I would say about half of that revenue was seven nanometer based  and the other half  not yet  And so  there is still a significant ramp as we go into 2020  but we re pleased with how quickly we ramped  you know  in 2019 Blayne Curtis    Barclays    Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst Yeah  Good afternoon  guys  Congratulations on the solid results  I just want to go back to the gross margin bridge from Q1 to the full year  I just want to make sure I understand  The drop from Q1 to the full year  is that 100  being driven just by gaming coming back more aggressively in the back half of the year  or have you baked in anything for either pricing competition from the No  1 guy out there or some share shifts  How do I think about that  Is it all about gaming Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer I think if you    maybe Devinder  you   Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer No  go ahead Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer All right  So  I think if you look at it  the predominant factor  if you re talking about  you know  Q1 guide of 46  versus full year at 45  it s just as we wrap those consoles  there s  you know  there s some impact of that  As it relates to the pricing environment and what we re expecting  you know  we re expecting a competitive pricing environment  and that s the way we built our model  So  we ve always expected that the competition will be very aggressive on both the CPU  as well as the GPU side  and you know  that is  you know  part of the inherent model for the company John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst That s helpful  Lisa  And then you guys have a ton of goodness on your immediate plate on the server side and the data center side  just with the workloads you re going after  But I m kind of curious  you answered an earlier question saying you expect more GPUs for the data center  And I don t want you to pre announce product  but then how should I think about your positioning for AIs and workload and acceleration  And just given some of the heavy lifting that NVIDIA had to do around CUDA  how do I think about the investment there  Is this an area that you think you have some unique IP you can bring to  or how do I think about that over the next couple of years Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So  I think that s actually a good way of talking about the opportunity  John  I think the CPU opportunity is very immediate and in front of us as we look at the opportunities with Rome and the expanding opportunities  I think the data center  you know  GPU market continues to be an important growth sector for us  and now  I call that over the several year horizon  So  when you look at the opportunities that we have  when we combine our CPU and GPU IP together  they re very  very strong  I mean  for example  this is the reason that we won the Oak Ridge National Lab Supercomputer with Frontier  which are actually both the CPU and GPU win  and some of the optimization that we ve done with that overall system  We think that there are additional opportunities like that  as well as machine learning and AI opportunities  Our focus there has been to work with large cloud providers  to optimize the machine learning frameworks  And we had some key milestones that we completed in the fourth quarter that will continue to be a focus for us in 2020 and beyond John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst Is it fair to say some of the GPU data center announcements this year go beyond just the cloud gaming market Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  I think you should expect that we will have  you know  additional  you know  sort of customer announcements outside of cloud gaming John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst Thanks  guys OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS  Your line is now live Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst Thanks a lot  I guess I had another question  just  Audio gap  gross margin  Audio gap  of the year s revenue in semi custom would be in the back half  But how does that break out between September and December  I guess  I asked that because I m just  you know  trying to see what the gross margin will be exiting this year if you strip out semi custom  Could it be 50  exiting the year  Thanks Devinder Kumar    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial Officer  and Treasurer I think  you know  it s hard to break it down that way  We are in the initial stages of planning for the ramp  and you re asking about Q3  Q4  We are projecting about 80  of the semi custom revenue  growing double digits year over year in Q3 and Q4  And typically  when we have this new game launches  our peak quarter from a revenue standpoint in semi custom will be Q3  But Q4  when you talk about the ramp of the product  especially in the first year of the ramp  it s hard to project how much it will be and then what the impact would be exiting 2020 from a gross margin  excluding semi custom  Maybe as we get closer to that and talking about three to six months  we can probably give you a better idea of that Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst I got it  OK  thank you  And then  can you just talk about what your share targets are for the year in PC  I think you re 17  18 in notebook  and you re maybe 14 in desktop  Can you just talk about how much share you think that you can gain this year given all the moving parts with the shortages and what not Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So  I m not sure I m going to forecast a share target for 2020  I will say  though  if you take a look back at the last eight quarters  we ve been on a fairly steady share gain in PCs  somewhere between  you know  depending on the quarter  let s call it  50 to 100 basis points per quarter  and that changes between desktop and notebook  I think we grew somewhere on the order of four points a share  So  we believe that we still have additional opportunities  and particularly  our focus is going to be both notebook  as well as commercial  And those are good opportunities for us and play well to our new Ryzen  you know  4000 mobile processors Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst OK  Lisa  Thank you so much Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Tim OperatorThank you  Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now live Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Hey  guys  Most of my questions been answered  and it kind of lines up with the model we got here  but I just want to make sure I got a couple of quick questions  And so  basically  for Q4  it looks like semi customer is probably down 50  sequentially  or somewhere around that range  Is that    am I leasing the ballpark  And then  secondly  from a server perspective  I m not expecting you to give numbers on this  but maybe qualitatively  how much of your revenue is going to be cloud versus enterprise  And I think that s one of the bigger debates  and I don t expect specifics  but anything you could to help us understand what should be the mix between cloud and enterprise for calendar  20 Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  sure  Mitch  So  look  I think you re right  When you look at the semi custom business in the fourth quarter  it was a bit softer than originally anticipated  So  we had originally said last quarter that we thought the second half of the year would be down high 30s  and we were actually down  you know  more than that for the second half of the year and for Q4  And as it relates to mix of cloud versus enterprise for 2020  You know  I mean  it will move around from quarter to quarter  but I think the best guess at this point is  let s call it  roughly even between the two Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Perfect  Thank you Laura Graves    Corporate Vice President  Investor Relations Operator  we have time for one more question  please OperatorCertainly  Our final question today is coming from Srini Pajjuri from SMBC  Your line is now live Srini Pajjuri    SMBC Nikko Securities America  Inc     Analyst Thank you for squeezing me in  Lisa  maybe on the supply side  you know  you re guiding for a pretty strong growth here  I m just curious  have you already logged in the supply for seven nanometer  And as we go into second half of the year  especially as you ramp the game consoles  I believe that those die sizes tend to be very large  I m just curious if you were to get upside  how are you feeling about your supply situation  Thank you Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah  So  TSMC has supported us very well through the first couple of quarters of our seven nanometer ramp here in 2019  I think  as we go into 2020  there will certainly be a significant growth for us in seven nanometer  You know  our current visibility supports the revenue guide that we gave you  It is fair to say that wafer supply is tight  and so  you know  it s really  you know  important for us to be planning well with our customers  and that s what we re working on Srini Pajjuri    SMBC Nikko Securities America  Inc     Analyst Thank you and good luck Lisa Su    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Thank you OperatorThank you  We reached the end of our question

220334,441850,AMD,High Expectations in Line for AMD Earnings and 2020 Outlook,news,"The week of January 31 will be the peak of earnings season  with almost half of the Dow Jones industrials and all the major technology stocks set to report earnings  Among them is Advanced Micro Devices Inc   NASDAQ  AMD  with a report that is due after the bell on Tuesday  With close to a 150  gain in 2019  and with a year to date gain of about 8  as of Tuesday morning  it s an understatement to say that expectations will demand nothing short of a stellar report on earnings and 2020 outlook AMD has managed to shed its past woes  it is winning more share in the processor market and the company is doing well in graphics with game consoles ahead of this year s console refreshes from Xbox and PlayStation  AMD shares recently hit a new all time high of  52 81  and that has surpassed its prior zeniths of 2000 and 2005 when the shares challenged the  40 level  It seems almost impossible to believe that AMD was a mere  2 stock in 2015 AMD s consensus target price heading into earnings was  43 33  While that is under the current share price by more than  6  it is higher than the Refinitiv consensus target of  41 60 just a week earlier and is better than the  37 77 consensus target price on the last day of 2019 div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  AMD has consensus estimates of  0 31 in earnings per share  EPS  and revenue of  2 11 billion for the fourth quarter of 2019  That would be up from  0 08 EPS and  1 42 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2018  It is unclear how far out AMD will offer guidance  but the consensus estimates ahead are as follows 

Q1 2020  0 20 EPS  vs  0 06 EPS a year earlier  and  1 86 billion in revenues  up 46  from a year earlier  
FY 2020  1 13 EPS  up from a projected  0 62 EPS for 2019  and revenues of  8 59 billion  up 28  from expected 2019  

Multiple analysts have made calls heading into earnings and the expectations remain firm Matt Bryson of Wedbush Securities issued a note with an Outperform rating but the same  51 50 target price until forward guidance is offered  A portion of his upside commentary We continue to believe AMD is a structural winner that is positioned to benefit from market share gains through 2021  if not beyond  As such we continue to view the stock as an OUTPERFORM  We however  are leaving our  51 50 target in place until we get an update around numbers  particularly in light of the recent certainty around the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus on technology supply demand  We anticipate AMD realized greater than anticipated results in PCs tied to both 1  a strong end demand environment and 2  INTC product constraints that likely benefited AMD share  AMD s PC business also should have benefited from normalization of inventory  sell in  as the company finally appeared to resolve the shortages that had weighed on the high end of its desktop line Merrill Lynch s Vivek Arya has a Buy rating and a  56 price objective on AMD  and that was issued ahead of the earnings call  His earnings preview focused on its share in servers  gross margin improvements an expected launch of its Zen 3 in 2020 and keeping longer term annual guidance at the vest until AMD s March 5 analyst day Other recent analyst calls 
On January 27  Susquehanna maintained its Neutral rating but raised its target price to  50 from  45 
On January 21  Cowen reiterated it as Outperform and raised its target to  60 from  47  noting that AMD was taking market share and was better positioned against Intel for more gains 
Mizuho upgraded it to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to  55 from  38 on January 9 
Wells Fargo reiterated an Overweight rating and raised its price target to  55 from  48 on January 7 
Nomura reiterated a Buy rating and raised its price target from  40 to  58 on January 2 
Rosenblatt reiterated a Buy rating and raised its target to  65 from  52 on AMD on December 31 
RBC Capital Markets reiterated it as Outperform and raised its target to  53 from  50 on December 24 
Needless to say  AMD must deliver solidly on all fronts for some value oriented investors not to bulk at its premium valuation of about 44 times expected 2020 earnings per share AMD was trading up almost 1  at  49 70 on Tuesday ahead of the key earnings report  Its market cap is now  58 billion  and its 52 week trading range is  19 05 to  52 81

220341,441857,AMD,The 3 Bets Every AMD Investor Is Really Making Now,news,"Credit has to be given where it s due  Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su has orchestrated the turnaround she intended to when she took the helm in 2014  The company was largely left for dead by then  but beginning in 2016  revenue turned around well enough to push AMD back into the black in 2018 
The future looks bright enough too  prompting not one but two big analyst accolades this year already  A little over a week ago  Instinet analyst David Wong reiterated his buy rating  but ratcheted up his price target from  40 to  58 on expectations that Advanced Micro Devices would become even more competitive this year  Just a couple of days ago  Mizuho s analyst Vijay Rakesh upgraded AMD from a neutral stance to a buy  touting its prospects for gaining market share in a recovering server market  An impressive showing at this year s annual Consumer Electronics Show bolstered the new optimism 
The pair of analysts and the investors that followed their lead may well be right  too  Although Advanced Micro Devices was the S P 500 s biggest winner in 2019 with its 148  advance  2020 could be another big one for the company s shareholders  Investors who are just now stepping into    or back into    this technology name  however  are ultimately making three dangerous bets they may not even realize they re making 

Bet  1  Valuations don t really matter
Do earnings valuations actually affect a stock s performance  The jury is still out on the matter  Warren Buffett has done well by scooping up stocks at historically cheap prices  but thorough statistical analysis repeatedly struggles to correlate market beating performance with low P E ratios 
The truth is likely to be somewhere in the middle of the two extremes  meaning it is possible to overpay for a stock  but impossible to know if and when you re doing so 
To the extent valuations do matter though  Advanced Micro Devices offers the least amount of upside among any of the major tech hardware names  That s the case on a near term and long term basis 

Data Source  Thomson Reuters
Bet  2  Server spending will recover in 2020 after 2019 s lull
Mizuho s Rakesh believes this year s server market will be  stronger than  the  muted consensus  following relative weakness last year  It slumped to the tune of 7  in 2019  and while forecasts are modeling a 5  increase in server hardware spending for 2020  Rakesh is modeling 7  growth  He further anticipates AMD leveraging its new wares to capture more than its fair share of that expansion at the expense of NVIDIA and Intel  driven by the usual cyclical demand after a few quarters  worth of slowdown 
It s a risky assumption  though  While seemingly overdue for a cyclical refresh of data centers  IT market research outfit Forrester fears overall tech spending growth    at least in the U S     will slow again in 2020  Furthermore  Forrester says  the lion s share of that spending growth will be on software rather than hardware  a premise fellow tech market research house Gartner reflected in October with its IT spending outlook  It believes enterprise software spending will swell by nearly 11   while spending on data center systems will grow by a more muted 2 6  this year  and trail to an even more modest pace of 1  in 2021 
Perhaps more concerning is that both outlooks are based on an assumption that the global economy won t buckle this year  but instead continue moving forward  Even a modest headwind could easily spook corporations and consumers into tightening their belts 
Bet  3  Trajectory momentum will override prevailing opinion
Finally  while Instinet and Mizuho are singing Advanced Micro Devices  praises  it s noteworthy that the rest of the analyst community isn t quite as optimistic despite their access to the exact same information  and plenty of time to respond to it  As a group  these professionals still rate AMD somewhere between a buy and a hold  and still sport a consensus target of less than  40 per share  That s nearly 20  less than the stock s present price 
Even without the analyst community s relatively reserved stances  however  one can t help but wonder if the recent cheerleading reflects hope that the stock s performance for the next few months will look like its performance over the course of the past few months  Remember  Rakesh switched his stance on AMD to neutral in July of last year  The stock floundered for a couple of months  but ended up rallying from  28 to  49 between October and this month  It s quite a move for any analyst or investor to miss out on  setting the stage for what could be seen as performance chasing now 
Bottom line
Of course  none of this has to mean Advanced Micro Devices won t move higher in the foreseeable future  It s been rather apt to defy valuation logic and analyst pessimism  and push past demand headwinds that essentially brought revenue growth to a standstill in 2019  Investors kept their eye on the long term trajectory  and were rewarded for doing so 
There s only so much heavy lifting a premise or trajectory can do  however  Beyond that  additional gains have to be built on actual results that may prove tough to achieve  Newcomers are betting the stock s not yet reached that pivotal point  Notice not everyone is taking that bet ",2020-01-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ph3do,2057626

220343,441859,AMD,Could AMD Be a Millionaire Maker Stock ,news,"Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  has been on a roll in recent years  The stock has gained 1 670  since the start of 2016 and 304  over the past two years alone  If you invested  50 000 in AMD five years ago  you re holding a position worth  1 07 million today 
AMD is already making millionaires out of ordinary long term investors  but how much further can the stock rise 
Realistic expectations
A  50 000 investment in AMD is not likely to make you a millionaire  Repeating the stellar returns of the last half decade would push AMD s share price above  900 per stub and the market cap would pass a trillion dollars 
That s simply not a realistic five year goal  and it s rather unlikely that AMD will reach that kind of rarefied air in the foreseeable future  If AMD makes any more millionaires at this point  they ll have to start from original AMD investments far larger than  50 000 

Growth drivers
AMD is operating under a highly competent team  led by CEO Lisa Su  and the company rarely makes a mess of its business plans these days  AMD is stealing market share from NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  in the graphics processor market while taking advantage of a rare manufacturing process advantage to poach desktop and server processor sales from Intel  NASDAQ INTC  
AMD will also benefit from the introduction of new video game consoles this fall  Both the Sony  NYSE SNE  PlayStation 5 and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  Xbox Series X will be based on custom versions of AMD s graphics and core processors  just like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 generation 
Looking beyond these short term sources of potential stock fuel  I like the way AMD is investing in its own future  The research and development budget is growing faster than AMD s incoming revenues  and the same goes for its capital expenses  In other words  AMD is doing its level best to support innovation and new ideas  That s a fantastic way to run a high tech company like AMD 

AMD Research and Development Expense  TTM  data by YCharts 
How much longer can AMD stay perfect 
So AMD has a lot going for it  but investors have already priced most of these advantages into its current stock prices  The optimistic projections may already have raced too far  too fast 
The stock is trading at nosebleed valuation ratios like 253 times trailing earnings and 26 times the company s book value  In other words  AMD s stock is priced for perfection  and any misstep along the way could trigger a massive crash 
Now  AMD has surprised me before  I made the same  priced for perfection  argument in 2017 and the stock has nearly quadrupled since then  Pulling the same trick on me today would make AMD s market cap comparable to sector giant Intel  whose annual revenues are 12 times larger than AMD s  Intel s profit margins are also much wider than AMD s  resulting in far richer earnings and cash flows 
Predicting that AMD will pass Intel as the preeminent processor provider might make sense from an extremely long term point of view  stretching across several decades  That s a fine argument for holding an AMD position  but you re very likely to see the stock take some major haircuts along the way 
So this is a classic growth stock dilemma  Yes  AMD might be able to create long term wealth for its investors  but this is probably not the best time to start a position in the stock due to an extremely bumpy road ahead  Even long term AMD bulls may want to wait for the next price drop before backing up the truck ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkxc0,2064068
220344,441860,AMD,AMD s RX 5600 XT Is a Midrange Champion,news,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  made some big claims when it announced the  279 RX 5600 XT graphics card earlier this month  Priced the same as NVIDIA s  NASDAQ NVDA  GTX 1660 Ti  the RX 5600 XT provided up to 20  better performance in AAA PC games  according to AMD s testing 
NVIDIA responded to AMD s announcement with a price cut on a more expensive graphics card  NVIDIA brought the price of the RTX 2060 down from  349 to  299  making it the de facto competitor to AMD s latest midrange graphics card 
Based on third party reviews of the RX 5600 XT  NVIDIA s price cut wasn t enough to swing the value proposition in its favor  Tom s Hardware ran a full slate of tests on an overclocked version of the RX 5600 XT from board partner Sapphire  finding that the card beat out the RTX 2060 in most cases 

Competitive below  300
The Sapphire card tested by Tom s Hardware features higher clock speeds than the base version  along with a higher  289 price tag  That s still  10 cheaper than NVIDIA s RTX 2060  One thing to note  The card tested uses a last minute firmware update that boosted clock speeds and performance  Other variants of the card may not perform as well 
Except for a few cases  the RX 5600 XT produced higher frame rates than the RTX 2060 at a 1080p resolution  The story was the same at a higher 2560x1440 resolution  with the RTX 2060 coming out on top only in a few of the games tested by Tom s Hardware 
The overclocked RX 5600 XT uses quite a bit more power than the base version  but still a bit less than the RX 2060  AMD seems to have caught up with NVIDIA in terms of power efficiency  an area where it s struggled in recent years 
 AMD s 5600 XT  specifically the Sapphire Pulse OC used for testing  has really shown some mettle in our performance tests  being able to match and perform a bit better than NVIDIA s more costly  even after price drops  reference RTX 2060  It did so while using less power  too   concluded the Tom s Hardware review 
NVIDIA will strike back this year
While NVIDIA is resorting to price cuts to keep its graphics cards competitive  the company is expected to launch cards based on its new Ampere architecture sometime this year  Ampere cards will use a 7nm manufacturing process  matching AMD and likely bringing substantial performance and efficiency improvements compared to NVIDIA s current lineup 
AMD also has something up its sleeve for 2020  The company is expected to launch a high end graphics card based on its Navi graphics architecture sometime this year  Currently  AMD is competitive up to the  400 price point  Above that  NVIDIA reigns supreme  AMD has tried and failed to break into the high end of the market over the past few years  This time could be different 
AMD had a unit share of less than 30  of the graphics card market  in the third quarter of last year  according to Jon Peddie Research  The company has a lot of ground to make up  and NVIDIA always has the option of price cuts to keep its resurgent competitor in check  But given how good AMD s mid range graphics cards are  it s hard to imagine the company won t pick up some market share this year ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plcc2,2064882

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  rose 148 4  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  The chip designer held on to a rare manufacturing process lead over archrival Intel  NASDAQ INTC  to boost its presence in the markets for data center computing and high end gaming machines 
So what
AMD s manufacturing partners are already able to crank out large scale production runs of processors using 7 nanometer chip traces  Meanwhile  Intel is only getting started on 10 nanometer production runs  Intel is usually the top dog in these manufacturing process battles  giving the larger company a far more cost effective production platform  But the world turned upside down in 2018  so AMD holds that ace card these days 

Now what
The process advantage is not an academic trump card  AMD started shipping 7 nanometer PC processor and graphics chips in the third quarter  and the market embraced these products with open arms  The company posted its highest single quarter revenue haul since 2005 while also expanding its profit margins across the board 
 We have the strongest product portfolio in our history   CEO Lisa Su said in the third quarter earnings call   We re on track to exit 2019 with another quarter of significant growth  driven by the ramp of our 7 nanometer products and believe we are well positioned to build our momentum in 2020 and beyond as we deliver an even stronger set of leadership products that can drive sustained growth  an increased share of the  75 billion markets for high performance computing and graphics technologies

220356,441872,AMD,Should You Buy AMD s Stock at Its All Time High ,news,"AMD s stock  NASDAQ AMD  recently hit a historic high on widespread optimism regarding the growth of its CPU and GPU businesses  However  investors sitting on multibagger gains are probably wondering if the chipmaker still has room to run in 2020  Let s weigh the bullish and bearish cases for AMD to decide 
What the bulls think about AMD
AMD once struggled to effectively compete against Intel  NASDAQ INTC  in x86 CPUs and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  in discrete GPUs  But that all changed after industry veteran Lisa Su took the CEO job in late 2014 

Su plowed AMD s rising cash flows  which mainly came from sales of APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One  into the development of new CPUs and GPUs that would match the performance of Intel and NVIDIA s chips at lower price points 
That bold strategy succeeded  AMD s Ryzen CPUs gained ground against Intel in the PC and data center markets  and Intel fumbled its counterattack with an abrupt CEO change and a chip shortage  AMD s new Radeon GPUs also held NVIDIA s GeForce GPUs at bay throughout the first half of 2019 
Between the first quarters of 2015 and 2020  Intel s share of the CPU market fell from 76 4  to 63 6   according to PassMark  AMD s share grew from 23 5  to 36 3  
Between the third quarters of 2015 and 2019  NVIDIA s share of the discrete GPU market slipped from 81 1  to 72 9   according to research firm JPR  AMD s share grew from 18 8  to 27 1   Moreover  AMD s gross margin actually expanded over the past five years  indicating that the chipmaker hasn t been swapping margins for sales growth 

Source  YCharts
AMD also remained the main chipmaker for Sony s  NYSE SNE  PS5 and Microsoft s  NASDAQ MSFT  Xbox Series X  both of which will launch in late 2020  The bulls believe that all these tailwinds will continue throughout the year and lift the stock to fresh highs 
Analysts expect AMD s revenue to rise just 4  this year  then accelerate to 27  growth next year  They expect its earnings to grow 35  this year  then grow another 79  next year  Those forecasts justify its forward P E of 44  and indicate that the stock still has room to run before overheating 
What the bears think about AMD
Meanwhile  the bears believe that it s only a matter of time before Intel and NVIDIA strike back  AMD is currently producing 7nm chips as Intel struggles to fix its 14nm production issues and ramp up its production of 10nm chips  However  Intel could catch up to AMD with 7nm chips by 2021 

NVIDIA s new Turing GPUs slightly beat AMD s latest Navi GPUs in head to head performance benchmarks  but AMD s GPUs only offer marginally less horsepower at much lower prices  However  NVIDIA has been actively targeting the low end market with impressive cards like the GTX 1650 Super  which only costs about  160  and it could continue to pursue budget gamers this year 
Intel and NVIDIA both have deeper pockets than AMD  and could significantly ramp up their R D and marketing efforts to throttle AMD s growth  Intel also recently announced its first discrete GPU  DG1  which could eventually compete against NVIDIA and AMD s GPUs 
AMD could also face 7nm production bottlenecks at its foundry TSMC as other chipmakers  including Apple  ramp up their production of 7nm chips  A disruption of AMD s supply chain could soften its defenses against Intel and NVIDIA 
Lastly  the bears will note that AMD s insiders sold nearly 39 million shares over the past 12 months but didn t buy a single share on the open market  That lack of insider interest strongly suggests that AMD s stock has gotten ahead of its business 
Should you chase AMD s rally 
I think there are compelling reasons to both buy and sell AMD s stock  However  I believe that AMD s CPU and GPU businesses will continue to flourish as long as Lisa Su leads the company  Intel and NVIDIA will inevitably strike back  but AMD will likely hold its ground with new Ryzen  Eypc  and Radeon chips 
The PS5 and Xbox Series X will give its EESC  enterprise  embedded  and semi custom  business a big boost in late 2020  and AMD will likely funnel that cash into its development of new CPUs and GPUs  Therefore  I strongly believe investors can still accumulate shares of AMD at its all time high ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfh2m,2055075

220366,441882,AMD,3 Reasons Why AMD Was the S P 500 s Top Stock in 2019,news,"On Dec  31  2019  Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  joined the New England Patriots and New York Yankees in an exclusive club of back to back champions  AMD was the top performing stock in the S P 500 in 2019 with a return of 148   This comes after the company also took home first place in 2018 with a return of 80   The two year combined tally is a celebration worthy 346  

Investing has a longer time frame than just one year  Envisioning three to five years into the future is a good starting place  That said  for fun  every year I go through the list of S P 500 companies and try to predict the top stock for the coming year  I didn t pick AMD last January  so when it took the top spot  I had to know what contributed to its success  Here are three reasons why Advanced Micro Devices rewarded investors so well in 2019  and whether they can expect a three peat in 2020 
1  General semiconductor rally
AMD operates in the semiconductor space  one that is notoriously cyclical  New device demand drives semiconductor inventory and prices higher  But in between product updates  inventory can bloat and prices fall  It was a slow year in 2018 for the semiconductor industry  but it picked up again in 2019  particularly in the second half of the year 

Data by YCharts 
The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF is a non leveraged ETF of U S  semiconductor companies and a good benchmark for measuring AMD s results  Of course  the chart shows that AMD outperformed the overall sector by a mile  However  a 60  return demonstrates that 2019 was a great year for the semiconductor industry in general 
So some of AMD s 2019 championship run can be attributed to a recovering semiconductor industry but certainly not all of it  The next two factors show why Advanced Micro Devices outperformed its peers 
2  Key customer product wins
Throughout the year  AMD announced many key customers were sticking with AMD for upcoming products  Sony and Microsoft announced that upcoming PlayStation and Xbox video game consoles will employ AMD system on a chip  SoC  technology  And companies like HP and Dell Technologies launched new laptops that continue to use AMD mobile processors 
Over the last couple of years  Advanced Micro Designs has taken CPU market share from top dog Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Intel is struggling with a chip shortage  and AMD opportunistically launched its Ryzen line    offering a comparable product at a superior price  However  even after losing some market share  Intel is still the company to beat  Even the worst estimates put its market share over 60   
But AMD s biggest computing win came in Oct  2019  when Microsoft launched its first ever AMD powered Surface laptop    historically an Intel stronghold  Not only is this a huge product line with nearly  6 billion in sales for Microsoft s fiscal 2019  but Microsoft s decision could lead even more companies to switch from Intel to Advanced Micro Devices down the line 
3  New product launches
Finally  we should note that while AMD returned 148  for the year  it returned almost 60  in the last three months of 2019 alone  Part of this is attributable to the Microsoft Surface win  but the dramatic upswing also corresponds to the announcement of its Radeon RX 5500 line of products  The low end graphics cards are meant to compete directly with NVIDIA s  NASDAQ NVDA  GTX 1650 
Investors are understandably excited with AMD s graphics potential  Earlier in the year  AMD released higher end graphic cards to compete with NVIDIA s higher end offerings  These products were identical to NVIDIA s in price  However  some believed AMD s graphic cards outperformed those of NVIDIA  That was a surprising development  as NVIDIA was the unquestioned leader in the space  If the RX 5500 line offers comparable or superior performance as well  Advanced Micro Devices could take market share from NVIDIA 
Here s to 2020 
Predicting the top S P 500 stock for 2020 is a tall order  but I don t think AMD will be it  It s rare for a company to win the trophy three years in a row  But Advanced Micro Devices doesn t need to be the top stock  It can still beat the market next year and be a good investment  Much of 2019 s success is attributable to the wins in computing and graphics products  However  one area that underperformed for AMD was its semi custom segment    down 27  year over year in third quarter of 2019  
That segment will pick up in 2020 when Sony and Microsoft prepare for video game console launches  If the computing and graphics segments remain strong  a surge in semi custom revenue should provide a catalyst for the stock to beat the market in 2020 yet again ",2020-01-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pduyb,2052563

Looking at the monthly chart for AMD  we can see that this move lower is coming after testing breakout price resistance  at old highs   And this turn lower may be contributing to a bearish reversal pattern

220401,441917,AMD,Top Stock Analyst Reports For Merck  Philip Morris   American Tower,opinion,"Wednesday  February 12  2020
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Merck  MRK   Philip Morris International  PM  and American Tower  NYSE AMT   AMT   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Merck s shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year   7 9  vs   13 3    The Zacks analyst believes that drugs like Keytruda  Lynparza and Bridion have been driving sales  Keytruda sales are gaining from continued uptake in lung cancer and increasing usage in other cancer indications 
Keytruda has strong growth prospects based on increased utilization  recent approvals for new indications and potential additional approvals worldwide  Animal health and vaccine products remain core growth drivers 
The potential separation into two companies makes strategic sense as the remaining Merck should be able to achieve higher profits than the combined company  However  generic competition for several drugs and rising competitive pressure  mainly on the diabetes franchise will continue to be overhangs on the top line  
 You can  
Shares of Philip Morris have gained  6 5  in the past six months against the Zacks Tobacco industry s rise of  7 8   The Zacks analyst believes that the company continues to battle receding cigarette volumes due to stringent regulations and rising health consciousness 
Notably  strong pricing aided the company s revenues and adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019  Results were also aided by cost efficiencies and gains from RRPs  which  in turn  is benefiting from broad based IQOS growth 
During the quarter  the top line grew and topped the consensus mark  Management expects pricing to be a driver in 2020  and remains focused on its RRP investments  Cigarette volumes are likely to drop in 2020  wherein international industry volumes are also expected to decline due to hurdles in Indonesia among other factors 
 You can  
American Tower s shares have gained  20 9  over the past three months against the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust industry s rise of  8 6   The Zacks analyst believes that the trend in estimate revisions of 2020 funds from operations  FFO  per share indicates a favorable outlook for the company 
Notably  the company is enhancing its macro tower portfolio and focusing on innovation to capture the underlying opportunities  Further  rise in mobile data usage and higher investments in 4G  as well as 5G technology is spurring demand for its telecom towers 
This will likely drive the company s leasing activity and organic tenant billings growth in the upcoming period  In addition  its attempt to increase shareholder value through dividend hikes boost investors  confidence in the stock  Yet  the company has a substantially leveraged balance sheet  Such high debt levels might impede cash flow growth

220402,441918,AMD,Coronavirus Fears Re Emerge  Bringing Risk Off Back Into Favor,opinion," Thursday Market Open  Anyone who went to bed last night thinking the market s coronavirus fears had faded got a rude awakening this morning  Stocks fell sharply overseas and U S  futures plunged after China reported thousands more cases and a larger death toll 
The bad news puts this week s fast paced rally into question as investors wondered if virus concerns might again quiet down the party Wall Street had been enjoying  We ve talked about how the virus is going to be an overhang  and sadly  it still is  There s nothing people can do except hunker down and  of course  watch their health 
After fading earlier this week  fear meters like bonds  gold  and volatility came back into favor today  The 10 year yield slipped below 1 6   the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   jumped above 15  and gold prices are firmer  Crude prices edged down toward  51 a barrel  A risk off tone seems to be back in town 
The travel and leisure sector might be in focus after two days of recovery for many of those stocks  For instance  yesterday saw gains for retailers whose shares had been beaten down by coronavirus  PVH  NYSE PVH  which owns brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein rose more than 4   Ralph Lauren  NYSE RL  was another big gainer  Cruise line and casino firms also made up ground  These stocks could be a good place to watch today for any rapid reaction to the new virus cases in China  RL  for instance  gave back all of its gains overnight 
Markets Due For A Step Back 
Even before China reported these new virus numbers  it seemed possible that the market could be in for a late week reckoning  We ve said it before and will say it again  Things can t go straight up forever  Virus or not  a three day weekend is approaching  and the last two Fridays saw profit taking as a big feature  Maybe these new cases could give some people an excuse to take profit a day early  but we ll have to wait and see how big a factor that is All this isn t to downplay the tragic human toll of the illness  but only to point out that investors might want to consider some caution as Friday approaches  That doesn t mean run for cover  but it could be prudent to take special care and consider limiting the size of your trades today and tomorrow until things get a little more settled around what the new virus numbers might mean It s possible we could learn more about how quickly it s spreading over the next few days  hopefully by the time U S  trading resumes next Tuesday after Monday s President s Day holiday  Any word on the pace of new cases is probably going to be sliced and diced pretty thoroughly by then  Remember  the spread had seemed to be slowing earlier this week The virus was bound to be discussed as China s huge tech firm   Alibaba    NYSE BABA  reported  and shares sank this morning despite the company having a solid quarter  Earnings and revenue topped Wall Street s consensus views  but the CEO said coronavirus is a  black swan  event that presents  near term challenges  to the company s business and could have a  significant impact  on China  Those words might have spooked some investors In other company related news  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  shares put on the brakes this morning when the company announced a  2 billion public offering of shares  Even with today s losses  the stock remains dramatically higher than it was a few months ago  but anyone getting on this train is probably in for some bumps along the way PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP  shares barely budged early Thursday as the company beat analysts  earnings and revenue estimates but delivered an outlook that was a little light on the fizz  Projected earnings growth for 2020 was lower than analysts had expected 
Earnings Roll OnThe earnings beat goes on this afternoon as chipmaker Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA  and digital media firm Roku  NASDAQ ROKU  both report  see more on NVDA below  
Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  managed to inch past analyst expectations for earnings and revenue when it opened the books after yesterday s close  but the stock came under major pressure overnight  It s been a bit of a head scratcher  seeing CSCO up just slightly over the last year even as so many other Information Technology players just keep going up  The focus today appears less on CSCO beating analyst estimates and more on its sinking revenue and falling product orders  The company cited macroeconomic headwinds  
Data also was in the news this morning as weekly jobless claims looked sparkling at a low 205 000  Inflation numbers for January looked unremarkable with a 0 1  headline rise for the consumer price index  
Age Old Question  Do Current Earnings Support Valuations Another reason to consider taking care and not going  all in  might be valuations  This latest surge pushed the forward price to earnings ratio  P E  of the S P 500 Index  SPX  to 19 4 by mid week  The 3 5  coronavirus related selloff earlier this month briefly put the P E back down near 18 5  and even that is historically on the high side  Now we re back where we were before on valuation  making some analysts wonder if prices are justified by underlying fundamentals  
The good thing is that the  E  part of the equation is doing a little better than people thought it might  Earnings probably rose about 1 5  last quarter  according to research firm CFRA  Many analysts had initially expected Q4 results to be in the red  The bad news is that even with growth in Q4  full year 2019 earnings growth would be just 1 3   followed by what CFRA projects will be another quarter of 1 3  earnings growth in Q1  Those aren t numbers to write home about 
It could get better after that  CFRA says  but the 6  earnings growth it projects for 2020 doesn t necessarily solve the elevated P E situation  Still  investors seem to be willing to let valuations hang out a little higher than normal in an environment where inflation and potential rate hikes just don t appear to be in the picture  In addition  the U S  economy continues to be arguably the best one on the block and consumers came out to shop during the holiday season  Consumer sentiment data due for release Friday morning loom large  as they ll be some of the first to reflect any reaction to the virus 






CHART OF THE DAY  Eu rosion  The euro dropped to its lowest level versus the dollar since May of 2017 Wednesday  as indicated by this chart of CME Euro Currency futures   6E    Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  said this week it s expecting a 10 basis point cut by the European Central Bank in Q2  Meanwhile  in two days of congressional testimony  the Fed chairman struck an upbeat tone on the US economy  which the markets may have interpreted as a greater likelihood it will hold the line on rates this year  Data source  CME Group  NASDAQ CME   Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Chips and China  Part Two  Earlier this week  we talked about why semiconductor companies might be partially immune to coronavirus  Problems in the China supply chain could cause chip shortages  raising prices for the end product and allowing the chip makers to benefit from higher prices even as they might see volume dip 
There s another reason these firms might end up not suffering so much from the illness  and that has to do with last year s trade war  Over the last two years  some chip companies started diversifying their supply chains into countries besides China as they worried about how tariffs might affect their China operations  They decided to protect themselves by spreading the wealth  so to speak  One unintended consequence might be that they now have a chance to get over the virus hump more easily because they don t have as much China exposure  If the virus slows production in China  they can simply shift some of their output and supply chain into other countries 
Nvidia Results Up Next  An easy comparison can sure help a company s earnings story  That might be the case for NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   which reports after the close today  Revenue is expected to increase for the first time in more than a year  MarketWatch reported  with sales driven by the data center segment  Both Intel  NASDAQ INTC  and Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  reported strength in data center revenue in their most recent quarters  One worry for NVDA is its gaming business  which MarketWatch says might see a short term headwind from coronavirus  Shares of NVDA have been on a roll lately  maybe a sign that investors remember the company has a history of beating Street estimates  especially on the bottom line  Another point maybe in NVDA s favor is the recent cryptocurrency rally  The company s graphics processing unit  GPU  is used in the cryptocurrency mining process  With shares up 73  from a year ago  one potential worry with earnings is that you can t rule out the chance of some profit taking after the news 
Dollar On a Roll  One aspect of U S  economic strength is arguably the resilient U S  dollar  After a brief slide below 97 in January  the dollar index climbed above 99 on Wednesday  That s the first time it s hit 99 since October  and it s not necessarily the best news for multinational companies that have big markets overseas  A higher dollar makes dollar denominated products more expensive for foreign buyers 
Looking at individual performances yesterday  you wouldn t get the sense people are too worried about dollar strength  Companies with big overseas exposure like  Nike   NYSE NKE   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  all rose sharply  That made the dollar look like background noise until this morning  when PEP said in its earnings release that foreign exchange poses a  headwind

220416,441932,AMD,Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  Tops Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 32 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 30 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 08 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 67   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  0 18 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 18  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Advanced Micro  which belongs to the Zacks Electronics   Semiconductors industry  posted revenues of  2 13 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 22   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 42 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Advanced Micro shares have added about 7 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 4  
What s Next for Advanced Micro 
While Advanced Micro has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 19 on  1 84 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 10 on  8 58 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

220442,441958,AMD,Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  Stock Moves  0 97   What You Should Know,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  closed the most recent trading day at  46 18  moving  0 97  from the previous trading session  This change lagged the S P 500 s daily of 0   Elsewhere  the Dow gained 0 08   while the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 18  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the chipmaker had gained 18 32  over the past month  This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector s gain of 4 19  and the S P 500 s gain of 3 37  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from AMD as it approaches its next earnings report date  On that day  AMD is projected to report earnings of  0 30 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 275   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  2 10 billion  up 48 09  from the year ago period 
AMD s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  0 62 per share and revenue of  6 71 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  34 78  and  3 56   respectively 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for AMD  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability

220511,442027,AMD,Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  Q3 Earnings Match Estimates,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 18 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  0 13 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  0 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 08  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Advanced Micro  which belongs to the Zacks Electronics   Semiconductors industry  posted revenues of  1 80 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 11   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 65 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Advanced Micro shares have added about 82 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 21 3  
What s Next for Advanced Micro 
While Advanced Micro has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 32 on  2 16 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  0 63 on  6 76 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Electronics   Semiconductors is currently in the top 23  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-earnings-match-estimates-200479797,200479797
220522,442038,AMD,Nvidia forecasts demand rebound  Wall Street not so sure,news,"By Sonam Rai  Reuters    Nvidia Corp s forecast of a demand rebound by the end of the year calmed investor nerves and pushed its shares up 5 percent on Friday  but several Wall Street analysts said the outlook was  aggressive  given weak demand and the ongoing U S  China trade war  The chip designer on Thursday forecast full year revenue to be  flat or down slightly  from 2018  but Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said he expects China  gaming and self driving vehicles to drive demand for its chips  Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  Inc had also forecast full year revenue ahead of analysts  expectations  AMD  like Nvidia  is banking on its newest graphics and data center chips to bolster growth for the year  Top chipmakers took a hit in the fourth quarter from a slowdown in China  triggered by the trade dispute  In January  Nvidia cut its fourth quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars because of weak demand in China  The dispute remains an overhang even as negotiators from the two countries are in talks ahead of a March 1 tariffs deadline  While Nvidia could see a double digit drop in revenue in the first two quarters  it is projecting a big 35 percent jump in the fourth quarter to make up for the lost sales  Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster wrote in a note   The key question  is a 35 percent y y growth exiting FY20 realistic  Our belief is that it is not realistic because it is similar to the growth rates during the crypto boom   Munster said  Demand for graphic chips from Bitcoin miners brought in hundreds of millions of dollars for Nvidia in 2018  But at the fag end of the year the boom evaporated  and  coupled with lower demand from China  led to a pile up of unsold chips at distributors and retailers  Nvidia will not be able to make up on all the crypto loss and could likely miss the full year guidance  according to analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insights Group  However  the company still has an opportunity in the form of selling technology for self driving cars  Nvidia s platform is being used by hundreds of companies involved in autonomous cars  including software developers  auto suppliers  sensor and mapping companies  
 Although this  self driving  segment currently contributes relatively little to the top line  we acknowledge the opportunity Nvidia has to grow its presence in cars beyond infotainment as drivers seek autonomous features in newer vehicles   Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri wrote ",2019-02-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-forecasts-demand-rebound-wall-street-not-so-sure-1781250,1781250

term lending facility through which some banks will avail loans at a cheaper rate  Additionally  introduction of a tiered system by the central bank will enable struggling banks to be exempted to pay to the ECB while holding overnight excess cash balance with it Meanwhile  the central bank of the Eurozone reintroduced the quantitative easing program  Effective Nov 1  the ECB will purchase  20

Advanced Micro  which belongs to the Zacks Electronics   Semiconductors industry  posted revenues of  1 53 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 62   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 76 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Advanced Micro shares have added about 81 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Advanced Micro 
While Advanced Micro has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

220586,442102,AMD,AMD revenue forecast disappoints as crypto demand subsides  shares plummet,news,"By Arjun Panchadar
 Reuters    Advanced Micro Devices Inc  O AMD  on Wednesday forecast fourth quarter revenue below estimates as the chipmaker faces dwindling demand from cryptocurrency miners for its high margin graphic processors and excess inventory  sending its shares down 22 percent 
AMD shares  which have more than doubled this year  were trading at  17 84 after the bell 
AMD and Nvidia  its main rival in the gaming chip market  were the biggest beneficiaries of a cryptocurrency boom last year as miners invested in new networks to keep up with demand 
However  with cryptocurrency prices in free fall  mainly due to regulatory worries  demand for the chips have declined 
Graphic Processing Units like AMD s Radeon provide the high computing abilities required for cryptocurrency mining 
Nvidia shares were down 2 5 percent at  194 98 
AMD said it now expects revenue of about  1 45 billion  plus or minus  50 million  below analysts  estimates of  1 6 billion  according to Refinitiv data 
The company said revenue from its graphics and computing business  which sells Ryzen desktop processors and Radeon graphics cards  rose 12 percent to  938 million in the third quarter 
AMD said strong sales of Ryzen chips were partially offset by lower revenue from its graphics business  where blockchain related GPU sales were negligible 
 In graphics  the year over year revenue decrease was primarily driven by significantly lower channel GPU sales  partially offset by improved OEM and data center GPU sales   Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said on a post earnings call 
Channel GPU sales came in lower than expected based on excess channel inventory levels  caused by the decline in blockchain related demand that was so strong earlier in the year  she added 
Su said the graphics and computing segment underperformed expectations by  100 million in the quarter and added that inventory levels for its graphics products remain high and may take a couple quarters to return to normal levels 
 The miss was due to GPU  AMD had too high an exposure to the crypto currency market  Additionally  they do not have a competitive line up in the PC Gaming market   Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said 
Sales in its enterprise  embedded and semi custom unit  which makes EPYC server processors  fell 5 percent to  715 million 
AMD said net income climbed to  102 million  or 9 cents per share  in the third quarter ended Sept  29 from  61 million  or 6 cents per share  a year earlier 
Excluding items  AMD earned 13 cents per share  narrowly beating estimates

Review  Are You Missing The Big Picture 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Are You Missing The Big Picture  We noted that with trading  it s easy to get lost in the minutiae  Specifically  traders often get so caught up in the details of the day to day that they lose sight of the big picture 
This Week  Climbing The Wall Of Worry
Despite a non stop flow fear mongering from the media  the market continues to climb the wall of worry  For example  we just hit fresh all time highs in the S P 500  and we just completed the best first half of the year in many years  Charlie Bilello does a good job of summing up the market s strength in his recent tweet citing lots of strong data points  as follows 

Those are some fairly compelling data points  and they come following lots of negativity and worry by many in the media  Of course for some investors  perhaps contrarians in particular  the fact that the market has done so well lately provides more nervous fuel that  we re due  for a bit of a pullback 
A question worth asking yourself   Is your nest egg at the mercy of the stock market  And to what extent  
For example  if you simply own an S P 500 index fund  you re going to basically return whatever the stock market returns  and that means if the market takes a nosedive then so too will your portfolio also take a nosedive 
Historically  the conventional wisdom has been to diversify some of your stock market risk away by owning high quality bonds  But the problem with that strategy now is that with the 10 Year treasury again recently dipping below 2  so too have the yields on investment grade corporate bonds to the extent that their returns are just not very compelling to many investors 
So what s an investor to do if they want to earn a return without being at the mercy of a rapidly climbing stock market that makes many investors nervous  The market is up a lot this year  but you only have to look back to the fourth quarter of last year to see how the market can turn ugly quickly  And while the recover to that sell off was fairly quick  it took considerably more time for the market to recover from a considerably larger pullback during the financial crisis  which really wasn t that long ago to those of us that have been participating in the markets for a while 
As one alternative solution  there are many trading strategies that offer lower correlations with the overall stock market  For example  long short funds  market neutral strategies  and a variety of shorter term trading strategies too  These alternative approaches can help diversify away some of that stock market risk that is keeping many investors awake at night  while still offering the potential for compelling long term returns  We ll discuss some specific examples of trades and trading strategies later in this report

Expert Picks From The Models
Note  This week s Stock Exchange report is being moderated by Blue Harbinger  a source for independent investment ideas 
Holmes  I know I am a computer model and not a person  but I am going to brag this week  I bought shares of AMD  AMD  on 6 18 and sold them on 7 1 for a healthy profit 

Blue Harbinger  A little anthropomorphic  are we Holmes  That is a nice trade  Those chip stocks have been a little volatile lately with all the China trade talks going on  I suppose that volatility is good for a  dip buyer  like you  I think the semiconductor industry  in general  will do well over the long term considering all the smart device computing power  Here is a look at the F A S T  Graph with some fundamental data  Holmes 

Holmes  There s more to it than simply calling me a  dip buyer   You re on the right track  but more specifically  I use a mean reversion approach to identify stocks that have moved  abnormally  far from their recent price history  And AMD did  and I also identified the additional conditions necessary for me to purchase 
BH  Nice trade  Holmes  And how about you Road Runner  any trades to share this week 
Road Runner  I bought Square  SQ  this week  How do you feel about that 

BH  Jeez  Road Runner  We were just talking earlier in this report about ways to place trades that are not highly correlated with the market  Square is a very high beta  around  2 0  depending on which time frame you look at  fintech company  If the market goes up  so does Square  And if the market goes down  so does Square  But in both cases  Square s price moves are usually much more dramatic  It s a fast grower  but it s got a very high valuation and its not really profitable  Here is a look at the F A S T  Graph 

RR  Really  You want to talk to me about beta  That s a stat normally calculated over a 3 year time period  I usually only hold for about 4 weeks  So your beta and long term fundamental data are nice  but really not all that useful to me  Generally speaking  I am a momentum trader  and I like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel as you can see in the Square chart below 

And for your information  I look for a certain type of situation  some call it a pattern  others may call it a setup  etc   where the probability of a particular action is not a matter of chance  50 50  but has been historically noted to result in a greater tendency towards a particular outcome   Trending in a channel  is one such situation  Equity will often  cycle  between the upper and lower bounds of that channel for substantial periods of time  My model design attempts to take advantage of this property by identifying stocks trending in an upwards channel and waiting until the stock price drifts to the lower bound  making it a candidate for purchase  These types of situations have a relatively high probability of positive outcome with reasonable profit potential  Square can be seen to be in this type of situation  This is a short term trade that has traditionally shown profitability when the right conditions have been met  One way or another  I ll be out of it shortly   usually after about 4 weeks 
BH  Alrighty then  Thank you  And how about you  Athena 
Athena  I sold my shares of Tableau Software  DATA  this week for a small loss after purchasing them in mid June  As you recall  I am a momentum trader 

BH  Sorry that trade didn t work out  but at least it wasn t a disaster  I actually like that business from a long term fundamental standpoint  maybe you should have held on to it a little longer  Here is a look at the F A S T  Graph 

Athena  Thanks for your opinion  but I ll stick to my strategy  I look for stocks having strong positive trends and then select only those with the very strongest trends   king of the hill    constantly replacing the ones with weaker trends  It should not surprise anyone that I bought Tableau  A quick look at the chart makes the strength of the trend fairly obvious  And I generally continue to hold my positions until either the strength of the trend abates or stock with an even higher trend strength comes along  I don t have a set  holding period  for a position  I will exit only when either a stronger stock comes along or if market conditions dictate a strong potential for loss   capital preservation remains the key driver in all situations 
Conclusion
With the market soaring this year and reaching new all time highs this week  a lot of investors are increasingly nervous  and the media s non stop fear mongering doesn t help  If you re going to own stocks for the long term then to a large extent you are at the mercy of whatever the stock market does  And the traditional alternative to stocks  i e  bonds  is not all too appealing considering interest rates are so low again  the 10 year Treasury fell below 2  again this week   One alternative to reducing your stock market risk  while still providing an opportunity for high returns is shorter term trading  This can involve quickly getting in and out of the market based on specific set ups and opportunities  This prevents you from being exposed to the overall stock market  beta  risks all the time and still creates opportunities to generate attractive returns ",2019-07-04,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-exchange-climbing-the-wall-of-worry-200436972,200436972

220612,442128,AMD,AMD  CDNA  IOVA  JE  LJPC  SAIC   Stock Charts To Watch,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices  Inc   NASDAQ AMD  has really been running as of late  going from 26 to 32 in the last week  and a half  or so  But the key is Thursday s action that broke out above the key trading range in the last two months  It jumped 2 32  or 8   to 31 82  on over 131 million shares  That s breakout volume  I think it s going to retest the highs at 34  and then 38  39  It s looking real good 
CareDx  Inc   NASDAQ CDNA  is an old swing trade of ours  and I believe  the top pick for the year  You can see on the chart that it ran back above resistance  and on Thursday  it was up 2 34  or 7   to 35 87  on 1 3 million shares  It s likely that the targets are going to be 40 and 46 
Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ IOVA  broke the base  popped  formed a wedge  exploded  and then formed a little wedge  It broke out  pulled back  and is really nicely moving in a rising channel  on Thursday  gaining 84 cents  or 5   to 18 47  on 1 8 million shares  I think it s going to see the 20 21 zone short term 
Just Energy Group Inc   TSX JE   with an explosive move out of its base  breakaway gap and big volume for this stock  advanced 46 cents  or 13   to 3 98  on 2 1 million shares on Thursday  closing at the high for the day going away  I think it s going to test the 4 1 2 3 4 area short term  and then blow into the 5 1 2 6 area 
La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company  NASDAQ LJPC   one of my old favorites  got crushed from the 40 s down to 5 00  It built a beautiful base  and on Thursday  exploded on positive drug news  taking it from 5 31 to 11 38  and snapped back 4 92  or 92 1 2   to 10 24  on 24 million shares  It more than doubled  and although it backed and filled all day  and at the end of the day it closed nicely  I would now look for this stock to run to 14  and then maybe 16 as a secondary 
Science Applications International Corporation  SAIC  also had a breakaway pop  jumping 5 67  or 7   to 84 95  on 1 5 million shares  That s a breakout  The next target is 93 94

220643,442159,AMD,Analysts Estimate Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 05 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  54 6  
Revenues are expected to be  1 26 billion  down 23 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Advanced Micro 
For Advanced Micro  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Advanced Micro will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Advanced Micro would post earnings of  0 09 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 08  delivering a surprise of  11 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Advanced Micro doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-advanced-micro-devices-amd-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200409588,200409588

220653,442169,AMD,AMD Pops And May Have More Room To Run,opinion,"Summary 

Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  rose by 8  on Wednesday  after bullish comments from an analyst at Nomura 
Based on its market cycles  we believe this one may have more room to run in the near term before a corrective phase of this cycle kicks in

Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  Stock Weekly Chart 
David Wong  an analyst at Nomura Instinet specializing in semiconductor stocks  initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating  He believes that AMD will earn  0 27 per share and  0 67 in 2020 
Wong explained   We think that AMD s high revenue growth and rapidly improving profitability justify what we consider to be an elevated multiple  We believe that further share momentum  as well as favorable mix  will help drive AMD s sales growth  
In analyzing the market cycles for AMD  we can see the stock is clearly in the rising phase of its current cycle  While it is also in a resistance zone  it is relatively early in this cycle  We think it may continue to rise to  31 in the near term before tailing off as this cycle matures ",2019-04-04,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amd-pops-on-positive-analyst-comments-may-have-more-room-to-run-200403807,200403807
220654,442170,AMD,Bear Of The Day  SMART Global Holdings  SGH ,opinion,"Headquartered in Newark  California  SMART Global Holdings  SGH  designs  manufactures  and supplies electronic subsystems to original equipment manufacturers  OEMs   and engages primarily in the computer  industrial  networking  telecommunications  and aerospace and defense markets  SMART Global operates throughout the U S   Europe  Asia  and Latin America 
Disappointing Q2 Earnings
While earnings of 77 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents  EPS declined considerably from the year ago quarter  Q2 2018 earnings were  1 64 per share 
Revenues of  304 million missed our consensus estimate and declined 3 2  year over year due to weakness in the company s Brazil business  Net sales in SMART Global s Brazil segment fell 29 5  year over year to  147 1 million on a  worsening price environment  for smartphone and PC commodity memory products 
However  SGH s specialty memory segment saw sales increase nearly 10  from the year ago quarter to  115 6   And to its acquisition of Penguin Computing last summer  the company s specialty compute and storage solutions segment posted sales of  41 3 million 
On top of these weak results was a weak outlook for SGH s third quarter  SMART Global expects net sales between  260 million and  270 million and adjusted earnings in the range of 34 cents and 38 cents per share  Analysts were projected EPS of 90 cents per share on revenues near  332 million 
Falling EstimatesSMART Global Holdings  Inc  Price and Consensus   Analysts have since turned bearish on SMART Global  with four cutting estimates in the last 60 days for the current fiscal year  Earnings are expected to decline 43  for the year  and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has dropped over one dollar during that same time period from  4 63 to  3 61 per share 
This sentiment has stretched into 2020  though the shifting tide hasn t been as dramatic  Earnings could see growth of around 6   but our consensus estimate has dropped significantly in the past two months 
SGH is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Shares of the specialty memory leader have fallen almost 27  since January  In comparison  the S P 500 is up almost 16  year to date 
Bottom Line
Disappointing results in the second quarter coupled with a not so stellar third quarter outlook is never a good combination 
While CEO Ajay Shah points out the progress made despite a challenging business environment and there is progress  like in the company s specialty memory and specialty compute segments investors were left needing more from SMART Global 
If you re an investor interested in adding a computer memory or chip stock to your portfolio  consider Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   AMD   Shares of Zacks Rank  3  Hold  AMD have gained over 60  since January and earnings are expected to grow almost 40  this fiscal year

Advanced Micro Devices  Inc   AMD 
AMD made a monster move on Tuesday  jumping 2 75  or 11 83   to 26 00 from a low of 23 59  on 151 million shares  on a breakout from a consolidation zone that took 5 6 weeks to develop  In particular  the last four session it formed a mini wedge and exploded on Tuesday  It closed at the high end of the range  On that kind of volume  it will immediately go to test the 28 1 2 area  If it really runs to the very top of the channel  you re looking at 33 33 1 2 
Axsome Therapeutics  Inc   AXSM 
AXSM a swing trade of ours is working great  It popped up  pulled back  ran up  formed a little bit of a corrective flag  made a 5 wave move down  then it took off and was up 12 days in a row  and then spiked up 1 48  or 12 9   to 12 95 with a high of 14 24  on 3 5 million shares  It may continue the momentum  An all time high was reached back at the end of 2015 at 15 74  Can it get up there  At this point  I m thinking that it s getting up toward the upper end of the range at key overhead resistance  It has already made a 5 wave move up  So  keep an eye on this one 
Canopy Growth Corporation  CGC 
CGC which I put a new swing on Tuesday  looks good  I m convinced that  after the consolidation pattern that looks textbook perfect  can explode  On Tuesday  it was up 42 cents  or 1   to 46 11  on 5 million shares  Now  I m looking for it to head to the 56 59 zone  and then 68  75  and on up 
Evolus  Inc   EOLS 
EOLS made a pop off Tuesday s low  There could have been a little wedge with a triple bottom in there  and held at 23 1 4 1 2  and then popped and went straight up 2 72  or 11 4   to 26 57 with a high of 27 96  on 3 2 million shares  That s the best volume in 6 7 weeks  All it needs to do now is get past 30 30 1 4  and then it should take off 
NewLink Genetics Corporation  NLNK 
NLNK a low priced biotech stock  was a big winner for us in late 2016 at nearly 60 dollars  It rolled over and was in a big down trend  formed a little mini base  popped  wedged  and broke out on Tuesday  gaining 25 cents  or 13 23   to 2 14 with a high of 2 27  on 3 2 million shares  I think it will follow through  Targets are 2 55 and 3 20 
Rocket Pharmaceuticals  Inc   RCKT

220707,442223,AMD,AMD Stock Carries More Risk Than Reward Near  25,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  stock is up almost 34  since the start of 2019  beating the year to date return of the S P 500 three times over  Shares fell to  16 04 on Dec  26  when the bulls finally managed to fight back  Yesterday  the stock closed at  24 71  following an intraday high of  25 51 
Most people  anticipating the rally to continue  would often buy a stock after it has risen substantially  But as Warren Buffett once put it   the investor of today does not profit from yesterday s growth   So let s take a look at AMD through an Elliott Wave perspective and see if it is still a good stock to pick up for 2019 

The 2 hour chart shows that the sharp selloff from  34 14 to  16 17 can actually be seen as a textbook five wave impulse in wave  A   whose wave 5 is extended 
According to the Elliott Wave theory  a three wave correction in the opposite direction follows every impulse pattern  And indeed  the rest of the chart reveals an A B C expanding flat correction in wave  B  up to  25 51 so far 
If this count is correct  there is a complete 5 3 cycle to the south from the September 2018 top at  34 14  Unfortunately for AMD shareholders  this means another decline to under  16 a share can be expected in wave  C  down from now on 
The MACD indicator further supports the negative outlook  It shows a bearish divergence between waves iii and v of C of  B   highlighting the bulls  hidden vulnerability near the 50  Fibonacci level  In our opinion  this is definitely not the time to join the bulls in AMD stock

220735,442251,AMD,Breakout And Anticipation Stock Setups ,opinion,"I research the strongest stocks when I look for swing trade ideas  I sift through the top 1 or 2  in terms of relative strength in the current market and look for two basic types of setups  breakouts  which I can buy intraday and anticipation setups  which I can buy the next trading day if they trigger 
Breakout
A 2 3  move that might be the beginning of another leg higher that could continue several days to several weeks and deliver 5  to 20  gain  There were quite a few signals on Friday  A few examples  EVBG  AMD  NASDAQ FIVN  EXAS  STAA  etc 
Anticipation
There is a tight range of contraction that can potentially lead to a breakout  You buy on a new 3 day high and either sell on strength or trail your profits  The nicest feature of anticipation setups is that all research can be done after the market close and the entries can be automated via conditional orders  buy or sell stop limit orders   so you don t need to sit in front of your screen all day  Today s anticipation setups after often tomorrow s breakout setups  Some current examples  WWE  RARX  etc 
   
The most important thing is to know when to play those setups  They don t work all the time and in every market environment  In fact  the same high relative strength stocks can offer great shorting opportunities during corrective markets when most breakouts fail and lead to a quick move lower ",2019-01-28,Ivaylo Ivanhoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-one-percent-stocks--january-28-200379844,200379844

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  11 11   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  0 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 13  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Advanced Micro  which belongs to the Zacks Electronics   Semiconductors industry  posted revenues of  1 42 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 48   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 48 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Advanced Micro shares have added about 9 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 5  
What s Next for Advanced Micro 
While Advanced Micro has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Digging into valuation  AMD currently has a Forward P E ratio of 32 39  For comparison  its industry has an average Forward P E of 13 82  which means AMD is trading at a premium to the group

220769,442285,AMD,Silver Outperforms Key Markets  Metals And Energy,opinion,"While December was a horrible month for the broader markets  that wasn t the case for the precious metals  As the Dow Jones and S P 500 Indexes suffered the worst December since the Great Depression  the silver price enjoyed quite a healthy rally  The notion of rising precious metals prices during a market selloff ran counter to most analysts who forecasted falling asset values across the board 
However  that s exactly what took place in December  I stated  since the beginning of 2018  that when the markets really started to decline the precious metals would likely disconnect and rally higher  Over the past month  the silver price jumped by 10  and gold 5   while most of the broader indexes  base metals  and energy suffered declines  
For example  the Dow Jones Index fell 9  since December 1st  even though it has rallied from its low on Christmas Eve 

At its low on Christmas Eve  the Dow Jones Index fell a stunning 16  in a little more than three weeks  Currently  the Dow is attempting to retest its 25 Day moving average  MA  and the 24 000 resistance level that I have shown in previous charts  If we look at the graph below  we can see that the Dow finally touched the 25 Day MA today 

It will be interesting to see what the Dow does tomorrow  but at some point  the broader markets will reverse and continue to sell off 
I must say  watching Intra Day trading of the markets  stocks  metals  commodities  and energy has been quite eye opening  Yes  I still follow the fundamentals as they are the true factors that guide the markets  but technical analysis provides us a  crystal ball  on price trend movements  I will explain at the end of the article  but let s look at the next following charts 
The oil price has also been falling along with the broader markets  Even though the U S  West Texas Intermediate oil price peaked at the beginning of October  it dropped another 8  over the past month 

Now  it is quite amazing how the oil price also fell to its low along with the Dow Jones on Christmas Eve and then shot up higher the next trading day  I believe the oil price will attempt to move back up to  52 before reversing lower 
Please note  these charts were done early today before the market close  so the metals and energy prices are reflective of January 7th  Monday  trading 
The next chart is quite surprising because it usually trends with silver  Because copper is the king base metal and a major indicator of the industrial sector  it provides an important gauge of the health of the economy   The silver and copper prices tend to move together as they are both industrial metals  However  the copper price has fallen 7  since December 1st while silver rose by 10  


What a disconnect  As I mentioned  the majority of technical analysts forecasted that the precious metals would fall with the broader markets  but as we can see  quite the opposite took place  While gold s increase of 5  over the same period was half that of silver  at least it also outperformed the majority of assets in the market 

While the precious metals have done relatively well compared to most other assets this past month  I believe we are just seeing the beginning stages of much higher gold and silver prices over the next few years  The broader markets are just beginning their massive correction lower even though some analysts are suggesting the BOTTOM is in 
How on earth can the bottom of the Dow Jones Index be in when it hasn t even fallen back to its 50 Month MA  BLUE LINE  

As I have mentioned in previous articles and videos  the Dow will likely fall back at least to its 300 MMA  ORANGE LINE   When the Dow starts ripping down through its lower moving averages that is when fear will begin to really motivate investors into gold and silver 
Revealing The Crystal Ball Of How The Markets Trade
The reason I have been adding charts and technical analysis in my work over the past few months is that I have become amazed at how the markets trade   By studying INTRA DAY TRADING  I now understand more of the mystery behind price movements in stocks  commodities  metals  and energy 
Now  what happens on an Intra day chart also takes place on a daily  weekly and monthly chart  They ALL FOLLOW technical levels  When you understand what takes place intra day  you can even understand what happens over a more extended period 
I say it s essential to start with the Intra day  1 2 5 15 30 minute charts  trading because you can watch it take place right in front of you  If you actually view a 1 minute chart and how the tickers move up and down off technical levels  then you can translate that to long term daily  weekly and monthly charts 
For example  I have been using the Intra day technical levels to understand how stocks trade  When you have a good idea when a stock price peaks or is at a low  then you can make a more confident trade or investment  Today  I was focused on AMD   Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   AMD is a good stock to trade because it has a great deal of volume and price movement 
Here is a chart of AMD with 5 minute candlestick tickers 

As we can see  AMD traded off its Linear Regression Lines  Blue   Red dashed lines  and moving averages  However  AMD finally bottomed and moved higher about 11 am  Why did AMD bottom at 11 am  shown by the arrow and move higher  There we no moving averages at that level 
To be able to spot when a stock reverses  we must look at many different chart intervals  I use StockCharts to provide me with additional moving averages and clues to when a stock price will reverse  The chart below is a 1 hour chart  each ticker is 1 hour   and the chart has twenty days trading  The red highlighted area is trading today  January 8th  

AMD bounced higher on Jan 4th and 7th with no real correction  By the end of trading on Jan 7th  AMD was becoming overbought  You can see that by the high RSI reading in GREEN  You will also notice that AMD was oversold the day after Christmas  Dec 26th  when the RSI went into the RED 
I placed a short trade  want the price to go lower  early this morning on AMD and covered as it sold off  shown in the large red candlesticks  However  I wanted to know how far AMD might fall before it would reverse  Of course  there are no guarantees in trading or investing  but nothing goes up or down in a straight line  Stocks correct up and down off technical levels ALL DAY LONG 
Because the first chart did not provide me with some sort of technical support level  I used my StockCharts to give me a pretty good idea that AMD would fall to that GREEN LINE moving average  And that is precisely where AMD reversed 
I share this because the markets and traders use these technical levels to determine price trends  When you understand these price trends  then you have more a crystal ball in trading and investing in the markets  This will become very handy when knowing when to invest in precious metals or mining stocks

220816,442332,AMD,AMD Stock Confirms Bearish Reversal,opinion,"A month and a half ago  on September 11th  Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  stock was hovering around  30 a share following a spectacular 190  rally in 2018  Optimism was running high  but knowing that semiconductors is an extremely cyclical industry  we thought it was time to  be careful  
Of course  the stock did not start declining immediately after our warning  Two days later  it added another 13  to reach  34 14 a share on September 13th  It wasn t Friday  but that day still brought bad luck to AMD stock investors  It marked the beginning of a 30 8  drop culminating on October 19th  And if losing almost a third of its market cap in less than 40 days wasn t bad enough  the Elliott Wave structure of this pullback suggests more pain lies ahead  Take a look 
The weakness from  34 14 has formed a textbook five wave impulse pattern  labeled 1 2 3 4 5  In addition  two sub degrees of trend are visible within wave 3 
For those new to Elliott Wave theory  impulses develop in the direction of the larger trend  Spotting an impulse to the south means that once the corresponding three wave recovery in wave  2 B  is over  another five wave sequence can be expected  Wave  3 C  down has the potential to drag AMD stock even lower 
But first we should get ready for a corrective rally in wave  2 B  to roughly  30 a share  The short term positive outlook receives further support by the MACD indicator  which shows a bullish divergence between waves 3 and 5 of  1 A  
In our opinion  wave  2 B  is going to give investors a chance to evacuate before the bears drag AMD stock to  20 or lower in the  3 C   The fact that other semiconductor companies such as Nvidia and Micron are also retreating after prolonged rallies suggests that maybe the tide is turning for the entire industry

220825,442341,AMD,AMD Stock Is Up 190  In 2018  Be Careful,opinion,"Our first and so far only article about Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  was published on January 4  2018  when AMD stock was hovering around  11 55 a share  Back then the Elliott Wave analysis of AMD s daily chart made us think the cryptocurrency mining boom was going to propel the stock price to a new high above  15 55  giving it at least 35  upside potential  A little over 8 months later  the stock is up 190  year to date  easily beating the S P 500 s 7 6  YTD return  Let s see how did that happen  
By early January it looked like there was a complete 5 3 wave cycle on the daily price chart of AMD stock  A five wave impulse from  1 61 to  15 55 was followed by a three wave A B C flat correction with an ending diagonal in wave C  The theory states that once the corrective phase of the cycle is over  the trend resumes in the direction of the impulsive sequence  So  it made sense to stay the course and expect more strength from AMD going forward  As the updated chart below shows  we were not optimistic enough  
AMD stock s surge did not start right away  though  It turned out wave  2 B  was still in progress as a simple A B C zigzag with a triangle in the position of wave B  However  the fact that investors had to wait a little longer did not change the positive outlook at all  The stock fell to a bottom at  9 04 a share on April 4th and has been under bullish jurisdiction ever since 
Currently approaching the  30 a share mark  Advanced Micro Devices is now attracting the attention of both large and small investors  who seem to believe the best is yet to come  A brief look at AMD s weekly chart tells a different story  
The historical chart of AMD looks more like a cardiogram than a great growth story  The industry AMD operates in  namely semiconductors  is known to be highly cyclical and not in the Elliott Wave sense of the word  This means we cannot rely so heavily on the Elliott Wave principle to keep us ahead of the market in the long term  The industry simply does not allow the forming of large enough trends  Several good business years are followed by roughly the same number of bad years  which results in AMD going practically nowhere in the long term 
As the weekly chart shows  AMD stock is now touching the resistance line drawn through the last two peaks in June 2000 and March 2006  It is hard to tell if AMD is going to reverse from this line or slightly breach it first  but if history is any guide  at current price levels the stock is carrying more risks than potential

220826,442342,AMD,The Week Ahead  Quit Fighting The Last War ,opinion,"There is a normal economic calendar featuring four different housing reports  With little interest in recent economic or earnings news  the punditry has been interested in history  For many it is another opportunity to sell fear  The pundits might not change focus  but investors should have a resolution 
Quit fighting the last war 
Today s WTWA will touch on a  mostly  overlooked element of the financial crisis  The Final Thought will emphasize what we all should be thinking about 
Last Week Recap
In my last edition of WTWA I noted the preponderance of inflation related data and suggested that the week ahead might be an inflation watch  The idea was probably OK  but the inflation results were tame  Instead  the punditry found it more interesting to look back ten years on the fall of Lehman and the financial crisis  Whatever the current relevance  that made for good reading and watching  which I might well have guessed would happen  Did it have any effect on trading or investing  More below on that question 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart of the S P 500  This week we ll feature the futures chart from Investing com  This is an interactive chart  if you go to the site  which provides many features  The static version still shows the overnight moves and provides a tag for each item of news 

The market gained 1 01  on the week  reversing last week  The weekly trading range was about 1 2   still very low  I summarize actual and implied volatility each week in our Indicator Snapshot section below  Volatility remains well below the long term average 
Personal Note
I will be taking a week off beginning next Saturday  so there will probably be no WTWA installment for the next two weeks  As I have done recently  I ll try to do a mini update if there is something really important 
Trivia Question
Who owns the Federal Reserve  Few know the answer  provided at the end of today s post 
Noteworthy
Eddy Elfenbein has a  fun side project  determining the implied strength of NFL teams from the betting markets  He sees usefulness in this sort of exercise since these are a  close cousin  of financial markets  I strongly agree  Thinking about sports requires the same skills and forces you out of your existing market biases  It is a good way to learn about modeling and forecasting   strengths and weaknesses 
It might also reveal a different set of biases  Mrs  OldProf is an Eddy fan and follows him on Twitter  as do I  of course   She claims that there must be some error in his power ranking  Green Bay is only 7th 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
When relevant  I include expectations  E  and the prior reading  P  
The Good
Rail traffic remains strong   especially Steven Hansen s  economically intuitive  portions   GEI

The Ugly
Robinhood is supposed to be a no commission broker  with special appeal to day trading millennials  In fact  they are collecting ten times as much as other brokers for selling order flow   Logan Kane  
Update on fake videos  I wrote about this in July  The story is now getting more traction  now recognized as a national security threat   TechCrunch   To really understand the power  play this BuzzFeed News deep fake using former President Obama  He has recently said some aggressive things about President Trump  but not what is portrayed here 
The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a normal economic calendar featuring housing news  Many will also be interested in the Philly Fed and Leading Indicator reports  As in recent weeks  we can expect trade war salvos and political news to be more important than earnings and the economy 
Briefing com has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
There is some economic news  but in recent weeks the focus has been elsewhere  In normal times we could expect plenty of attention to housing with four relevant reports on the docket  Instead  expect a grudging turn from the ten year Lehman anniversary to lessons for the future  Pundits might not  but investors should be asking 
How relevant is the financial crisis to the current market  What can we do to prepare for the  next war  
The lessons
The biggest problem in drawing lessons from history is the temptation to fight the last war  In 2014 Ben Carlson had a nice post on this topic  including suggestions for further reading and the following key section 

One of my favorite expressions about the behavior of investors is that we are constantly fighting the last war  The representative heuristic causes us to overweight recent events when we make forecasts and extrapolate the latest performance indefinitely into the future 


The reason it s so easy to fall prey to this bias is because in the back of our minds it s very easy to think   If this same market scenario happens again I will be prepared and I know exactly how to position my portfolio  I will not get caught off guard again  

Barry Ritholtz notes 10 things that people still get wrong about the crisis  Bloomberg  
The ten year anniversary of the fall of Lehman  and the start of the financial crisis  launched a raft of retrospective articles  Most were heavy on the author s pet interpretation of what happened and light on useful ideas about the future  Some examples 
Nothing has changed  It could all happen again tomorrow   Economics has not advanced in the right ways  Larry Summers  
Policymakers did well  given the circumstances   Neil Irwin  NYT 
Subprime lending has been replaced by    fill in the blank    Various pundits on MarketWatch  
Bank regulation has not improved 
No one went to jail  so there is no deterrent against a repeat   Ritholtz  
Debt of all types is massive  and so is leverage 
These themes were especially popular among those warning current equity investors 
An important theme that got little attention was the role of an accounting rule called  FAS 157   This new rule changed the valuation method for some bank assets  Michael Cannivet s excellent summary notes that this was a ticking time bomb that provided a tipping point for the crisis  This chart illustrates the timing 

Ken Fisher writes that Lehman was  illiquid  not insolvent   He quotes former FDIC head William Isaac as saying this mushroomed several hundred billion in loan losses into  2 trillion in write downs  The accounting rule was eventually modified  but the effect on investors was lasting 

The widely bandied risks of today s bull market don t compare  Investors fight the last war psychologically  Markets don t  The next bear will likely look more normal  starting amid investor euphoria 

Robert Pozen  Harvard Business Review  asks whether it is fair to blame FAS 157 for the crisis  He analyzes several myths about this issue  noting that part of the problem was poor understanding  by banks  counterparties  and investors  on what the rules actually meant 
I wrote extensively about this problem as it was happening  but I was wrong about this prediction 

This is something you have not seen anywhere else  In a few weeks  you will see it everywhere  There is general consensus that the credit default swap market is flawed  unregulated  and possibly manipulated 


No one seems to have noticed that the ABX  the Market Index used to shrink the financial balance sheets and drive ratings downgrades  consists of only twenty securities   all credit default swaps 


Connect the dots  


Do you think that these CDS s might have been manipulated by those seeking short sale profits on financial firms  At some point we will see that the  marks  used by accountants were not only illiquid securities  but possibly manipulated securities  If there is ever an SEC investigation  we will see some  perp walks  


You heard it here first 

That was a bad guess  I continue to believe that there was a market ju jitsu  Clever traders attacked the ABX  requiring far less capital to drive down the twenty underlying MBS holdings  to profit from short positions in banks and the overall market  It would make a fine dissertation topic 
What has changed
There actually have been several changes  including the following 
Modification and clarification of the FAS 157 rule 
Tighter bank regulation and the addition of stress testing 
Reduction of permitted leverage 
Increased reporting of swaps 
But more could and should be done 
In today s Final Thought  I ll focus on the next war

I have a rule for my investment clients  Think first about your risk  Only then should you consider possible rewards  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
The Indicator Snapshot

Short term trading conditions continue at highly favorable levels  Actual volatility remains very low  While many argue that the low VIX level is a sign of complacency  it remains higher than realized volatility  Those selling volatility and making money  The 3  yield is slightly rounded up  3  is still viewed as a battleground on the ten year note 
The request for a 2008 version of the Indicator Snapshot was a great idea  The problem is that we need more dates  The key warnings came in 2006 or 2007  By 2008 the C Score was  correctly  looking for the cycle trough  My plan is a separate article with a couple of past time frames and then a regular link from WTWA

Guest Commentary
Tom Lawler  via Calculated Risk  looks at the difficulty in estimating the number of US households  It would seem to be so easy  but  
To be sure  there is no shortage of household estimates  in addition to the decennial Census counts  Census releases four different estimates of the number of US households  Unfortunately  the estimates not only differ materially  but also show different characteristics of households  e g   by age  and often show different growth rates over time 

Insight for Traders
Check out our weekly Stock Exchange post  We combine links to important posts about trading  themes of current interest  and ideas from our trading models   This week we took note of the widespread discussion of the most recent appearance of the Hindenburg Omen  Each time this appears it attracts a new raft of adherents with little discussion of past results  We took a deeper look  We shared advice by top trading experts and discussed some recent picks from our trading models  Our ringleader and editor  Blue Harbinger  provided fundamental counterpoint for the models  who are all of the technical persuasion 
We have been getting good results from the models  Some of them fit a risk reward profile that is attractive for retirement investors  Check out the weekly post  including results  and write to us at main at newarc dot com if you want more information or a consultation 
Insight for Investors
Investors should have a long term horizon  They can often exploit trading volatility 
Best of the Week
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Jack Forehand s  Validea  The Benefits of the Other Side  He takes note of the increasing polarization in society and the spread from politics to other ideas 

The belief that there is an absolute right answer and an absolute wrong one is fraught with problems  though  It leads to not even considering the opinions of others  It becomes the enemy of learning  And it leads to poor decision making 


We all are subject to this  We like to point our fingers at others  but they are often best pointed in the mirror 

He proceeds to consider several historical metrics that  should be open to review and subject to challenge  

In the end  looking at the other side doesn t mean you have to change what you think  It doesn t mean you need to ignore the historical evidence that supports what you think  What it means is that confirmation bias can be the enemy of good decision making  We all want to be right  but it is more important to be correct 

This is great advice

Lawrence Hamtil has an interesting discussion of the factors behind Peter Lynch s storied success  a return almost double that of the S P 500 for 13 years  He identifies Lynch s flexibility in his  charter   He had the ability to exploit the best ideas from colleagues running more focused funds 
Personal Finance
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich s Asset Allocation Daily is consistently both interesting and informative  This week I especially liked his discussion of the possible limits of diversification and how best to achieve it  His carefully reasoned answer considers several different dimensions of diversification  He cites a strong post by Erik Conley  asking us to challenge ourselves  What investment approach is best  not for everyone  but for a specific investor  He discusses the difficulties of implementing a  buy and hold  approach  He writes   Everybody is a Buy   Hold investor until their account value starts going down  
Abnormal Returns is an important daily source for all of us following investment news  His Wednesday Personal Finance Post is especially helpful for individual investors  As always  there are many great links on various topics  I especially liked Ben Carlson s Avoiding a Single Point of Financial Failure  It includes  for example  advice from Charlie Munger  There are 3 ways for a smart person to go broke  liquor  ladies  and leverage  And the important observation that financial  emergencies  are just infrequent expenses you can reliably expect to see  you just don t know when  Read the full post for some other great advice

Final Thought
How can we best prepare for upcoming investment challenges  How can we fight the next war rather than relive the financial crisis 
In an era where tweets and political events dominate the market agenda  this seems like a special challenge  We need focus  With that in mind  I will try for simplicity 
The most important issue is avoiding a global trade war 
How this is achieved does not matter  Some see a grand Presidential plan where a bargaining position has been established  Others see impulsive positions that must then be walked back or negotiated  It does not matter which is correct  or whether either is correct  As investors we care about the result  not the politics  A credible sign of real progress could lead to a 4  jump in stocks  a real solution might mean as much as 10   There is no way to prepare for a surprise announcement  Would you buy the market after a four percent pop  I didn t think so 
The most recent estimate of the effect on global GDP is about a 1  hit 
The estimate of the impact on S P earnings is about  10  a decline of 6  from current levels  Some of this is already reflected in the market 
There is a danger that the stock market effect of the tax cuts will be completely undone 
Here are three simple steps 
Get past the hype and understand the economics  My colleague Dr  Merton D  Finkler has an unbiased presentation of the issue  showing the effects on US agricultural exporters and Harley Davidson  The help to 140K steel workers should be compared to the impact on 6 5M jobs negatively affected 
Judge positive progress by news that traditional Republican groups and leaders are carry an effective message   Bloomberg  
Watch for a decline in business confidence and consumer sentiment  David Templeton  HORAN

Trivia Answer
From the Atlanta Fed s Charles Davidson via GEI  where John constantly provides items you would otherwise miss 

Stop us if you ve heard this one  the Fed is owned by a small  influential clique of global oligarchs whose aim is to serve powerful financial interests 


As Federal Reserve employees  we frequently encounter this misconception  And we are always eager to dispel it  The truth is  the Federal Reserve was established to serve the public interest and is not owned by anyone  See the full post for a complete explanation of both history and current operation

220830,442346,AMD,You Can Bet on Bitcoin Without Coughing Up  10 000 for One Coin,news," Bloomberg     Maybe you don t want to pay  10 000 for bitcoin  Or perhaps you re scared that the world s fastest growing currency is an asset bubble 
But if the FOMO is real  there are other not so obvious ways to bet on cryptocurrencies in the U S  stock market 
Trusts
With no bitcoin specific exchange traded fund on the market  many U S  investors have turned to The Bitcoin Investment Trust  GBTC   a private trust that trades over the counter  It invests exclusively in the cryptocurrency and derives its value solely from its price  but it isn t bitcoin  Thomas Lee  an uber bitcoin bull who heads research for Fundstrat Global Advisors  sees GBTC hitting  2 800 by 2022 from its current price of around  1 550 
ETFs
The ARK Web x 0 ETF  ARKW  is one of the first U S  ETFs to have indirect exposure to bitcoin  which it gets by having GBTC as its top weighted member at 7 percent  The ARK fund also holds  Square Inc   NYSE SQ    which is letting some users buy bitcoin via its Square Cash app  and crypto exposed semiconductor bellwethers like Nvidia Corp  The fund s up almost 82 percent this year  mostly because of GBTC  which accounts for almost 22 percent of the gain  according to an analysis of Bloomberg data 
Semiconductor exchange traded funds are also potential derivative plays on cryptocurrencies  With companies like Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  Inc  and Nvidia being used to mine ether  the second most valuable digital token  funds that hold the stocks may be offering indirect crypto exposure  Both the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  SOXX  and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF  SMH  hold them  In fact  Nvidia s gains this year are responsible for 7 4 percent of SOXX s returns 
Stocks
There are also plenty of crypto related companies that have seen their stocks skyrocket over the past few months   Overstock com  Inc   NASDAQ OSTK  has nearly matched bitcoin s return after announcing the launch of a regulated crypto exchange  Riot Blockchain Inc   RIOT   a former maker of diagnostic machinery for the biotech industry  now invests in crypto related businesses  leading its stock to more than double in the past two weeks  Digital Power Corp   DPW   which is involved with cryptocurrency mining  and Marathon Patent  MARA   which recently said it would issue shares to fund a blockchain deal  each surged more than 40 percent today ",2017-11-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/you-can-bet-on-bitcoin-without-coughing-up-10000-for-one-coin-930001,930001

220837,442353,AMD,Parabolic Moves Highlight FOMO Warm Up Time,opinion,"AT40   62 2  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   59 0  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   12 2Short term Trading Call  neutral
Commentary Money managers may desperately want to wait until after Labor Day to put idle cash to work  but the stock market may force more and more hands to rush in earlier and faster  FOMO   Fear Of Missing Out   may be warming up 
The S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   is starting to go parabolic with a 0 7  gain the curved the index notably above its upper Bollinger Band  BB  
With the Fed out of the way  the S P 500 ran freely above its upper Bollinger Band  BB  to another all time high  The index has not gapped up like this all year  The stretch makes the index look primed to attempt a run up similar to January s and the more other money managers come to that conclusion  the more likely FOMO will create a self fulfilling prophecy 
Already similar to January s run up is the behavior of AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their 40 day moving averages  DMAs   AT40 is still failing to confirm the index s new found strength  AT40 traded as high as 65 4  but faded all the way back to a close at 62 2   The move created a gain for the day under two percentage points  During January s run up  AT40 essentially churned in place  My favorite technical indicator only managed to close in over bought territory  above 70   twice and just marginally at that  When AT40 fell from the overbought threshold  it created a sell warning which I am being more disciplined to respect early  I was embarrassingly late in recognizing the strengthening and dangerous sell off from January s top   I will be on alert as the S P 500 presumably melts itself higher in the coming days and maybe even weeks 
AT40  T2108  is lagging the S P 500 by a widening margin  It has yet to surpass the July high much less reach the overbought threshold at 70  
For good measure  I doubled down on my S P 500 put options which are now incredibly cheap as portfolio protection  The volatility index remained steady on the day  so there was no opportunity to double down on my ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  call options at a cheaper price

Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  AMD is a great stock for today s them of melt ups and parabolic moves 
AMD is up 146  year to date  The stock s latest breakout has transformed into a classic parabolic pattern  Trading volume soared to 324 8M shares  an all time record for AMD  The 268M shares traded on May 2  2017 post earnings now takes second place  AMD fell 24 2  that day  Ironically  the stock closed at  10 32 which is almost exactly the same as the  10 28 share price it ended 2017 with 
AMD gained 5 3  but faded sharply from its all time intraday high of  27 30  After closing three straight days well above its upper BB  AMD is due for a rest  If the stock closes today s gap  it will likely confirm the classic topping pattern of the evening star  The record trading volume will then provide the marker of a blow off top  With 20  of the float sold short  I strongly suspect a many AMD bears rushed to get out today 
A bum rush of buyers have pushed their way into Advanced Micro Devices  AMD   Can the stock continue higher after such heavy volume  such extended stretching  and such a sharp fade from its intraday all time high 

Tilray  TLRY  TLRY is another great stock for today s theme given cannibis related stocks have become quite the rage 
TLRY gapped up today and closed with a 21 8  gain on record volume  It fell sharply from its intraday all time high of  58 68  An earnings report tomorrow evening will add further drama to this show with the CEO making a post earnings appearance on CNBC for good measure 
The video clip below comes from CNBC s Fast Money featuring Timothy  Cannibis King  Seymour talking weed stocks  I often fail to quite understand Tim s specific trading advice  and his commentary on TLRY was similarly hard to tie up neatly  the stock is  ridiculously expensive  but the stock is also potentially in play for a buy out that will be a part of big brand building  The upcoming earnings event should make investors cautious  the stock could be due for a pullback  Yet  TLRY has some  impressive investors  on its board and has critical mass 
Tim has been selling upside calls against his TLRY position at the  60 strike  the actions speak more clearly than the words  The options market  no surprise  is pricing in about a 29  move from today s close by September 21st  Let the fireworks continue 

Tilray  TLRY  is in lift off mode in a parabolic move just ahead of earnings

Commentary
In my last Above the 40 post  I discussed the early signs of a potential run up driven by the  fear of missing out   FOMO   The S P 500 SPY closed two more days at or above its upper Bollinger  Band  BB   The last close was a new all time high  The last two days of the month featured some drift back to the bottom of the upper BB channel that looks like a brief rest waiting for the refueling that can come with the end of summertime trading  
The S P 500  SPY  is in a relatively robust breakout mode 
Needless to say  the NASDAQ and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  are also in fresh run ups 
 
The NASDAQ is ripped higher all week along its upper Bollinger Band  BB   
The Invesco QQQ Trust gapped higher to start the week and barely stopped from there 
The volatility index did NOT cooperate with the week s run up  On Thursday  the VIX jumped 10 4  and even closed near its high of the day  Volatility faders came back the next day and reversed half the gain  Still  post summer trading will start with a potential resumption of FOMO AND volatility  The small spark in volatility is particularly important because the market is now just 4 trading days from officially ending what looks like a very brief period of extremely low volatility  ELV   I am still refining my understanding of the implications of these periods of ELV  
Volatility ended summer trading with a small revival  but it spent almost all summer well below the 15 35 pivot 
AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   took a hit to close out the week  The drop back to 57  is more evidence that my favorite technical indicator is not confirming the market s overall bullishness  Underneath  there is still enough undertow to seed the next pullback  I am keeping the short term trading call at neutral out of deference to price momentum  More importantly  if the buyers return after this Labor Day weekend  there is considerable runway between here and an overbought reading for AT40  above 70    I cannot even think about bearishness until unless AT40 fails at the overbought threshold or falls below it  I do not quite have enough evidence to make a bet on a pullback from here to uptrending 50DMA support 
The Australian dollar is offering its own version of caution but political turmoil is clouding this usually reliable signal of the market s appetite for risk taking  In the wake of political tumult in the country  the Aussie plunged against major currencies  The weakness took the currency to a new 22 month low against the Japanese yen  AUD JPY has now broken down below what was a wide 5 month trading range  At the time of writing  the Reserve Bank of Australia  RBA  is within hours of issuing its latest pronouncements on monetary policy  This event should either confirm the breakdown or trigger the next bounce off lows for AUD JPY  I am getting ready to trade the aftermath after the dust settles a bit  
The Australian dollar broke its 2018 low against the Japanese yen  AUD JPY is back to flagging red for financial markets

The U S  dollar index is offering its own separate opinions  Last week closed with a bounce after optimism over the end of trade war risks proved premature  When President Trump promised on Thursday to follow through on another  200B in tariffs on China  it caused enough jitters to send the VIX up and the S P 500 down  Still  last week s action slightly reduced my bullishness on the dollar given how ready the market appears to sell the dollar on any bit of dollar negative news  
The U S  dollar index bounced back to recover its 50DMA  
Source  TradingView com
The bounce in the dollar included a bounce against the Mexican peso  The trade setup fading USD MXN against its 200DMA worked out well but only as quick swing trades  I am now playing fades with the USD MXN pulling away from its 200DMA as support  This trade is more risky  but I like the position as a small hedge against my dollar bullishness that will delivery good carry  
The U S  dollar is starting to pivot around all three of its major moving averages versus the Mexican peso  USD MXN is bouncing around its 20  50  and 200DMAs

Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD 
I earlier made a case for a blow off top in AMD  Sellers ALMOST followed through on the pattern  but they only closed Monday s gap up on an intraday basis  Wednesday s gap down was immediately met by buyers  Buyers subsequently failed to restart upward momentum  so AMD is now stuck in a stalemate  I positioned for a blow off top  but a move back to the upper Bollinger Band will suggest the market s readiness to continue the  parabolic  march toward infinity  
Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  fought off a blow off top by closing the week flat with Monday s close 
Dick s Sporting Goods  NYSE DKS 
DKS gapped down hard in response to its earnings last week  but 200DMA support proved up to the task  This rebound makes a bottoming in DKS even more convincing  
Dick s Sporting Goods is making an impressive post earnings recovery with a bounce of 200DMA support strong enough to nearly close the post HIBB gap down 
Fitbit  NYSE FIT 
In June  FIT caught my attention as a potential catch up play for money managers who do not want to chase the major indices higher  As luck would have it  FIT peaked out the next day  In two months  FIT finished reversing its entire breakout  The stock is back to struggling  and I am looking for salvage value in the call options I accumulated during the reversal  
Fitbit failed to hold June s breakout and recently failed to recover through 50DMA resistance 
Foot Locker  NYSE FL 
With 12  of its float sold short  FL looked poised to be another retailer with an outsized post earnings surge  especially with a 50DMA breakout ahead of the report  Instead  FL gapped right back down to 200DMA support  A grinding recovery off that support seems underway  Accordingly  I am holding onto a bullish  hedged pre earnings position I put on ahead of earnings  
Foot Locker  NYSE FL  failed to hold its 50DMA breakout through earnings  but it managed to bounce off 200DMA support

period  The company posted better than expected revenue numbers for the quarter and also reduced operating expenses significantly Inside the HeadlinesGoPro surprised investors with its sales figures  as its quarterly revenues grew 37 1  from the prior year quarter s tally to  329 8 million  This marked the company s second consecutive quarter of revenue growth  The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  314 3 million Revenue growth was driven by robust sales of the latest Hero5 cameras and launch of its premium priced HERO6 Black with global on shelf availability GoPro  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   HERO5 Black was the best selling digital imaging device in units and dollars in the United States for four consecutive quarters  More than half of GoPro s

expenses plunged 49 1  year over year  Third quarter operating expenses came in at  122 5 million  down 42 4  year over year Non GAAP gross margins contracted 50 basis pointsyear over year to 40 1   Non GAAP operating income came in at  24 million  down 127 2  from  88 6 million generated last year RestructuringGoPro has been aggressively cutting costs in recent times through a series of layoffs  Last year  the company conducted two rounds of layoffs  cutting 7  and 15  of its workforce in January and November  respectively  GoPro also shuttered its entertainment and media business as part of restructuring The companyalso shifted most of software development to a more economical location like Romania  while customer support and administrative services have been moved to the Philippines  The company has streamlined supply chain and also made changes to its product packaging and shipping GoPro believes that restructuring efforts will help it bring down full year GAAP operating expenses below  585 million and non GAAP operating expenses below  495 million  The company also assured that it would bring down operating expenses by over  200 million and return to EBITDA profitability in 2017 Moreover  the companyaffirmed that these cost cutting efforts will not interfere with its pipeline of hardware and software product launches Notable DevelopmentsIn October  GoPro announced its

 It projects revenues of about  470 million      10 million  for the quarter For full year 2017  GoPro plans to limit operating expenses in 2017 to  490 million  in an attempt to try to return to full year profitability next year GoPro should be able to attain these massive cost reductions  in light of its recent job cuts and business restructuring  which did away with many high cost operations  including its entertainment division Our TakeGoPro has been aiming towards transforming itself from the  camera maker  to  content maker   and has taken significant steps to diversify into higher margin businesses including video editing and virtual reality  The company is developing various types of software solutions and hardware to curtail the complexity of managing  editing and sharing contents on different media platforms The company has made significant improvements to its editing software  on the back of its recent acquisition of two of the most popular mobile editing apps  Replay  which has been rebranded as Quik  and Splice  which are experiencing robust adoption  We believe that these efforts will pay off in the long term  and go a long way toward opening GoPro to a wider audience and expanding the user base GoPro currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Other Stocks to Consider Some other top ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Imax

221014,442530,AMD,Last count survives in Rajaratnam brother s insider trading trial,news,"By Nate Raymond NEW YORK  Reuters    Prosecutors avoided the dismissal of the last remaining count against Rengan Rajaratnam on Wednesday  a day after a federal judge tossed the primary fraud charges against Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam s younger brother 
Following arguments at a hearing in New York  U S  District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald declined to dismiss a count of conspiracy against Rengan Rajaratnam  allowing the case to proceed to the jury 
 I very much enjoyed hearing a preview of your summations  but I think I am going to have to hear them again   Buchwald said 
The ruling came after she dismissed two securities fraud counts against Rajaratnam  43  related to the government s claims he engaged in insider trading in technology company Clearwire Corp in 2008 
The non appealable decision meant Rajaratnam  a former Galleon portfolio manager  would avoid the most serious charges he faced  each of which carried a maximum term of 20 years in prison  The remaining conspiracy count carries up to five years in prison 
The ruling was a serious blow to prosecutors under Manhattan U S  Attorney Preet Bharara  whose office has won 81 insider trading convictions of individuals through pleas or jury verdicts since October 2009  never losing at trial 
The ruling s impact could be seen throughout Wednesday s arguments  which drew the attendance of Bharara s top deputy  Richard Zabel 
A comment by assistant U S  attorney Randall Jackson that the prosecution might still focus on how a tip about Clearwire to Raj Rajaratnam went to Rengan drew criticism from Buchwald 
 I made a ruling on that yesterday   she said   What you re saying is inconsistent with that  
Rajaratnam s lawyer  Daniel Gitner  had sought to bar the government from arguing anything about Clearwire going forward 
Buchwald declined his request  saying it was not in his interest  given how she found no jury could reasonably find Rajaratnam engaged in insider trading in Clearwire 
Many of the arguments over the remaining count turned on whether prosecutors could establish Rajaratnam engaged in a conspiracy regarding the stock of another company  Advanced Micro Devices Inc 
Prosecutors contend that in August 2008  Raj Rajaratnam told his brother of a  handshake  deal between AMD and an Abu Dhabi state owned company he learned about from Anil Kumar  a McKinsey   Company partner 
In a wiretapped recording of a call that same day  Rengan Rajaratnam told his brother he had talked with another McKinsey partner  David Palecek  who  spilled his beans   encouraged him to buy AMD and was  a little dirty  
Gitner said his client was simply seeking investment advice from Palecek and discussed other stocks despite prohibitions imposed on McKinsey partners 
But Christopher Frey  another prosecutor  said Rajaratnam s  own words belie the notion  that he was not seeking inside information  pointing to part of the call when Rajaratnam said Palecek  kind of volunteered the information on the investments  

Raj Rajaratnam is serving an 11 year prison term following his 2011 conviction  Kumar pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years probation in 2012  Palecek died in 2010 
The case is U S  v  Rajaratnam  U S  District Court  Southern District of New York  No  13 00211

221015,442531,AMD,Trial of Rajaratnam s brother ends as defense says U S  case flawed,news,"By Nate Raymond NEW YORK  Reuters    A lawyer for Rengan Rajaratnam on Monday compared the government s insider trading case against the younger brother of Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam to a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces had been wrongly jammed together 
In closing arguments in New York federal court  Daniel Gitner  Rengan Rajaratnam s lawyer  told jurors what remained of the case against his client  a former Galleon fund manager   doesn t fit together  
In no wiretapped phone call did Raj Rajaratnam tell his brother he was trading on inside information  Gitner said  Nor was there proof Rengan Rajaratnam entered into a conspiracy to engage in insider trading  he said 
 They can t finish the puzzle they are so desperate to finish   Gitner said 
But Randall Jackson  the prosecutor who made the government s closing argument  said the brothers engaged in  obvious criminal activity  that allowed Rengan Rajaratnam to personally earn  40 000 trading on inside information about technology company Advanced Micro Devices Inc  N AMD  in 2008 
 He is a coconspirator   Jackson said   His brother embraced him  
The case is part of a broad crackdown on insider trading by Manhattan U S  Attorney Preet Bharara s office that has resulted in 81 convictions since October 2009  Bharara and some top officials from the office were in the courtroom on Monday 
Jury deliberations are expected to begin on Tuesday 
Last week  the prosecution suffered a big setback when U S  District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald dismissed two securities fraud counts against Rengan Rajaratnam related to improper trading in Clearwire Corp 
He now faces a single conspiracy account  which carries a maximum term of five years in prison 
Jackson said jurors should not allow Gitner to distract them from the  simple truth  that Rajaratnam and his brother agreed to engage in insider trading 
He cited an August 2008 phone call  in which Raj Rajaratnam told his brother about a  handshake  deal between AMD and an Abu Dhabi state owned company 
The information  he said  came from Anil Kumar  a former McKinsey   Company partner  The same day  Rengan Rajaratnam told his brother he had met with another McKinsey partner  David Palecek  who was  a little dirty  and  kind of volunteered the information on the investments  
Jackson said the comment that Palecek was  dirty  showed  Rengan s understanding he can exploit this guy  
But Gitner said the  dirty  remark referred to investment advice Rengan Rajaratnam received from Palecek  whom he met in business school  McKinsey policy prohibits such advice  Palecek died in 2010 
 It makes no sense for Rengan to seriously ask someone he hadn t seen in years to break the law   Gitner said 

Raj Rajaratnam is serving an 11 year prison term following his 2011 conviction  Kumar pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years probation in 2012

221033,442549,AMD,Why Did Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  Stock Surge Today  ,opinion,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD   moved higher throughout morning trading hours on Tuesday  eventually hitting an intraday peak of  13 48 a 6  climb from Monday s close just before noon 
The move comes on the back of the chipmaker s latest product announcement  On Tuesday  AMD unveiled its Embedded Radeon E9170 Series graphic processing unit  a GPU that is optimized for low power embedded applications 
 The new AMD Embedded Radeon E9170 Series GPU not only achieves up to 3X the performance per watt over previous solutions  but is the first  Polaris  based Embedded GPU available in the MCM form factor to enable sleek designs in a variety of sizes  striking the optimal balance of performance and power efficiency   said Colin Cureton  director of product management at AMD Enterprise Solutions 
In its press release  AMD mentioned that the E9170 Series has a wide variety of applications  Of these  the chipmaker described how the new GPU could power digital casino games  thin clients  medical displays  retail signage  and industrial shock tests 
Investors are clearly bullish about AMD s newest GPU  which is yet another example of the graphics chipmaker working to legitimize to its enterprise offerings  Expanding its enterprise GPU line and competing against the likes of Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   is a key goal for AMD 
AMD s graphics chips have seen increased demand from cryptocurrency mining  which has skyrocketed in popularity as the price of things like bitcoin and ethereum have grown  But the company itself has admitted that cryptocurrencies are not a long term growth driver making product announcements like today s even more important 
Interestingly enough  the latest surge in AMD shares is also coming on the same day that short interest in the stock reached an all time high  According to Business Insider and financial analytics provider S3 Partners  AMD shares sold short rose to 159 million a new record and an estimated 18  of total shares available 
Shorting AMD has not been a consistently profitable strategy this year  but after the stock s 83  gain over the past 52 weeks  many investors are betting that the popular chipmaker will lose steam soon  As for now  AMD sports a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

221039,442555,AMD,How AI And Algorithms Can Help You Find Winning Stocks ,opinion," 0     Investing With AI   Big Data 3     Natural Language Processing 5     What Is The Source Of The Big Data Used  10     BUZZ U S Sentiment Leaders ETF Overview  BUZ 12     Market Value and Sector Weighting Breakdown 15     Investing Themes Using BUZ Strategy  The Rise Of Big Data 20     What s Next For AI  Big Data and Social Media  22     Episode Roundup  As more and more content appears online  it is creating a tsunami of data that is on a totally unprecedented scale from a historical perspective  Tweets  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  posts  blog entries  and a variety of other content fills up the internet with millions of messages and fresh data points on a minute by minute basis  and it is only increasing by the day 
Some might think there is too much noise out there and that any sort of useful signal is too difficult to find in this sea of data  but that may not be true  That is because recent advances on the technological front specifically in the fields of Big Data and natural language processing make sifting through loads of data a whole lot easier than what we saw even a few years ago 
This could be great news for stock investors too  as we can now utilize new Artificial Intelligence applications to shift through the data and find key trends in terms of online sentiment  For more on this approach  I spoke with Jamie Wise  the CEO and founder of Buzz Indexes in this week s Dutram Report to learn how investors are tapping into technological advances  and how ETF investors can play this information revolution too  
Buzz Approach
First off  Jamie and I discuss what is actually meant by  natural language processing  and what kind of technological advances we have seen in the data world over the past few years  These key changes make analysis of online sentiment trends possible for stock investors  allowing algorithms to read online posts and determine if they are focused on the stock  or on a given customer s experience with a company instead 
Once we ve gone over the basics  we move on to what kind of sources are used for the information  and this includes everything from Twitter  TWTR  and Facebook  FB   to posts on various other sites as well  Some do receive higher weights than others in the models  but it is clear that a number of sources are used for the data 
Index   BUZ ETF
Beyond that  we also talk about how this is put into practice with the BUZZ NextGen AI US Sentiment Leaders Index  the basis for the BUZ ETF  Jamie lets us in on   and some of the key factors that go into this benchmark s construction  We also talk about what is meant by  sentiment  and why focusing on this metric could be a good idea for investors 
One area that was especially interesting to me  was the idea that investors generally focus in on a few companies in a select number of industries  How does one expand the reach to a broader company list  and is there enough info for some of the smaller stocks out there  Jamie walks us through the answers to these questions in the podcast  but it definitely seems like the group of possible stocks is growing by the day as more information is hitting the web all the time 
We also discuss a few ways in which this approach has been helpful as of late  focusing in on the tech sector  In particular  we zero in on the chip space  which has definitely been in the spotlight lately 
Two companies that we highlighted were Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  and Nvidia  NVDA   Check out the podcast for more on how the Buzz model spotted these stocks ahead of some strong performances for both  and what this means for stocks in the future too  But definitely check out the podcast for additional information on the index s construction  and the key things to note about this AI focused approach 
What s Next 
Jamie and I also talk about what is coming down the pike for Buzz Indexes  and the additional ways this approach could be utilized in the ETF world  I also make the parallel between this technique and the idea of the  wisdom of the crowd  and we discuss how this index in many ways is a more advanced application of that popular concept 
Finally  we also discuss what is ahead for the world of social media and the big data landscape too  Check out the podcast for more information on these topics  and more  in this edition of the Dutram Report

221043,442559,AMD,AMD Sell Signals Have Come In,opinion,"BEARISH SIGNAL
Double top that has been fueled with negative divergence could be a recipe for a disaster  especially a cheap stock like AMD 
I ve been watching AMD ever since it cleared above the  8    10 major pivot level  back in December of 2016  breaking out above the 8 year range it has been in since 2008 
I generally despise going long on a breakout  so I ve decided not to pull the trigger upon that breakout 
Truthfully  ever since then  I ve been secretly hoping for a correction  no offense to AMD investors  so I can start to accumulate positions 
Well  maybe my wish might just come to a fruition once for all 
As you can see in the chart below  we have pretty steep bearish divergence happening on MACD here  This is the pattern that killed AMD when it topped out in 2010 
After this pattern was confirmed  AMD got into a bear market for a whopping 3 years  2010   2013  and then  afterwards  it got into a sideways dead move for another 3 years  2013   2016  
For sure it was scary pattern for the investors back then and it is a scary pattern for the investors now 
Well  the scary monster is back today even with scarier look on MACD as you can see that it has much steeper decline than 2010 MACD 
This is the pattern that might just kill the AMD stock value to half  

 
MAJOR SUPPORTS
So what are the levels we can possibly look for a strong support  I have reasons to believe that  8 to  6ish could provide as strong support 
Yes  I know that s a pretty big spread  but when you are dealing with these kind of patterns  discussed above  along with so much optimism hype that is starting to die off here  it s very difficult to pin point the exact level 
I also believe that  8    6 level are the levels to hold for the uptrend to possibly continue to the upside  because if we lose the level   8    6   AMD may never recover and it may be up for another 3 5 years of bear market just like what happened in 2010 
That s why it s crucial that buyers protect the  8    6 level to maintain integrity of this uptrend to keep the momentum going for the primary term perspective to stay in bullish sentiment 
If  indeed  the price falls to  8  I will be looking to purchase stocks within the range of  8    6 00 

BONUS CHART

As my follower mentioned   50EMA  Monthly   has been served as a major pivot level since 2005 
2005  acted as strong support  blue boxes 
2010   2015  acted as strong resistance  red boxes 
Currently residing at  7ish
If the price falls to  50EMA  Monthly   at around 7  I believe it will act as strong support",2017-08-08,Kay Kim,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amd-sell-signals-200206101,200206101
221044,442560,AMD,Bitcoin ETFs  More Issuers Join The Race,opinion,"The rising tide for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin  Ethereum and  have lately shaken the investing world  Among the lot  bitcoin has been firing on all cylinders since the beginning of 2017  having hit a series record highs  In three months  the price of the digital currency has surged about 94  
Investors should note that bitcoins are  mined  by using a greater amount of computer processing power  However  since there is a fixed amount of bitcoins  as the limit is reached  it becomes hard to  mine  for the coins  The best part of this system is that it is beyond the reach of central banks  read    
The currency is in the limelight probably because of the fact that  bitcoin isn t regulated by  and has been used by consumers worldwide to shelter assets from inflation or political upheavals in their home countries   As per an article published on   bitcoin is emerging as a safe haven asset like gold 

source  coindesk com
Needless to say  amid a sky high price rise  the digital currency is gaining favor from ETF issuers  though the SEC is no quite happy with the concept  After rejecting the filing for an ETF on this cryptocurrency by   the SEC is reviewing its decision once again 
The SEC is seemingly looking for more proof of safety in this trade  Meanwhile  some more ETF issuers have lined up to seek regulatory approval with their bitcoin related products  read    
Inside New Filings 
Investment firm VanEck  for an exchange traded fund to invest in bitcoin derivatives in mid August  Though  acknowledged the riskiness of the product and believes that this digital currency is no match to gold as far as safe haven status is concerned  the issuer could not overlook bitcoin s monumental craze  read    
VanEck noted that the digital currency cannot even replace the necessity of the dollar  rather it is likely to end up in carving a place for itself as a niche product  VanEck s proposed product will invest in certain Bitcoin Instruments through the Subsidiary and the investment in that subsidiary is likely to be limited to 25  of the portfolio  thus meaningfully lowering the risks 
After VanEck  ETF Firm REX also planned a new fund that will invest in bitcoin based derivatives  There are two products filed by REX  namely REX Bitcoin Strategy ETF and REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF  The ticker codes and expense ratios of those funds are yet to be disclosed 
As per   the long fund  seeks to achieve its investment objective  under normal circumstances  by obtaining investment exposure to an actively managed portfolio of financial instruments providing long exposure to movements in the value of bitcoin  together with an actively managed portfolio of fixed income instruments  while the short fund is intended to offer the negative exposure of the same asset 
What Lies Ahead 
The tussle between the U S  Securities Exchange Commission and Winklevoss over the launch has been going on for about three years  In fact  the  the proposal for the Bitcoin ETF multiple times 
However  it looks like that the SEC may approve a fund in the coming days given rising pressure from issuers  Plus  the Russian government is also expected to make cryptocurrencies legal financial instruments in 2018  as per   Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari pointed to the strength of the  supporting bitcoin 
Among other interested candidates  the   CBOE  has teamed up with Gemini  the bitcoin exchange backed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss  in order to launch cryptocurrency derivatives trading 
Bitcoin s Impact on the ETF World 
While it is still unclear if we will get a bitcoin ETF soon  the sheer success of the cryptocurrencies should benefit semiconductor ETFs like iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF   This is because mining of cryptocurrencies needs the usage of semiconductors  A   Application Specific Integrated Circuit  is designed explicitly for mining bitcoin 
As per   there was a 10 fold rise from April to June in the Ethereum market which helped shares of Nvidia Corp    NASDAQ NVDA   and Advanced Micro Devices Inc    NASDAQ AMD   substantially  read    
On the other hand  since some view the currency as  digital gold   bitcoin trading may snatch some buyers from SPDR Gold Trust   V GLD    Bitcoin s un correlated nature to the other asset classes and strong momentum may hurt GLD  NYSE GLD  in the current scenario

A strong graphics chip market should be encouraging news for investors as we head towards Nvidia s second quarter report in the coming weeks  Nvidia has shifted towards a machine learning and AI focus recently  but the company still brings in plenty of revenue on the consumer level  where it directly competes with AMD in the gaming market 
While AMD s success might mean that Nvidia has lost some market share  it is likely a positive indicator of rising overall demand  On top of video gaming  Nvidia and AMD have benefitted from the astronomical rise of bitcoin and ethereum over the past year  as more and more people build powerful machines using high end graphics chips to  mine  these cryptocurrencies 
Looking ahead  our current consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to post EPS growth of 60  and revenue growth of 37  this quarter  These impressive growth rates have helped the stock earn a  B  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  and they ve contributed to Nvidia s status as one of the most popular growth picks on Wall Street right now 
NVDA has also been a scorching hot momentum stock  with shares gaining more than 190  over the past year  In 2017 alone  NVDA has soared nearly 60   making it one of the year s hottest stocks 
Furthermore  the company has put together quite the earnings track record  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 27  in each of the trailing four quarters  This should give investors even more confidence in this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock as we approach its earnings report date

221082,442598,AMD,Doomsday Thursday ,opinion,"Ever since the great recession of 2008  the governments and central banks of the world have been pumping ludicrous amounts of money in the financial system in order to artificially inflate asset prices 
In the short term  this is really good for large corporations and financial institutions  However  the long term effects of these extraordinary and unprecedented policies are yet to be seen  Some economists have hypothesized that the fallout from all this excess money in the system could be even more devastating than the original financial crisis that it was intended to fix 
The US Federal Reserve has been making great efforts lately to get back to a normal policy  Next week  they should give us some indication about how they plan to get rid of more than  4 trillion worth of bonds and other assets that they have bought over the last decade 
The European Central Bank however  is still pumping about  60 Billion into their economy on a monthly basis  In today s monetary policy meeting  Mario Draghi is largely expected to maintain the pace of this program even though the noticeable effects have been very minimal lately 
The fact that an unelected official has so much power over so many people is a bit sad  I sincerely hope that in the near future  we ll be moving to a better form of money  One that is more efficient  more democratic  and more fair to everyone 
Today s Highlights
UK Elections Day
Freeze     FBI  
Mining is now Mainstream
Please note  All data  figures   graphs are valid as of June 8th  All trading carries risk  Only risk capital you re prepared to lose 
Market Overview
Today is the day we ve been speaking about for almost two months  When Theresa May first announced the snap elections on April 18th she had a very wide lead in the polls  Since then her lead has narrowed to about 5  
The main issue on the table is Brexit and what type of relationship England and the EU will have in 5 years time  Multiple terrorist attacks and budget plans from both parties have tried to change the focus of these elections  However  at the end of the day  the main decisive factor will be voter turnout 
Price action in the UK s pound sterling has been as complacent as her citizens of late and many are just tuning out 
In this graph  we can see the GBP USD since the Brexit Referendum about a year ago  Draw your own conclusions 

At this point  it s impossible to know what will happen next  Who will win  by how much  and how the market will react remains a large question mark  Exit polls should be available as early as 10 00 PM in London  Be ready for anything  
eToro has organized a special webinar to discuss these elections with three of our popular investors  all from the UK and all with excellent trading stats  Of course  like all things in eToro lately  the topic of conversation was changed about half way through to cryptocurrencies 
The recording is available now on YouTube at   
Trump Under Fire
Today fired FBI Director James Comey will take the stand and reveal the nature of some private conversations he s had with Donald Trump  His opening statement has been released already  You can find it  
The main quote that keeps coming up is   
 I need loyalty  I expect loyalty  
Legal experts feel that from this statement Trump may have crossed a line but hasn t done anything explicitly illegal  Therefore  we may actually see some relief from the whole fiasco  However  if the Q A session today has any further revelations  the consequences and market reactions could be significant  
Crypto Mining is Big Business
Recently  both AMD  NASDAQ AMD  and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  have announced that they will be making brand new graphics cards specifically designed for mining cryptocurrencies 
According to  on   both card makers have been selling out due to an influx of people looking to get in on the action  So there is certainly a high demand for this new product 
So  if you re scared about the extreme volatility involved in trading directly on bitcoin and ethereum or even if you re just looking for another way to balance out your portfolio  You can also check out the stocks of these two companies who are looking to capitalize on this new industry in quite a different way 
Thanks to Jasper Lee our Managing Director in China for bringing this to my attention  Shares in both of these companies are surging on the news

	Chicago  IL   May 01  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   NASDAQ           Advanced Energy Industries Inc   NASDAQ          and Integrated Device Technology Inc   NASDAQ          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

Semiconductors Stocks Reporting Q1 Earnings on May 1 

	The first quarter earnings season has picked up pace  with results from 181 S P 500 members or 40  of the index s total market capitalization already out  as of April 26  

	As per the latest    total earnings of these companies are up 10  on a year over year basis  75 7  of the companies beat EPS estimates  while total revenue is up 4 3  on a year over year basis  64 1  of the companies beat top line estimates  
	Notably  earnings and revenue growth numbers are significantly better than investor expectations  In fact  growth is on track to reach its highest level in almost three years  We believe that continuation of these trends through the rest of this earnings season will serve as a reassuring development for the market 
	Overall first quarter earnings for S P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 9 7  from the year ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 5 9   This would be better than the  7 4  growth in fourth quarter earnings on  4 8  higher revenues  Finance  Technology  Industrial Products  and Basic Materials are expected to post double digit earnings growth 
	We note that almost 25 8  of the total market capitalization in the technology sector has reported till now  Total earnings are up 13 9  on a year over year basis  76 5  of the companies beat EPS estimates  while total revenue is down 0 1  on a year over year basis  70 6  of the companies beat top line estimates  
	Earnings for the Technology sector are anticipated to be up 11 8  on the back of 6 1  higher revenues  driven by strong growth from the semiconductor industry 
	The industry is anticipated to benefit from rapidly growing cloud computing as well as Internet of Things  IoT  markets  which are driving growth for chip components to power applications particularly automotive  medical healthcare and smart connected devices 
	Here we take a look at three semiconductor companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on May 1 Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ         is unlikely to beat first quarter 2017 expectations as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an  of 0 00  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   
	This is because  as per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 to beat earnings  You can see   
	We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
	However  we note that AMD s results compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 35 76  

	We believe that AMD s improving position in key markets   like virtual reality  VR  and augmented reality  AR   gaming and parallel processing   driven by the launch of Radeon and Ryzen chips is a key catalyst   Read More    
	AMD has also outperformed the Zacks  industry on a year to date basis  While the stock gained 20 1   the industry returned 17 3  
	Similarly  Advanced Energy Industries Inc   NASDAQ          looks unlikely to beat first quarter fiscal 2017 estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00  
	Notably  Advanced Energy has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the preceding four quarters with an average positive surprise of 17 10   Moreover  the company has outperformed the Zacks  industry on a year to date basis  While the stock has gained 37   the industry posted an increase of 25 2  

Integrated Device Technology Inc   NASDAQ         is unlikely to beat fourth quarter 2017 estimates as it has an unfavorable combination of an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Notably  results have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the preceding four quarters  It has an average four quarter positive surprise of 8 27  

	Integrated Device products continue to gain traction in the computing  communications and automotive markets  However  increasing competition is a significant headwind that will weigh on share price in 2017 
	We note that shares have gained 4 6  on a year to date basis  worse than the Zacks Electronic Semiconductors industry s rise of 18 2

221104,442620,AMD,Using Options To Profit From The Artificial Intelligence Boom,opinion,"LEDE
If we apply risk controls to a very common option strategy in Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD   we find better returns with less risk 
PREFACE
While Nvidia Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  is rightfully garnering all of the headlines for its successes in end to end machine learning and artificial intelligence that are driven by its GPU processors  there is a smaller technology company that is competing   Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  
While AMD stock has been ripping  there is a risk conscious approach to options that benefits from the stock  not going down a lot   and it has performed exceedingly well 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD 
What we re about to look could feel uncomfortable  not in that it s difficult  but rather that s it s this simple   and it is a glaring example of how the top 0 1  have been dissecting retail traders for decades  But its objective data   this is how option professionals find the edge they require to keep going 
When trading options we need to answer three critical questions   what to trade  when to trade and when to close the trade  Here s how knowing the answer to those questions has meant more than 200  returns over the last year in Advanced Micro Devices Inc 
What to trade  Let s examine selling out of the money puts in AMD 
When to trade  Let s now compare examine selling the monthly options versus the weekly options 


It might have felt like a trivial difference   to trade weekly or monthly options   but it isn t trivial at all  Selling a weekly out of the money put in AMD over the last two years has returned  28  while simply switching to the monthly option has returned 73   But we are just beginning our journey to discovery 
Now that we know the what to trade and the when to trade  we must objectively answer when to close 
Reduce Risk
A short put actually has tremendous downside   so we need to make a risk adjustment to this strategy  While a short put can see a several hundred percent loss in any given trade  we can put a stop loss on each trade to limit that black swan risk  That answers when to exit the downside 

We also need to answer  when to close on the upside   It turns out that if a put was sold for  say  1 00  closing that put out once it goes down to  0 10  has had a large impact on results as well  Here s how we account for both our stop loss and limit gain 

And now  the results 

We have now fully answered the what to trade  when to trade it  and when to close it specifics of our option trades  The final question we need to answer is if this is just luck 
Is This Really Analysis  or Just Luck
Skepticism is natural   trading isn t a game and that means we have to prove to ourselves that this isn t luck or happen stance 
What we need to do now is look at this short put over various time periods  We see that it has worked over the last two years  now let s look at the last year 


A 176   return  when we chop the risk down and close at the right time  has turned into a 202  return over the last year in Advanced Micro Devices  Inc  NASDAQ AMD  
It s not a magic bullet   it s just easy access to objective data 
Finally  we look at this short put over the last six months  these are the results 


While the risk reduction strategy actually didn t help returns  the point is that it didn t really hurt returns   we are seeing similar reward for far  far  less risk  Yet again  when we have access to objective data  our what to trade  when to trade  and when to close rules have worked 
What Just Happened
If you ve made it this far then you recognize that this is how people profit from the option market   it s preparation  not luck

221105,442621,AMD,Double Top In NVIDIA  Time To Short Sell Semiconductors ,opinion,"Semiconductors were real outperformers last year  By far the strongest performer in the semiconductor space was NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  as well as Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  
NVIDIA went up fivefold in less than a year  That is impressive to say the least 
However  right now  NVIDIA seems to be setting a major double top  Note the purple circle on the first chart  A double top was set in February  and a lower high was set in March  That is really concerning for NVDA  and it seems that sellers are taking control over buyers 
The downside potential in NVDA is significant  It is not that the financials of the company are not good  With a 32x P E ratio  great turnover and EPS figures  there really is not a financial problem  The issue is that the stock got ahead of itself  At a certain point  too high too fast needs to correct 
Ultimately  NVDA can come down  until its 90 week moving average  which is around  55  Not that this our forecast  but it s a potential downside target for the short to medium term  depending on how broad markets will act 

Now  if NVDA would fal  which we anticipate  it would have major implications for stock markets  The reason is that semiconductors have done very well since stock markets recovered early 2016  But as they have been leading stocks higher  stock markets need a strong performance in semiconductors to remain in a bullish environment

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  Any time there is positive news with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the company s stock  Adversely  negative news will generally cause declines  However  there are few pieces of news that have the potential cause movement in the market quite like product releases  Ultimately  AMD investors know that new products mean upgrades for those that already use AMD hardware  and more opportunities with those that don t  This has the potential to drive massive amounts of revenue and profit  As a result  the stock is climbing in the market today  Currently  11 17   AMD is trading at  2 29 per share after a gain of  0 11 or 4 82  thus far today 
What We Can Expect From AMD Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have a relatively bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from AMD  The reality is that the new product release is likely to drive massive amounts of revenue  making earnings look great and generating investor excitement  Not to mention  investors and analysts alike were already excited about the stock before the company revealed the new products  It is expected that AMD will more than double in price to  5 per share over the next year or so  The bottom line is that AMD has a line of great products  a great team  and a clear plan for success  Between these factors  the company has the recipe to make big things happen  All in all  things are looking great for AMD ",2016-03-02,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/advanced-micro-devices-(amd)-stock:-here’s-why-it’s-climbing-today-200120177,200120177
221183,442699,AMD,AMD  Here s Why Investors Are Excited,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  had a tough time in the market over the past five years  Through this time  the stock has seen more than 70  of its value disappear into the abyss  However  the year 2016 has been incredibly good to the company  So far this year  the stock has climbed by nearly 40   and thanks to recent announcements  we re likely to see further gains  Just days ago  AMD made a big announcement with regard to virtual reality that s likely to send the stock soaring  Today  we ll talk about the announcement  what we ve seen from AMD since  and what we can expect to see from the stock moving forward 
Advanced Micro Devices Moves Toward Virtual Reality
On Monday  AMD had an incredible day in the market after unveiling new virtual reality hardware and software features  During the showcase  the company showed off new graphics processing unit technology  They also announced the launch of a new GPU certified program  Perhaps most importantly  AMD made a big statement in one of their announcements  They stated that they believe they hold about 83  market share of home entertainment virtual reality systems  This may seem far fetched and hard to believe  but in reality it is definitely possible  After all  VR is a very new industry and it requires incredibly advanced chips  Advanced Micro Devices has the chips and is surely a big player in the industry  In a statement  Raja Koduri  senior vice president and chief architect at the company s Radoeon Technologies Group had the following to say 

AMD continues to be a driving force in virtual reality    We re bringing the technology to more people around the world 

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  When there is good news released with regard to a publicly traded company  we expect to see gains  Adversely  when bad news is released  we expect to see losses  Naturally  Advanced Micro Devices  announcement that it is a major player in the virtual reality space is incredibly good news  and is sending the stock upward  In fact  since Monday  we ve seen strong upward trends on the stock that are continuing in the market today  Currently  10 50   AMD is trading at  2 76 per share after a gain of  0 13 per share or 4 94  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
As AMD continues to dominate in the market as it has done for the most part of the year  investors are starting to ask whether or not they should invest in the company  The truth is that I understand the hesitance associated with investing in AMD  As mentioned above  the stock has been heading downward over the past 5 years  However  at this point  I believe that the downward trends are over for AMD  First and foremost  the company s virtual reality computer chips are incredibly important to the vast majority of VR systems  Because virtual reality is already incredibly popular  I would imagine that this is going to be a very profitable space for all involved  including Advanced Micro Devices  While virtual reality is a big driver  I believe that another big driver of movement is going to be computerized gaming  and possibly even drones  The simple fact is that at this point  AMD has carved out a clear niche  and it just so happens to be a very profitable one  So  I m expecting to see gains in the value of the stock ",2016-03-17,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/advanced-micro-devices-(amd)-stock:-here’s-why-investors-are-excited-200121979,200121979

Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NYSE AMD  has already restructured operations and is now transforming itself from a supplier of PC microprocessors and graphics controllers to an SoC supplier of application specific integrated circuits  ASICs  to PC  tablet  game console  professional graphics  embedded products and cloud server applications  New products accounted for over 30  of H213 sales  and management is targeting 50  by the end of 2015 
Q4 video game upside
Revenue grew by 9  sequentially  above expectations  to  1 6bn  Pro forma gross margin was weak at 35  on a richer mix of new video game SoCs  Pro forma EPS met expectations at  0 06  and pro forma positive free cash flow goal for H213 was achieved  Cash  equivalents and both short  and long term marketable securities exceeded targeted  1 1bn by  100m  while debt was flat but greater at  2 1bn  Computing products declined by 9  to 45  of sales with a  7m operating loss due to consumer notebook PC weakness  while graphics and SoCs grew by 29  to 54  of sales with  121m in operating income due to video game strength from both Microsoft and Sony launches  Guidance for Q1 calls for a seasonal revenue decline of 13 19  after two quarters of both revenue growth and earnings 
Transformative growth
New products expected to drive revenue growth and profitability at Advanced Micro Devices for 2014 include continued strength from SoCs for video games to Microsoft and Sony  the new Kaveri processor for underserved desktop PCs  new low power Beema and Mullins processors for tablets and ultrathin notebooks  new Radeon mobile discrete graphics processors to Dell  Lenovo and others  new AMD FirePro professional graphics subsystems for the Mac Pro and others  embedded offerings for digital signage  cash registers and medical devices  and cloud server offerings including SeaMicro systems and the new Seattle 64 bit ARM processor sampling this quarter

221189,442705,AMD,Here s What The Buy Side Expects From AMD Thursday,opinion,"Advanced Micro Devices Inc   NYSE AMD  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Thursday  April 17th  AMD is a large semiconductor company which produces computer processors  motherboard chipsets  graphics processing units  and other hardware products  AMD along with its competitor Nvidia dominate the GPU market  This quarter Wall Street is expecting a strong earnings report out of AMD to the tune of 22 9  year over year revenue growth  In FQ1 last year AMD reported a loss but still beat analysts  expectations  This quarter the Street expects AMD to erase its losses and post 0c EPS  Here s what investors expect from AMD Thursday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 
The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for AMD to report 0c EPS and  1 337B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 33 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 2c EPS and  1 361B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting AMD to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue by a small margin 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting AMD s EPS and revenue 4 times each  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a small to moderate difference between the two groups  expectations 
The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  3c to 10c EPS and from  1 321B to  1 421B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a large distribution of EPS estimates and a moderate range of revenue estimates on AMD 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean more volatility post earnings  
Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus inched higher from  1c to 0c while the Estimize consensusrose from  1c to 2c  Meanwhile Wall Street lowered its revenue consensus by  51M while the Estimize community kept its expectations relatively flat  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy at the end of the quarter both groups were comfortable in keeping their consensus expectations flat 
The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 1c EPS and  1 343B in revenue  turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked  among over 4 100 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 59  and 55  of the time respectively 1644 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case turbinecity is expecting AMD to miss the Estimize community s expectations on both EPS and revenue 
Last year in FQ1 AMD lost 13c per share  this time around the Estimize community expects a profitable quarter  On Thursday the Estimize community is looking for year over year gains of 15c in EPS and a substantial  273M  25  increase  on revenue

221190,442706,AMD,When Stocks Breakdown  4 Case Studies,opinion,"The ability to recognize shifts in market sentiment and momentum through price action analysis is an essential characteristic of a skilled trader and investor  This talent is not born overnight 
In fact  it can take weeks or months of watching a stock closely to acquire a familiarity with its fluctuations over various time frames and develop the eye to discern key changes in price 
It must be emphasized that stocks trade both up and down  and that we can make money in either direction 
By entering a long position  we profit by buying a stock at a low price and selling it at a higher price  We only make money if the stock price rises  bullish bias  
By entering a short position  we profit by selling a stock at a high price and buying it back at a lower price  We only make money if the stock price falls  bearish bias  
 The problem with short selling is it s still not particularly well accepted as an American way of investing     Bill Ackman  Hedge Fund Manager  in a Reuters Impact Players Interview on 4 8 2013
Most people are familiar with betting on a rise in stock prices and thus going long  as this is what is traditionally presented as the primary way to make money in the market  Going short is not as well understood  in part due to the stigma associated with it as well as the lack of education about it 
Let s take a look at some examples of stocks we ve highlighted recently and a few new ones which all share one thing in common  notable breakdowns in price that traders with a preference for entering and profiting from short positions can learn from 

1  Zillow Inc   NASDAQ Z 
In our last post about Z    we noted that the stock s close below its multi week support level at  123 on Friday   9 26 14  was a significant price breakdown in favor of the bears  On 9 26 14  Z closed at just under  122 a share 
In the two weeks that followed  the bears have completely run over the bulls  with the stock falling nearly  20 a share  It closed Friday  10 10 14  at  104 79 
Let s watch to see if  100 holds as a support level on any continued selling pressure 
2  Bitauto Holdings Limited  NYSE BITA 
We last wrote about BITA  and brought attention to the stock s incredible summer climax run from the low  40s  At the time  BITA had traded as high as  85 a share 
The stock went on to trade even higher  reaching its pinnacle of  98 28 the week of 8 25 14  The high  70s provided support for the bulls on subsequent pullbacks in price until the beginning of October  when BITA closed at just under  75 a share on Friday  10 3 14 
In the week that followed  BITA pulled back further  It closed Friday  10 10 14  at  64 10  We will be watching to see if the high  50s hold as a support level on any continued move lower 
3  National Bank of Greece  NYSE NBG 
On 10 7 14  we issued a on NBG  noting its break below long term support at  3 on Friday  10 3 14  when it closed at  2 86 a share  Although the stock had tested the  3 level several times since late 2013  it had never closed below it on the weekly time frame 
By the close of trading on 10 10 14  NBG had fallen to  2 68  It had traded as low as  2 55 earlier that week  The stock is now in uncharted territory and we can thus make no determination on what the next support level may be 
4  Advanced Micro Devices  NYSE AMD 
Since May 2013  AMD has traded above  3 a share  Last week it traded below  3 and closed Friday  10 10 14  at  2 72 a share  This is an important breakdown in price as the bulls failed to support the stock from the onslaught of heavy selling pressure 
If the bulls are unable to regroup  it would not surprise us in the least to see a further pullback in price  Support currently seems to be in the mid  2s  going back to late 2012 early 2013 ",2014-10-13,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/when-stocks-breakdown:-4-case-studies-228776,228776
