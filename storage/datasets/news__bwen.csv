3594,225109,BWEN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Cisco  AZZ  Flowserve  Timken And Broadwind,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  June 28  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    AZZ Inc    NYSE AZZ    Flowserve Corp    NYSE FLS    The Timken Co    NYSE TKR   and Broadwind Energy Inc    NASDAQ BWEN   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog U S  Business Investment Rebounds  5 Top PicksOn Jun 26  the Department of Commerce released U S  factory orders for long lasting durable goods in May  Although the orders contracted  the rate of decline was much less than the previous month Moreover  core durable goods order   a key metric to track business investment plan   jumped significantly  The shipment of core durable goods also increased to a large extent in May  These two metrics provide a major relief to the market s concern that investment softened in the manufacturing sector primarily owing to the lingering trade dispute with China Durable Goods Orders Weak But Not DisappointingThe Department of Commerce reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods declined  3 3 billion or 1 3  to  243 4 billion in May from April  The consensus estimate was of a decline of 0 8   However  durable goods orders in April declined 2 8   revised data   This indicates that the rate of decline in capital goods orders actually halted in May Moreover  the decline in May s durable goods order was primarily attributed to a 28 2  drop in non defense aircraft orders  This tepid result was mainly due to lack of orders for the troubled 737 MAX aircraft of Boeing  NYSE BA  Motor vehicles and parts orders rebounded 0 6   while Orders for transportation equipment plummeted 4 6   Overall durable goods shipments rose 0 4  and inventories increased 0 5  in May Core Durable Goods Orders Jump in MayMore important information from the report is that the core durable goods order  which exclude defense aircraft  jumped 0 4  in January after witnessing a sharp fall in the previous three months  This also reflects the highest monthly gain of core factory orders since January  Notably  this metric declined 1  in April Last month  leading performers for core durable goods were heavy machinery  primary metals  computers and networking gear  Meanwhile  in May  core capital goods orders rose 2 3  year over year  Shipments of core capital goods increased 0 7  in May compared with 0 4   revised data  in April Implication of Strong Core Durable Goods DataIndustry researchers are highly concerned about future capital spending by the U S  manufacturing sector due to the prolonged tariff battle between the United States and China and an impending global economic slowdown  However  core capital goods data for May indicate that business spending is likely to continue although the pace may decline to some extent Shipment of core capital goods is a leading metric to calculate equipment spending in the U S  government s GDP measurement  Notably  the manufacturing sector constituted nearly 12  of U S  GDP Lingering trade conflict between the United States and China took a toll on the manufacturing sector  A large section of U S  manufacturing companies is dependent on low cost inputs from China which acts as intermediary product for heavy industrial sector  However  imposing of tariff on several of these intermediary products by the Trump administration raised input cost for those U S  companies Consequently  business confidence dented and investors postponed investment plans  Notably  the first quarter of 2019 witnessed contraction of business spending on equipment for the first time in three months  Therefore  stabilization of business investment in May will act as a major boon to the manufacturing industry  Notably  business investment in the 12 months ended in May rose 1 4  from 1 2  in April Our Top Picks   Against this backdrop  it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the solid core factory orders data  We narrowed down our search to five such stocks  Each of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

3603,225118,BWEN,Siemens Gamesa needs more wind in its sails as Vestas stretches U S  lead,news,"By Christoph Steitz and Jose El as Rodr guez FRANKFURT MADRID  Reuters     Siemens   Gamesa   MC SGREN  has fallen behind biggest rival Vestas  CO VWS  in the race for orders in the United States  hurt by a perceived lack of technology investment and a less centralized supply chain in the world s second biggest wind turbine market  The U S  battleground is among the biggest for western turbine manufacturers  with the U S  Energy Information Administration forecasting the addition of 6 gigawatts  GW  of capacity this year and a further 8 GW in 2018  But things have not gone well for Siemens Gamesa since the merger that brought together Siemens   DE SIEGn  wind power division with rival Gamesa this year  even though it has described the United States as critical to its success  The merger was aimed at giving the combined entity an edge in an increasingly competitive global market amid sector consolidation that saw Germany s  Nordex   DE NDXG  buy the turbine unit of Spain s Acciona  MC ANA  and  General Electric   N GE  take over France s  Alstom   PA ALSO    Siemens Gamesa has struggled to bring an attractive turbine to North America   said one senior industry adviser who declined to be named to protect business relations  There is a view that the company has not done enough to improve its geared turbines  the adviser added  Siemens has mainly sold gearbox based turbines in the United States  where they are the preferred model  but its market share has dwindled in recent years while that of Vestas has increased steadily  TURBINE SWITCH  Complementing its portfolio and recouping lost market share in the United States were among the main drivers of the tie up with Gamesa  which has a broader offering of gearbox based turbines and is expected to fare better locally  Siemens Gamesa will present its new strategy in February and sources close to the group said chances are that the joint venture may use more of Gamesa s turbines in the United States in future   After the merger the combined company has greater scale in the U S   which will enable us to increase the wind turbine models and the volumes produced in the country   Siemens Gamesa said in an e mailed statement  Improvement is badly needed after the group announced the closure of its blade production operation in Canada  job cuts at its nacelle manufacturing plant in Kansas and writedowns on the U S  business that caused a profit warning and management reshuffle  Siemens Gamesa did end a losing streak this week when it reported U S  orders for 784 megawatts  MW  of capacity  It has also won an upgrade contract it says is worth 190 MW  But that is still less than half of what has been taken in by Vestas  The Danish company s order book is brimming with 2 086 MW in announced U S  deals  close to a third of its total orders globally  Fresh data from the American Wind Energy Association  AWEA  also shows that Vestas is much more successful than Siemens Gamesa in striking deals for projects  The association s latest quarterly market report said Vestas has taken 47 percent of the U S  wind projects under construction or in advanced development that have announced a supplier  Siemens Gamesa s share stood at 8 percent  or 1 258 MW  at the end of the third quarter   PEDESTRIAN  OUTLOOK  The need to catch up will keep a lid on stock momentum for at least another couple of quarters    Barclays   LON BARC  analysts said  forecasting a  pedestrian  outlook for 2018  which they expect to be issued along with fourth quarter results on Nov  6  Barclays expects next year s sales to be down by more than a fifth from its forecast for 2017 numbers  The analysts are forecasting sales of 8 48 billion euros   9 88 billion  in 2018  well below the 10 14 billion Thomson Reuters I B E S estimate  In the medium term  the merger is expected to help Siemens Gamesa to gain a stronger foothold in the United States and recover some of this year s 30 percent lost market value    a far cry from the 25 percent gain for shares in Vestas  Regardless of the actual products  Siemens Gamesa must also find a way to compete with the centralized supply chain that Vestas has built in the United States  Vestas operates four factories making towers  blades and nacelles in the state of Colorado  located in the middle of the windy central plains corridor of the United States  which analysts say is a big advantage   We think the key is localizing the product   said Chris Brown  president of Vestas s sales and service division in the United States and Canada  Siemens Gamesa also has a strong presence in the region  with blade and nacelle production in Iowa and Kansas  though it does not identify the local providers from which it sources its towers  In the past it has bought towers from  Broadwind Energy   O BWEN   which has production sites in Wisconsin and Texas   In a cut throat competitive turbine pricing environment  the additional costs of transport can win or lose contracts   said Jesse Broehl  senior analyst at Navigant Research

3608,225123,BWEN,Industrials Rise To The Top  5 Best Stocks In The Sector,opinion,"Industrials topped the Zacks sector heatmap  ending the one and half month lead of the Auto  Tires and Trucks sector  The upward movement  from the sixth position to the top  can be attributed to the fact that the majority of the industries within this sector performed well in the past few months and look poised for growth in the coming quarters 
Year to date  the sector has gained 5 18   It is expected to improve further as the year progresses  Currently  the Office Supplies industry is among the top 1  of the total 265 Zacks categorized industries  while Machinery Electrical Utilities and Thermal Products are among the top 2   Tools   Related Products is among the top 4  while Wire and Cable Products industry is ranked in the top 5        
We believe that a lot of domestic and international drivers  including growth policies of U S  President Donald Trump  policies of the Federal Reserve  energy price volatility  forex woes and economic unrest in some foreign nations are influencing market sentiments in the U S  Trump administration s plan to invest significantly in the country s infrastructure  if implemented  will boost growth of the industrial sector 
Also  other economic indicators are pointing toward a healthy business environment in the industrial sector  Industrial production grew 0 1  year over year in January and 0 4  in February driven by improvements in manufacturing and mining outputs  partially offset by a decline in utilities outputs  Also  new export orders for U S  manufactured machinery have risen 2 9  in the first two months of 2017 We believe that government policies encouraging better trade relations  increase in infrastructural investments  job creation and high consumer end demand will support growth of the industrial sector  As per the  report dated Apr 6  first quarter 2017 earnings and revenues for the sector are projected to grow 5 8  and 7 3   respectively

the lingering trade dispute with China Durable Goods Orders Weak But Not DisappointingThe Department of Commerce reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods declined  3 3 billion or 1 3  to  243 4 billion in May from April  The consensus estimate was of a decline of 0 8   However  durable goods orders in April declined 2 8   revised data   This indicates that the rate of decline in capital goods orders actually halted in May Moreover  the decline in May s durable goods order was primarily attributed to a 28 2  drop in non defense aircraft orders  This tepid result was mainly due to lack of orders for the troubled 737 MAX aircraft of The Boeing Co    NYSE BA   Motor vehicles and parts orders rebounded 0 6   while Orders for transportation equipment plummeted 4 6   Overall durable goods shipments rose 0 4  and inventories increased 0 5  in May Core Durable Goods Orders Jump in MayMore important information from the report is that the core durable goods order  which exclude defense aircraft  jumped 0 4  in January after witnessing a sharp fall in the previous three months  This also reflects the highest monthly gain of core factory orders since January  Notably  this metric declined 1  in April Last month  leading performers for core durable goods were heavy machinery  primary metals  computers and networking gear  Meanwhile  in May  core capital goods orders rose 2 3  year over year  Shipments of core capital goods increased 0 7  in May compared with 0 4   revised data  in April Implication of Strong Core Durable Goods DataIndustry researchers are highly concerned about future capital spending by the U S  manufacturing sector due to the prolonged tariff battle between the United States and China and an impending global economic slowdown  However  core capital goods data for May indicate that business spending is likely to continue although the pace may decline to some extent Shipment of core capital goods is a leading metric to calculate equipment spending in the U S  government s GDP measurement  Notably  the manufacturing sector constituted nearly 12  of U S  GDP Lingering trade conflict between the United States and China took a toll on the manufacturing sector  A large section of U S  manufacturing companies is dependent on low cost inputs from China which acts as intermediary product for heavy industrial sector  However  imposing of tariff on several of these intermediary products by the Trump administration raised input cost for those U S  companies Consequently  business confidence dented and investors postponed investment plans  Notably  the first quarter of 2019 witnessed contraction of business spending on equipment for the first time in three months  Therefore  stabilization of business investment in May will act as a major boon to the manufacturing industry  Notably  business investment in the 12 months ended in May rose 1 4  from 1 2  in April Our Top Picks   Against this backdrop  it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the solid core factory orders data  We narrowed down our search to five such stocks  Each of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

3615,225130,BWEN,5 Stocks To Buy On Record Gain In Durable Orders,opinion,"Durable orders increased significantly in October  indicating that the U S  manufacturing sector was attaining stability  This report adds further weight to a raft of data released recently which suggest that the economy has strengthened  Further  markets and industry have been buoyed by Donald Trump s victory  hoping that this will provide an additional fillip to growth
This is why this may be a good idea to invest in the manufacturing sector  Adding stocks from this sector to your portfolio is a prudent option at this point 
Sharpest Increase Year to Date
Orders for durable goods increased by 4 8  to a seasonally adjusted  239 4 billion in October  This monthly increase was the sharpest recorded for the year  Durable orders exceeded most estimates primarily due to a near twofold rise in demand for civilian aircraft   However  excluding transportation  durable orders increased by 1  
Additionally  orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased by 0 4   This is a marked improvement after the metric declined by 1 4  in September  Manufacturing growth has been held back by several factors including a surging dollar which has raised the cost of U S  exports  However  this report and others released recently  including an improvement in the ISM manufacturing index for October  indicate that the tide is turning 
Economic Outlook Bright
The report on durable orders is further evidence of the fact that the economy is improving  Residential starts touched the highest level since Aug 2007  while the percentage increase from September was the biggest since Jul 1982   Read    Further  existing home sales rose 2  in October to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5 60 million  the highest annualized rate in more than nine years 
Meanwhile  retail sales jumped 0 8  in October  recording the best two month gains registered in more than two years  The pace of inflation has also increased recently  indicating that the economy has gained strength fairly early in the last quarter  According to the Atlanta Federal Reserve  GDP is expected to increase by 3 6  in the fourth quarter  compared to the rate of 2 9  for the July September period  Such an increase is unlikely to occur without a further pickup in manufacturing

3616,225131,BWEN,Phoenix Strategy  Hold Your Nose and  Rent  the Junk,opinion,The stock rally in 2012 has been characterized by a low quality rally  or  dash for trash   I wrote  that investors were under invested in equities and have been rushing for the entrance  They have been chasing the low quality high beta names as a way to quickly increase their equity exposure  If I am right in my thesis that we are in the midst of a buying panic  then the low quality theme makes sense as a trade  The way to participate is through the use of the Phoenix strategy The Phoenix rises again  I gave  of  on February 24  2009  shortly before the ultimate bottom in the stock market in March 2009  The idea behind the strategy is to find beaten down stocks that barely survived the bear market and have the financial or operational leverage to benefit from the coming upturn   The February 24  2009 list produced many winners  Notable among them were household names such as the Bank of America  BAC  Liz Claiborne  LIZ     and Saks  SKS  Different macro backdrop  but still dashing for trash This time  the macro backdrop is different  We were not in a recession  though arguably it has been a period of anemic economic growth  so the situation for many companies isn t as dire as it was in late 2008 and early 2009  Nevertheless  Phoenix does make sense as a way to participate in the  dash for trash  theme  With that in mind  I screened the members of the Russell 3000 for the following characteristics Stock price below  8  lower quality  high beta names One year return of  50  or less  beaten down stocks Market capitalization of  100 million or more  must be  real  companies Net positive insider buying  number insider buys   number of insider sells   0  which should provide some downside support should our thesis turn out to be wrong I came up with the following 39 names  American Superconductor Corp  AMSC   ATP Oil   Gas Corp United States  ATPG   Aviat Networks Inc  AVNW   Broadwind Energy Inc  BWEN   Central European Distribution Corp  CEDC   Clearwire Corp  CLWR   Cleveland Biolabs Inc  CBLI   Coldwater Creek Inc  CWTR   Demand Media Inc  DMD   EXCO Resources Inc  XCO

Semiconductor Inc  TQNT  and Willbros Group Inc  WG  Important caveats and disclaimers I know nothing about your investment objectives and risk tolerance so don t construe this as investment advice as this may not be a suitable strategy for you   This is obviously a high risk approach and I would take the following steps to control risk  First of all  determine how much of your portfolio you want to put into this strategy as 100  commitment is not suitable for pretty much everyone  Second  diversification is critical  I have received feedback when I last issued the call to buy into the Phoenix strategy about this stock or that stock not working out  If you do employ this strategy  you should buy a basket of these stocks and not focus on just one or two names   Do your own due diligence on the stocks on the list  For some investors  this list could serve as a starting point to do some investigation of their own  As well  define your risk tolerance carefully  either on an individual stock basis and or on a portfolio basis   Lastly  this is a momentum dependent strategy that should be rented and not owned  As soon as momentum wanes  that will be the exit signal  You re on your own A shorter list If 39 names is too much for you to think about  then I winnowed the list down to eight names by requiring that there are no insider sells  instead of just positive net insider buying  and heavy insider buying  defined as more than five insider buys within the last six months  ATP Oil   Gas Corp United States  ATPG   Coldwater Creek Inc  CWTR   Gentiva Health Services Inc  GTIV   MEMC Electronic Materials Inc  WFR   Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc  SVNT   SIGA Technologies Inc  SIGA   Sun Healthcare Group Inc  SUNH  and Willbros Group Inc  WG   Since the market rally has been going on for several months  buying into a Phoenix strategy now is being late in the game  However  as equity underweight investors rush to get into the stocks  this strategy should yield some decent returns if my investment thesis is correct  One important component of this approach is to watch momentum indicators carefully  When they start to turn down  then it s time to get out  Be bold  This is the time to hold your nose and  rent  the junk Full disclosure  I am personally long ATPG and SVNT and may seek to get long the other names mentioned in the days to come ,2012-02-13,Cam

3618,225133,BWEN,Broadwind Energy  The Wind Is Kicking Up,opinion,"Alternative energy has been a hot place to invest  And volatile  Solar has gone through a lot of ups and downs  But wind power has been left behind  at least in the stock market  That may be ready to change though  Broadwind Energy  NASDAQ BWEN  is starting to look attractive  It has been a long time since anyone could say that  Take a look at the weekly chart below  You would be hard pressed to find a more ugly chart  This stock dropped from a high of  290 to an ultimate low at  1 70  over 99 4   And it has basically done nothing for 3 years since getting there 

But lets zoom in on that last bit of chart  Since the low at 1 70 it has been steadily rising and crossing SMA s  The latest was a cross of the 200 week SMA in March  The bull case for more upside gets more weight from a Golden Cross  with the 50 week SMA crossing up through the 200 week SMA just last week  The series of higher highs and higher lows has been continuing for 18 months now and it is holding at support of the 20 week SMA  Stocks generally retrace at least parts of long trends  And if this stock only retraces 23 6  of the move down  the first Fibonacci ratio  it would target a move to 68  DO I have your attention now  Sure it has been a dog stock and maybe it retraces the bounce move first back to 1 70  But that is what a stop loss is for  An entry here or over the previous high even at 13 80  would have plenty of upward potential  And a stop a few cents under the 20 week SMA keeps the losses light  I bought some yesterday to get started

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Thursday which  as July gets in full swing sees the equity markets looking very strong  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue in its uptrend while Crude Oil continues lower in a pullback in the uptrend  The US Dollar Index looks to move sideways while US Treasuries consolidate but are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are biased to the upside  Volatility looks to remain unusually low and actually biased lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts show strength but with the QQQ possibly getting extended and the IWM near prior resistance  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
