120792,342307,NYT,Why The New York Times Stock Gained 44  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of The New York Times  NYSE NYT  outpaced last year s booming market  soaring 44  compared to the 29  rise of the S P 500  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence 
In July  shares were up by as much as 60  from where they began the year  but only partially recovered from an August slump during the final quarter 

So what
Robust demand for its news products pushed digital subscriptions past 4 million last year  including an impressive 31  spike in the fiscal third quarter  That success drove the media company s revenues upward by nearly 5  through the first three quarters of the year  demonstrating that it has a path for growth even as demand for its print edition wanes 
It wasn t all good news for shareholders  though  as operating costs have been outpacing revenue growth  The New York Times has also been hurt by challenges in the digital advertising industry 
Now what
Those challenges are expected to reduce fourth quarter advertising revenue by a mid teen percentage  according to CEO Mark Thompson and his team  The company is also predicting continued robust growth in its subscriber base when it posts results in early February  Investors are hoping that the growing subscriber fee revenue base will begin boosting profitability soon  but that s likely not going to happen in 2020 since management intends to spend aggressively on its digital platform during the year ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phenq,2058083

To draw a further contrast  McClatchy s stock has fallen 95  in the past two years  It has a market capitalization of  3 3 million  The New York Times stock is up 17  over the same period  It has a market capitalization of  5 5 billion  In the last quarter  the Times had revenue of  428 million and net income of  16 million  McClatchy had revenue of  167 million  Its net loss was  23 million Experts who follow the newspaper industry have said the industry is doomed  While that may be true  it certainly will continue to be badly injured  No other paper can approach the success of the New York Times  The quality of all other major city dailies has fallen too far for them to be attractive to most possible subscribers  At the same time  the quality of the New York Times has gotten better

120822,342337,NYT,Can The New York Times Company Repeat Its Success in 2020 ,news,"A couple years ago  few investors would have identified The New York Times  NYSE NYT  as a potential growth stock  yet The Gray Lady has enjoyed a heady run lately  Shares of the newspaper and online content powerhouse surged 44  in 2019  and over the last three years  the stock has booked a cumulative total return of 148   In this article  we ll look at the key factors that will affect shares in 2020  For reference  the company will next report quarterly earnings in early February  
Strength in digital circulation
The New York Times  digital only subscription growth has figured as its main economic driver and stock price catalyst over the last few years  In the first three reported quarters of 2019  digital only subscriptions grew 31  versus the comparable prior year period  while revenue from these products rose by 15   Although news product subscriptions accounted for most of this growth  the smaller category of non news digital  subs  has experienced extremely rapid expansion  This category  consisting primarily of stand alone subscriptions to the Times  highly regarded cooking and crossword products  achieved revenue growth of nearly 57  to  15 6 million during the first nine months of 2019 
Heading into 2020  The New York Times plans to juice subscription growth by cashing in on its promotional investments  During the company s Q3 2019 earnings conference call in November  CEO Mark Thompson relayed that the newspaper is cutting down on the number of articles users can read anonymously  thus encouraging visitors to go through a registration process that should eventually result in higher subscriptions  Also  the company is attempting to convert customers who originally signed up in 2018 on a  1 per week promotional digital subscription into full price subscribers  Management should have more data on both of these efforts in the next two quarters 
New revenue streams
The New York Times  digital subscription momentum is buttressed by new content offerings  including podcasts  TV  and radio shows  This recent evolution is best exemplified by The Daily  its runaway hit podcast and radio show about its top trending stories  The Daily boasts over 2 million listeners  and regularly lands in the top 10 podcasts as measured by podcast ranking services that track listening stats  
The company s new television show  The Weekly  is another example of content innovation  Management cited revenue generated by The Weekly as the main force behind a nearly  10 million year over year increase in  other  revenue in the third quarter  other revenue totaled  48 million during the period  
The Daily  The Weekly  and other shows have opened up a new advertising stream for The New York Times  but the primary purpose of this content is to expose a wider audience to the company s journalistic prowess  and funnel listeners to customer status under its  subscription first  revenue focus  Shareholders can expect additional investments in both journalism and content production in 2020  as the organization s initial yield from this effort has exceeded expectations  

Digital advertising weakness
One headwind shareholders will watch in 2020 is a recent deceleration in advertising revenue  While print advertising was expected to be soft in 2019  and indeed  it declined about 9  to  191 million in the first nine months of the year   digital advertising revenue has also weakened in the last few months  dipping 5  to  55 million in the third quarter  It s still grown by 9  to  168 million in the first nine months of 2019 against the comparable 2018 period  but management expects the digital advertising top line to decline in the fiscal fourth quarter by  the mid teens  versus Q4 2018  which saw an outsize 31  increase against its own comparable period 
The New York Times  digital advertising revenue tends to be variable  as it s often affected by large  one time deals  It s too early to tell whether current digital advertising weakness will persist as an earnings headwind throughout 2020  Management is nonetheless confident that the company will see a pickup in this revenue stream at some point in the coming quarters  During the third quarter call  Thompson cited as just one example of progress a new multiyear agreement with Verizon in which The New York Times will offer free access to over 7 million students and teachers in Title 1 schools across the United States  
The election year effect
The New York Times  earnings and share price renaissance over the past three years can be traced in part to a surge of subscriptions it reaped during the 2016 election year amid heightened interest in the U S  presidential race  Subsequent coverage of the Trump administration has also factored into subscription growth  I ve previously described the often adversarial relationship between the company and President Trump as a mutually beneficial   frenemy  arrangement 
As we head into a new election year  The New York Times is almost certain to see a boost in digital subscriptions  as its investments in greater journalistic firepower over the last three years will enable it to provide far reaching and in depth coverage on the 2020 race  Investors can expect digital subscription activity to enjoy a tailwind from this effect as early as this summer  Depending on the company s performance to that point  this may either help it recover from near term profit taking or sustain its strong share price momentum of the past three years ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfwwk,2055908

120862,342377,NYT,NYT   GCI  Should Dividend Investors Check Out Newspaper Stocks ,opinion,"This week  The New York Times Company   NYSE NYT   impressed investors with its latest earnings report  The company posted revenue growth of 4   comfortably topping estimates on the back of strong digital subscription figures  The newspaper giant added 265 000 digital only members in the latest quarter  its biggest increase since right after the 2016 U S  election 
NYT s performance helped the company record earnings of 32 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus by four cents  It was the 10th consecutive quarter that NYT surpassed earnings estimates  Management also announced that it would be raising its quarterly dividend by a penny to five cents per share 
Shares of NYT skyrocketed to a 13 year high in the wake of the report  as the results quickly reminded that it is  in fact  possible to succeed and grow in today s evolving media landscape  And for those worried about whether they missed the boat on NYT  there might even be another interesting newspaper stock to check out right now 
NYT rival Gannett   NYSE GCI   should be reporting its latest quarterly earnings within the next few weeks  This publisher owns USA Today and more than 100 local media brands  making it the largest newspaper company by way of circulation in the United States 
As Ryan explores in today s video  earnings estimates for Gannett s to be reported quarter have moved slightly higher over the past 60 days  which is typically a good sign as it approaches its report date  Gannett is still struggling to grow earnings and revenue  but it does hold another strong characteristic that might attract investors 
Indeed  GCI appears to be a decent dividend stock  as the company pays a  0 16 per share quarterly distribution that yields 5 8  on an annualized basis right now  GCI has sustained this 16 cent payment for several years  and although its 54  payout ratio is a bit high  the company is likely aiming to maintain or grow the dividend 
Gannett has a different model than NYT especially with digital media but it s similar to the Times in that it is a traditional media company looking to move further into the next era  Whether it can pull that off in the long term is uncertain  yet the stock looks like a decent dividend option ahead of earnings 
Make sure to check out today s video for more information on NYT and GCI

120903,342418,NYT,Publishers rebuke Google s interpretation of EU privacy law,news,"By Paresh Dave SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Google is forcing media firms that generate revenue from its advertising services to accept unreasonable responsibilities under a new European privacy law  four major publisher trade groups told the Alphabet Inc  O GOOGL  unit late Sunday in a letter seen by Reuters  The dispute reflects differing interpretations of the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR   which imposes a range of new requirements on how companies collect and process personal information about EU users  The law comes into effect May 25  and over the past several weeks many companies have begun to detail how they will comply   Google is the biggest vendor of the software and services that many newspapers and digital media firms use to sell ads on their websites and mobile apps   As part of its plans for GDPR  Google would offload to publishers the burden of getting user consent for the data collection that is at the core of how Google s ad serving business operates   The company has also irked publishers by saying that rather than being a  processor  of data as defined by GDPR  it wants to be a  controller   giving it more ability to use information such as reader data for its own purposes    Your proposal severely falls short on many levels   publisher groups wrote to Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai  adding that it  would undermine the fundamental purposes of the GDPR and the efforts of publishers to comply with the letter and spirit of the law    Signing the five page letter  which ends on several questions to Google  were Digital Content Next  European Publishers Council  News Media Alliance and News Media Association  They represent about 4 000 newspapers and media companies  primarily in Europe and North America  including Axel Springer  Telegraph Media Group   New York Times  Co  N NYT   Associated Press and Thomson Reuters  Google said Monday it was committed to complying with the  significant new obligations for the ecosystem  under GDPR   We appreciate that there is a lot of confusion around the requirements of GDPR  so we are looking to help our publishers as much as we can   spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn told Reuters   We published more information in our Help Center last week to help our partners understand what we re providing and the steps they need to take to comply with GDPR   Publishers could in principle move to rival services if they do not like Google s terms  But Google s network is unrivaled in size and can often generate more revenue for publishers than rival newtorks can  Publishers said Google s requirement that publishers obtain consent on behalf of Google and its business partners in the ad serving sector could enable the search giant to dictate what constitutes consent and which other ad services a publisher can use   They note that GDPR does permit tracking of users without their permission for certain reasons  including serving  a legitimate interest  such as combating account fraud or measuring marketing efforts  Yet Google is insisting on affirmative consent in all cases  GDPR violations can carry hefty fines  and publishers wrote that Google s terms could multiply their exposure to  potentially ruinous  judgements by leaving them liable for misuse by Google and its partners  Spokeswoman Blackburn said Google is a controller under GDPR  because we make decisions on data processing to help publishers optimize ad revenue   but the company notes that the  designation does not give us any additional rights to data  than afforded by its publisher contracts  The company already requires publishers to obtain  certain consents  from European users and that it is  updating those requirements in line with the GDPR   Google said  Google said it is providing optional tools to help publishers meet the requirements  Jason Kint  CEO of Digital Content Next  said the statements show that at a time of heightened awareness about online privacy   these big tech behemoths are focused on protecting their massive collection of personal data rather than aligning with the spirit of these new rules and raising the bar on consumer trust   Smaller players in the digital advertising supply chain say they are concerned that Google could limit working with them if publishers have not obtained consent on their behalf

120907,342422,NYT,New York Times  NYT  Soars To A 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of The New York Times   NYSE NYT    Shares have been on the move with the stock up 15 4  over the past month  NYT hit a new 52 week high of  26 75 in the previous session  The New York Times has gained 43 5  since the start of the year compared to the  10 1  move for the Consumer Staples sector and the 22  year to date return for its peer group 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 3  2018  The New York Times reported EPS of  0 17 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 15 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1 34  
For the current fiscal year  The New York Times is expected to post earnings of  0 91 per share on  1 71 billion in revenues  This represents a 13 75  change in EPS on a 2 31  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 12 per share on  1 78 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 23 08  and 3 96   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
The New York Times may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for NYT  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
The New York Times has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 29 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 22 3X versus its peer group s average of 7X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 24  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective The New York Times Company Price and Consensus
    Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  The New York Times currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2 and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if The New York Times passes the test  Thus  it seems as though NYT shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2018-06-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/new-york-times-nyt-soars-to-a-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200327151,200327151

120913,342428,NYT,3 Stocks Soaring To Multi Month Highs After Earnings,opinion,"Broad market indexes were down slightly through early afternoon trading hours Wednesday  but a number of notable stocks surged to key multi month highs on the back of better than expected earnings results 
The biggest surprise of the day is Snap   NYSE SNAP    which posted its latest results on Tuesday afternoon  The embattled social media company reported revenue growth of 36 4   surpassing analyst estimates and its own guidance range on the back improved user trends 
The Snapchat parent  which has struggled to maintain users amid competition from Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   Instagram  said that daily active users  DAUs  in the quarter totaled 186 million  This is down about 1  from the year ago period but unchanged sequentially and above expectations 
The recent quarter s performance resulted in an adjusted loss of 4 cents per share  narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 8 cents and the year ago quarter s loss of 13 cents  Investors were also optimistic about Snap s engagement numbers and the early results of its Android app redesign 
Snap shares surged as much as 29  to touch an intraday high of  9 09 on Tuesday  This marked the highest level the stock has seen in at least three months  Snap still has a mountain to climb  as shortly after this time last year it was trading as high as  21 22 per share  but the company is finally moving in the right direction again 
Another pleasant surprise for investors Tuesday was Skyworks Solutions   NASDAQ SWKS    The specialty chip maker s better than feared report was celebrated by semiconductor bulls  who were happy to lift the beaten down stock about 12  to a three month high of  87 48 a share 
At first glance  many of Skyworks  numbers weren t too great revenue fell 8  year over year  margins contracted across the board  and earnings per share missed the consensus by a penny but the report outperformed the company s revised guidance and pointed to signs that a pullback in demand might run its course soon 
Management expects its challenges to continue in the ongoing quarter  but investors interpreted a newly approved  2 billion share repurchase program as a bullish indicator meant to reward stockholders for being patient 
Wednesday s other earnings success story was The New York Times Company    NYSE NYT     Forget the multi month highs here  as shares of the New York Times publisher skyrocketed to a 13 year high on the back of its earnings results and ambitious plans for the future 
NYT said today that it added 265 000 digital subscriptions last quarter  its biggest quarterly increase since right after the 2016 U S  elections  The company ended the quarter with 3 4 million digital subscriptions  putting it three quarters of the way to a five year goal of doubling digital revenue after just three years 
Overall  fourth quarter revenue at NYT surged 10   excluding the impact of 2017 s extra week  with subscription revenue up 5  and ad sales up 11   At one point today  the stock was up nearly 14  to  30 60 per share

Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge

120954,342469,NYT,Newspapers aim to ride  Trump Bump  to reach readers  advertisers,news,By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK  Reuters    The Trump administration s combative view of traditional news media as the  opposition party  and  fake news  is turning out to be the best hope in 2017 for newspapers struggling to attract more digital readers and advertisers  The  New York Times   N NYT   the Financial Times  The Wall Street Journal and  Gannett Co   N GCI  are building on the online readership they gained during the 2016 presidential election by marketing unbiased reporting as a sales strategy  The risk  however  is whether those new readers will attract advertising dollars to the newspapers  some of which have been criticized for having political leanings  An Edelman survey of more than 33 000 people in 28 countries shows trust in the media is at an all time low at just 35 percent  So far  there is reason for optimism among newspaper executives and investors  The New York Times  which President Donald Trump has referred to as  failing  in his Twitter messages  added a record 276 000 digital news subscribers in the last quarter and sees digital ad revenue up 10 to 15 percent in the current quarter  The company said it expects to add 200 000 digital subscriptions to its news products in the first quarter  The Wall Street Journal added 113 000 digital subscriptions in its latest quarter  an almost 12 percent jump  The company said that January s numbers were even higher  but it declined to provide figures   Financial Times digital subscriptions jumped 6 percent in the fourth quarter to 646 000  while digital subscriptions at the 109 local newspapers across the country that make up the Gannett s USA Today Network  grew 26 percent to 182 000 in the fourth quarter   Meanwhile USA Today  which is part of the USA Today Network  and not subscription based  saw revenue grow 1 4 percent  the company said  It said 68 percent of USA Today s advertising revenue in the fourth quarter came from digital  In addition to the proliferation of  fake news  websites that publish false stories for propaganda purposes  another challenge for traditional media is hostility from Trump who has on occasion described their reporting as  fake news   Republican Trump s close adviser  Stephen Bannon  told The New York Times in an interview in January   The media s the opposition party  and not the Democratic Party   NO TILT  To win over advertisers and readers  trust  The Wall Street Journal ran ads online and in print during the election  One featured a pin ball machine with the tagline   No Tilt  Campaign coverage that s on the level   The paper has run ads after the election to highlight its content as  created  curated and checked in a real newsroom    The New York Times  which is focused on increasing its subscriber revenue  in January launched its  Truth  campaign consisting of online ads urging readers to sign up because   Truth  It needs your support    The newspaper sees an opportunity in making sure readers understand that it is fair and accurate and plans to launch another marketing campaign in coming weeks  Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson said on the company s last earnings call  The Financial Times is running its  Facts  Truths   campaign promoting its coverage of the election and now the Trump administration  Gannett  which rebranded its publications under the  USA Today Network   has used the election to highlight it has journalists at local newspapers across the United States  said Andy Yost  chief marketing officer at Gannett  WILL ADVERTISERS COME  Divisiveness stirred by the election campaign has made brands avoid publications that appear to be politically aligned  said Natalie Prout  a strategist at Phenomenon  a Los Angeles based branding agency   For example  there is a heightened understanding in the wake of November s election that if a brand buys an ad in The Huffington Post  for example  it could be perceived as supporting a liberal agenda  Prout said  Brands are also worried about their ads showing up in what is perceived as  fake news   so they are exercising more caution when using programmatic advertising  where they automatically buy digital ad spots through a third party  Instead of listing which sites they do not want their ads showing up on  more advertisers are choosing which sites they do want to see their ads  said Barry Lowenthal  president of The Media Kitchen  a New York based media buyer  Despite the recent bump in subscribers  newspapers still are facing major headwinds  said newspaper analyst Ken Doctor    Print advertising is in free fall   Doctor said   The fundamentals haven t changed   But growing digital subscribers can help attract advertisers to other areas  such as conferences  said Suzi Watford  chief marketing officer of Dow Jones  which includes The Wall Street Journal    The more we are able to bring in people  the more we are able to build and maintain a

120963,342478,NYT,5 Top Stocks To Buy For Terrific Earnings Growth,opinion,"Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have earnings  Earnings growth draws the attention of almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  And why not  If the company doesn t make money  it won t survive the test of time 
This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price  Better than expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price  However  in addition to actual earnings  expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock 
Earnings Estimates Determine Share Prices
We have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline  This is largely a result of a company s earnings failing to meet market expectations 
Earnings estimates embody analysts  opinions of factors such as sales growth  product demand  competitive industry environment  profit margins and cost control  Thus  earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions  Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm 
Investors  thus  should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Hence  it is important for investors to buy stocks that have witnessed historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we have added the following parameters

DFS Presents an Attractive Risk Reward Trade Off
DFS is down 19  year to date while the S P 500 is up 11   This price depreciation amidst solid fundamentals provides an attractive buying opportunity  At its current price of  58 share  DFS has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 6  This ratio means the market expects DFS  NOPAT to permanently decline 40  from current levels  This expectation seems rather pessimistic for a firm that has consistently grown NOPAT over the past decade

NYT Presents Valuation Risk
Despite the lagging fundamentals  NYT is up 42  year to date  which far outpaces the 11  gain of the S P 500  The significant price appreciation leaves NYT with significant downside risk 
To justify its current price of  19 share  NYT must maintain 2016 NOPAT margins  6   and grow NOPAT by 8  compounded annually for the next 13 years  This expectation seems rather optimistic for a firm that has seen NOPAT decline by 9  compounded annually over the past decade

with sinking advertising revenues  and the global economic slowdown has only worsened the situation  The downturn in the newspaper publishing industry witnessed over the last few years was aggravated by a decline in print readership  More and more readers started opting for online news  thereby making the print advertising model increasingly irrelevant Changing consumer preferences and the advent of new and innovative technologies have been altering the way news is offered and read  Readers now have myriad choices when it comes to collecting and reading articles or news through devices such as netbooks  tablets or other hand held devices  Advertisers are now tapping the online video boom to reach their audience These factors have been weighing on the print industry  as advertisers now get low cost avenues to reach their target audience more effectively  We believe that an alternative and stable source of revenues is needed to salvage the dwindling print newspaper industry  To deal with the situation  newspaper companies are trimming their operations  resorting to restructuring  revamping their print editions and investing in digital initiatives Declining Newspaper Advertising RevenuesAdvertising remains a significant source of revenues for the industry that in turn depends on the health of the economy  Macroeconomic factors such as sluggishness in business spending  high unemployment and falling home sales may affect the level of national  retail and classified advertising revenues  as advertisers cut their budget in response to soft economic conditions Advertising volumes remain under pressure as advertisers still deter from making any upfront commitment in an economy under recovery  The McClatchy Company  NYSEAMERICAN      witnessed a 15 6  drop in print advertising revenues during the second quarter of 2017  preceded by a decline of 17  in the first quarter  Print advertising revenues fell 10 5  in the second quarter  following a decline of 17 9  in the preceding quarter at The New York Times Company  NYSE       At Gannett Co   Inc   NYSE       print advertising and circulation revenues declined 16 8  and 7 4   respectively  on a same store basis Newspaper Companies Keeping Up Changing TrendsNewspaper companies have now been remodeling and restructuring themselves to better align with the growing need of marketers  targeting younger people  affluent households and other demographic groups with multiple web and print publications  Publishing companies are adapting to the changing face of the multi platform media universe  which currently includes Internet  mobile  tablet  social media networks and outdoor video advertising in its portfolio McClatchy launched a new digital advertising agency   excellerate   to provide marketing solutions to local and regional advertising clients  The company s digital only advertising revenues surged 10  in the second quarter of 2017  while total digital advertising revenue fell a marginal 0 9  from the year ago period  The New York Times Company s digital advertising revenues jumped 22 5   while New Media Investment Group Inc  s  NYSE      digital revenues increased 9  during the second quarter Publishing companies have been disciplined buyers of local media assets  New Media Investment Group has been continuously looking for strategic buyouts  The company concluded the acquisition

In the reported quarter  The New York Times Company  which carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   registered an increase in the number of digital subscribers and a rise in circulation revenue  The quarter also witnessed a decline in print and digital advertising revenues  Adjusted operating costs remained almost flat at  318 2 million during the quarter under review  Management now anticipates adjusted operating costs to increase in the low to mid single digits in the third quarter of 2016 The New York Times Company s total revenue of  372 6 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  376 million  and decreased 2 7  year over year 
Circulation revenue grew 3  to  219 5 million  primarily backed by the company s digital subscription initiatives and a rise in the home delivery price of The New York Times in 2016  Circulation revenue from digital only subscription jumped 15 3  to  56 4 million  Circulation revenue from digital only subscriptions to news products rose 14  to  54 1 million  Management now projects total circulation revenue in the third quarter of 2016 to increase at a rate in line with the second quarter

Digital advertising revenue tumbled 6 8  to  45 million  after witnessing a decrease of 1 3  in the previous quarter  The fall in the digital advertising was due to a decline in traditional website display advertising  partly offset by sturdy growth experienced across mobile  video and virtual reality  branded content and programmatic advertising  Nevertheless  management projects solid revenue growth from both digital advertising and digital consumer business in the third quarter 
The company saw a 14 1  drop in the display advertising category and a 6 1  fall in the classified advertising category  The diversified media conglomerate hinted that total advertising revenue in the third quarter may decline in the mid single digits compared with the prior year period 
Total adjusted operating profit plunged 15 4  to  54 5 million on account of a fall in advertising revenue  partly offset by a rise in circulation revenue 
Other Financial Aspects
The New York Times Company ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about  915 4 million  and total debt and capital lease obligations of approximately  433 7 million  The company incurred capital expenditures of about  5 million during the quarter  Management foresees total capital expenditures in the band of  35 million to  40 million for 2016 NY TIMES A Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Conclusion
Advertising  which remains a significant source of revenue  is largely dependent on the global financial health  Softness in advertising demand has been weighing on The New York Times Company s performance  Consequently  the company is trying every means to shield itself from the impact of an unstable market and contemplating on new avenues of revenue generation  The company had offloaded assets that bear no direct relation to its core operations in order to re focus on its core newspapers and pay more attention to online activities 
The New York Times Company has been adding diverse revenue streams  such as a pay and read model  to stay less vulnerable to economic conditions  The company is also adapting to the changing face of the multiplatform media universe  and has already included mobile and reader application products in its portfolio  Other publishing companies such as New Media Investment Group Inc    NYSE NEWM    Gannett Co   Inc    NYSE GCI   and The McClatchy Company   NYSE MNI   are also trying to adapt to different revenue generating ways 
Despite hiccups in the economy  what still promises revenue generation is The New York Times Company s pricing system for NYTimes com  which was launched on Mar 28  2011  The company notified that the number of paid digital subscribers reached 1 424 000 at the end of the reported quarter   rising 67 000 sequentially  51 000 came from the digital news products and 16 000 from the Crossword product  and 25  year over year

121205,342720,NYT,UPDATE 3 Cheaper Roche drug as good as Lucentis report,news,"  Study results could eat into sales of pricier Roche
drug 	
   Avastin costs about  50 shot vs about  2 000 for
Lucentis	
  
  Add timeline for results in second paragraph 	
 By Julie Steenhuysen	
 CHICAGO  April 27  Reuters    Avastin  a cancer drug made by
Roche Holding AG   was about as effective as the
company s far more expensive eye drug  Lucentis  at preventing
vision loss in people with age related macular degeneration  the
New York Times reported on Wednesday 	
 The two drugs were compared in a federally funded U S  study
due to be released on Sunday at a medical meeting and in the New
England Journal of Medicine  The results are now expected some
time on Thursday   ID nLDE73J1XO 	
 The Times report cited two anonymous sources who said the
study found injections of Lucentis and Avastin given every four
weeks had similar results after one year  Release of trial
results ahead of their publication is considered a scientific
and ethical breach 	
 At stake are billions of dollars in Lucentis sales for both
Roche  which sells the medicine in the U S   and Novartis Inc
   which sells the medicine outside the United States 	
 Avastin could cannibalize Lucentis sales because it costs
about  50 per shot  compared with about  2 000 for a dose of
Lucentis and would be a more attractive treatment if its
efficacy and safety profiles are similar 	
 Age related macular degeneration  or AMD  is the leading
cause of blindness in people over 60  Some 13 million Americans
have signs of AMD and more than 1 million Americans have the wet
form  the most severe type 	
 Avastin is not licensed for use in the eye but it works in a
similar way to Lucentis  and doctors often use Avastin off label
in these patients 	
 Most analysts expected Avastin to prove as effective as
Lucentis in the 1 200 patient test 	
 Last year  Roche and Novartis each generated around  1 5
billion in Lucentis sales and some analysts suggest it could go
on to become a  10 billion plus drug 	
 
 SAFETY DEBATE	
 The New York Times said researchers taking part in the study
met on Tuesday in Chicago to hear the results  but were sworn to
secrecy  The study was conducted by the National Eye Institute 
part of the National Institutes of Health 	
 NEI spokeswoman Jean Horrigan confirmed that the meeting
took place but could not comment on whether the institute will
investigate who leaked the results  or when they would become
available 	
 What the study may not settle is a growing debate over
whether using a cancer drug to treat an eye disease exposes
patients to additional safety risks 	
 Yaron Werber of Citigroup said in a note to clients on
Wednesday the study is too small to detect any safety
differences between the two drugs  echoing claims by Roche s
Genentech unit 	
 Anthony Adamis  global head of ophthalmology at Genentech 
said in an interview this week there is an emerging body of data
suggesting there may be safety differences between the two
molecules  Genentech has not seen the results of the full study 
 	
 Adamis said Lucentis is a much smaller molecule than Avastin
and is cleared out of the blood stream within two hours  as
opposed to Avastin  which takes 20 days to be cleared 	
  The thinking is that would be a good thing because the more
it is exposed to the body the greater the risk for side
effects   Adamis said 	
 Some analysts believe there may be an increased risk of
stroke and death with Avastin because it does not bind as
tightly to the eye and could cause systemic side effects 	
 The outcome of the U S  trial is important not only for the
two Swiss drugmakers but also Germany s Bayer   which
is developing a rival eye drug called VEGF Trap Eye with
Regeneron  	
 In the wet form of macular degeneration  abnormal blood
vessels grow beneath the retina and leak blood and fluid  Both
Lucentis and Avastin are vascular endothelial growth factor  or
VEGF  inhibitors that work by blocking the growth of blood
vessels

   Charts paint bearish technical picture

 LONDON  Sept 2  Reuters    European shares fell sharply on
Friday  snapping a four session rally  on concerns that U S 
non farm payrolls numbers could signal the world s biggest
economy was headed for a recession 	
 Financials came under renewed pressure  with Greek banks
 falling 5 2 percent and Greek shares down 3 4
percent after the country said on Thursday it would miss its
budget deficit target

Monetary Fund and European Central Bank inspectors on whether it

 The STOXX Europe 600 banking index fell 2 7 percent

prepared to be filed against big U S  banks such as Bank of
America and Goldman Sachs  	
 The report said investors fear that if banks are forced to
pay out billions for mortgages that defaulted  the suit could
sap earnings for years and contribute to further losses across
the financial services industry 	
 At 0845 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top 
European shares was down 1 8 percent at 955 61 points after 
rising 0 7 percent in the previous session  The index fell 10 6
percent in August and is down 14 percent so far this year  with
recent macroeconomic data raising fears about a recession 	
  I think the job figures are going to be worse than
expected  It could be a wake up call for the market and share
prices could go down even further   said Koen De Leus 
strategist at KBC Securities  in Brussels 	
  Expectations of the QE3  another round of quantitative
easing  have helped shares in the past days  but at the end of
the day  the market needs better economic environment that
stimulates growth and company results  	
 The U S  non farm payrolls data is expected to show an
increase of 75 000 jobs  although market talk points to the
possibility of a much lower number at 1230 GMT  following a
decline in the employment component of the Institute for Supply
Management s factory activity index on Thursday 	
  Despite the fact we recently got some better than expected
economic releases  recession fears are dominating the markets  
The U S  jobs report  the mother of all economic releases  will
be quite important  A weak figure may bring QE3 a step closer

 Automobile shares featured among the biggest fallers  with
the sector index dropping 3 4 percent on concerns that
slower economic growth will hurt global demand for vehicles 	
 
 BEARISH TECHNICAL OUTLOOK	
 Technical analysts said the Euro STOXX 50   the
euro zone s blue chip index  could fall back towards the 2 170
area where it had got the trendline support connecting the

likely resonate for many months to come  Although it s going
sideways at the moment  it s going sideways at lower levels and
ultimately that doesn t bode well for the index   said Phil
Roberts  chief European technical strategist at Barclays

factors working against recessionary forces  The impetus should
come from emerging market economies and we may be bottoming on
the U S  manufacturing cycle   said Didier Duret  global chief
investment officer at ABN AMRO Private Banking 	
 ABN AMRO increased its exposure to information technology
companies and consumer discretionary shares 	
  We are in a step by step approach towards increasing the
risk in the portfolio because we think that the value is there 
We find dividend yields higher than bond yields in a lot of
stocks and this is not something that happens frequently   Duret
said  adding that low equity valuations were another compelling
reason to increase its exposure to equities 	
 Echoing a similar view  HSBC strategist Garry Evans said
economic growth in developed economies was likely to be sub par
for a long time  but equities may still do okay as emerging
markets growth remains robust  allowing earnings for U S  and
European companies the chance to grow at a faster pace than
their local economies  	
 Moreover  equity returns have poor correlation with economic
growth in the long run  Valuations matter much more  On most
measures  equity valuation is back to the level of the early
1980s   he said 	
 According to Thomson Reuters Datastream  the STOXX Europe
600 index carried a 12 month forward price to earnings
ratio of 8 7  the lowest since early 2009  against a 10 year
average of 13 2

121211,342726,NYT,Daily Watch List  The Loop,opinion,"Right off the bat I felt that we were not going to have a lot of actionable ideas from yesterday s watch list based on the gap up pre market   I m not a big fan of buying gap ups especially one that comes after an extended move   What ended up happening is a gap and crap  the  ARCA SPY  traded as high as  201 75 before settling at  200 50 
A few things that you should know about this swing strategy 
It s main goal is to get you in when stocks are moving and keep you out in choppy sloppy markets  it is imperative that you allowed the market to get you in only when the stocks go through their previous day s high 
Your awareness of how the market is behaving is crucial  this will give you an idea of how hard to push the envelope   My best indicator for this is my rolling 5 day watch list 
Swing trading is a numbers game  you are going to be wrong half the time  risk management is above all  and many times you will have nothing to do like yesterday because the market did not get you in  We are not looking for any action  we are looking for the right action 
Don t be penny wise  don t try to anticipate a move just because the chart looks good   You can have a great looking tight set up with a stock coiling for 10 days but who is to say that it won t coil for another 5 days   If you anticipate the range expansion you might buy something that is not ready to go and it will only frustrate you and lower your odds of a winning trade 
For me this list is a one way list   long bias   I do not look at this list as a long or short list  long and short are two different games with different dynamics 
You need to be extremely organized   Most if not all your work will be done pre market and you will spend the day just executing or you can just automated it with buy orders after 9 45am 
Today s list is short as well  not many names and I felt like I stretched a little to put some of these names on the list   yesterday s cautionary signal came and went 
Textura Corp  NYSE TXTR   World Wrestling Entertainment Inc  NYSE WWE    NASDAQ SCTY    NASDAQ CAMP    NYSE TWC    NASDAQ XOMA    NYSE NYT    NASDAQ GEOS    NASDAQ FRAN    NASDAQ VRA    NASDAQ BCOV    NASDAQ PLUG    NYSE CRCM    NASDAQ ACAT  
The Process
Every morning I go through a few of my scans to find buy candidates for the day   Depending on the current state of the market the size of the list will vary  usually its no more than 50 names   My process is based on market structure not on beliefs or myths of what works  or what doesn t work   They are certain behavioral patterns that have been around for 100 years that are based on market structure  these behavioral patterns are recognizable  observable  and quantifiable   On daily basis we have 5 000 stocks that we filter based on certain market structures that gives us an edge of a higher probability than a random outcome   Once the list is narrowed to a handful of names the market will further narrow down the list by getting us in or keeping us out of these names with a range expansion move 
I don t look at charts in your conventional cookie cutter manner  or have rules as to where the stock should be whether its 15  off its 52 week highs or above or below certain moving averages etc 
These are what I consider  tight set ups  that will trigger a buy signal for me if  and only when they break the previous day s high   On a regular trading day I would indiscriminately take every trigger because you just don t know which one will be the big winner  you might have an idea but in the end you don t know 
How much you put at risk per trade depends for the most part what your current outlook is for the market over the next 0 5 days 
Put these names on your trading platform  set the alerts at yesterday s high for each name  once the alert goes off take a look at the chart  decided within 3 seconds whether or not you are going to buy it  decide how much you want to risk on the trade and your stop loss  hit the buy button  and leave the rest up to the market  wash  rinse  repeat

Changing consumer preferences and the advent of new and innovative technologies have been altering the way news is offered and read  Readers now have myriad choices to collect and read articles and news through devices such as netbooks  tablets or other hand held devices  These have been weighing on the print industry  as advertisers now get low cost avenues through which they can reach their target audience more effectively  We believe that an alternative and stable source of revenue is the demand of time  to salvage the dwindling print newspaper industry Waning Newspaper Advertising Revenues Advertising remains a significant source of revenue for the industry that in turn depends on the health of the economy  The macroeconomic factors such as sluggishness in business spending  high unemployment and falling home sales may affect the level of national  retail and classified advertising revenues  as advertisers cut their budget in response to weak economic conditions  Advertising volumes are still under pressure as advertisers still deter from making any upfront commitments in an economy which remains in recovery mode  According to the data released by the Kantar Media Intelligence  advertising expenditures during second quarter 2014 fell 9 7  at Local Newspapers and 15 8  at National Newspapers due to soft spending across automotive  financial service and retail categories  Print advertising revenues at New York Times Company  NYSE NYT  dropped 5 3  in the third quarter of 2014  while at The McClatchy Company  NYSE MNI  it dropped 11 2   At Gannett Co Inc  NYSE GCI   publishing advertising revenue fell 4 9  in the quarter Newspaper Companies Adapting to Changing Trends Newspaper companies have now been remodeling and restructuring themselves to better align to the growing need of marketers  targeting younger people  affluent households and other demographic groups with multiple web and print publications  The publishing companies are adapting to the changing face of the multi platform media universe  which currently includes Internet  mobile  tablet  social media networks and outdoor video advertising in its portfolio  Newspaper publishing companies have been offloading assets that bear no direct relation with the core operations  diversifying revenue base and even separating their broadcasting and digital properties from the sluggish print business  Gannett has been steadily enhancing its presence in broadcasting and digital products to lower its dependency on its soft print media business

121249,342764,NYT,FOREX Dollar declines as stocks rebound  oil jumps,news,"  Dollar drops vs major currencies as U S  stocks recover
   Yen hits one month high earlier on China stock decline
   Sterling falls as some BoE members wanted bigger QE
  Updates prices  adds quote  details 
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK  Aug 19  Reuters    The dollar fell against the
euro and a basket of currencies on Wednesday as a rebound on
Wall Street reduced safe haven demand for the U S  currency 
 But the dollar weakened against the yen  although it came
off the day s worst levels as a sharp slide in China s stock
market overnight raised concerns about the global economic
outlook and boosted the Japanese currency s allure 
 A recovery in U S  stocks and a more than 4 percent jump in
oil prices to above  72 a barrel lifted commodity currencies 
while the euro pushed above  1 42  on track for its biggest
daily rise against the dollar in more than two weeks 
  Currencies have been tracking sentiment  in the equity and
oil markets  said Brian Kim  currency strategist at UBS in
Stamford  Connecticut   That s why we ve seen the dollar come
off  
 In recent months  the dollar has tended to fall as stock
prices and risk appetite rise  giving investors less impetus to
buy dollars as a safe haven 
 In late New York trading  the euro rose 0 7 percent to
 1 4236  well off a session low of  1 4081  according to
Reuters data 
 In the absence of fresh economic data  currencies were
mostly following stock prices for direction  With trading desks
thinned out by summer holidays  analysts said moves were
exaggerated 
  These are some of the most illiquid market conditions you
will see all year  with probably about 25 percent of normal
market volume  so this has to be put into that context   said
Michael Woolfolk  senior currency strategist at the Bank of New
York Mellon in New York 
 The dollar hit a one month low against the yen and was last
down 0 7 percent at 93 98 yen  The euro was unchanged at 133 82
yen  well above its one month low of 132 16 yen 
 PIMCO  BUFFETT COMMENTS WEIGH
 The ICE Futures U S  dollar index  which tracks the
performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major
currencies  was down 0 5 percent on the day 
 Comments from a portfolio manager at Pacific Investment
Management Co and from billionaire investor Warren Buffett also
weighed on the dollar  said Ronald Simpson  managing director
of global currency analysis at Action Economics in Tampa 
Florida 
 Curtis Mewbourne of PIMCO wrote on the firm s Website that
the dollar is losing its status as a reserve currency and will
likely continue to fall versus other currencies 
  We are clearly seeing a loss of status for the U S  dollar
as a store of value even in the absence of a single viable
alternative  
 Writing in The New York Times on Wednesday  Buffett warned
that the  gusher of federal money  aimed at rescuing the U S 
economy will in the long run undermine the dollar 
 Excess spending in Britain has also hit sterling hard of
late  The currency fell sharply earlier after minutes from the
Bank of England s last meeting showed some board members 
including Governor Mervyn King  wanted an even bigger expansion
in the bank s asset purchasing program 
 Sterling last traded down 0 1 percent at  1 6538  having
recovered from a  1 6372 session low  Asset purchases require
the BoE to print money  which some investors fear may lead to
an oversupply of sterling and eventual inflation 
 Among commodity currencies  the Australian dollar rose 0 4
percent to US 0 8290  while the U S  currency fell 0 6 percent
to C 1 0952 versus its Canadian counterpart

121250,342765,NYT,ANALYSIS Recovery rules out depression a year after Lehman,news,"  Recession has been deep but far short of 1930s slump
   Broad return to renewed GDP expected in third quarter
   Global trade and industry output indicators turn up
   Stock markets recoup much of post Lehman drop
 
 By Brian Love and Emily Kaiser
 PARIS WASHINGTON  Sept 9  Reuters    Fears of a new Great
Depression  all too real after Lehman Brothers collapsed a year
ago  have abated as the global economy emerges from the depths
of recession with the help of massive government intervention 
 Nothing so dire has materialised and forecasters believe the
economy is already growing once again after a recession that may
well enter the record books as the worst since the depression of
1929 33  but a very distant second 
 Cross border trade is showing renewed signs of life  regular
business surveys have been suggesting stabilisation since March 
triggering a sharp rise in stock markets  and now forecasters
such as the OECD are saying the downturn is coming to an end 
 For graphic of global stock market and global PMI index  a
leading indicator for output  click 
 
 Marc Touati  economics research chief at Global Equities  a
French financial services brokerage  says fears of a 1929 rerun 
like swine flu  will soon join SARS and the Y2K computer bug in
the annals of economic calamities that never materialised 
 There is a big catch though  The economy is recovering
thanks to trillions of dollars of central bank and government
intervention and remains dependent on that public life support 
 The next challenge will be when and how fast to remove the
fiscal and monetary stimulus that broke its fall  and doing so
without causing a relapse or stoking excessive inflation 
  Right now the recession doesn t feel so bad   said Deutsche
Bank s chief European economist  Thomas Mayer   But the day of
reckoning is still ahead  
 Finance ministers from the world s largest economies agreed
on Sept  5 that now was no time to withdraw stimulus amounting
to the equivalent of two percent of global GDP this year and 1 6
percent in 2010  according to IMF estimates  For G20 statement

 SHOCK
 Last September  the world was already struggling with a
credit freeze stemming from a collapse in the U S  housing
market  The demise of Lehman    viewed as one of those banks
that was too big to be allowed to fail    triggered a far deeper
global economic crisis and left markets temporarily paralysed 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said later that the
markets went into  anaphylactic shock  
 A year on  while experts disagree about relapse risks that
lie ahead  the worst of the downturn seems to have passed as far
as global trade and industrial activity are concerned 
 The MSCI global share price index  has been
rising since the lows of March and has recovered about two
thirds of the ground it lost since the Lehman bankruptcy filing
on Sept  15 2008 
 U S  Yale university economist Robert Schiller said in an
end August article in the New York Times that the renewal of
confidence was now becoming infectious 
 Truly global statistics are hard to come by but according to
the Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis  which aggregates
official data for some 70 countries  worldwide industrial output
rose 2 0 percent from May levels  more than in any month on
records going back to 1991 
 World trade volume rose 2 5 percent in June  the strongest
rise since July 2008  says the state funded Dutch agency 
  It s still likely to be a relatively slow recovery but even
if it is it s a vastly superior performance than back in the
1930s   Jorgen Elmeskov  chief economist at the Organisation for
Economic Co operation and Development  said 
 The OECD effectively called an end to the recession in the
industrialised world on Sept  3  saying economic growth looked
set to return in the current third quarter after second quarter
accelerations in China and broader Asia that resuscitated
cross border trade 
 The public think tank now sees renewed expansions of gross
domestic product in the United States and the euro zone in Q3 
after respectively four and five quarters of shrinkage 
 For graphic showing how consensus view of 2009 GDP outlook
has changed over past year  based on Reuters polls  click 
 
 
 NO DEPRESSION BUT REAL PAIN
 Researchers at the U S  Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis
reckon the average GDP loss caused by recessions is around two
percent for the U S  economy 
 Assuming recovery does come in the third quarter  the real
GDP loss will be almost twice as big and will top other major
downturns  notably during the oil crises of the 1970s 
 This time  U S  GDP loss totals 3 9 percent across the four
quarters of recorded shrinkage between second quarter 2008  the
cycle peak  and the end of the second quarter of this year 
according to Reuters calculations based on the latest government
data 
 For the euro area  the cumulative GDP loss amounts to around
5 0 percent over the five quarter contraction period so far  to
the end of the second quarter of this year  calculations based
on official data from EU statistics office Eurostat show 
 Big as both the U S  and European losses are  they pale
beside losses more of the order of 25 percent in the Great
Depression  and top U S  GDP losses in the 1970s too 
 
 BLOWING BUBBLES
 Even if recovery is at hand  regulators around the world are
warning that unless lessons are learned about the credit bubble
which led to bust    fuelled by banks  excesses    history may
be doomed to repeat itself 
  This recession is more like the U S  recession in the early
1990s when the Fed  U S  central bank  had to cut interest rates
and that led to very low interest rates in Asia for a long time
leading to the 1997 asset bubble burst   said Frederic Neumann 
Asia economist at HSBC in Hong Kong 
  This time  the Fed will also need to keep interest rates
low for a long time     which means interest rates in Asia will
be low and that could lead to another asset bubble  
 Deutsche Bank s Mayer says that central banks are in a bind
because the broader economy now looks to be recovering faster
than the financial sector  That generates a conflict between the
need for interest rate rises as GDP gains pace and continued
dependence of some large banks on low policy rates for survival 
  When the real economy is coming back faster than the
financial sector soon we will be talking exit  but central banks
will have a hell of a time exiting as fast as the real economy
is exiting the mess    and that s the real problem   Mayer said

121251,342766,NYT,U S  unemployment not to peak until 2011   Krugman,news,"  Global economy is stabilising at low level
   Double dip recession possible
   Global job market will continue to get worse
   More aggressive stimulus programmes needed
 By Marja Novak
 LJUBLJANA  Sept 16  Reuters    Unemployment in the United
States will peak only in early 2011 because of a slow and
painful recovery from the global economic crisis  Nobel
Prize winning economist Paul Krugman said on Wednesday 
 He said the global economy seems to be stabilising at a
level that is  unacceptably poor  and added it is possible that
the recession will be a double dip one 
   U S   unemployment will peak in early 2011     certainly
staying very high and possibly rising all next year   Krugman
told a business meeting in Slovenia  adding his forecast was
based on data from previous U S  economic crises 
 The U S  unemployment rate jumped to a 26 year high of 9 7
percent in August  according to U S  Labor Department data 
 Krugman  who received a Nobel Prize for economics in 2008 
said the acute phase of the global crisis had passed but the
recovery is likely to feel like a  continuing recession  
 He said recoveries have been weak from past crises in the
United States and other regions as job sectors continued to get
worse long after the crises have bottomed out  adding the
global job market will continue to get worse  well into 2011  
  We might have a double dip  that s a real possibility now
for the world as a whole   said Krugman  saying the effects of
stimulus programmes will start to fade early next year and
recovery will be slow due to the global nature of the crisis 
 The Princeton professor and New York Times columnist said
most economies should have more aggressive stimulus programmes
than seen so far and added rising budget deficits had saved the
world from a replay of the Great Depression of the 1930s 
  What we should be doing is a lot more support for
economies  Yes  deficits are a concern but so is a world
economy which is probably operating 7 or 8 percent below
capacity   Krugman said 
 He also said governments should help people retain jobs 
essential income  social services and health care 
 One way to overcome the crisis might be to boost global
investment in green technology and  get serious  about climate
change as that could help sustain demand  he added

121252,342767,NYT,Weak U S  dollar worries some but lessens recession,news,"  Weak U S  dollar sparks debate over American image
   Dollar fuels political gripes about Obama
   Softens impact of U S  recession  helps tourism  exports
 By Michelle Nichols
 NEW YORK  Oct 15  Reuters    A weak U S  dollar is drawing
tourists to the United States and complaints from Sarah Palin
and other conservatives who say it s hurting the country s
image as a world power 
  One of the psychologically most interesting things is we
think it gives people license to actually go over the edge to
make the decision to come to New York   said George Fertitta 
head of New York City s marketing and tourism organization 
 NYC   Company expects the number of international and
domestic tourists to the city to be down about 5 percent in
2009 compared to last year  but the dollar was helping cushion
the effects of the recession  said Fertitta 
   Retailers are seeing a resurgence of international
visitors spending more   he said 
 Last month U S  retailers posted their first monthly sales
increase in more than a year  inching up 0 6 percent compared
with expectations for a 1 1 percent decline 
  Maybe we have spent a little more money  than we would
have    said German tourist Elizabeth Rammler  51   It was nice
for us but it didn t affect our decision to come here  We would
have come anyway  
 As the U S  dollar index  which measures it against a
basket of currencies  hit a 14 month low at one point on
Thursday  other Americans said they were worried 
 Honey Marques  an organizer with the conservative Tea Party
Patriots in Scottsdale  Arizona  said a weak dollar would dent
American self esteem 
  It s going to cause a serious depression in our country  
she warned   The economy is going to collapse and then we re
screwed  that s a big deal  
 PALIN WEIGHS IN
 For U S  farmers  a weak dollar can boost export sales of
wheat  corn  beans or other commodities 
 U S  Wheat Associates head Alan Tracy said his
organization  which markets U S  wheat to buyers around the
world  has been playing up the opportunity   We ve been using
it as a kind of marketing tool   said Tracy 
 U S  wheat export sales reached a marketing year high for
the week ending Oct  8  with buyers ordering 767 300 tonnes  up
43 percent from the previous week 
 But Palin  last year s Republican vice presidential
nominee  criticized the dollar on her Facebook page while
commenting on reports that Gulf Arab states were in talks with
France  Russia  China and Japan to replace the dollar with a
basket of currencies to price oil 
 Saudi Arabia  Russia and France denied the reports  but the
former Alaska governor said that  even the possibility of such
a talk weakens the dollar and renews fears about its continued
viability as an international reserve currency  
 Several leading Republicans have echoed her criticism  and
media mogul Rupert Murdoch s Wall Street Journal says the world
is wondering if America has cast the dollar adrift 
  Washington may not care to notice  but the sell off in the
dollar is a daily global vote on U S  economic policy  It is
not a vote of confidence   said a recent newspaper editorial 
  FEAR IS SUBSIDING 
 But Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman wrote this
week in his New York Times column that a weak dollar is
actually good 
  For one thing  it s mainly the result of rising
confidence  the dollar rose at the height of the financial
crisis as panicked investors sought safe haven in America  and
it s falling again now that the fear is subsiding   he said 
  And a lower dollar is good for U S  exporters  helping us
make the transition away from huge trade deficits to a more
sustainable international position   he added 
 Yet for some Americans the weak dollar just seems like more
economic doom and gloom 
  It sucks   said Delores Marshburn  an office manager who
lives in Manhattan   I don t have any money as it is and then
to have a weak dollar    I am never going to have any money  No
matter what I do I am never going to have any  
 One New Yorker admitted he didn t know what to make of the
situation 
  I m concerned about it  but I don t know exactly what to
be concerned about   said Kevin Doyle  24  of Brooklyn  wearing
a Broadway show sandwich board and handing out discount ticket
flyers   I m worried about the economy but the weakness of the
dollar isn t something on my mind everyday

121255,342770,NYT,Inflation  Robbing You Since The 10th Century,opinion,At the moment the gold price is low  much of the mainstream media blame it on the loss of the fear trade as the US economy shows signs of life once again and the much feared inflation has never appeared  Of course  inflation is lurking somewhere  in the US the M2 money supply has expanded by 7  year on year whilst GDP on average has increased by 1 5 2 0   Just look at asset prices and the equity markets  there s your inflation Inflation is not a new phenomenon  as the author points out below  Frequently when asked to call upon an example of when gold was used as money I recall an example of inflation or hyperinflation and there I have a story  Steinhart s example of France s Assignats experiment is a prime example  as he says  of the lengths governments will go to defend a paper currency   as far as the death sentence  This same behaviour is echoed in the treatment of the Liberty Dollar founder  Bernard von Nothaus who currently faces up to 20 years in prison  longer than many criminals who have committed physical acts against other human beings face As von Nothaus said in an interview to the New York Times   when money goes bad  people go crazy  this is best applied to governments  behaviour at the moment Watching from afar as inflation in Argentina grows worse   officially 11   realistically around 25    it s tempting to think of the scourge of fiat money as a modern phenomenon  If only FDR hadn t confiscated US citizens  gold to usher in the beginning of the current era of paper money  we could be living in a precious metals paradise  as our ancestors before us did  That narrative  of course  is utterly false  Humans have been screwing up money for centuries  beginning with China s printing of jiaozi in the 10th century  History is littered with episodes of hyperinflation  but my favorite is that of revolutionary France as told by Andrew Dickson White in   It contains the most vivid description I ve seen of how inflation transforms into hyperinflation  and how far governments will go to maintain their power in the face of a dying currency  France s hyperinflation began as all hyperinflations do  the state printed too many assignats pictured below   and they rapidly lost their purchasing power  French citizens sought alternative stores of value and mediums of exchange  as any intelligent person would  The French government  correctly perceiving this as a threat to its financial hegemony  reacted violently  I ll let three short passages from the book explain  Note in particular the rapid progression  all emphasis mine   August 1793   Couthon had proposed and carried a law punishing any person who should sell assignats at less than their nominal value with imprisonment for twenty years in chains  and later carrieda law making investments in foreign countries by Frenchmen punishable with death   September 1793   The Convention decreed that any person selling gold or silver coin  or making any difference in any transaction between paper and specie  should be imprisoned in irons for six years    that anyone who refused to accept a payment in assignats  or accepted assignats at a discount  should pay a fine of three thousand francs   Later  the penalty for such offences was made death  with the confiscation of the criminal s property  and a reward was offered to any person informing the authorities regarding any such criminal transaction   May 1794   The Convention decreed that the death penalty should be inflicted on any person convicted of having asked  before a bargain was concluded  in what money payment was to be made   Yikes  Fiat currency isn t just a contemporary problem  that s for sure  Are Argentines headed for the guillotines  too  Probably not  The Argentinian government has made a virtual decennial ritual out of inflating its currency out of existence  As a result  Argentines have earned their black belts in navigating through hyperinflations  That  combined with the Argentine government s lack of resources to enforce its edicts  ensures that most Argentines won t suffer the gruesome fate that many poor 18th century Frenchmen did  Importantly  though hyperinflations   or even just double digit inflations   decimate much of the wealth of a populace  they also create massive distortions  Or  as we like to call them at Casey Research  opportunities ,2013-06-14,Jan Skoyles,https://www.investing.com/analysis/inflation:-robbing-you-since-the-10th-century-171309,171309
121256,342771,NYT,The Market  A Bubble That Is About To Burst ,opinion,What do 1929  2000 and 2007 all have in common  Those were all years in which we saw a dramatic spike in margin debt  In all three instances  investors became highly leveraged in order to  take advantage  of a soaring stock market  But of course we all know what happened each time  The spike in margin debt was rapidly followed by a horrifying stock market crash  Well guess what  It is happening again  In April  the last month we have a number for   margin debt rose to an all time high of   The previous high was 381 billion dollars which occurred back in July 2007  Margin debt is about 29 percent higher than it was a year ago  and the S P 500 has risen by more than 20 percent since last fall  The stock market just continues to rise even though the underlying economic fundamentals continue to get worse  So should we be alarmed  Is the stock market bubble going to burst at some point  Well  if history is any indication we are in big trouble  In the past  whenever margin debt has gone over 2 25  of GDP the stock market has crashed  That certainly does not mean that the market is going to crash this week  but it is a major red flag  The funny thing is that the fact that investors are so highly leveraged is being seen as a positive thing by many in the financial world  Some believe that a high level of margin debt is a sign that  investor confidence  is high and that the rally will continue  The following is from a recent article in the     The rising level of debt is seen as a measure of investor confidence  as investors are more willing to take out debt against investments when shares are rising and they have more value in their portfolios to borrow against  The latest rise has been fueled by low interest rates and a 15  year to date stock market rally  Others  however  consider the spike in margin debt to be a very ominous sign  Margin debt has now risen to about 2 4 percent of GDP  and as the  recently pointed out  whenever we have gotten this high before a market crash has always followed    The first time in recent decades that total margin debt exceeded 2 25 percent of G D P  came at the end of 1999  amid the technology stock bubble  Margin debt fell after that bubble burst  but began to rise again during the housing boom   when anecdotal evidence said some investors were using their investments to secure loans that went for down payments on homes  That boom in margin loans also ended badly  Posted below is a chart of the performance of the S P 500 over the last several decades  After looking at this chart  compare it to the margin debt charts that the New York Times recently published that you can find   There is a very strong correlation between these charts  You can find some more charts that directly compare the level of margin debt and the performance of the S P 500 right here  Every time margin debt has soared to a dramatic new high in the past  a stock market crash and a recession have always followed  Will we escape a similar fate this time  What makes all of this even more alarming is the fact that a number of things that we have not seen happen in the U S  economy since 2009 are starting to happen again  For much more on this  please see my previous article entitled  12 Clear Signals That The U S  Economy Is About To Really Slow Down   At some point the stock market will catch up with the economy  When that happens  it will probably happen very rapidly and a lot of people will lose a lot of money  And there are certainly a lot of prominent voices out there that are warning about what is coming  For example  the following is what renowned investor Alan M  Newman had to say about the current state of the market earlier this year     If anything has changed yet in 2013  we certainly do not see it  Despite the early post fiscal cliff rally  this is the same beast we rode to the 2007 highs for the Dow Industrials  The U S  stock market is over leveraged  overpriced and has been commandeered by mechanical forces to such an extent that all holding periods are now affected by more risk than at any time in history   Unfortunately  most Americans never get to hear such voices  Instead  most Americans rely on the mainstream media to do much of their thinking for them  And right now the mainstream media is insisting that we are not in a stock market bubble    Forbes     ABC News     Businessweek     Yahoo     MarketWatch     So what do you think  Do you believe that we are in a stock market bubble that is about to burst  or do you believe that everything is going to be just fine  Please feel free to express your opinion by posting a comment below   ,2013-06-18,Michael T.

121258,342773,NYT,What Bothers Me About NSA Data Collection  A Reply To Thomas Friedman,opinion,Warning  This post has little to do with economics  unless you happen to think that an open society with free and private communication is essential to our continued prosperity A series of Congressional hearings this week is drawing renewed attention to the issue of the National Security Agency s program to collect data on telephone and internet activities of hundreds of millions of Americans  While much of the media has focused on whether Edward Snowden is  personally  a hero or a villain  some commentators have plunged into the substantive debate that he hoped to touch off  Is the program he has blown the whistle on really something we want our government to be doing One of the most articulate commentators to come to the defense of the NSA is Thomas Friedman  His recent column in the New York Times epitomizes what bothers me most about this whole affair the readiness of people who claim to be defenders of an open society to make excuses for people and policies that undermine it Friedman argues that although what the NSA is doing is distasteful  we should put up with it because it might stop some future terrorist attack  which in turn  would prompt even more intrusive violations of our freedoms  He explains that he fears government abuse of privacy less than he fears another 9 11 not because I don t care about civil liberties  but because what I cherish most about America is our open society  and I believe that if there is one more 9 11 or worse  an attack involving nuclear material it could lead to the end of the open society as we know it  If there were another 9 11  I fear that 99 percent of Americans would tell their members of Congress   Do whatever you need to do to  privacy be damned  just make sure this does not happen again   That is what I fear most That is why I ll reluctantly  very reluctantly  trade off the government using data mining to look for suspicious patterns in phone numbers called and e mail addresses and then have to go to a judge to get a warrant to actually look at the content under guidelines set by Congress to prevent a day where  out of fear  we give government a license to look at anyone  any e mail  any phone call  anywhere  anytime Here are three things that trouble me about this line of argument 1  It looks like the NSA can already do pretty much whatever it wants My first concern is that we appear alreadyto have given the security establishment a license to look at anything they want  Snowden s revelations give us a peek at this broad program of surveillance  but we don t know a lot of the details  nor are we likely to find out any time soon  Here is what we do know The NSA routinely collects  outside of the envelope  data about most if not all of our electronic communications  landline  cell  and internet They comb through this data with computer models that look for patterns of suspicious activity When they find something that looks suspicious  they make a secret request to a secret judge who decides in secret whether to allow the NSA to  open the envelope  and read or listen to the content of the communication The judges hear only the government s side of the case and almost never say no How is that not  giving the government a license to look at anyone  any e mail  any phone call  anywhere  anytime  The only evidence we have to the contrary is the word of our intelligence professionals  who keep telling us that they only look inside the envelopes of the bad guys  and that doing so has allowed them to foil many vaguely specified plots  The trouble is  our intelligence professionals are inherently not credible  That is because they see themselves as having a duty to lie to us when they think we are getting too close to the truth Yes  not just a duty to keep secrets  but a duty to lie  That is more than just a conjecture  Exhibit A is the lie that James Clapper  director of national intelligence  told Congress in March this year  Here is a link to the video clip  in case you haven t watched it yet  In the clip  Congressman Ron Wyden asks Clapper to answer  yes  or  no  as to whether the NSA collects any kind of data at all on millions of Americans  Clapper answers  No  and then adds  disingenuously   Not wittingly  What is revealing is not so much the answer  which Snowden s revelations have shown to be false  and which Congressman Wyden probably knew to be false from previous closed hearings  but Clapper s defense of the answer  Speaking to NBC s Andrea Mitchell  he explained  I was asked a  when are you going to stop beating your wife  kind of question  which is  meaning not answerable necessarily  by a simple yes or no  So I responded in what I thought was the most truthful or least untruthful manner  by saying   No   In fact  Wyden did not ask the trick question   Have you stopped beating your wife   He asked the simpler question   Do you beat your wife   It is hard to think of a more untruthful answer than  No   What is interesting is that Clapper did not choose the less untruthful answer   I cannot answer that question in open session   The inference I draw from his untruthful  No  is that he understands his duty not to reveal secrets to include an obligation to tell outright lies whenever a simple  No comment  might be too revealing In short  it is my view that giving our intelligence agencies the authority to do a limited amount of data collection and at the same time giving them permission to lie about whether they are exceeding the limit is functionally the same as giving them unlimited authority in the first place  Interpreting what any intelligence professional says on the subject  whether to a journalist or under oath to a Congressional committee  is like trying to figure out one of those trick cards that read  on one side   The statement on the other side of this card is true   and on the other   The statement on the other side of this card is false 2  We know the NSA s methods are fallibleWe are supposed to be reassured to know that the NSA initially gathers only information  outside the envelope  and uses that information only as input to computer models than look for  patterns   The trouble is  pattern finding models are prone to errors  How do we know  We know because Wall Street hires a lot of people to do the same thing  Wall Street firms can pay higher salaries than the NSA  so they presumably get first pick of the best pattern searchers  Still  they make mistakes  sometimes big ones  as happened in the infamous London Whale episode  In the best case  their models are right more often than they are wrong right often enough to make money for JPMorgan Chase and right enough for the NSA to catch some bad guys Still  any statistical models  no matter how sophisticated  have to be calibrated in a way that turns up a lot of false positives  If they are not  they will miss too many true positives  On Wall Street  false positives result in bad trades  In the intelligence world  false positives result in God knows what At best  the subject of an intelligence false positive might be hassled at airport security  At worst  if the false positive is unlucky enough to live in Waziristan or Yemen  he may find himself in the crosshairs of a drone  The CIA does not always know the specific identity of its targets  As reported in the Los Angeles Times and elsewhere  the agency also conducts so called  pattern of life  strikes  which means killing people who it thinks  on the basis of computer models  are probably dangerous terrorists  Those programs  too  are of necessity calibrated to tolerate some nonzero level of false positives Let s suppose you are a false positive and you are lucky enough only to end up on a no fly list instead of in the crosshairs of a drone  At that point  you run up against another aspect of fallibility that of the process through which you can appeal to get off the list  Here is how the ACLU describes its attempts to get help one group of no fly list victims Our brief  in the case Latif v  Holder  highlighted the utter irrationality of the government s No Fly List procedures  The plaintiffs in Latif all flew for years without any problems  But more than two years ago  they were suddenly branded as suspected terrorists based on secret evidence  publicly denied boarding on flights  and told by U S  and airline officials that they were banned from flying perhaps forever  Each of them asked the government to remove them from the No Fly List through the only  redress  mechanism available the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program  But the government has refused to provide any explanation or basis for their inclusion in the list  Our clients have been stuck in limbo ever since 3  We know the NSA s people are fallibleBeyond the fallibility of the NSA s computers  we have to worry about the fallibility of their people  One of the most astonishing things about the reaction to Snowden s revelations is the parade of intelligence officials who have told us that he could not  or should not  have had access to the very information that he has leaked  If one low level contract employee could bypass the NSA s internal firewalls  we have to assume that others can as well  Snowden took his information to the Guardian and the Washington Post  Who knows to whom others might be leaking information  To foreign governments or terrorists  Obviously  but there are other possibilities that are not much less worrisome Hedge fund managers have billions to spend in search of patterns of behavior that could be the basis for profitable trades  How do we know they are not planting Snowden like IT people at the NSA to snoop for such patterns in the Prism database  What would that say about the integrity of our markets  let alone of our government On the same page of the New York Times where Friedman s column appeared    Professor of Law at the U C  Berkeley Law School  noted that the NSA database could be very handy for uncovering patterns of behavior that reveal crimes other than terrorism  Its use for such purposes is not yet authorized  but Rule worries that once the tools are in place  it will be hard to resist calls to use them for such worthy purposes as targeting child abusers  drug smugglers  and tax evaders  True  those uses are not yet authorized  but how can we be sure that there are no unauthorized uses  Suppose Jane at the IRS thinks she can get a promotion by cracking a big tax evasion case  What keeps her from getting help from her boyfriend at the NSA  The same firewalls that failed to stop Snowden NSA people are only human  Some of them presumably have personal grudges  What stops a vindictive employee from  say  inserting false information into the database that will put a former spouse or lover on the no fly list  or derail their application for a security clearance Of course  most federal intelligence employees are straight shooters  but a frighteningly large number of people work in intelligence  The Snowden episode shows that some of them  at least  are willing to step out of line  and that internal controls are less than perfect  In fact  Snowden is actually a special case  in that the nature of his infraction of the rules whistleblowing necessarily means the public finds out about him  We are much less likely to learn about those if there are any who are passing insider information to hedge funds  or slipping an unauthorized tip to friends in another branch of law enforcement  or working out grudges against former lovers  Even if they are caught  it is likely that their cases will be hushed up as administrative matters  not tried in open court The bottom lineThomas Friedman fears rocking the boat  lest doing so lead to  the end of the open society as we know it   Personally  though  I am not satisfied with the degree of openness of the society we now know the society of secret lists  secret courts  and officials who feel free no  who feel duty bound to lie to us and our elected officials about what they are up to  But it s all perfectly legal   you say  Well  as Sen  Rand Paul put it the other day   Just because Congress approved it doesn t make it right    That s the same Congress  by the way  in which a majority thinks it would be an outrage against our constitutional rights to maintain a federal register of firearms data  Go figure  The whole NSA program  including its fa ade of legality  is uncomfortably reminiscent of SORM  an internal eavesdropping system first developed by the KGB in the 1980s and extended in Putin s Russia to encompass cell phones  internet  and every other known form of communication  Interestingly  SORM  like its American counterpart  requires the security services to get a court order before installing equipment to capture data  However  Andrei Soldatov  an investigative journalist and author of several books on Russian security services  has told the Moscow News that the system of court supervision is a sham   It s all regulated by internal procedure  by the FSB  essentially   he said   Supposedly  there s some sort of prosecutor control  but nobody s heard of it  being used   Nobody is required to show these warrants  so  we  never know for sure whether  the agencies  actually have one    Bracketed material is from the Moscow News original  I don t deny that there are real terrorists out there who would be happy to blow me up in the name of whatever warped cause they represent  On balance  though  I welcome the Snowdens who are willing to risk rocking the good ship Open Society a little before it sinks with all of us on board  I d rather take the risk of a little rocking than cower in the hold  hoping that if we accept things as they are  they won t get any worse ,2013-06-19,Ed

121259,342774,NYT,John Williams  Ben Bernanke s Real Message For Gold Investors,opinion,Don t fall for propaganda from the Federal Reserve about tapering quantitative easing  says ShadowStats editor John Williams in this interview with The Gold Report  His corrected economic indicators show the U S  is nowhere near a recovery and the Fed will have to increase rather than decrease bond buying to prop up the banks and push off inevitable dollar debasement  That could be very bad for savers  but good for gold   The Gold Report  On Wednesday  the Federal Reserve hinted that it might begin tapering quantitative easing by the end of the year based on signs of an improving economy  Gold immediately dropped from  1 347 an ounce   1 347 oz  to  1 277 oz  a 7  decline and the lowest price in more than two years  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ were also off more than 2   You called this  jawboning  and said that due to stresses in the banking system the Fed would be obliged to continue bond buying  Why would the central bank threaten to cut off the flow if it didn t plan to do it   John Williams  All the hype over the Fed s so called tapering is absolute nonsense  Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed s pulling back of quantitative easing was contingent on the economy recovering in line with the Fed s relatively rosy projections  He also indicated  however  that if the economy worsened  he would expand quantitative easing  When you consider that the official Fed projections are grossly optimistic  the conclusion is that we will have more  not less  bond buying from the government   The jawboning was a multifaceted attempt to placate the Fed s critics  while soothing the stock and bond market jitters at the same time  The comments  however  hammered equities and bonds  as well as gold  The negative impact on gold likely would have been viewed as a positive result by the Fed   The banking system nearly collapsed in 2008  The federal government and Federal Reserve took extraordinary measures to keep the financial system from imploding  Those actions prevented an immediate systemic collapse  but they did very little to resolve the underlying problems  I contend that we re still in recession  with the economy deepening into a renewed downturn  At the same time  the banking system solvency problems continue  Little has changed in the last five years   The purported nature of the quantitative easing is a fraud on the public  While Bernanke describes the extraordinary accommodation in terms of trying to stimulate the economy  lowering the unemployment rate and attaining sustainable economic growth in the context of mild inflation  those factors are secondary concerns for the Fed  The U S  central bank s primary function always has been to assure banking system solvency and liquidity  All the easing efforts have been aimed at the banking system  The flood of liquidity spiked the monetary base  but it has not flowed through to the money supply and ordinary people   Simply put  the Fed is propping up the banking system  Bernanke is using the cover of a weak economy to do that because the concept is not politically popular  but it s what the Fed has to do because the underlying system is just as broken today as it was in 2008   TGR  Let s go back to your statement that the economy is doing worse rather than better  Didn t positive housing start statistics and consumer confidence numbers just come out  How do you know if the economy is getting better or worse   JW  Housing starts are still down 60  from their peak  Based on the first two months of the second quarter  housing starts are on track for a quarter to quarter contraction  a rather substantial one  Industrial production also is on track for a quarterly contraction  These indicators easily could foreshadow a contraction in the current quarter s gross domestic product  GDP   The underlying economic issues remain  as in 2008  with structural constraints on consumer liquidity and banking system stability  With those ongoing  fundamental weaknesses  there has been no basis whatsoever for the purported economic activity since 2009  or for a recovery pending in the near term   The consumer directly drives more than 70  of GDP activity  Indirectly  the consumer impacts the balance of the economy  To have sustainable growth in consumption  there needs to be sustainable growth in liquidity  reflected in income and  ideally  supported by credit  Instead  household income is shrinking and traditional consumer credit is heavily constrained   Headed by two former senior Census Bureau officials  SentierResearch com publishes monthly estimates of median household income adjusted for the government s headline CPI inflation number  Those numbers show that household income plunged toward the end of the official economic downturn  Officially  the recession went from the end of 2007 to the middle of 2009  but the reality is that household income kept plunging after the middle of 2009  It hasn t recovered  Right now  it s flat and bottom bouncing at the low level of activity for the cycle  If you look at those numbers on an annual basis  again adjusted for headline CPI inflation  median household income in 2011  latest available  is lower than it was in the late 1960s and early 1970s  The consumer here is in severe trouble  You can t have inflation adjusted or real growth in consumption without real growth in income  Income drives consumption  That s basic   You can buy a little extra consumption through debt expansion  The consumer in the precrisis era tended to maintain his or her standard of living by borrowing from the future  Recognizing a developing liquidity squeeze  then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan encouraged the consumer to take on as much debt as possible  In the decade prior to the 2008 panic  the bulk of economic growth was fueled by debt growth  not income growth  For the consumer  the credit crisis dried up everything except federally issued student loans  and those don t buy washing machines and houses   If you don t have income growth or credit availability  that takes a toll on consumer confidence  Usually consumer sentiment follows the tone of the popular press on the economy  and monthly movement in the different consumer measures can be quite volatile  Despite the happy hype of recent headline monthly gains in consumer confidence  the news doesn t have much relevance to our being out of economic trouble  Consumer confidence plunged starting in 2006 and we ve been bottom bouncing ever since  Current levels are consistent with numbers seen during the depths of the worst recessions in the post World War II era  We re still at recession levels in consumer confidence  those measures have not shown the full recovery that has been reported in the GDP   Official GDP reporting shows that the economy turned down right after the end of 2007  plunged through 2008 into the middle of 2009  and then started turning higher and has continued higher ever since  If you believe the GDP numbers  the economy fully recovered as of the fourth quarter of 2011  regaining its prerecession highs  and has continued to expand ever since  No other economic series confirms that pattern   The big issue in the reporting of the GDP is with the inflation adjustment process  The government in the last several decades has changed its inflation estimation methodologies to lower the reported rate of inflation  In the case of the CPI adjustments  it s has been trying to cut budget deficits by using a lower inflation rate to calculate cost of living adjustments for Social Security  A number of the changes to CPI reporting also affected estimates of the GDP s implicit price deflator  the inflation measure used to remove the effects of inflation from the GDP calculations   If you correct for the understatement of GDP inflation  the accompanying overstatement of economic growth reverses  showing that the GDP started to turn down in 2006  plunged into 2009 and has been bottom bouncing along with other indicators  including housing starts  median household income and consumer confidence measures  and along with reporting of other series corrected for inflation overstatement  particularly industrial production and real retail sales  Other real world business indicators  including corporate sales of consumer products  are showing the same pattern of plunge and bottom bouncing  as opposed to plunge and recovery  The reality is that the economy is weak and it s going to get weaker   We haven t seen a recovery and that is why the Fed won t end quantitative easing  Any talk of tapering is pure propaganda to placate global markets on the U S  dollar  trying to hit gold and maybe get a sense of how the markets would respond to an actual withdrawing of quantitative easing   TGR  We saw the response loud and clear on Thursday   JW  Yes  the stock market is like a drug addict and Bernanke s been the drug dealer  pushing direct liquidity injections   TGR  The market came back a little bit on Friday  Do you think the plunge was just a temporary knee jerk reaction and things will be back to their upward trajectory in no time   JW  The stock market is irrational  It s heavily rigged with big players manipulating it  and with the President s Working Group on Financial Markets taking actions to prevent  disorderly  conditions in the equity market  as well as other markets  I would tend to avoid the stock market  Gold took a big hit  too  but the underlying fundamentals remain extraordinarily strong for gold  This is not a situation where everything s right again with the world and the Fed is going to pull back from debasing the dollar  If anything  the Fed is going to have to move further into dollar debasement  That is what Bernanke was saying  If the economy doesn t recover we ve got to expand the easing  He is propping up the banking system under the cover of propping up the economy  Nothing that he is doing is helping the economy   TGR  You called the dollar  a proximal hyperinflation trigger  and said that  gold is the primary and long range hedge against the upcoming debasement of the dollar irrespective of any near term price gyrations   Yet the dollar seems to be stronger than ever  What would trigger the dollar selling panic that you have predicted by the end of the year   JW  A visibly weaker economy could have a devastating impact on the dollar  It would force Bernanke to expand rather than contract quantitative easing  That would result in heavy selling pressure against the dollar and a spike gold prices   At present  there are four major factors out of whack between market perceptions and the fundamental  underlying reality  These misperceptions will tend to shift toward reality  and a confluence of these factors would be devastating to the U S  currency   At the top of the list  at the moment  is Fed policy  which we ve been discussing  My contention is that the Fed is locked into quantitative easing  It can t escape it   A close second are U S  fiscal conditions and long range sovereign insolvency risks  Fiscal issues should come to a head after Labor Day  when the government runs out of room with all its current bookkeeping finagling so as not to exceed the debt ceiling  Prospects for a meaningful resolution of the fiscal problems remain nil  In the summer of 2011  the market reaction to the government s fiscal inaction was clear  Heavy dollar selling and gold buying came out of that   The third factor  again  is the economy being a great deal weaker than consensus expectations  based on the indicators I outlined  As weakening business conditions become more evident in the popular economic releases  that should be a large negative for the dollar  Aside from increasing speculation as to increased Fed easing  it also would have a negative impact on the federal budget forecasts going forward  Economic growth of 4  projected for 2014 is not going to happen  The deficit will explode  and  again  that is very bad for the dollar   Finally  developing scandals in Washington have the potential to hit the dollar hard  The press has started raising questions about a number of cover ups  I was involved in the currency markets during the Watergate era  I can tell you that on a day to day basis  as the scandal began to unfold  whenever the news was bad for President Nixon  the dollar took a hit  Anything that questions the stability of the government is a big negative for the dollar   All of these factors work in conjunction with each other  That is why I am predicting a massive decline in the dollar at some point this year  which will spike inflation  certainly spike gold prices and will lead us into the very high inflation environment that will provide the basis for actual hyperinflation in 2014  It s not just current government actions  It s series of circumstances that have evolved over decades into a developing crescendo of dollar debasement or inflation   TGR  You recently wrote that we re approaching the endgame based on volatility in equities  currencies and monetary precious metals of gold and silver  What will that endgame look like  And how will we know if we are in it   JW  Primarily I would look at the U S  dollar as an indicator  when very heavy  consistent  massive selling of the U S  dollar and dollar denominated assets begins  As the selling becomes heavier  pressure to remove the dollar from its current world currency reserve status should become unstoppable  I would take that as a sign that we are moving into the position that will set the stage for the hyperinflation   TGR  Whatever happens in the economy  it sounds as if Bernanke s days will be numbered  What could that mean for economic policy and Federal Reserve actions  And what advice do you have for whoever takes his place   JW  I wouldn t want to be the person who takes his place  Bernanke is a very smart and generally well intentioned individual who s in a situation that was not of his creation  but one that he has been trying  with great difficulty  to extricate the Fed from  The Fed doesn t have any real options here  The best it can do is continue to buy time   There s nothing the Fed can do that will stimulate economic activity  except possibly to raise interest rates  Low interest rates are actually negative for economic activity at this point  They constrain loan growth  With higher interest rates  banks have the ability to make more of a profit margin on their lending  The greater the profit margin  the greater the ability to lend to perhaps less qualified borrowers  to take a little more credit risk  but with that also comes loan growth  That helps fuel economic activity  It might even cause the money supply to pick up  The biggest constraint on bank lending  though  remains the still troubled nature of the banking industry   Separately  low interest rates devastate the finances of those trying to live on a fixed income  It used to be you could go invest your money in a CD and make a positive return  after inflation  and your money was safe  at least within the insured limits of the banking system  That s not the case anymore  Domestically  there is no safe investment where you can beat the rate of inflation  Government policies are driving savers into riskier investments  such as the highly unstable stock market   TGR  So you think by default we will have a continuation of the current policies   JW  Yes  effectively  The Federal Reserve board has run along with the program  moving in accord with the government to save the financial system  Back in 2008  it could have let the banking system fail  Understandably  though  the Fed and the federal government decided to save the system at all costs  That meant spending  creating  lending and guaranteeing whatever money was needed  Whatever had to be done they did  They prevented the system from collapsing  pushing the problems down the road  Now all those problems again are coming to a head  With many of the same risks in the system today  as in 2008  there is potential for another panic  The Fed has to keep easing here to maintain liquidity in the banking system  The U S  central bank does not have a choice in the matter   TGR  It sounds as if there isn t a lot that Bernanke s replacement could do  Would your only advice be don t hold a lot of press conferences   JW  That would be a big plus  If there s bad news  basically the central banker has to lie  If he or she says   The banks are going to collapse   or  The economy is going to hell   that will move the process along in a self fulfilling negative cycle  Accordingly  central bankers often attempt to put false a positive spin on things  Having a Fed chairman hold press conferences is actually something relatively new   Jawboning  was one tool Bernanke thought he could use to influence the economy and market behavior  That s deliberate policy  but it has problems  as we saw on Wednesday  The tradition for Fed chairmen has been to keep remarks to the minimum  whenever possible   TGR  Sounds like some very good advice  Thank you for your time   JW  Thank you   Walter J   John  Williams has been a private

121260,342775,NYT,The Golden Cycle ,opinion,The New York Times had the definitive take on the vicious sell off in gold  To summarize one of their articles   Two years ago gold bugs ran wild as the price of gold rose nearly six times  But since cresting two years ago it has steadily declined  almost by half  putting the gold bugs in flight  The most recent advisory from a leading Wall Street firm suggests that the price will continue to drift downward  and may ultimately settle 40  below current levels    The rout says a lot about consumer confidence in the worldwide recovery  The sharply reduced rates of inflation combined with resurgence of other  more economically productive investments  such as stocks  real estate  and bank savings have combined to eliminate gold s allure    Although the American economy has reduced its rapid rate of recovery  it is still on a firm expansionary course  The fear that dominated two years ago has largely vanished  replaced by a recovery that has turned the gold speculators  dreams into a nightmare    This analysis provides a good representation of the current conventional wisdom  The only twist here is that the article from which this summary is derived appeared in the August 29  1976 edition of The New York Times  At that time gold was preparing to embark on an historic rally that would push it up more than 700  a little over three years later  Is it possible that the history is about to repeat itself   At the time The Times article was written gold had fallen to  103 per ounce  a decline of nearly 50  from the roughly  200 it had sold for in the closing days of 1974  The  200 price had capped a furious three year rally that began in August of 1971 when President Nixon  temporarily  closed the gold window and allowed gold to float freely  Prior to that decision gold had been fixed at  35 per ounce for nearly two generations  That initial three year 450  rally had validated the forecasts of the  gold bugs  who had predicted a rapid rise in gold prices should the dollar s link to gold be severed  The accuracy of these formerly marginalized analysts proved to be a bitter pill for the mainstream voices in Washington and Wall Street who  for reasons of power  politics and profit  were anxious to confine the  barbarous relic  to the dustbin of history  Incredulous as it may seem now  with gold still priced at  35 per ounce  official forecasts of both the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve were that demonetizing gold would undermine its value  and that its price would actually fall as a result   Of course government experts could not have been more wrong  Once uncoupled from the dollar  gold s initial ascent in the early 1970 s was fueled by the highest inflation in generations and the deteriorating health of the U S  economy that had been ravaged by the  guns and butter  policies of the 1960 s  But the American economy stabilized during the mid years of the 1970 s and both inflation and unemployment fell  When gold reversed course in 1975 the voices of traditional power elite could not contain their glee  When the gold price approached  100 per ounce  a nearly 50  decline  the obituaries came fast and furious  Everyone assumed that the gold mania would never return   Although the writer of The Times piece did not yet know it  the bottom for gold had been established four days before his article was published  Few realized at the time that the real economic pain of the 1970 s had  to paraphrase The Carpenters 1970 s hit   Only Just Begun   When inflation and recession came back with a vengeance in the late 1970 s  gold took off  to quote another 1970 s gem   like a skyrocket in flight  By January 1980  gold topped out at  850 an ounce  The second leg of the rally proved to be bigger than the first   The parallel between the 1970s and the current period are even more striking when you look closely at the numbers  For example  from 1971 to 1974 gold prices rose by 458  from  35 to  195 25  which was then followed by a two year correction of nearly 50   This reduced total gains to just under 200   The current bull market that began back in 2000 took a bit longer to evolve  but the percentage gains are very similar   We should allow for a more compressed time frame in the 1970s because of the sudden untethering of gold after decades of restraint   From its 1999 low to its 2011 peak  gold rose by about 650  from  253 to  1895 per ounce  followed by a two year correction of approximately 37   down to around  1190 per ounce  The pullback has reduced the total rally to about 370   The mainstream is saying now  as they did then  that the pullback has invalidated fears that rising U  S  budget deficits  overly accommodative monetary policy  and a weakening economy will combine to bring down the dollar and ignite inflation  But 1976 was not the end of the game  In all likelihood  2013 will not be either   The biggest difference between then and now is that until 1975 ordinary Americans were barred by law from buying and owning gold  About the only route available to participate in the earlier stage of the precious metal rally was by hording silver dimes  quarters and half dollars minted prior to 1965  My father indulged in this process himself by sifting through his change  the cash registers of any merchant who would allow him  exchanging new non silver coins and bills for silver   and by sifting out silver coins from rolls he bought from banks  It was a time consuming process  and most of his friends and family members thought he was crazy  But the  10 000 face value worth of those coins he collected had a melt value of over  230 000 when silver hit its peak   By the mid 1970 s none of the problems that initially led to the recession in the early years of the decade had been solved  Contrary to the claims of the  experts  things got much worse in the years ahead  It took the much deeper recession of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s  which at the time was the worst economic down turn since the great Depression  to finally purge the economy of all the excesses  The lower marginal tax rates and cuts in regulation implemented by President Reagan and tight money under Volcker helped get the economy back on track and create investment opportunities that drew money away from gold  As a result gold fell hard during the early 1980 s  But even after the declines  gold maintained levels for the next 20 years that were three to four times as high as the 1976 lows   Although the economy improved in the 1980 s  the cure was not complete  Government spending  budget and trade deficits continued to take a heavy toll  The U S  was transformed from the world s largest creditor to its largest debtor  When the time came to face the music in 2001  the Fed kept the party going by opening the monetary spigots  Then when decades of monetary excess finally came to a head in 2008  the Fed open up its monetary spigots even wider  flooding the economy with even more cheap money   Unfortunately just like 1976  a true economic recovery is not just around the corner  More likely we are in the eye of an economic storm that will blow much harder than the stagflation winds of the Jimmy Carter years  And once again the establishment is using the decline it the price of gold to validate its misguided policies and discredit its critics  But none of the problems that led me and other modern day gold bugs to buy gold ten years ago have been solved  In fact  monetary and fiscal policies have actually made them much worse  The sad truth is that as bad as things were back in 1976  they are much worse now  Whether as a nation we will be able to rise to the occasion  and actually finish the job that Ronald Reagan and Paul Volcker started remains to be seen  But I am confident that the price of gold will rise much higher  and that its final ascent will be that much more spectacular the longer we continue on our current policy path  Don t believe the mainstream  Just as before  they will likely be wrong again BY Euro Pacific Capital,2013-07-01,Euro

121261,342776,NYT,Can The Gold Bug Bashing Continue Further ,opinion,The New York Times had the definitive take on the vicious sell off in Gold To summarize one of their articles Two years ago  gold bugs ran wild as the price of gold rose approximately six times  But since that crest it has steadily declined  almost by half  putting the gold bugs in flight  The most recent advisory from a leading Wall Street firm suggests that the price will continue to drift downward  and may ultimately settle 40  below current levels The rout says a lot about consumer confidence in the worldwide recovery  The sharply reduced rates of inflation combined with resurgence of other  more economically productive investments  such as stocks  real estate  and bank savings have grouped to eliminate gold s allure Although the American economy has reduced its rapid rate of recovery  it is still on a firm expansionary course  The fear that dominated two years ago has largely vanished  replaced by a recovery that has turned gold speculators  dreams into a nightmare This analysis provides a good representation of the current conventional wisdom  The only twist here is that the article from which this summary is derived appeared in the August 29  1976 edition of The New York Times  At that time gold was preparing to embark on an historic rally that would push it up more than 700  a little over three years later  Is it possible that the history is about to repeat itself At the time The Times article was written  gold had fallen to  103 per ounce  a decline of nearly 50  from the roughly  200 it had sold for in the closing days of 1974  The  200 price had capped a furious three year rally that began in August of 1971 when President Nixon  temporarily  closed the gold window and allowed gold to float freely  Prior to that decision gold had been fixed at  35 per ounce for nearly two generations  That initial three year 450  rally had validated the forecasts of the  gold bugs  who had predicted a rapid rise in gold prices should the dollar s link to gold be severed  Once uncoupled from the dollar  gold s initial ascent in the early 1970 s was fueled by the highest inflation in generations and the deteriorating health of the U S  economy that had been ravaged by the  guns and butter  policies of the 1960 s  But the American economy stabilized during the mid 1970 s and both inflation and unemployment fell  When the gold price approached  100 per ounce  a nearly 50  decline  the obituaries came fast and furious  Everyone assumed that the gold mania would never return Few realized at the time that the real economic pain of the 1970 s had  to paraphrase The Carpenters 1970 s hit   Only Just Begun   When inflation and recession came back with a vengeance in the late 1970 s  gold took off  to quote another 1970 s gem   like a skyrocket in flight  By January 1980  gold topped out at  850 an ounce  The second leg of the rally proved to be bigger than the first The parallel between the 1970s and the current period are even more striking when you look closely at the numbers  For example  from 1971 to 1974 gold prices rose by 458  from  35 to  195 25  which was then followed by a two year correction of nearly 50   This reduced total gains to just under 200   The current bull market that began back in 2000 took a bit longer to evolve  but the percentage gains are very similar   We should allow for a more compressed time frame in the 1970s because of the sudden untethering of gold after decades of restraint   From its 1999 low to its 2011 peak  gold rose by about 650  from  253 to  1895 per ounce  followed by a two year correction of approximately 37   down to around  1190 per ounce  The pullback has reduced the total rally to about 370   The mainstream is saying now  as they did then  that the pullback has invalidated fears that rising U  S  budget deficits  overly accommodative monetary policy  and a weakening economy will combine to bring down the dollar and ignite inflation  But 1976 was not the end of the game  In all likelihood  2013 will not be either The biggest difference between then and now is that until 1975 ordinary Americans were barred by law from buying and owning Gold By the mid 1970s none of the problems that initially led to the recession in the early years of the decade had been solved  Contrary to the claims of the  experts  things got much worse in the years ahead  It took the much deeper recession of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s  which at the time was the worst economic down turn since the great Depression  to finally purge the economy of all the excesses  The lower marginal tax rates and cuts in regulation implemented by President Reagan and tight money under Volcker helped get the economy back on track and create investment opportunities that drew money away from gold  As a result gold fell hard during the early 1980 s  But even after the declines  gold maintained levels for the next 20 years that were three to four times as high as the 1976 lows Unfortunately just like 1976  a true economic recovery is not just around the corner  More likely we are in the eye of an economic storm that will blow much harder than the stagflation winds of the Jimmy Carter years  And once again the establishment is using the decline in the price of gold to validate its misguided policies and discredit its critics  But none of the problems that led me and other modern day gold bugs to buy gold ten years ago have been solved  But I am confident that the price of gold will rise much higher  and that its

121263,342778,NYT,The Week Ahead  Have Investors Dodged The Bullet ,opinion,In last week s prediction for the week ahead my streak of good guesses came to an end  I had the temerity to suggest that market focus might finally be moving beyond the Fed policy QE debate and turning to corporate earnings  While earnings provided some important stories  the biggest news came when the market ignored the slightly bearish Fed minutes and found comfort in a few words from Chairman Bernanke  While many of us saw nothing new  it is a matter of perception  I described the three schools of thought in this post  The trader school finally got the message this week  causing media types to conclude that he must have said something different or the markets would not be moving  Sheesh  Is the Fed fixation finally behind us  In a week where Bernanke testifies before Congress  the Beige book comes out  and Fed Presidents are on the rubber chicken circuit  this seems like a dangerous prediction  Undaunted  I will try again  This week s key question will be all about new records in stocks and the lessons for corporate earnings reports  In particular  people will be asking  Have we dodged the bullet   Was the modest June swoon the extent of the market correction  or is there something else to fear  Ed Yardeni  in the current bull market Here are three current viewpoints We are beyond the seasonal weakness in evidence during the last few years  Most see economic and earnings improvement in the second half of 2013   that forward earnings are at a new record  year over year earnings growth is about 5   and the earnings yield on the S P 500 is 7 15     all indicating a cheap market  He is expecting a new market record in the next few months  The  is looking for 3 25  growth in the second half of 2013 Economic threats   the sequester  reduced home purchases due to rising rates  or effects from abroad   may derail the earnings story   is  very concerned  about earnings and pessimistic about the economic  false dawn   He predicts that Q2 earnings will actually decline by 1   This is a dramatic prediction with a near term time frame We are OK for now  but political leaders in Europe and the U S  have plenty of time before the year ends  The debt ceiling talks are on  life support     and the debt ceiling must be raised this fall  Will it be a replay of 2011  Nothing bad actually happened from that debt ceiling debate  but consumer confidence plummeted as people watched the process  This week the political science world lost Alan Rosenthal of Rutgers  who studied the state legislatures of every state and helped to reform 35 of them  His  explains as follows Observing the Ohio General Assembly  he decided to test the old saying that likened the legislative process to sausage making  so he visited a sausage factory  His conclusion  written for State Legislatures magazine in 2001  was that sausage making was cleaner  more efficient  more collaborative and better labeled  I have some thoughts on the potential for a market correction  which I will take up in the conclusion  First  let us do our regular update of last week s news and data  Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead  There are many good lists of upcoming events  One source I regularly follow is the weekly calendar from Investing com  For best results you need to select the date range from the calendar displayed on the site  You will be rewarded with a comprehensive list of data and events from all over the world  It takes a little practice  but it is worth it  In contrast  I highlight a smaller group of events  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios  Each week I consider the upcoming calendar and the current market  predicting the main theme we should expect  This step is an important part of my trading preparation and planning  It takes more hours than you can imagine  My record is pretty good  If you review the list of titles it looks like a history of market concerns  Wrong  The thing to note is that I highlighted each topic the week before it grabbed the attention  I find it useful to reflect on the key theme for the week ahead  and I hope you will as well  This is unlike my other articles at  A Dash  where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context  Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market Last Week s Data Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good This was a light weak for economic news  but there were a few positive items A federal budget surplus  According to   the probability is increasing that we will see this in the next few years  I am scoring this as  good  since it reflects better revenues  Might it be happening too quickly  Scott Grannis  The early bank earnings reports were strong   on JP Morgan  JPM  and Wells Fargo  WFC    about the impact of rates on housing and bank earnings   The bottom line is that the construction recovery is nowhere near ended  The building permits numbers point to a decent gain in housing starts in June  data out Wednesday   And with starts still well below historically normal levels  homebuilding volumes will keep rising for some time after that  European trade is achieving balance  proving the doomster s wrong according to Olaf Storbeck at Breakingviews  He writes   The latest German trade data confirm that one of the fundamental causes of the euro crisis may be fading away  The long standing intra euro zone trade and current account imbalances are disappearing slowly but surely  The progress is hidden behind the statistics  headline numbers  The Bad There was also a little bad news  Feel free to add in the comments anything you think I missed The IMF reduced global growth forecasts  See analysis from  Jobless claims were a bit higher than expected  perhaps influenced by the July 4th holiday  The four week moving average was also a little higher  but the report was within the normal noise level Oil and gasoline prices moved higher  reflected in the PPI  It is time to review the PPI core versus headline numbers with  Mortgage rates are higher and refinancing activity is lower     The Ugly This week s  ugly  award goes to the anonymous bond trader who moaned and groaned to CNBC s Bob Pisani about Bernanke s market moving comments in the Q and A following his  to the NBER conference in Cambridge  Pisani repeatedly reported that traders were unhappy about this news and some on the network even described it as market manipulation  These complaints illustrate a serious and important discrepancy between the reality of policy making and the reality of trading  I have been a member of both groups  As a trader  I never expected government actions  speeches  or data releases to conform to my trading convenience  The timing was announced in advance  It was up to me to decide if I wanted to carry a position overnight  I did not expect much from the Bernanke speech  and I was surprised that the market thought it was fresh news  The Fed minutes seemed more important  It was a surprise  just as like many other events Should Bernanke decline any speeches that are outside of market hours  Refuse to answer questions  even if repeating what he has already said before When you have a losing trade  you just accept it and move on The Indicator SnapshotIt is important to keep the current news in perspective  I am always searching for the best indicators for our weekly snapshot  I make changes when the evidence warrants  At the moment  my weekly snapshot includes these important summary indicators  For financial risk  theSt  Louis Financial Stress Index An updated analysis of recession probability from key sources For market trends  the key measures from our  Felix  ETF model Financial Risk  The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has recently edged a bit higher  reflecting increased market volatility  It remains at historically low levels  well out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions  The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses  Recession Odds  I feature the C Score  a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found    I have now added a   where Dr  Dieli explains the rationale for his indicator and how it applied in each recession since the 50 s  I have organized this so that you can pick a particular recession and see the discussion for that case  Those who are skeptics about the method should start by reviewing the video for that recession  Anyone who spends some time with this will learn a great deal about the history of recessions from a veteran observer  I have promised another installment on how I use Bob s information to improve investing  I hope to have that soon  Meanwhile  anyone watching the videos will quickly learn that the aggregate spread  and the C Score  provides an early warning  Bob also has a collection of coincident indicators and is always questioning his own methods  I also feature RecessionAlert  which combines a variety of different methods  including the ECRI  in developing a Super Index  They offer a  Anyone following them over the last year would have had useful and profitable guidance on the economy  RecessionAlert has developed a comprehensive package of economic forecasting and market indicators  well worth your consideration  Of special interest is the Leading SuperIndex  which accurately forecast the absence of a summer swoon  Since the weekly data are still mixed  it is important to monitor the index closely  Here is the  and chart  Georg Vrba s four input recession indicator is also benign  Here is his  where he concludes   Based on the historic patterns of the unemployment rate indicators prior to recessions one can reasonably conclude that the U S  economy is not likely to go into recession anytime soon   Georg has other excellent indicators for stocks  bonds  and precious metals at   Unfortunately  and despite the inaccuracy of their forecast  the mainstream media features the ECRI  Doug Short has of the ECRI recession prediction  now over 18 months old  Doug updates all of the official indicators used by the NBER and also has a helpful list of articles about recession forecasting  His latest comment points out that the public data series has not been helpful or consistent with the announced ECRI posture  Doug also continues to refresh the  of the major indicators used by the NBER in recession dating  The average investor has lost track of this long ago  and that is unfortunate  The original ECRI claim and the supporting public data was expensive for many  The reason that I track this weekly  emphasizing the best methods  is that it is important for corporate earnings and for stock prices  It has been worth the effort for me  and for anyone reading each week  Readers might also want to review my   which explains many of the concepts people get wrong   Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  Two weeks ago we switched to a bearish position  but it was a close call  Last week we switched back to neutral  which was also a close call  The inverse ETFs were more highly rated than positive sectors by a small margin  but remained in the penalty box  This week we are almost in bullish territory  This has been an amazing change in only two weeks  I will stick with  neutral  for this week  but the bias is to the upside  These are one month forecasts for the poll  but Felix has a three week horizon  Felix s ratings have improved a bit  The penalty box percentage measures our confidence in the forecast  A high rating means that most ETFs are in the penalty box  so we have less confidence in the overall ratings  That measure remains elevated  so we have less confidence in short term trading   For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer   The Week Ahead There is a lot of news and data on this week s calendar  The  A List  includes the following Bernanke testimony  W Th   The semi annual report to Congress spans two days  This time he starts in front of the House Financial Services Committee and then presents exactly the same statement the next day to the Senate Banking Committee  Next time the order will be reversed  The feature of both sessions will be questions from our legislators  While I do not expect any new information  traders seem toInitial jobless claims  Th   Employment will continue as the focal point in evaluating the economy  and this is the most responsive indicator Housing starts and building permits  W   Housing may now be the most important economic driver and building permits are the best leading indicator Retail sales  M   An important confirmation of other data on consumers The  B List  includes the following Industrial production  T   Especially important for those few who still fear an imminent recession Beige book  W   The Fed s collection of anecdotal evidence will be in front of the participants at the next FOMC meeting  so it could be interesting  The various regions take turns in preparing this material Leading indicators  Th   Still a favorite of many  and showing only a modest positive CPI  T   This will be influenced by energy prices  while the core remains subdued  This is not really a factor at the moment  but it bears watching There is plenty of other news  including Chinese economic data on Monday  various speeches by Fed bank presidents  and the regional Empire State and Philly Fed releases  Any of these might move the markets if unusual  And most importantly   more earnings  How to Use the Weekly Data Updates  In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach  To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances  My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage  Insight for Traders  Felix has continued a neutral posture in equities  We have had a successful long position in oil  via USO  and a one day foray into the inverse ETF for the DJIA  DOG   DOG went back to the penalty box   or should I say the doghouse   after only one day  Like any human trader  Felix makes mistakes  The overall ratings are now slightly positive  so we may see some new positions this week  It is fair to say that Felix remains cautious about the next few weeks  Felix did well to avoid the premature correction calls that have been prevalent since the first few days of 2013  accompanied by various slogans and omens  More recently  Felix has avoided the treacherous stock trading of the last few weeks while making some profit in short bonds and long oil  Insight for Investors  This is a time of danger for investors who are stubbornly sticking to losing ideas  My recent themes are still quite valid  If you have not followed the links below  please find a little time to give yourself a checkup  You can follow the steps below  What NOT to do Let us start with the most dangerous investments  especially those traditionally regarded as safe  Interest rates have been falling for so long that investors in fixed income are accustomed to collecting both yield and capital appreciation  An increase in interest rates will prove very costly for these investments  It has already started  Check out   which continues to signal the risk  Other yield based investments have also suffered  and it is not over  Check out the latest interest rate forecast   Or the timetable to a 4  ten year note from Goldman Sachs  via    Find a safer source of yield  Take what the market is giving you For the conservative investor  you can buy stocks with a reasonable yield  attractive valuation  and a strong balance sheet  You can then sell near term calls against your position and target returns close to 10   The risk is far lower than for a general stock portfolio  This strategy has worked well for over two years and continues to do so  I have had a number of questions about this suggestion  so I recently   That post provides background as well as concrete examples showing how you can try this strategy yourself  There is nothing quite as satisfying as watching your account grow while the market is doing nothing or trading in a range  Balance risk and reward There is always risk  Investors often see a distorted balance of upside and downside  focusing too much on news events and not enough on earnings and value  You need to understand and accept normal market volatility  as I explain in this post  Should Investors be Scared Witless  Get Started Too many long term investors try to go all in or all out  thinking they can time the market  There is no reason for these extremes  Recent weeks have been tough for traders  Most were surprised by the market reaction to more FedSpeak and the spike in interest rates  For investors it was a different story  If you had your shopping list  there have been good opportunities to buy stocks  For those following our enhanced yield approach you had both the chance to set new positions and to sell calls against old ones  And finally  we have collected some of our recent recommendations in a     a starting point for the long term investor   Comments and suggestions welcome  I am trying to be helpful and I love feedback   Final Thought  There is always the potential for a market correction  We know that corrections will occur even during the best of years  The biggest challenge for the intelligent investor is the flow of news  There is always something to worry about  Smart people try to draw conclusions about anything that might be a threat  Every week I get calls from new clients   very intelligent  well educated people who have been successful in their day jobs  When they tried to apply these skills to their own investments  something went seriously awry  The biggest single reason is a failure of perspective  Instead of trying to explain  let me highlight the best investment article from last week  Josh Brown s  He writes as follows   It s very simple   is the only way to successfully fund a retirement over the long stretch  Unless you believe that you have the god like ability to dance into and out of the markets with good timing on a consistent basis  I know you can t and I don t even know you  Fun fact   pick any day of any month of any year over the last 50 years   if you bought the stock market on that date  you had a 75  of being up one year later  That s the math of being in the game and being long biased at all times   That is just a sample  You really need to read the entire post  Josh is especially trustworthy because he is aligned with the average investor  as I described in my   Most importantly  few investors should be  all out   Look at a chart   stocks  GDP  population  profits  number of homes  number of computers     you name it  Things improve  That should be the  default setting   You can adjust your defaults by looking for risks as we do each week in this series  Insist on quantification  There are always worries  For perspective  compare your own current list with those when the Dow was at 10K     What I recommend is in sharp contrast to the various sources telling investors that stocks are too expensive  Those who unwisely use  for example  the Shiller CAPE ratio for market timing have a short bias as their default setting  Prof  Shiller himself does not take this approach  although many of those citing him draw that conclusion  See the full story here ,2013-07-14,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-week-ahead:-have-investors-dodged-the-bullet-175300,175300

121294,342809,NYT,Obama opposes energy bill trade penalties reports,news,"WASHINGTON  June 28  Reuters     U S  President Barack
Obama on Sunday called a House passed climate change bill  an
extraordinary first step   but spoke out against a provision
that would impose trade penalties on countries that fail to cut
greenhouse gas emissions 
  At a time when the economy worldwide is still deep in
recession and we ve seen a significant drop in global trade  I
think we have to be very careful about sending any
protectionist signals   Obama said in an Oval Office interview
reported by The New York Times  the Los Angeles Times and The
Washington Post 
  I think there may be other ways of doing it than with a
tariff approach   Obama said 
 The Democratic controlled House on Friday passed the
climate change bill that would require large U S  companies 
including utilities and manufacturers to reduce emissions of
carbon dioxide and other gases associated with global warming
by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050  from 2005
levels 
 A top priority for Obama  the measure was approved by a
219 212 vote  with only eight Republicans joining Democrats in
support of the bill  Republicans said the bill would neither
effectively help the environment nor improve an economy reeling
from a deep recession 
 Obama dismissed the Republican criticisms and castigated
opponents for  lying  about cost projections and  scaring the
bejeezus  out of voters  the Los Angeles Times said 
 Obama also accused Republicans of being stuck in a
1990s era debate on energy when the American people  have moved
forward  with concerns about climate change and hope for

121295,342810,NYT,CHRONOLOGY Key dates in health saga of Apple s Jobs,news,"June 30  Reuters    Apple Inc  Co founder and Chief
Executive Steve Jobs is back at work  returning from a near
six month medical leave after receiving a liver transplant 
 ID nN29361531 
 Here is a chronology of his health issues 
 August 2004  Jobs announces he underwent successful surgery
to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas  He said it was a
rare form of pancreatic cancer called an islet cell
neuroendocrine tumor 
 June 2005  Jobs mentions the cancer in a commencement
address at Stanford University 
  This was the closest I ve been to facing death  and I hope
it s the closest I get for a few more decades   he says 
 2008 
 June 9  Jobs appears dramatically thinner at an Apple
iPhone event  touching off speculation the cancer had returned 
The company said he was fighting a  common bug  and taking
antibiotics  Apple later called Jobs  health a  private
matter  
 July 26  The New York Times journalist Joe Nocera wrote in
a column that he had spoken to Jobs about his health but that
because the conversation was off record  he could not disclose
what was said   While his health problems amounted to a good
deal more than  a common bug   they weren t life threatening
and he doesn t have a recurrence of cancer   Nocera wrote 
 Sept  9  At an iPod product launch  Jobs jokes about his
health by walking on stage in front of a giant screen that
flashed  The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated     a
quotation borrowed from Mark Twain 
 Oct  3  A false Internet report that Jobs had suffered a
heart attack briefly pushes Apple shares down 2 percent to a
17 month low  Apple quickly denied the report on iReport com  a
citizen journalist site owned by CNN 
 Oct  14  At a Mac product launch event  Jobs jokes again
about his health  His blood pressure was 110 over 70 and he
said   And that s all we re going to be talking about Steve s
health today  
 Dec  16  Apple said Jobs won t deliver the keynote address
at the Macworld trade show in January  reviving concerns about
his health  Asked to explain the decision  a spokesman said it
would be the last time Apple takes part in Macworld so  it
doesn t make sense for us to make a major investment in a trade
show we ll no longer be attending  
 Dec  30  Apple shares fall as much as 2 percent after
Gizmodo reported that Jobs health was  rapidly declining  and
that was the reason why he canceled the Macworld keynote 
 2009 
 Jan  5  Jobs says he has been losing weight throughout 2008
and his doctors think a hormone imbalance was  robbing  him of
proteins  He says he has begun a  relatively simple and
straightforward  treatment for his nutritional problem and that
he will continue as CEO during recovery 
  I will be the first one to step up and tell our board of
directors if I can no longer continue to fulfill my duties as
Apple s CEO   he says  Apple shares rise 5 percent 
 Jan  14  Jobs announces medical leave until the end of
June  saying his health issues are  more complex  than
originally thought  He hands day to day operations to Chief
Operating Officer Tim Cook and says he plans to remain involved
in major strategic decisions  Apple shares fall 10 percent in
after hours trading 
 Jan  21  The U S  Securities and Exchange Commission is
examining Apple s disclosures about Jobs to ensure investors
were not mislead  Bloomberg reports 
 June 8  Apple unveils new iPhone 3GS at its annual
Worldwide Developer s Conference  but Jobs does not make an
appearance 
 June 20  The Wall Street Journal reports that Jobs had a
liver transplant in Memphis  Tennessee about two months ago and
that he is expected to return to work later in June 
 June 22  Jobs is spotted at the Apple campus in Cupertino 
California  underscoring expectations that he is either back at
work or will return soon 
 June 23  The Methodist University Hospital Transplant
Institute confirms it performed a liver transplant on Jobs and
says he is  recovering well and has an excellent prognosis  
The hospital does not give more details  saying the
confirmation had come with Jobs  permission 
 June 30  Jobs returns to work  an Apple spokesman says 
adding that he will work from home part of the time

121296,342811,NYT,FOREX Dlr  euro hold steady vs yen  eyes on US earnings,news,"  Limited reaction seen from ruling bloc loss in Tokyo poll
   Dollar yen and cross yen supported by short covering
   Eyes on equities  outlook for risk appetite
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO  July 13  Reuters    The dollar and the euro held
steady against the yen on Monday  supported by short covering as
investors awaited U S  corporate earnings results this week to
gauge the strength of the global economy 
 An election loss for Prime Minister Taro Aso s ruling bloc at
a Tokyo assembly poll on Sunday had limited impact on the yen 
traders said  adding that the market was focusing more on the
health of the global economy 
 Traders said a renewed focus on market expectations that
Goldman Sachs would post good results when it reports quarterly
earnings this week helped spur some short covering in the yen
crosses  and dragged the yen lower at one point 
  The market has been long the yen  and it seems like there is
some position unwinding in yen crosses overall   said a trader
for a major Japanese bank  adding that the talk about Goldman s
results helped trigger the move 
 In a story on its website  the New York Times said Goldman
Sachs was likely to post huge profits  The paper said analysts
predict the bank earned more than  2 billion in the March June
period  helped by its trading across global markets 
 Not all traders were convinced that the New York Times story
about Goldman Sachs had much impact  and a trader for a European
bank said the contents of the article were not particularly new 
 Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting Goldman to
report net income for common shareholders of  3 54 a share  which
would exceed a surprisingly strong first quarter in which Goldman
reported net income of  3 39 per share 
 The dollar edged up 0 1 percent to 92 63 yen  after rising to
as high as 92 95 yen on trading platform EBS earlier in the day 
and pulling away from a five month low of 91 77 yen struck on
Friday 
 The euro edged up 0 1 percent to 129 20 yen  having risen as
high as 129 89 yen earlier  The euro fell to 127 00 yen last
week  its lowest in nearly two months 
 The dollar and yen crosses gained support when U S  S P 500
stock futures and Tokyo shares edged higher earlier on Monday 
but later trimmed their gains as equities turned negative 
traders said 
 One trader said the euro edged up against the yen at one
point due to short covering by an Asia based fund 
 Against the dollar  the euro rose 0 1 percent to  1 3950 
 RISK APPETITE
  The theme is likely to continue to be whether risk can be
taken or not   said Minoru Shioiri  chief manager for FX trading
at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities  adding that forthcoming U S 
corporate earnings were a focal point 
 The dollar and yen have fallen broadly since March  as hopes
grew that the worst of the global economic recession was over 
boosting risk appetite and prompting investors to shift funds out
of the safe haven dollar and low yielding yen into other
currencies and assets 
 But in recent weeks  market players have started to fret that
optimism about the global economy s recovery prospects and the
rally in risk assets may have been overdone  giving a boost to
the yen and the dollar  and dragging down currencies such as the
euro and the Australian dollar 
 Latest U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows
that speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange s
International Monetary Market have flipped to net long positions
in the yen  to the tune of 17 117 contracts in the week to July
7  after having been slightly short the yen the prior week 
 Traders and analysts played down the impact from the weekend
Tokyo assembly election 
 Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso s ruling bloc was soundly
defeated in the Tokyo election seen as a bellwether for a
national poll to be held within three months 
The election results suggest the main opposition Democratic
Party will win more seats in a general election that must be held
by October at the latest  said Tohru Sasaki  chief foreign
exchange strategist for JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo 
 But it is unclear how that would affect Japan s economy  and
the impact on the foreign exchange market seems likely to be
limited at this point  Sasaki said  adding that the market s
focus was on global economic conditions

   Dollar yen and cross yen take cues from equities
   Eyes on US corporate earnings
 By Masayuki Kitano
 TOKYO  July 13  Reuters    The yen rose against the euro and
the Australian dollar on Monday  drawing support from falls in
Asian equities that dovetailed with receding optimism about the
chances for a quick recovery in the global economy 
 The yen reacted little to news that embattled Prime Minister
Taro Aso plans to call a general election on Aug  30 
 Traders and analysts said the timing of the election was not
surprising  adding that the yen was taking its cues from Asian
shares and U S  stock futures as the currency market s focus was
on the outlook for the global economy and investor risk appetite 
  The yen crosses look weak  including moves in the Australian
dollar against the yen   said Yuichi Hojo  director of FX
distribution for UBS AG s Tokyo branch 
 The yen rose broadly  with the euro dipping 0 4 percent
against the yen to 128 58 yen  after having risen to around
129 90 yen earlier in the day 
 The Australian dollar fell 0 5 percent to 71 65 yen 
 The dollar dipped 0 2 percent to 92 35 yen  inching back in
the direction of a five month low of 91 77 yen hit on trading
platform EBS on Friday 
 Earlier  the yen had fallen broadly as Tokyo shares and U S 
S P stock futures hovered in positive territory 
 Traders said a renewed focus on market expectations that
Goldman Sachs would post good results when it reports quarterly
earnings this week helped spur some short covering in the yen
crosses  and dragged the yen lower at one point

report net income for common shareholders of  3 54 a share  which
would exceed a surprisingly strong first quarter in which Goldman
reported net income of  3 39 per share 
 The yen later edged higher as equities turned negative  with
Japan s Nikkei stock average falling 2 3 percent and U S  S P
stock futures dipping 0 8 percent on the day 
 RISK APPETITE

taken or not   said Minoru Shioiri  chief manager for FX trading
at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities  adding that forthcoming U S

optimism about the global economy s recovery prospects and the
rally in risk assets may have been overdone  giving a boost to
the yen and the dollar  and dragging down currencies such as the
euro and the Australian dollar 
 Against this backdrop  the yen showed subdued reaction to the
Japanese ruling bloc s loss in a Tokyo assembly election on
Sunday  and to Prime Minister Aso s plans to call a nationwide
general election at the end of August 
 Investors are already bracing for the likelihood of the
opposition Democratic Party winning the general election  traders
and analysts said 
  Regardless of whether the Liberal Democratic Party stays or
whether the Democratic Party takes over  the chances are low that
there will be a drastic improvement in the economy itself or in
how the economy will be managed   said Tokichi Ito  deputy
general manager for Trust   Custody Services Bank s forex team 
  It is hard to draw a picture of the yen being bought or sold
because of it   Ito said 
 UBS  however  said in a client note that an increase in
political uncertainty may initially be negative for the yen 
adding that if the market thinks the Democrats are going to add
to spending to the detriment of the fiscal outlook  that would
also be negative

  Adds Citigroup response 
 NEW YORK  Aug 2  Reuters    Andrew Hall  the trader behind
Phibro LLC  the energy trading arm of beleaguered bank
Citigroup   is quietly pushing for a  quiet divorce  from
his parent company and has had preliminary talks with one
possible suitor  The New York Times reported on Sunday 
 Citigroup said in a statement   We are evaluating the best
way forward for our stakeholders   A company spokeswoman
declined to comment specifically on the talks referred to in
the Times  story 
 Phibro has been in the spotlight after the White House
criticized a reported  100 million pay plan for Hall as  out of
whack  
 Citigroup said in its statement that the Phibro unit
operates under a pay for performance contract  with
compensation determined at the end of the year as a percentage
of the profits the business earns for Citi 
  We re confident in the value these types of profit sharing
arrangements bring to the company and its shareholders as they
directly align compensation with performance and include
appropriate clawback and risk sharing provisions   Citigroup
said 
 It has previously been reported that Hall  a trader known
for huge long term bets in the oil market  has been pressing
Citi to honor the 2009 pay package 
 The secretive Phibro unit  based in Connecticut  can
sometimes provide the bulk of revenues for its parent company 
which has taken a  45 billion federal bailout and is expected
this week to give the government a 34 percent equity stake 
 Citigroup is trying to balance its desire to retain its top
energy trader against the government s drive to crack down on
excessive compensation on Wall Street

   IRS seen prosecuting 150 wealthy U S  clients of UBS
 
  Recasts with details from source  background 
 ZURICH  Aug 14  Reuters    A landmark settlement that will
spare UBS a lengthy and damaging U S  tax trial is set to be
signed next week and will involve the disclosure of the biggest
holders of secret Swiss accounts 
  The signing will most likely take place next week   a
source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday 
 The source did not want to disclose any details from the
settlement  but the New York Times said on Friday Swiss accounts
in the name of U S  residents over a certain dollar amount would
be disclosed to U S  tax authorities 
 Earlier this week  the U S  and Swiss government initialled
an out of court settlement to end a dispute over whether the
Swiss bank should be forced to disclose the names of 52 000 rich
U S  clients suspected of tax evasion 
 However  the parties did not disclose details of the deal 
which ends a protracted tax dispute that has damaged UBS s image
abroad and threatened Switzerland s prized bank secrecy 
 The details of the settlement will also be made public next
week  the source added 
 The New York Times said the settlement would involve UBS
disclosing the names of U S  clients who had set up offshore
entities to evade taxes and those who had contact with
Swiss based UBS bankers in person  by telephone or e mail 
 Shares in UBS were up 1 28 percent at 17 44 Swiss francs 
outperforming a flat DJ Stoxx European Banking Index 
 The New York Times also reported that 150 American clients
of UBS would likely face criminal charges related to tax evasion
in the United States  citing a person briefed on the matter 
 The person told the paper that several inquiries across the
country were being handled by dozens of prosecutors and will
result in criminal complaints 
 The paper said it was unclear where the U S  government got
the client names from 
 In February  UBS agreed to pay  780 million and to hand over
data related to about 250 U S  clients to settle criminal
charges it was facing under a tax dispute with the U S 
government 
 UBS and the Swiss department of justice declined to comment

 NEW YORK  Aug 19  Reuters    The dollar fell against the
euro and a basket of currencies on Wednesday as a rebound on
Wall Street reduced safe haven demand for the U S  currency 
 But the dollar weakened against the yen  although it came
off the day s worst levels as a sharp slide by China s stock
market overnight raised concerns about the global economic
outlook and boosted the Japanese currency s allure 
 A recovery in stock prices and a jump in oil prices to
above  72 a barrel lifted commodity currencies  while the euro
pushed above  1 42  on track for its biggest daily rise against
the dollar in more than two weeks 
  Currencies have been tracking sentiment  in the equity and
oil markets  said Brian Kim  currency strategist at UBS in
Stamford  Connecticut   That s why we ve seen the dollar come
off  
 In recent months  the dollar has tended to fall as stock
prices and risk appetite rise  giving investors less impetus to
buy dollars as a safe haven 
 In mid afternoon trading in New York  the euro rose 0 8
percent to  1 4246  well off a session low of  1 4081

121305,342820,NYT,Simon Moores  Flake Graphite Prices Have Bottomed,opinion,Growth potential among end users and underinvestment on the supply side makes graphite an obvious go long play  according to Simon Moores  manager of Industrial Minerals Data  China s consolidation of graphite production plays a role in that scenario  Now is the time to look for responsible junior graphite miners that base their economics on current  lower  prices  says Moores in this interview with The Metals Report   The Metals Report  Simon  the Chinese government says it is no longer willing to sacrifice the environment to mine and export commodities  You recently visited several graphite mining operations in China  Is this for real or just paying lip service   Simon Moores  When you visit these mines and see how dated and wasteful some of their mining practices are  the environmental issues are apparent  But while this stance is partially to benefit the environment  it s also about China wanting to retain raw materials and use them to manufacture higher value products  China does have some leading graphite producers that are now investing in not only improving their products as well as their mining practices  This is something non Chinese companies will have to keep track of   TMR  If China is  going green   what are the ripple effects that graphite investors in the West will feel   SM  China s  going green  is twofold  Green from the mining side means becoming more efficient with graphite mining and using less hazardous materials for processing the material  This will result in less material being available for export  Buyers outside of China have no choice but to eventually find supplies elsewhere   From the market side  going green undoubtedly means expanding the electric vehicle market  The growth for batteries  especially lithium ion batteries  could be explosive  This could transform demand for key raw materials  especially flake graphite   TMR  What were the biggest takeaways from your visit to China   SM  The biggest one was China s willingness to control the industry  Its amorphous graphite industry has been consolidated  In Hunan province  the government consolidated close to 230 small time mines into one company that now controls 50 60  of the production in that area  Another takeaway is that flake graphite is on China s radar  Although it was the amorphous graphite mines that were consolidated  flake graphite  which is the bigger business  was being discussed   TMR  Some people have speculated that the consolidation strategy in flake graphite could ultimately lead China to flood the market with graphite  much like it did in the mid  90s  forcing some graphite miners out of business  You disagree  Tell us why   SM  Today is a completely different situation from the mid  90s  A generation ago  China was on its way up  It was getting its primary industries underway  growing as quickly as possible  taking in as much revenue as possible  Back then  China could mine cheaply  export cheaply  undercut everybody and get quick money  There was no competition  Now  China needs to move its economy to the next level  to the value added level  It wants to compete with South Korea  Japan  Europe and the U S  Cheap exports are not the way to do that   Its challenge is to appease the mining companies through things like tax breaks on higher value products to push these companies to develop value added products such as battery grade graphite and even the batteries themselves  The car industry is a perfect example  Ten years ago  China didn t have one  now I expect to see Chinese cars on European and North American roads in the next three years   TMR  China also has a source of flake graphite in North Korea  What is going on there   SM  China has exported flake graphite from North Korea for the last decade from a mine that once was a joint venture between North and South Korea  It exported about 1 000 tonnes in 2012  The graphite goes to China  where it is blended with other products  This is a captive source for China that has historically been used internally   TMR  Why is this Korean source being talked about more now   SM  I am not sure  Our research indicates that China is not getting as much flake graphite from North Korea as previously thought  The problem is that bad information gets around really quickly  especially when it is free  Everyone thought North Korea was sending 30 000 tonnes per year  tpa  of flake graphite to China  We think it was actually less than 1 000 tonnes in 2012  North Korea was considered the fourth largest producer in the world  If the data are wrong  that could indicate there is a lot less flake graphite in the market than people realized   The same problem exists with India  The Indian production figures that are freely available for flake graphite indicated production of 140 000 tpa when  according to our research  in the last 12 months it was actually 35 000 tpa  If that is the case  the rest of world production could be well overestimated   TMR  The price of flake graphite has been dropping since May 2012  mostly owing to softer demand from steel refractories and lubricant markets How is this affecting the economics of flake graphite projects   SM  Obviously  lower prices would have a negative effect on projects whose economics were done 12 18 months ago using the very high prices we saw then  Prices have come down about 50  on average from the 2011 2012 peak  On that basis  some companies are already reevaluating   TMR  Does that invalidate their preliminary economic assessments and other economic studies   SM   Invalidate  is probably too strong a word  but the more responsible graphite juniors are revaluating their economics based on lower prices  Typically  these companies use price averages for their analyses  Predicting the future price of graphite price is always guesswork  Whether they take a 12   18  or 24 month average  it will be an average  and there will always be problems with that   But understandably  miners have to use a price and this is where we come in  as the only independents pricing natural graphite  TMR  What is the current price of flake graphite   SM  Using our most commonly quoted grade  the  80 mesh  94 97  carbon  the price is now  1 400 tonne  It has dropped about 50  since the highs of 2011 and 2012   TMR  What price do you predict through 2015   SM  I think the industry has seen the bottom of graphite prices and should expect a rise from here or in Q3 13  Flake graphite prices have settled higher than expected  They remain 60  higher than pre recession levels in 2008 2009  Other commodities  especially fluorspar  have crashed and hit all time lows  Graphite has not done that   TMR  What is the path forward for companies developing graphite projects   SM  It depends on the company  whether it is coming from an industry perspective or  like most of the juniors  from a stock market perspective  From an industry perspective  the hope is to move away from dependency on China  Graphite buyers need supply security  the price volatility of the past five years has not been good for business  For a company producing refractories  raw materials are by far the biggest input cost  and price volatility does not allow for long term business planning  For long term supply security  companies are looking away from China   TMR  Does that make graphite a go long play   SM  Yes  because the fundamentals will not change any time soon   TMR  The other great debate in this sector is whether graphene is worth talking about as part of an economic thesis   SM  I do not think graphene will ever be a volume business for any graphite producers  The value for graphite companies going into graphene  which only a handful are doing  is the research and development  R D  and new technology that will allow them to produce graphene from natural graphite  This technology will be a game changer for materials science  and the graphite industry will be pretty irrelevant in terms of global impact   Some companies are experimenting with carbon sciences  merging carbon materials into their applications  Companies will never make money from selling large volumes of graphite to make graphene   TMR  Realistically  how far away are we from producing graphene from mined graphite   SM  A few companies are pioneering that technology  Grafoid Inc  has an R D agreement with Focus Graphite Inc   FMS TSX V  to investigate and develop a graphene based composite for electrochemical energy storage for the automotive and or portable electronics sectors  They have just launched the world s first trademarked graphene product MesoGraf  But this material is still in the R D phase   The value of these companies is their research into the best methods to produce graphene and finding applications for it  No one really knows how to use it the graphene pioneers have to build an industry and convince people to use it  Everyone now knows the theory  but the reality the real world application is something that will take time   I went to a graphene event last month  and it struck me that people are not worried about how to produce it  they are more focused on developing the market  on getting end users to try to make products that include graphene   TMR  What will be the next graphite project to reach production   SM  If the press releases are anything to go by  I would say Ontario Graphite Ltd   private   But it is hard for us to analyze because it is a private company that does not put out much information  We look less at the tonnages in the ground and more at the flake distribution of the deposit  Ultimately  these companies will need to sell material  Flake fines  or smaller flake graphite  is the hardest to sell  while large flake the easiest   TMR  Suppose  just for the sake of argument  that Ontario Graphite did add the 20 000 tonnes it says it will to the market  With TIMCAL  a member of Imerys  NK PA   already operating at a roughly similar production rate  could both operations continue at a profit   SM  No  I do not think those two mines could both operate at that rate for very long not in today s market conditions  The good news is that the production rate at TIMCAL s Lac des Iles mine has always been falling  while costs have been rising for a while now  TIMCAL has been looking at other options and other mines  at other graphite juniors  You can pretty much assume that Lac des Iles is on its last legs  which is good news for graphite juniors   TMR  What does that news from TIMCAL mean for a company like Northern Graphite Corporation  NGC TSX V   which also has an advanced stage graphite project in Ontario   SM  It is great news for companies like Northern Graphite  The TIMCAL mine is a generation old  Northern Graphite has been around for ages under a different name prior  but I think that will pay off because of the amount of information the company has on that deposit  I think everything it s been working toward will pay off   TMR  As a graphite deposit  what does Bissett Creek have going for it   SM  The large flake size is the key attraction  The grade is very low  but that s not much of a problem with graphite mining if you can economically extract it  Northern Graphite has a much higher distribution of large flake material  which is what the industry wants   TMR  What are the next steps for Northern Graphite   SM  The next step is to redo the economics  The company released more drill information and increased its confirmed resource data  From there  it is a matter of riding out the storm until the market cycle comes around again  When that happens  it will be one of the strongest junior graphite companies   TMR  In our last interview you talked about Energizer Resources Inc   EGZ TSX V  and its Green Giant project in Madagascar  Can you give us an update   SM  Energizer Resources is doing something very similar to Northern Graphite  It has its asset  its project and a lot of information gathered already  Energizer has to get the word out and go to the market to get funding  I think management is focusing on that  because there is only so much drilling and reporting public companies can do  In other news  Energizer is planning on making an agreement with the nearby Sakoa Coal Field project that would allow Energizer to purchase  over the fence  power and share infrastructure  reducing its operating costs   Logistics is a major factor  particularly in somewhere like Madagascar  If the company can team up with a much larger operation  then it will be a compelling project   TMR  Can you share a couple of other graphite stories that have compelling narratives   SM  Talga Resources Ltd   ASX  TLG  has been working on a JORC confirmed  Joint Ore Resources Committee  graphite resource in Sweden  In terms of volume  it is smaller than deposits in Canada or Africa  but in terms of quality it is up there  I would look out for it   Syrah Resources Ltd   ASX  SYR  is the leading graphite junior in Australia  It also is developing the Balama graphite project in Mozambique  Syrah had a great 12 months when everybody else struggled   Zenyatta Ventures Ltd   ZEN  TSX V  has made a lot of headlines in recent months and enjoyed a high share price when everyone else has suffered  The company has a unique project with very high carbon purities  Zenyatta has been coy about allowing others to test this so far  The data it has released is very impressive on the carbon purities front  but because it s so unique  the question is whether or not it can be used in the same markets as flake or synthetic graphite  Only time will tell   TMR  What thoughts would you leave investors with for the rest of 2013   SM  Look at the long term basics in the graphite industry  Look at where graphite is used  Traditional volume markets include refractories  which is the steel industry  High tech uses include electric vehicle batteries and portable electronics  Very few raw materials have this balance   Look at the supply situation  China continues to dominate  and there have not been any new mines opened in a generation  When you have this kind of growth potential  matched with underinvestment on the supply side  it should not take a genius to work out that something has to change   TMR  Simon  thank you for your time and your insights  Simon Moores is manager of Industrial Minerals Data  a business that sets prices for natural graphite and fluorspar

121307,342822,NYT,Japanese Nikkei Is The Latest Bubble,opinion,Alan Greenspan gave them the playbook  Credit   Debt Manipulation 101  and now Ben Bernanke and global inflators everywhere have taken the ball and run with it in new  innovative and levered up ways  Actually it s a game of Whack a Mole and they play it well  these inflating moles  The minute you think you re going to drop the hammer on one of their heads  he s gone and another one pops up elsewhere So how can we follow all the data points that hands on  manipulative policy has introduced and forecast conclusions with accuracy  The answer is that it is difficult in the short term  but in the long term we are all dead anyway  so we might as well use some inflationary bubbles of the past as a road map to what may be ahead There are currently several bubbles  and one anti bubble   in play over varying time frames  These bubbles are the direct result of policy actions  Last weekend we reviewed the bubble in Japan s Nikkei in relation to its policy induced crashing of the Yen and then last week wouldn t you know that the Yen caught a bid and the Nikkei suffered an incredibly bearish day That was the first impulsive hit  The Nikkei could well go back up to test the highs  but something seemed to kick off over there in the Land of the Rising Sun  Don t fall for calming talk across global markets  It appears the first big moneyed interests got the hell out of the Yen bear trade and the Nikkei bubble trade last week The Nikkei is copper 2006  crude oil 2008  silver 2011  etc  These markets were hockey sticks with the blade pointing up  They reflected hot money that has been given permission to speculate and drive up prices  But this hot money  newly created and pumped into the financial system does little for the real economy  It transforms debt into vehicles for speculation within the financial sphere  with the first users being the most privileged with respect to coming policy In other words  the financial entities that put the money to work first and most profitably have been given the playbook ahead of time  Let s be realistic about this  That right there disqualifies Bernanke and Co  from any respect in my book  The system is stacked and speaking as an American  is bad for most of America  You may have similar or contrary feelings about the policy of your country or union  depending on where you live Never before have the few rich been so targeted for further enrichment and the many of modest or little means targeted for further degradation  Meanwhile the hype is that we have a Socialist in the White House  Well  why do you think he is there and why do you think his agenda is so popular  I guess this is how a screwed up society redistributes some of what its corrupted components have horded The entire post 2000 play has been to financialize the economy to keep it going  To financialize something  you need money  To print money you need to put up more credit and so on and so forth  We know that under Greenspan the US had a convenient partner in China  as the US printed up a bubble in commercial credit and sent the consumer out there  credit card in hand to buy up all sorts of cheaply made goods  This helped build China s infrastructure and pump commodities  That was the play  as inflation  got out there  it took advantage of the  China build out  hype and pumped strategic commodities This time around  a different mole has popped up and it is not one that the commodity gurus and gold bugs favor as it leverages the deflationary pressures in many parts of the world  and contains commodity prices  But the money has to go somewhere and a stock market with a Goldilocks story of  just right  economic and policy conditions carries the day So in our twisted macro scenario  good is bad  Mediocre is good and bad will still be bad after the current phase passes  see Wrap Up for unsettling perspective on timing   Last week the economic numbers were biased positive and the Fed was on full Jawbone with Huey  Dooey and Louie speaking and the last FOMC minutes were released to boot  An over bought market running with the cult of easy money had a little case of the jitters That is because the financialized markets do not give a damn about what is good for their host countries or the average person  They are fixated on big mouth bankers in high places who feel they have the right to use monetary magic tricks to direct how the rest of us proceed with our financial affairs  They have withdrawn our free market in favor of something they manage as if it were just another government agency overseeing a given area for the public good  It is FrankenMarket and it does not want what is good for America  it wants what is good for it At the end of last week some inconveniently strong economic data came in on the heels of the jawboning Fed  This paints a picture that puts the Fed in a position to have to answer the question  why are you taking yield from fixed income investors to reward risk takers with the Dow above 15 000 and the economy strengthening  The answer is that something of mocked up origins must be defended to the hilt because it was not born of natural means and its Achilles Heel lurks somewhere within the layers of leverage that have brought us to this point in a confusing macro backdrop  Here is a twisted picture of what the stock market wants to see continue US manufacturing activity is just right  It is going nowhere but is not declining impulsively  A question we might want to ask right here and now is how long will it keep up its lame growth if the dollar keeps appreciating A hard rise in the USD would croak the manufacturing sector  What happens then  a return to the China labor outsource arbitrage gimmick  That is waning as China s underpaid workers are slowly being converted to consumers with financial means Here are our bubbles du jour  with quick commentary as it is time to get on with this week s analysis Japan s Nikkei is a hockey stick Japan s Yen is a hockey stick flipped over Copper was once a hockey stick and has gone nowhere   subject to massive ups and downs  compliments of the financialized economy   since Crude oil was a hockey stick that got members of congress squabbling and hand wringing about how to control the evil speculators that drove the price up to such debilitating highs  remember  The bubble was actually compliments of Alan Greenspan s out of control credit policies  which I ll bet not one of those bozos sought to blame back then And finally  we have the silver hockey stick  which formed a huge blade right into the conclusion of the last inflationary phase and commodity blowout Bottom Line on the Games of Whack a Mole and HockeyWith the modern way of doing things  money is created and set free to go where it will go within the structure of the global economy  Sometimes its inflationary effects will pop up here and sometimes there  Early last decade it was freed up to create a commodity bubble that attached itself to the  China Story   which was itself a manifestation of the US China cooperative experiment in credit creation and consumer spending There is Paul Krugman  he of the respectable platforms at the New York Times and Princeton and there has been Larry Summers  he of the respectable platforms at the US Treasury and Harvard  There have been a thousand others throwing their hats into the ring  speaking intelligently as if they are anything but promoters of an unproductive system that issues credit and creates new money out of nowhere toward its ends It is not a natural economic path  There will be resolution to the hockey stick forming in the Nikkei  The US and other global markets that have launched rallies through inflationary monetary policy along with the Yen s fall should be affected as well  As we have shown each week  there has been a great wall of sentiment fueled rationalization erected as to why the new bull atmosphere is real and sustainable  Did the first brick pop out of that wall last week with the Nikkei s 7  plus decline in a day   The  anti bubble  is the hockey stick pointing downward toward hell that is the current view of most market participants toward an anchor to honest monetary systems  namely gold  Think about this for a moment  creators of paper and digital money  i e  credit  have got the global investment community eating out of their hands in service to asset speculation  in this case  equities  and in utter revulsion toward the anti market to all of this chicanery  gold ,2013-06-02,Gary Tanashian,https://www.investing.com/analysis/japanese-nikkei-is-the-latest-bubble-169425,169425
121308,342823,NYT,Corporate Profits Soar  Small Businesses  Income Stagnates,opinion,Americans have long seen small businesses as the heart and soul of their economy  but small firms have not fared well in recent years  Corporations  in contrast  seem to be on a roll  with profits and stock prices soaring to record highs  Is small business really in decline  and if so  what should we do about it First  some dataOne striking indication that small business is falling behind is the divergence between corporate profits and proprietors  income  The trend is evident in data  shown in the following chart  that were released last week by the Bureau of Economic Analysis It is true that the two series in the chart correspond only approximately to the popular distinction between big and small business  Proprietors  income includes the current income of unincorporated businesses that have the legal forms of proprietorships  partnerships  and tax exempt cooperatives  It does not perfectly match up with small firm size because some small firms are incorporated and some proprietorships  partnerships  and cooperatives are large  Also  proprietors  income is not  in an economic sense  a pure measure of the profits of small businesses  since it includes the imputed income of small business owners who live off the net proceeds of their enterprises without paying themselves a salary or interest on funds they have loaned to their firms Even given these caveats  though  the chart is strongly suggestive  It shows that corporate profits reached an all time high of 12 74 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2011  Although profits for Q1 2013 were down slightly to 12 30 percent of GDP  that is still higher than they had ever been before their peak of two years ago  Meanwhile  proprietors  income was up slightly to 7 9 percent of GDP  but it remains well below its all time high of 8 8 percent in 2004  Before the early 1990s  the two forms of income rarely differed by as much as two percent of GDP At the same time as corporate profits have risen faster than proprietors  income  large firms have been growing faster than small ones  The next two charts show total employment by firm size over the past twenty years  Naturally  if big business accounts for a growing share of employment  we would also expect it to account for a growing share of profits  However  a closer examinaton of the underlying data shows that the growing employment share of large firms explains only about half of the trend in the ratio of corporate profits to proprietors  income over the past twenty years  It seems that big businesses are not only growing in size  but are generating more profit per worker as they do so  So what ails small business  What exactly is behind the apparent stagnation of small business  One way to find out would be to ask small businesses themselves  That is something the National Federation of Independent Businesses does on a regular basis  The next chart  taken from the latest issue of the NFIB publication   shows that small business optimism has not fully rebounded from the low point reached in 2008  Four years into the recovery  it remains below its average for the past 30 years  The NFIB also reports what its members see as the single biggest problem facing their firms  Taxes top the list of complaints in the most recent survey  but that is nothing new  In fact  the share of small businesses listing taxes as their top problem has fallen over time  and is a bit lower now than it was late in the George W  Bush administration  Weak demand is another major complaint  but  after topping the list of problems in the depth of the recession  its importance  too  is falling  Competition from big business is still another worry  but only 8 percent of respondents listed it as the biggest problem The problem that is increasing most rapidly in perceived importance is regulation and red tape  Some 21 percent of respondents in the latest NFIB survey listed it as the single greatest problem  putting it just behind taxes  Small businesses complain about safety and environmental regulations  as they always have  but the big focus at present is on the possible effects of the Affordable Care Act  which will come into full force next year Some commentators  including Martin Neil Baily of the Brookings Institution  maintain that small business worries about the ACA are out of proportion to the content of the act itself  In recent   Baily pointed out that there are no requirements on businesses with fifty or fewer employees to provide insurance  nor are they required to pay a penalty if they do not provide it  Furthermore  he testified  90 percent of small businesses  accounting for 57 percent of employment in the sector  have fewer than 50 employees  while a high fraction of larger establishments are already providing health insurance to their workers Other studies  several cited   suggest that the ACA will help revitalize the small business sector by encouraging startups  The difficulty of getting health insurance in the individual market is a significant deterrent for people who would like to quit their job and undertake something new  Data now show that people are more likely to start their own new business if they have a spouse with a job that provides health insurance  Other data suggest that there is a big jump in start ups as people become eligible for Medicare  Still  despite these considerations  small business owners have legitimate concerns about the ACA  One is that the act gives low paid employees an incentive to drop out of employer sponsored health plans and buy subsidized policies on the soon to be created insurance exchanges  That could lead to higher premiums per worker for firms that already offer plans to their employees  Another concern is the fact that the ACA defines full time workers as those who work 30 hours a week or more  That may induce some small businesses to limit some workers to 29 hours per week  despite the administrative costs of dividing a given number of hours among more employees  A recent  article contends that some of these problems arise from ambiguous or carelessly drafted sections of the ACA of a kind that  in the past  would have been fixed by technical amendments  Today s polarized Congress  however  seems incapable of making such fixes even when members of both parties agree privately that they should  What should we do about it  What are the policy implications of the apparent decline of small business  In my view  the proper approach would be to level the playing field by ensuring that laws affect all firms equally regardless of size or legal form of organization  The tax system would be a good place to start  For the most part  owners of proprietorships and partnerships are taxed at personal income tax rates on both labor and capital income that they receive from their business activities  So are the owners of small businesses that qualify for Subchapter S corporate status  Taxation of other corporations is more complex and may result in rates that are either higher or lower than those for small businesses  Typically  corporate income is subject to double taxation  first as corporate profit when it is earned by the firm and then as individual income when owners receive it as dividends or capital gains  However  some corporations  including many of the largest  escape the corporate profits tax in whole or in part by taking advantage of various loopholes  Their owners then benefit further from preferential individual income tax rates on dividends and capital gains  The result is a combined rate for capital income from corporate sources that  even with double taxation  is often below the rate on ordinary income  As I have frequently argued  the best way to level the playing field for taxes on businesses of all types would be to abolish the corporate profits tax altogether and tax all capital income at ordinary rates when it is received by owners  Another reform that would go a long way toward leveling the playing field between large and small businesses would be once and for all to break the link between employment and health insurance  The current system of employer provided insurance is disadvantageous to small businesses in several ways  First  the tax advantages it provides for health coverage are more easily exploited by large firms than by small ones  Second  employer healthcare coverage is provided at group rates based on the average healthcare costs of a firms  employees  a system that inherently works better for large than for small groups  Third  the employer linked system makes it risky for employees with pre existing conditions to move from stable jobs at large employers to less certain employment at smaller firms  especially start ups  even if the jobs would otherwise be more attractive  Fourth  as mentioned earlier  the difficulties of finding affordable coverage in the individual health insurance market discourages corporate employees from leaving to start their own small firms  Other countries offer a variety of healthcare models that break the link between insurance and employment  These range from single payer systems to systems that provide guaranteed private coverage under community rating  that is  at a cost based on the average health expenses of the whole community  The ACA does not cleanly follow either of these alternatives  It contains some elements of guaranteed coverage and community rating for people in the market for individual insurance  but at the same time it leaves the old employer linked system largely intact  The result is likely to be preservation of the existing advantages to large firms while subjecting small firms to new uncertainties and regulatory burdens  There are better ways to provide universal healthcare than the ACA  Still  even leveling the playing field in areas like taxation and healthcare would not guarantee an end to recent trends that seem to signal a decline of small business  Globalization and technological change may inherently favor larger firms  If so  the trends in profitability and firm size may continue  If so  how much should we really worry  There seems little risk that small businesses will disappear altogether  They seem safe in the many markets where personal service and knowledge of local circumstances are the keys to success  Also  while technological change and globalization kill off some small firms  they create opportunities for others  whether they are software developers or small farmers catering to the demand for local organic produce  The bottom line  It probably is not necessary to consider the size distribution of firms per se as a policy objective  Rather   we should change tax  healthcare  and other policies that selectively serve the interests of the corporate sector  At that point we can expect any further change in the balance between large and small firms to be for the better  whichever direction it goes ,2013-06-03,Ed

Inside Mortgage Finance HousingPulse Tracking Survey  investors purchased 69  of  damaged  properties in April 2013  while first time home buyers accounted for only 16  of  damaged  purchases It is very well documented in these pages how home prices in the U S  economy are being driven upward by institutional investors  Affirming my stance on the U S  housing market  Suzanne Mistretta  an analyst at Fitch Rating Services  was quoted this week as saying    The  housing price  growth is being propelled by institutional money  The question is how much the change in prices really reflects

S  housing market that it plans to rent out Rising prices on homes in various pockets of the U S  housing market are a direct result of large institutional investors buying in Take Atlanta  for

I don t hold a very optimistic view on the U S  housing market for four very specific reasons  first time home buyers  desperately needed in any housing recovery  are missing from the action  investors who are buying homes to rent them are pushing prices higher  new homebuilder stocks are down 14  in the past month  according to the Dow Jones U S  Home Construction Index  and long term

return on their money  But institutional buying of American homes will not sustain a recovery in the U S  housing market We need the average American to be involved in the U S  housing market because he she provides liquidity and pushes up consumer spending  Increasing home prices right now don t mean the U S  housing market has recovered  actually  it s far from it when first time home buyers are

   Many Asian  European centres closed for Easter holiday
   Focus on how stocks fare as US bank results come in
 By Kaori Kaneko
 TOKYO  April 13  Reuters    The dollar edged up on the yen in
quiet trade on Monday  with many Asian and European financial
centres closed for the Easter holiday and as markets waited for
the U S  corporate earnings season to get into full swing 
 U S  banks including Goldman Sachs  JPMorgan and Citigroup
are set to report first quarter results this week  and traders
are keen to see how stock markets react to these earnings
reports 
 But after a relaxation of industry accounting standards 
analysts say it will be difficult to gauge losses from bad loans
in areas like real estate and consumer credit 
  Market participants generally stayed on the sidelines before
the U S  bank earnings and they are waiting for stocks  moves
following the results   said a dealer at a Japanese bank 
 Last week  the dollar rose against the yen  buoyed by a rally
in U S  shares after positive earnings guidance from U S  bank
Wells Fargo 
  If U S  earnings results show signs that the U S  is pulling
away from the worst of the economic downturn  risk appetite is
expected to grow  putting pressure on the yen   said Yoshihisa
Kanzaki  a currency dealer at Shinkin Central Bank 
 Others said the currency market has priced in positive U S 
earnings figures  so downward pressure on the yen could be
limited even if the results are better than expected  and the
market is more likely to swayed by negative surprises 
 The dollar was trading around 100 42 yen compared with 100 22
yen in late Tokyo trading on Friday  The U S  currency touched
101 45 yen last week  its highest in six months 
 The euro was quoted at  1 3168  a shade down from  1 3186 on
Friday when it also slipped to  1 3090  a level not seen since
mid March 
 Against the yen  the euro was flat at 132 26 yen  It climbed
to 137 42 yen last week  its highest in six months

 Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co  one of Japan s top nine life
insurers which hold a total of about  1 5 trillion in assets 
said it planned to increase currency hedged foreign bond holdings
by more than 200 billion yen   2 billion  this financial year to
next March and cut foreign stock holdings by 40 billion yen 
 The Australian dollar rose against both the dollar and yen
even though Australia s markets were closed and traders in Tokyo
said business was limited 
 The Aussie was up 0 5 percent at  0 7224 and rose above 73 00
yen  the highest since October  before falling back to 72 51 yen 
 Retail investors had likely picked up the higher yielding
Aussie on expectations Japanese stocks would open higher  giving
a lift to investor confidence  dealers said  but the Nikkei
average later fell 
 The Aussie has gained 2 percent against the dollar this year
and 13 percent against the yen as investor confidence has crept
back into the market and players have begun to look for yield 
 Australia last week cut its key cash rate by 0 25 basis
points to 3 0 percent  less than some had expected but still
higher than rates near zero in both Japan and the United States 
 Market players were also looking to developments in China
after a report the country was considering more stimulus steps 
 China is planning a new economic stimulus package targeted at
boosting consumption  the China Securities Journal reported 
citing an official of the State Information Center  which is
affiliated with the country s top planning agency 
 If China expands its economic measures  it would help
increase investor risk tolerance as a strong economic recovery in
China would help the global economy  traders said 
 The U S  Treasury Department is directing General Motors to
lay the groundwork for a bankruptcy filing by June 1  even though
the automaker has publicly stated it could reorganise outside of
court  the New York Times reported 
 The immediate impact of the GM report on the currency market
was limited but players will watch how U S  markets react to it
later in the session  dealers said 
 The market will also be watching U S  economic data 
including housing and labour market figures  as well as Chinese
gross domestic product data for the first quarter due this week

121337,342852,NYT,UPDATE 7 Freddie Mac CFO dies in apparent suicide police source,news," Firm no indication death linked to federal probes
  Executive was veteran in firm  key in accounting
  Kellermann was fun to work with ex colleague
  Suburban home known for holiday decorations
  Adds more details  quotes 
 By Deborah Charles
 RESTON  Va   April 22  Reuters    The finance chief of
troubled U S  mortgage giant Freddie Mac  David Kellermann  was
found dead on Wednesday after apparently committing suicide  a
police source said 
 Kellermann  who was promoted to acting chief financial
officer last September after the government took control of the
company and its sibling mortgage agency Fannie Mae  was found
hanging in the basement of his home in an affluent Washington
suburb at around 5 a m   0900 GMT  
 There was no indication what drove 41 year old Kellermann 
who was married and had a young daughter  to kill himself 
 Kellermann  a 16 year veteran of the firm  had played a key
role in helping it navigate past accounting scandals and answer
questions from regulators and investors who put the company
under intense scrutiny as a five year U S  housing market boom
ended in 2006 
 Last year s government take over came as Freddie Mac and
Fannie Mae  known as government sponsored enterprises  faced
deep losses and the effects of the U S  housing market crash
engulfed other financial institutions 
 Freddie Mac is currently being investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission  It has provided documents
in the probe and made employees available for interview in the
case  but neither the company nor the SEC have given details 
  Freddie Mac knows of no connections between this terrible
personal tragedy and the ongoing regulatory inquiries discussed
in our SEC filings   said Freddie Mac spokesman David Palombi 
 The current probe is far less intense than the drilling
several years ago after accounting and political fundraising
scandals  several Freddie Mac employees said 
  Back then  investigators took everthing  You d be lucky if
they left you re kids  pictures   said one long term employee 
 OUTGOING PERSONALITY
 There have been several high profile suicides of business
executives around the world in the last six months as the
financial crisis took hold  Former colleagues said Kellermann
and the accounting team had been under intense stress  although
Kellermann had an outgoing personality 
  He was not like some introverted recluse of some sort  
 said Byron Boston  chief investment officer at mortgage REIT
Dynex Capital  who was vice president and co manager of Freddie
Mac s mortgage portfolio group from 1997 to 2003   If you sat
and worked with him everyday  he was a fun guy  
 Fairfax County police officials would not confirm the
death as a suicide  but said police were called to Kellermann s
home in Reston before dawn and found him dead in the basement 
  We do not suspect foul play   said Fairfax County Police
spokesman Eddy Azcarate 
 In September  Kellermann was awarded a retention bonus of
 850 000 to be paid out over 18 months  Freddie Mac said 
 Kellermann hired a private security firm after reporters
came to his house to ask about his bonus several weeks ago when
there was a public outcry over compensation at companies that
have received government aid  the New York Times said 
 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had a hand in about half of the
entire U S  mortgage market and were taken over in an effort to
ward off further damage to the U S  housing market 
  From my understanding  he was working very  very hard  
Boston said of Kellermann   Accounting issues  the company gets
taken over by the government  it s just a complete mess  I
could just imagine what kind of pressure that would put on
you  
 While Freddie Mac has seen its executive ranks churn since
accounting improprieties first emerged in 2003 and as it has
booked multi billion dollar losses in recent quarters  those
who knew Kellermann spoke of his good character 
  For many years  we have known David as a person of the
utmost ethical standards who was hardworking and knowledgeable
in his field   the Federal Housing Finance Board  Freddie Mac s
chief regulator  said in a statement 
 Before taking over as acting CFO  Kellermann had been
senior vice president  corporate controller and principal
accounting officer 
 BOW TIES  CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS
 He was known as a cheerful personality around the office
with a light hearted manner  Former colleagues said he
sometimes wore a bow tie or nautical themed trousers to work 
 He volunteered in the community with a charity for the
homeless  He was married  and the couple had a daughter who
neighbors said is aged about 5 or 6 
  They were the last people in the world you d think this
would happen to   said Susan Unger  who lives across the street
from the Kellermanns in the Hunter Mills Estates of
million dollar homes 
 Unger and her husband said the Kellermanns were known on
the street for having the fanciest Christmas decorations  They
even decorated their sprawling brick house for Halloween and
with hearts for Valentine s Day 
 Freddie Mac s interim chief executive  John Koskinen 
visted the Kellermann home on Wednesday morning and later
addressed employees  encouraging them to take time off if they
needed to grieve  Freddie delayed for at least one day the
routine sale of new notes 
 The executive s death is just the most recent of several
recent blows to Freddie Mac  whose chief executive David
Moffett resign in March after just seven months on the job 
 Kellermann s death followed several high profile suicides
in the global financial crisis 
 German billionaire businessman Adolf Merckle threw himself
in front of a train in January after heavy losses on the stock
market 
 Frenchman Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet  co founder of
money manager Access International  slit his wrists with

121338,342853,NYT,ANALYSIS Could legalizing immigrants improve U S  economy ,news,"By Tim Gaynor
 PHOENIX  April 27  Reuters    If the United States under
President Barack Obama grants legal status to its 12 million
illegal immigrants  most of them Hispanics  would it prove a
net gain or a drain for the beleaguered U S  economy 
 Immigration  particularly what to do about illegal
immigrants  is a hot button issue in the United States 
Immigration advocates say illegal immigrants do jobs Americans
won t  Critics say they depress wages and drain resources 
 There is disagreement over whether giving legal immigration
status to people now in the United States illegally would sap
hard pressed federal  state and local coffers  as people who
oppose legalization say  or boost tax revenues and unleash a
pent up spending spree by the immigrants  as advocates argue 
 Hispanics are the largest and fastest growing minority in
the United States  accounting for around 15 percent of a U S 
population of some 300 million people  An estimated fifth of
them are in the country illegally 
 Compared to multibillion dollar financial bailouts and a
nearly trillion dollar economic stimulus package signed by
Obama in February amid the ongoing recession  analysts say the
economic costs or gains from legalization are relatively
small 
  A lot of this conversation about economics has to do with
the political optics   said Marc Rosenblum  a senior analyst
with the Migration Policy Institute think tank in Washington
that examines international immigration issues 
  Immigrants are still a small proportion of the U S 
economy  and it s not going to make or break the U S  economic
recovery or the recession  whether or not we do legalization  
Rosenblum added 
 The most recent attempt to get immigration legislation
through the U S  Congress failed in 2007 amid an acrimonious
public debate about what critics called  amnesty  for millions
of illegal immigrants and opposition from many Republican
lawmakers in the U S  Congress 
 The New York Times reported this month that Obama plans to
start addressing immigration this year  including a search for
a path to legal status for illegal immigrants  The Times said
Obama would speak publicly about the matter in May with an eye
toward possible legislation as early as the fall 
  NOT AN EASY ISSUE 
  We know this is not an easy issue   White House press
secretary Robert Gibbs said this month 
  I think we understand that in order to get immigration
reform through Congress and to the president s desk  it s going
to take a healthy bipartisan majority   Gibbs added 
 When immigration legislation was debated in 2007  the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that
legalizing illegal immigrants would add  48 billion to federal
revenues over 10 years  That move also would prompt  23 billion
in direct public spending  mostly on refundable tax credits and
the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor  it said 
 Lawmakers in Arizona opposed to legalization question the
math showing a net financial gain from giving legal status to
illegal immigrants  They argue granting citizenship to mostly
low wage immigrants would have a crushing effect on the state 
which borders Mexico and has about 500 000 illegal immigrants 
  They re costing us in Arizona billions a year and that s
when they are getting hardly any benefits   said John Kavanagh 
a Republican state representative 
 Scott Smith  mayor of the Phoenix suburb of Mesa 
disagrees  He said changing the laws could mean additional tax
dollars for his cash strapped city  and a reduction in the
money spent on budget busting items such as policing illegal
immigration 
  NO DOUBT 
  There s no doubt that the disorder in the immigration
system creates a huge cost   Smith said 
 The spending power of U S  Hispanics more than quadrupled
since 1990  according to a 2006 University of Georgia study 
although advocates and critics of reform dispute the economic
impact of legalization 
  Whatever gain there is     it s so small they can barely
measure it  It comes by increasing the supply of unskilled
workers and lowering the wages of the least educated
native born workers   said Steven Camarota  research director
of the Center for Immigration Studies think tank  which opposes
legalization for illegal immigrants 
 Legalization advocates say giving legal status to illegal
immigrant workers would raise wages by preventing businesses
that use poorly paid illegal labor from undercutting
competitors that do not use illegal labor and consequently bear
higher employee costs from wages and benefits 
 They also say granting legal status would trigger an
increase in spending by immigrants 
  The first thing I would do would be to buy my daughters a
home of their own   said Samuel Roldan  33  an illegal
immigrant from Guatemala who has been working in Phoenix under
constant fear of deportation for more than a decade 
 For Joan Dodd  a Phoenix real estate agent with more than
three decades on the job  having a larger pool of qualified
buyers    as some people who are currently illegal immigrants
could become    would be welcome in tough times 
  There are lots of people now who are living as renters who
would love to be homeowners if they had a path   Dodd said   As
long as they could qualify and had a job history  I think it
would be helpful in many of our areas of town that are so

121339,342854,NYT,Obama says financial sector to shrink in US economy,news,"  Financial sector to be smaller in U S  economy Obama
   New rules to build in U S  financial system Obama
 By Jeff Mason
 WASHINGTON  May 2  Reuters    The financial sector will
make up a smaller part of the U S  economy in the future as new
regulations clamp down on  massive risk taking   President
Barack Obama said in an interview published on Saturday 
 Obama  whose young administration has spearheaded a raft of
reforms in the banking sector as part of efforts to tackle the
financial crisis  said the industry s role in the United States
would look different at the end of the current recession 
  What I think will change  what I think was an aberration 
was a situation where corporate profits in the financial sector
were such a heavy part of our overall profitability over the
last decade   he said told the New York Times Magazine 
  Part of that has to do with the effects of regulation that
will inhibit some of the massive leveraging and the massive
risk taking that had become so common  
 Obama said some of the job seekers who may normally have
gone to the financial sector would shift to other areas of the
economy  such as engineering 
  Wall Street will remain a big  important part of our
economy  just as it was in the  70s and the  80s  It just won t
be half of our economy   he said 
  We don t want every single college grad with mathematical
aptitude to become a derivatives trader  
 The Obama administration in March proposed sweeping reforms
to curb risk taking on Wall Street and close regulatory gaps to
prevent the kind of excesses that led to the worst financial
crisis since the 1930s Great Depression 
 The president said in the interview that better regulation
would help restore confidence in the U S  financial system 
  A more vigorous regulatory regime  I think  will help
restore confidence  and you re still going to see a lot of
global capital wanting to park itself in the United States   he
said 
 REGAINING TRUST AND CONFIDENCE
 Obama expressed optimism that the market for securitized
products would pick up  though he said that could take time 
 The Federal Reserve  with taxpayer capital from the U S 
Treasury  is supporting consumer and real estate lending
markets through a loan facility that could reach  1 trillion 
 Holders of existing asset backed and commercial
mortgage backed securities can get loans from the Fed by
putting up their securities as collateral 
 The facility aims to unclog frozen credit markets and
jumpstart securitization 
  We re going to have to determine whether or not as a
consequence of some of the steps that the Fed has been taking 
the Treasury has been taking  that we see the market for
securitized products restored   Obama said 
  I m optimistic that ultimately we re going to be able to
get that part of the financial sector going again  but it could
take some time to regain confidence and trust  
 Part of Obama s regulatory reforms include the creation of
a new  systemic risk regulator  with broad powers to seize
large non bank financial firms  such as insurers  hedge funds
or private equity companies  if they are deemed to threaten the
stability of the financial system 
 Large   systemically important  firms would be required to
hold bigger capital cushions 
 Obama also said financial rules should be crafted according
to what an institution actually does to avoid a regulatory gap
in areas such as commercial and investment banking 
  Other countries that have not seen some of the problems in
their financial markets that we have nevertheless don t
separate between investment banks and commercial banks   he
said  citing Canada as one example in that area 
  The experience in a country like Canada would indicate
that good  strong regulation that focuses less on the legal
form of the institution and more on the functions that they re
carrying out is probably the right approach to take

121340,342855,NYT,Obama economic panel moves into the spotlight,news,"  Volcker  other panel members to discuss energy issues
   Wall Street keenly interested in Volcker s role
   Obama s  green jobs  proposals to top meeting agenda
 By Caren Bohan
 WASHINGTON  May 20  Reuters    A high level panel of
experts that has been helping to shape U S  President Barack
Obama s response to the economic crisis will step into the
public view on Wednesday at a meeting to discuss energy issues
and job creation 
 Obama announced the creation of the 16 member Economic
Recovery Advisory Board  led by former Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker  in February  but its work had been entirely
behind the scenes 
 Wednesday s meeting  scheduled for 10 a m  1400 GMT  will
be open to the media and carried via a live video stream on the
White House website  It is the first of what are expected to be
quarterly meetings by the board 
 Topping the meeting agenda is Obama s proposal to create
 green jobs  in sectors of the economy aimed at developing
cleaner energy sources 
 Volcker s role in advising Obama is of keen interest to
many on Wall Street  where the 81 year old former central
banker remains a towering figure known for breaking the back of
runaway inflation during the 1980s 
 Volcker has continued to weigh in on public policy matters
since leaving the Fed in 1987  He was a key adviser to Obama
during the campaign and speaks frequently with White House
officials on financial regulatory and other issues 
 But he has vented some frustration to associates about his
level of access within the White House economic power center 
 Obama s inner circle on economic policy consists of
National Economic Council director Lawrence Summers  a former
Treasury secretary  current Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner  Christina Romer  chairwoman of the Council of
Economic Advisers  and Austan Goolsbee  a longtime Obama
adviser who sits on the Council of Economic Advisers and is
also chief of staff on the Volcker economic recovery panel 
  TEAM OF RIVALS 
 Some refer to the group as  team of rivals  because it
consists of high powered people who bring varying perspectives
and personal styles 
 In an interview with the New York Times magazine published
this month  Obama said his economic team is marked by  an
appreciation of complexity  
 He described Volcker as  somebody who has enormous
influence over my thinking  and someone who can provide
 counterbalance  in discussions 
 The economic recovery panel  which includes Democrats and
Republicans and people from business  academia  public policy
and labor union backgrounds  is intended to give Obama some
outside perspective on economic issues 
  The purpose of the board is not to work inside the White
House  but to bring a diverse set of perspectives and voices
from different parts of the country and different sectors of
the economy to bear in the formulation and evaluation of
economic policy   White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said 
 She said the members of the panel have been conducting
their own analysis to prepare for the discussion of energy
issues 
 On Tuesday  Obama ordered the struggling auto industry to
make more fuel efficient cars under tough new standards to cut
emissions and increase gas mileage 
 The president is also seeking action on Capitol Hill on a
climate change bill aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other
pollutants  The bill would establish a  cap and trade  system
that would gradually reduce the amount of greenhouse gases
industrial companies could emit ",2009-05-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/obama-economic-panel-moves-into-the-spotlight-56079,56079
121341,342856,NYT,Europe stocks inch lower  banks  insurers retreat,news,"  FTSEurofirst down 0 1 pct after dipping below  08 close
   Drugmakers gain  GlaxoSmithKline up on deal news
   Banking  insurance shares lose ground
 
 By Atul Prakash
 LONDON  June 23  Reuters    European equities inched lower
by midday on Tuesday after falling sharply in the previous
session  with weaker banks and insurers outpacing positive
pharmaceutical and automobile stocks 
 Investors traded cautiously on worries that a recovery in
the global economy could take longer than expected  Analysts
said that the market has paused for a breather following an
impressive rally after hitting a record low in early March 
 At 1118 GMT  the pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top
shares was down 0 1 percent at 836 61 points after briefly
falling below the 2008 close of 831 97 points  But it is still
up about 30 percent since hitting a lifetime low in March 
 Financial shares were among top decliners on the index  with
Standard Chartered  Barclays  Lloyds  Societe Generale and
Credit Agricole down 1 1 3 9 percent 
 However  UBS jumped 3 5 percent after the New York Times
reported the U S  Justice Department may drop a case aimed at
forcing the Swiss bank to reveal the names of 52 000 wealthy
American clients suspected of tax evasion 
  There is nervousness around the market and these sorts of
pullbacks and volatility are likely to continue   said Henk
Potts  equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers in London 
  The market needs tangible proof that the economic data is
truly getting better   he added 
 The market continued to get mixed economic indicators  Key
surveys showed that a recovery from a severe recession in the
euro zone s services sector stalled in June as consumers
remained nervous  but factories fared better 
 A Chinese central bank official said that the country s
economy was headed in the right direction  but the foundations
of the recovery were not yet solid  adding to a chorus of voices
cautioning against expectations of a rapid rebound from the
global crisis 
 The U S  unemployment rate    at 9 4 percent  already its
highest in about 25 years    is likely to hit 10 percent in the
next couple of months  a White House spokesman said on Monday 
  After the massive three month rally that sent all major
indexes significantly higher  we are now in the middle of the
long awaited pullback   Close Brothers Seydler said in a note 
  Market participants start to realise that the recovery in
the economy and earnings is unlikely to be as strong as the rise
in stock prices since early March  
 
 INSURERS DOWN  PHARMA UP 
 Insurers also lost ground  with Swiss Life  Legal and
General  Aegon and Prudential down 1 9 5 8 percent 
 Drugmakers advanced  however  with AstraZeneca  Merck 
Novartis and Shire all up 1 2 5 percent 
 GlaxoSmithKline rose 1 8 percent  The company has signed a
deal with Chroma Therapeutics  giving it access to the unlisted
British biotech company s experimental compounds for
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 
 Automakers were also higher  BMW  Daimler AG  Porsche 
Volkswagen AG and Peugeot were up 0 4 3 1 percent 
 Shares in Anglo American fell 1 3 percent after the mining
group rejected a merger proposal from rival Xstrata  Xstrata
shares fell 1 3 percent 
 Anglo American trimmed some early losses after dealers cited
market talk of bid interest from China s state owned Chinalco  A
Chinalco spokesman in Shanghai said the company was unaware of
the bid talk  while Anglo American declined to comment 
 Later in the day  investors will focus on U S  housing data
at 1400 GMT 
 Eyes will also be on the U S  Federal Reserve central bank 
whose Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  begins its two day
meeting on interest rate policy

121342,342857,NYT,Public Debt And Economic Growth,opinion,In the election of 1952 my father voted for Dwight Eisenhower  When I asked him why he explained that  FDR s debt  was still burdening the economy   and that I and my children and my grandchildren would be paying it down for as long as we lived  I was only six years old and had no idea what a  debt  was  let alone FDR s  But I had nightmares about it for weeks  Yet as the years went by my father stopped talking about  FDR s debt   and since I was old enough to know something about economics I never worried about it  My children have never once mentioned FDR s debt  My four year old grandchild hasn t uttered a single word about it  By the end of World War II  the national debt was 120 percent of the entire economy  But by the mid 1950s  it was half that  Why did it shrink  Not because the nation stopped spending  We had a Korean War  a Cold War  we rebuilt Germany and Japan  sent our GI s to college and helped them buy homes  expanded education at all levels  and began constructing the largest public works program in the nation s history   the interstate highway system   FDR s debt  shrank in proportion to the national economy because the national economy grew so fast  I was reminded of this by the recent commotion over an error in a  by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff  The two Harvard economists had analyzed a huge amount of data from the United States and other advanced economies linking levels of public debt to economic growth  They concluded that growth turns negative  that is  economies tend to collapse into recession  when public debt rises above 90 percent of GDP  That finding  in turn  fueled austerics  who insisted that the budget deficit  and debt  had to be cut in order to revive economic growth  But Reinhart and Rogoff s computations were wrong  and average GDP growth in very high debt nations is around 2 2 percent rather than a negative 0 1 percent  A few days ago  the two offered a defense in an  in the New York Times  asserting  very small actual differences  between their critics  results and their own  Regardless  Reinhart and Rogoff seem to be correct in one basic respect  Economic growth does seem to be lower in very high debt countries  But the entire debate over their paper s flaws begs the central question of cause and effect  Is growth lower because of the high debt  That would still make the austeric s case  even without the magic 90 percent tipping point  Or does cause and effect the other way around  Maybe slow growth makes debt burdens larger  There s  to suggest this is the case  If so  government should be fueling growth through  say  spending    at least in the short run  As we should have learned from what happened to  FDR s debt   growth is the key ,2013-04-30,Robert B.

121343,342858,NYT,James Dines  Another Commodity Crash Prediction ,opinion,When the metals markets tumbled in mid April  The Gold Report reached out to  the original investor bug  and author of The Dines Letter  James Dines  for perspective  He predicted a crash in commodity prices two years ago based on his analysis of a weak Chinese economy  Next  he says  will be a bond market bust once interest rates start to climb  This will lead to  a stampede to get out of bonds like a herd of elephants attempting to exit through a revolving door   How can investors protect themselves  That is Dinesism  38   The Gold Report  What does it mean that leading stock market averages have been in Uptrends  while commodities markets are in Downtrends   James Dines  Our  Sell  signal on China s economy in The Dines Letter  TDL  of Sept  16  2011  is still stubbornly resisted by the mainstream press  which instead persists in calling for 7 5  growth by China Since we perceive China as a barometer for the commodities markets  it followed that there would be a decline in raw materials prices   We find it astonishing that we seem to be the only voice in the world s mainstream press calling commodities markets in the last two years  a crash   Cotton down 70  from its high is merely one example  It s not in the world s headlines yet  but we find it remarkable that virtually all commodities are down  worldwide  even including precious metals  oil  uranium and rare earths  How could leading market averages be in Uptrends  presumably forecasting a business upturn  even while commodities have plunged  After all  to market things  they need to be made  with commodities  do they not  China was the biggest consumer of commodities  so we infer China s economy is in trouble  especially its banks and real estate  as predicted in our 2013 Annual Forecast Issue  pages 26 29  also The Dines Letter of Mar 15  2013  page 7   So our next  Buy  signal on China will be crucial in attempting to discern the cyclical advent of the next raw materials upturn   Because of excessive government interference with interest rates  those desperate for income including pension funds have pushed prices of virtually all secure sources to nosebleed heights  When the Fed eventually does raise interest rates  the bond bubble will be pricked and the stampede to get out of bonds should be like a herd of elephants attempting to exit through a revolving door  What to do in such a bond market crisis  Aside from TDL s blue chip recommendations  we always recommend dispersing assets in several  friendly  countries  Also  diversifying in golds and silvers  including Saint Gaudens double eagle gold coins  rather than just keeping capital entirely in fiat currencies   The world is in what we call  The Second Great Depression   comparable with the first one  in the 1930s  As laid out in my final business book   Goldbug    doubling the money supply in 1922 to pay for World War I caused a great inflation that after 1929 was corrected by the First Great Depression  in the 1930s  The similar printing of enormous quantities of paper money  not backed by anything except more paper  has also resulted in the current Great Deflation  still deepening  worldwide  The soup kitchens of the 1930s have been replaced by food stamps  but the resemblance is not coincidental   Realizing that Keynesian economics failed to end unemployment after the 1932 crash  until World War II began around 1940  enabled us to predict with specific clarity that it would not work these days either  Indeed  Historically  large quantities of printing press money has failed to reduce the downward trend of Americans with jobs in recent years  Few believed our prediction of  The Coming End of the Age of Jobs   or that it would lead to  The Coming New Social Order   but it is already unfolding  Unemployment in Europe already ranges between 20  and 50   depending   It is difficult for investors to protect themselves in this situation  but we cover it as best we can  We have recommended blue chip stocks that have a dividend yield higher than that of U S  Treasury paper  because they are proxies for institutions seeking to park their cash in areas other than overpriced bonds  That should end when the Federal Reserve finally allows interest rates to rise  but its fanaticism in continuing to suppress rates despite the Keynesian method not working represents a triumph of hope over experience and will not end well   Especially shocking is the delusion that adding inflation to a deflation would somehow cancel each other out  but is in fact the futile attempt to cure a problem with its cause  Overprinting paper runs at increasing risk of an eructation of  hyperinflation  please note it is a word not used anywhere in the mainstream press these days  Predicting a hyperinflation is so daring in today s environment that we might be mistaken  so we will have to get closer toward the end game to be more confident of it  We hope we are mistaken   TGR  What will be the next big sector   JD  We refer you to Dinesism  38  of the 65 that guides our methodology   Rich or poor it s good to have a lot of cash   And you may feel free to quote us on that  Also  parking some long term capital in gold and silver  especially during pullbacks  would be useful if a hyperinflation eructs   James Dines is legendary for having made correct forecasts that were in complete contradiction to the rest of the financial community  He is the author of five highly regarded books  including  Goldbug    in addition to his popular newsletter  The Dines Letter  and videotaped educational series  Dines  highly successful investment strategies have been praised by Barron s  Financial Times  Forbes

121344,342859,NYT,Investing And The Restructuring of Global Economies,opinion,The world is changing because it must change  When the unemployment rate hits 27 percent  as it now stands in Spain  something more is going on than just a business cycle Unemployment is also above 27 percent in Greece  In Italy  the unemployment rate is close to 12 percent  In France  the unemployment rate is above 10 percent  The employment problems in these countries are not just cyclical  they are structural The same for the United States  Although the unemployment rate in the United States is under 8 percent  the startling figure concerning the U S  labor market is that the labor participation rate has dropped below 64 percent  a figure not reached since the latter part of the 1970s when women were not as big a part of the workforce as they are now These structural forces are causing divisions between countries as the world tries to recover from the Great Recession and more  Angela Merkel  German Chancellor   highlights eurozone divisions   The unemployment rate in Germany is 5 4 percent But  as we know  the utilization of capital in the western world tends to be lower now  for this stage in the business cycle  that at any other time in the past fifty years  Western countries are not only not using the human capital that is available  it is not using the physical capital it possesses  The competitiveness of the eurozone is an issue that comes up over and over again Phillip Stephens writes in the Financial Times about The New Deal for Europe  More Reform  Less Austerity   High unemployment in Europe is not just a reflection of recession  It often mirrors ossified labor markets that lock out young people and discourage investment and innovation  But he also goes on to talk about the problem in the pension area  Additionally  there is the education and training shortfall  The infrastructure is not up to date  And  then there is always the problem in many areas of Europe of political corruption and unworkable governmental bureaucracies The problem for politicians is that these are long run problems  they are not problems that are going to be achieved in the near future  And  that is where the austerity issue also comes into play  Almost everyone seems to believe that government deficits must come down  However  trying to bring the deficits down in the short run can just exacerbate the problem  Most countries in Europe that have attempted to reduce their budget deficits have found that due to the slower growth that results their budget deficits have actually increased So many politicians act according to the quote attributed to John Maynard Keynes   In the long run we are all dead   To the politicians  if they focus on the long run  they fail to get re elected  Thus  the time horizon for a politician is the next election But  this is where money comes into play  Politicians also need money to get re elected and to live  the good life   In some areas of Europe  getting money from constituents is just  business as usual   So there are a lot of structural issues that must be dealt with and  in most cases  these issues do not have easy solutions These issues  however  will produce some kind of results   one way or another   because the world always moves into the future  Even the political corruption issues cannot continue to be ignored  For an insight into this issue check out the book review by Janet Maslin in the New York Times headlined   Formatting a World With No Secrets   which deals with the book  The New Digital Age  The important point is that these structural problems are going to have to be dealt with  Education and training are going to be done differently  How much can on line courses help resolve the issue  Do we continue to need massive universities and public school systems to educate the masses  Are public and private pension systems on the verge of massive changes But  what about our financial system  If the commercial banking system of the United States  which at present provides about fifty percent of the credit to the US economy  becomes a smaller and smaller contributor  what is going to happen to the financial structure of the country What about the natural gas revolution that is taking place  How is this going to impact utilities  manufacturing firms  and the infrastructure  And  there are the changes taking place in the health system  The health system has constantly been a laggard in the use of information technology  This is changing rapidly and everything I read about this the  revolution  here is going to change how we are treated  how we benefit from the new associations being created in the health field  and  I am told  these changes are going to increase our ability to deal with sickness  old age  and quality of life The story can go on and on  This re structuring is going to create a large number of investment opportunities  However  these opportunities are not going to be short term opportunities  These opportunities are going to be of the longer term type because they involve major changes in the way America  Europe  and the world  do business Editor s Note  This is the first of a series addressing the implications of profound changes underway in both the domestic and global economies  Future business success will require entrepreneurs to foresee the impacts of these changes and steer their firms accordingly Discalimer  All data and information provided on this site is for informational purposes only  Capital Matters makes no representations

121345,342860,NYT,Does JP Morgan  Love That Dirty Money  ,opinion,If those in my beloved hometown of Boston  love that dirty water   then similarly current management at my last stop on the sell side of Wall Street  that being JP Morgan  seem to  love that dirty money   The filth and stench surrounding this story runs so high as to have recently influenced JPM s bedmates   er  I mean regulators   to pronounce that they   Wow  That s saying something  We know that only 1 in 5 in America trust our banks  down from 1 in 2 a mere 5 plus years ago   but for regulators to now voice their distrust in JPM s management is a cry from the bedroom not often heard  What s going on at JPM  Let s navigate  We now learn about another JP Morgan whistleblower who has paid the ultimate price  JPM s questionable dealings in the electricity market  money laundering  and so much more as  exposes the bank s devotion to fighting the flow of dirty money  Bring the waders and let s move downstream  First stop  let s meet Jennifer Sharkey  In the summer of 2009  Jennifer Sharkey was moving in select company  As a Manhattan based vice president at JPMorgan Chase   Co  s Private Wealth Management group  she juggled relationships with 75  high net worth  clients with assets totaling more than half a billion dollars  Things changed for her  she claims  after she raised doubts about a  suspect  foreign client who had millions stashed in various accounts at the bank  The client was   according to a lawsuit Sharkey is pursuing in federal court in Manhattan  She also found evidence  her suit claims  that the client had falsified financial statements for one of his companies and that he d been involved in the  unexplained disappearance  of millions of dollars in merchandise in another venture  After she warned high level bank officials that the client might be involved in fraud and money laundering  her suit claims  JPMorgan moved to silence her   pressuring her to stop raising questions about the client  assigning her other clients to junior colleagues and  finally  firing her  Seemingly standard treatment for a whistleblower  Moving right along     In 2011  the bank paid nearly  90 million to settle regulators  claims that it had  against Iran  Cuba and other countries under U S  embargoes  In January  a consent order from JPMorgan s main federal regulator  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  cited the bank for    in its anti money laundering controls  including inadequate procedures for monitoring transactions at foreign branches  JPMorgan and other major banks have increased their risks and rewards in the offshore world by weaving a web of branches and subsidiaries across places that have been tagged as havens for financial secrecy and criminal activity  A 2008 U S  government report found JPMorgan had 50 subsidiaries in Bermuda  the Bahamas and other places labeled as tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions  tied for 11th highest among the 100 largest U S  companies  Since then the bank has expanded its reach in some offshore centers  Its tally of subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands grew from seven in 2007 to 20 at the end of 2012    Over that span its subsidiaries in Mauritius   a tiny isle off Africa s eastern coast that s been called  a Cayman Islands to India    grew from eight to 14  When the topics surrounding Madoff  Enron  and manipulation of electricity markets are broached  once again JP Morgan is prominently displayed  The bank held as much as  5 5 billion in Madoff connected cash and  according to court filings by Picard  earned an estimated half billion dollars from fees and other revenues generated by Madoff s billions  Any concerns within the bank about Madoff  were suppressed as the drive for fees and profits became a substitute for common sense  ethics and legal obligations   Picard s lawsuit said  As Enron s primary banker  did JP Morgan learn a thing or two about manipulating electricity markets  Then how to explain that  Investigators from the agency that regulates power markets have found a unit of JPMorgan Chase   Co manipulated trading in the California and Michigan electricity markets  the New York Times reported  in what would be the latest government crackdown on trading abuses in the markets  The newspaper said it reviewed a confidential  70 page government document that was sent to JPMorgan in March and that also criticized Blythe Masters  the bank s current head of global commodities and former chief financial officer  How does all this come to pass  Actually very easily  When bankers own the politicians and regulators they will push the envelope as far as they possibly can  When revenue streams in other books of business decline  then the questionable activities and double digit returns within the dirty money are accentuated  As was then  is now  and forever shall be UNLESS and UNTIL the pols and the regulators are forced out of the bankers  bedroom  I can only chuckle thinking that JP Morgan s chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon is stealing a page from Washington s handbook and will try to shovel away a lot of this dirt by soon hosting a town meeting with the junior staff of the OCC  What a joke  If they took out the banking systems and put in sewing machines  the Department of Health would likely shut the place down ,2013-05-07,Larry

121346,342861,NYT,Winds Of Change  Energy,opinion,In my last post I wrote about all the economic re structuring that is taking place  Even though economic growth remains relatively tepid  changes are taking place in the economy that are going to dominate the future when the economy fully adjusts Maybe one of the reasons that the economy is growing so slowly is that the economy is going through a transition phase  like in the 1930s  where resources have to be re allocated and re structured in order for the economy to take off once again That is  resources are mis located now relative to what is happening in the economy  For the economy to pick up its full head of steam  resources have to be re aligned to fit what the economy is evolving into not what it was  Economic policies that attempt to put resources especially labor back into the jobs they historically held just doesn t work Therefore  as I mentioned in the previous post  this re structuring is creating tremendous opportunities for investment  But  one has to change ones perspective and not focus on what was  This is why I found the recent article on the future of energy by Clifford Krauss in the New York Times so refreshing  The title to the article  to me  says it all   By 2023  A Changed World in Energy   If you could close your eyes for just a moment like Rip Van Winkle  and blink them open in 2023  you might see a very different energy world Electric cars may be popular  Solar energy could be cheap enough that millions of households and businesses deploy solar panels to generate their power needs  Fossil fuels will probably still dominate  but most trucks and many trains could run on natural gas rather than more polluting diesel  And the United States could be a major oil exporter  And  the miraculous change   a country on the path to becoming energy independent  a hopelessly quixotic quest only a decade ago  Newly prolific oil fields in North Dakota and Texas are expanding domestic production to levels not seen in a generation  The United States has suddenly become a net exporter of gasoline and diesel fuel  And it is looking for new markets for natural gas as well  new drilling technologies have allowed domestic production to soar over the last five years  causing a glut and price slump  Krauss quotes energy expert Daniel Yergin   When it comes to energy  the rule of the game is to expect the unexpected  So much effort is going into research  development and innovation all across the energy spectrum  10 years from now we may well see the next game changer  All this  to me  spells opportunity  I don t have space to go through all the possible changes that Krauss writes about in his article  They are mind boggling  The point is that there are so many things going on in the energy field that it is hard to know exactly what the future is going to look like In terms of macroeconomic impacts  however  there are several things that look to be pretty clear  First  the demand for energy in the United States is growing  but rather slowly  The output of energy in the United States is exploding  Think of the implications this has for the US economy  Think about how this will change spending patterns In the rest of the world demand is going to be expanding very rapidly  And  what do analysts see The International Energy Agency has recently published its World Energy Outlook  which included the prediction that  the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world s top oil producer by 2017  and North America will become a net exporter by around 2030  As imports of oil and other energy sources declines and exports increase  the United States balance of payments becomes a major contributor to economic growth  not a drain The world is going through a period of transition  Resources are being re allocated  The primary resource  human capital  is going to have to go through a major re structuring in the process  Education and training will have to be adjusted to meet the needs of the future One sees more and more studies on how the American work force is bifurcating between the more educated and the less educated  Floyd Norris discuses this bifurcation in his recent article  Wage Disparity Continues to Grow   Those with educations are doing much better than those with less education  And  the median income continues to remain roughly constant  However  the lower end of the income spectrum continues to fall behind How can you have a better situation for the creation of opportunities  It appears as if everything seems to be moving in the right direction in the United States in terms of energy and energy resources  And  the financial resources are finding their way into these areas enhancing research and development  The expansion in this area creates all the right incentives for innovation So where do you find the opportunities In the natural gas area  In biofuels  Conversion of power plants from coal to combustible gas coming from converted coal  Electric cars  Changing cars and trucks and trains from oil and diesel oil to liquefied natural gas  A growth in renewable sources of energy coming from new and more efficient power generation where solar energy panels and wind conversion innovations make much greater contributions  And so on and so forth This is where I show my long term optimism relative to my short run pessimism  Unfortunately  I see the world bogged down with its emphasis on short run solutions  To me  these short run solutions slow down the transition and help to postpone the arrival of the new structure  By focusing just on short run solutions the world actually hurts those less educated because it prevents them from adapting to the new reality In all of this  however  there is great opportunity  However  we must focus on what is needed in the future and not what will help us retain the past  This is also were smart investing will help us to achieve that future In economic re structuring there are lots and lots of opportunities  Even in the area of human capital  why do we need to wait on the government  How many private universities have evolved in the last ten years  In many places community colleges are thriving  If there is still a gap try and find out who is trying to fill the gap  If you can t find anyone trying to fill the gap you see why don t you try and get something going The point is  there is something terrific going on in the energy space in the United State  Going even further  there is something terrific going on in quite a few areas in the United States  When major transitional movements that impact an economy periodically are creating momentum all sorts of good things are available  But don t focus on what the industry was look to where the sector is going  Look for what is happening and invest in them Editor s Note  This is the first of a series addressing the implications of profound changes underway in both the

121347,342862,NYT,Winds Of Change In Banking,opinion, Another Executive Leaves JPMorgan  reads the headline of the business section in the New York Times  The question is  what is going on at JPMorgan Chase  JPM  The timing of this last leaving is raising questions  The latest major departure is Frank Bisignano  the co chief operating officer  The questions are about the status of Jamie Dimon  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of JPMorgan  the  persistent executive turnover   and the up coming board meeting where a debate is raging about whether or not Mr  Dimon should hold both top positions To me  there are two reasons for the recent departure events  First  Mr  Dimon is in control and he does not like what has happened inside JPMorgan over the past two years or so  with  the London Whale  and other events that have tarnished the  bravo  image of Mr  Dimon and his bank  The activity going on inside the bank remind me of a  turnaround  operation  But  there is a second reason for the things that are going on  Mr  Dimon is moving JPMorgan into the future If this is true  then this whole effort is to move JPMorgan into the future in the face of the  hostile  regulatory environment that exists  in the face of the changes that information technology are forcing on the banking industry  and the changing nature of the financial industry If I were Mr  Dimon  my feeling would be that the current regulatory environment  sucks  Being John Mason  my feeing is that the current regulatory environment  sucks  In either case  the basic feeling is that I really don t want to run a bank  I want to run something different Second  whatever is being done in the financial industry  the future of commercial banking of finance in general is information technology  Finance is nothing more than information  Ultimately  finance is nothing more than 0s and 1s  Thus  whatever you call a financial institution in the future it will just be another name for a information processing organization And  if we are dealing in information technology  as Fred Tomczyk  CEO of TD Ameritrade was quoted as saying about the discount brokerage business    it s a scale business  It takes a lot to compete in terms of investments and technology and marketing  There are only one or two maybe transactions left  If you have an account at TD Ameritrade why do you need a commercial bank Third  there is the changing nature of the financial industry  You look at the largest seven  commercial banks  in the United States in terms of revenues and you find in number five position  Morgan Stanley and in number six  Goldman Sachs Group  and in number seven  American Express In addition to that the total assets in the commercial banking sector are less than half the total  banking  assets in the United States  Total  banking  assets in the United States  according to the Federal Reserve System consists of those institutions that take deposits and are monitored and regulated and then there is the  shadow  banking system that does not take deposits and are not monitored and regulated to any degree What is the difference  All financial institutions are  intermediaries   They receive funds from  savers  and lend the funds to  borrowers  But  the  savers  do not need to be depositors  The  savers  could be anyone providing the financial institution with funds to lend  The crucial thing is that the  credit intermediaries  have the ability to earn a sufficient spread on the difference between the interest rate they pay the  savers  and the interest rate they charge the  borrowers  These  intermediaries  can also buy assets  trade in assets and hedge assets and so on and so forth and earn fees rather than interest  And  there are other things these  intermediaries  can do to earn income  In these areas they don t really need deposits And  officials at the Federal Reserve claim that perhaps most of what the investment bank like institutions do that is  Morgan Stanley and the Goldman Sachs Group is really  shadow banking  and not commercial banking One can  therefore  really question whether most of what JPMorgan Chase does is commercial banking  David Reilly in the Wall Street Journal tells us that JPMorgan s  total net loans of  708 billion at the end of the first quarter equaled less than a third of total assets of  2 4 trillion  Trading Assets and securities holdings were slightly more than its loan book  And its derivatives holding are the largest of any U  S  bank  He goes on   Meanwhile the banks trading operations are a significant driver of profit  In the first quarter  JPMorgan s corporate and investment bank produced net income of  2 6 billion  That was equal to 40  of overall profit and slightly exceeded the income generated by the bank s consumer and community banking business  Why do I really want to be a commercial bank  Much of the deposit business is just a headache and it is so costly think of all those branches out there with hardly any customers ever in them The new chief operating officer  Matt Zames  was co chief operating officer with Mr  Bisignano  But  Mr  Zames is coming from the fixed income area  His background  He worked for a hedge fund  Long Term Capital Management Maybe JPMorgan Chase is thinking less of being a  commercial  bank and moving more and more of its business into the  shadow  area  This would be consistent with talk now being heard in Congress  Congressmen are apparently concerned that these too big to fail institutions like JPMorgan should not have their non depository business protected with deposit insurance  In essence  these too big to fail institutions should be split into  real  commercial banks with deposits  and  shadow  banks or institutions that do not need deposit insurance As organizations like JPMorgan Chase earn more and more of their income from corporate and investment banking operations  asset management and corporate private equity sources  why should they want to keep the consumer and community banking areas  If we are getting enough earnings from these other sources  let s just  spin off  the banking  stuff  I would bet that of the top twenty so called commercial banks in the country in terms of assets  more than half the revenue of these financial institutions comes from  shadow banking  sources So  maybe Jamie Dimon is moving on  Maybe Jamie Dimon is trying to create a financial institution that will be a part of the future  not one that tries to hang onto the past  I believe that Jamie Dimon is smart enough to do this and brazen enough to carry it off Therefore  the current level of activity is showing us who is in charge  The future needs new ideas and in many cases new people to achieve that future  So JPMorgan is working through a turnaround and it is becoming more and more technology based  and is moving more and more into the  shadow   If this is the case  I am much more hopeful for the performance of JPMorgan in the future than I have been recently Editor s Note  This is the first of a series addressing the implications of profound changes underway in both the domestic and

121348,342863,NYT,Alan Abelson  Former Barron s Editor And My Mentor  Has Passed ,opinion,Alan Abelson  former Barron s Editor and my mentor  passed away last week   The first time I ever spoke with Alan was February 1970 when I was an MBA student at the Harvard Business School and he answered a collect call from me  Digital Equipment was a Wall Street darling at the time  but I had heard that DEC for the first time was inventorying mini computers instead of shipping current production   At that time  Alan s Up and Down Wall Street column was the most influential on Wall Street  I had called him on a whim because I and several other students had bought out of the money DEC puts  He thanked me  and as anyone who has ever talked to Alan over the phone knows  he hung up without saying goodbye  The story ran the following week  DEC stock dropped and our puts were in the money   I got to meet Alan two months later when he spoke at the Harvard Business School Finance Club  That meeting and a few phone calls eventually led to a summer job as Alan s assistant   My first story assignment was a News   Views company story on Woolworth  Alan told me to make an appointment and interview either the CEO or the CFO but never the PR guy  and then write the story  I said okay  did the interview  wrote up the story and handed it in  Years later I learned that Alan was impressed by the fact that I followed his orders and got the story without asking him any questions  What Alan didn t know was that I was so ignorant about journalism that I didn t even know what questions to ask   All of the above is my way of saying Alan took a shot on me and I paid off for him  Alan made many other unusual journalism hires of people who went on to become stars in their own firmaments  Barton Biggs  who preceded me  went from Barron s staffer to head of Morgan Stanley research and then his own hedge fund  After me Alan hired Jim Grant  of Grants Interest Rate Observer  and Diana Henriques and Floyd Norris of the New York Times  among others   And then there is the Barron s Round Table  Several current and former Round Table members have told me they owed Alan a great deal  Not that he made them great money managers  rather Alan s support took some of them from barely relevant to big time operators  Very few know that Alan over the years had several job offers to leave journalism to become head of research at top Wall Street firms   About five years ago I asked Alan for permission to write his biography  He declined and that was the last time I spoke with him  What I really wanted to say was that in his time Alan was the real world top cop on Wall Street  And after Alan stepped down as Barron s editor  no one  repeat no one has picked up his mantle   Alan stepped down as Barron s editor in the mid 1990s but continued doing his column until three months before he died  Alan s Up and Down Wall Street column for many years was the most influential on Wall Street  The late Danny Dorfman even at his peak acknowledged to me that Alan was his better  So  why was Alan s column so powerful   First Alan was obviously smart enough to understand and explain in simple terms the most complex financial frauds  Moreover  Alan never quit once he was on the chase of a big time Wall Street con   One example  Back in 1972 Alan got a tip from the top gold and silver trading house at the time  Mocatta Metals  that an up and coming commodity option shop  Goldstein Samuelson  was a ponzi scheme  I got assigned to check it out and in doing so became friends with both Dr  Henry Jarecki  then Mocatta s chairman  and Thomas Peterffy  who was among the first to use volatility analysis to trade commodity options  Parenthetically  Thomas went on to use volatility analysis to trade stock options and that led to where Thomas is today founder and chairman of Interactive Brokers   With Alan s backstopping me  I learned everything I needed to know about the pricing of commodity options and why the ultra cheap commodity straddles that Goldstein Samuelson was peddling had to be a Ponzi scheme  My story ultimately exposed the fraud and the fraudsters ended up serving time  For what it is worth  I was told Alan nominated me for a Pulitzer Prize   Unfortunately  by the early 1990 s Alan was constantly bickering with Dow Jones management who objected to his truth seeking and cared more about short term profits  In 1992  when I was recommending short positions at Market TrimTabs  I recommended shorting Dow Jones  The reason was that Dow Jones had squandered a highly profitable monopoly position as the major purveyor of Wall Street research and news  As everyone knows  Dow Jones today is a minor subsidiary of Fox  I loved that Alan not only posted the TrimTabs Dow Jones short sale recommendation on the bulletin board outside his office but that he kept it there until he left as Barron s editor in 1994   With Alan gone  there literally is no one on Wall Street who is willing to take on and expose the fraudsters  Today s Barron s applauds itself for the being the first to question Madoff s credibility  However  I have no doubt that if Alan were in charge of Barron s at that time  Madoff would have been exposed  saving investors billions Below you may find the video ,2013-05-15,Charles

121378,342893,NYT,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 Russia AFI in survival mode  valuations drop,news,"  Portfolio valuation falls to  2 billion from  6 billion
   Pushing ahead on three high profile projects
   Sees potential in managing developments seized by banks
  Recasts  adds more quotes  background  details 
 By Melissa Akin and Yuliya Komleva
 MOSCOW  March 12  Reuters    AFI Development chief executive
Alexander Khaldei considers his company a survivor on Moscow s
devastated real estate scene  but he has lost some of his
swagger 
 Last year Khaldei  who co owns the Russian developer with
Israeli billionaire and diamond dealer Lev Leviev  was sitting
on a portfolio of some of Moscow s most prestigious projects 
valued at nearly  6 billion 
 Now  he has scaled back his development projects from 34 to
concentrate on three flagship central Moscow ventures which make
up the lion s share of his portfolio  which was valued by
consultants from Jones Lang Lasalle at  2 billion at the end of
2008 
 The Moscow property market has seized up as the businesses
that occupy the city s sleek new Class A office space slash
their staff and some companies pack up altogether  filling the
business newspapers with sale and bankruptcy notices 
  You open Kommersant on a Saturday  They fill two pages with
news and six pages with bankruptcy notices   Khaldei said 
 Where are they going  Those offices are emptying out  We feel
the effects of it too   Khaldei said in an interview 
  We try to be flexible  cutting rates a little bit to try to
keep our tenants  so our turnover is small  But on the whole 
there is a lot of empty office space on the market  
 Office rents  he said  have fallen by 20 percent  while
flats are steadier  falling 10 15 percent 
 He said the  2 billion was valuation was too low 
  But considering what is happening with developer
structures  we can t prove otherwise  The market is at a
standstill  not because we aren t building anything  but because
there is no demand   Khaldei said 
  Developers need to go on holiday  There is no demand  If
there is no demand  it doesn t matter what you build  It can be
a shack or a palace    if you can t sell it  you can t get a
return on your investment  
 Before the crisis  AFI was selling offices as fast as it
could build them  It continues to rent its own premises from a
rival  with Khaldei s corner office overlooking the building he
had planned to occupy  now let to a Wall Street bank 
 That office building is part of its intricate Tverskaya
Zastava project  a plan to renew the grubby and crumbling
neighbourhood around Belorussky train station at the old
northern gates to the city  now a traffic bottleneck 
 With cash in short supply and demand scarce  AFI is pursuing
Tverskaya Zastava and two other flagship projects    the Mall of
Russia in Moscow s new financial district and an apartment
building across the river from the Kremlin 
 The company will write down assets  within reason  in an
earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2008    when the
credit crisis hit Russia with full force    to be issued on
March 17  he said 
 Leviev s vehicle  global developer Africa Israel Investments
 said earlier this week it would post a loss of 2 7 billion
shekels for the fourth quarter on plummeting property values 
mainly its New York Times building in Manhattan 
 While the Moscow real estate scene has been heavily focused
on its more leveraged developers  AFI Development had around
 370 million on its balance sheet at the end of the third
quarter and  long  comfortable credit lines  with no debt
immediately due 
 Khaldei was sniffing the air for blood last year  hoping to
acquire crisis victims with his cash pile  But the company
returned cash to its shareholders last year instead  and now
sees potential in managing assets seized by banks for debt 
  Banks are the biggest owners of real estate right now  They
can t sell off all that collateral  There are no buyers on the
market so it would be logical to put it under experienced
developers  management   he said 
  We could take on  say  five sites from a bank  get them
into shape and finish them on schedule  so that finished
buildings were ready for the end of the crisis  ",2009-03-12,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/interview-update-1-russia-afi-in-survival-mode,-valuations-drop-35388",35388

Standard   Poor s downgraded General Electric and its finance unit one level to AA  with a stable outlook  GE  
had maintained its AAA rating since 1956  A fall below AA  would have forced the firm to post additional  
collateral  GE said in a statement it  does not anticipate any significant operational or funding impacts   
 
S P analyst Robert Schulz said that the ratings committee balanced the  excellent risk profile  of GE s  
industrial businesses against the prospects of weaker earnings or a  modest net loss  at GE Capital 
 
 We re not expecting any real earnings or cash flow from GE Capital this year or next year   Schulz said

Ahead of the G20 meeting of finance ministers scheduled for this weekend  the Obama administration is putting more pressure on other economies to respond aggressively to the global recession  and its backing its words with a bigger commitment to the International Monetary Fund  IMF  
 
 There is a broad based recognition that our fortunes are closely linked to the fortunes of the rest of the  
world   Treasury secretary Geithner said   And if we don t get the world moving with us  then we face some  
prospect of a deeper  longer lasting recession in the United States  
 
U S  officials are proposing an increase in one of the IMF s emergency credit lines to struggling nations to  
 500 billion from  50 billion  which could increase the U S  commitment to  100 billion from  10 billion  The  
proposal also seeks more funding commitments from China and other developing nations 
 
In a briefing ahead of the meeting  Mr  Geithner said U S  officials will also push for efforts to redraw oversight of financial markets  echoing calls from European officials that large  multinational financial companies must be subject to much stricter supervision 
 
Those proposals include 
 
1  Guidelines and principles for compensation practices 
 
2  Special attention paid to firms that pose potential systemic risks to the stability of the financial system 
 
3  Fundamental reforms to the way banks are required to hold capital 
 
4  Improved reforms to consumer protection and market integrity  
 
5  One entity to fill the role of a U S  regulator to monitor systemic risk likely to be the Federal Reserve 
 
 
Writing for the New York Times William D  Cohan looks at complicity of top executives in the financial crisis  
 
 So enough already with the charade of Wall Street executives pretending not to know what really happened and  why  They know precisely why their banks either crashed or are alive only thanks to taxpayer provided life  support  And at least one of them   John Mack  the chief executive of Morgan Stanley   seems willing to admit it  
 
 He appears to have undergone a religious conversion of sorts after his firm s near death experience  But there  can be no restoration of confidence in the banking system   and therefore no hope for an economic recovery   until Wall Street comes clean  If the executives responsible for what happened won t step forward on their own  perhaps a subpoena wielding panel along the lines of the 9 11 commission can be created to administer a little  truth serum  ",2009-03-12,LFB Forex,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/financial-sector:-ge-debt-downgrade...ahead-of-the-g20...executive-complicity-in-the-crisis-35538,35538
121380,342895,NYT,UPDATE 1 U S  bank rescue plan could come on Monday   WSJ,news," Adds details from WSJ report  New York Times  background 
 NEW YORK  March 20  Reuters    The U S  government will
announce as soon as Monday a long awaited plan to try to get
bad assets off the books of banks  a cornerstone of its efforts
to tackle the credit crisis  The Wall Street Journal reported 
 The Obama administration  battling a deepening recession 
is set to adopt a three pronged approach to ridding the
financial system of so called toxic assets  the newspaper and
the New York Times said on their websites on Friday 
 The plan would create an entity  backed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp  a U S  banking regulator  to buy and
hold loans  the reports said 
 It would expand a newly launched Federal Reserve facility
   that lends money to investors to buy securities backed by
consumer loans    to include toxic assets  And it would create
new public and privately financed funds to buy such securities
under the management of private investment experts 
 The Obama administration plans to contribute between  75
billion and  100 billion in new capital to the effort although
that amount could be expanded  the Wall Street Journal said 
 The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve declined to
comment  Sources familiar with the government s thinking have
told Reuters details of a plan could be announced next week 
 The Bush administration tried without success late last
year to set up a mechanism to get bad assets off the balance
sheets of commercial banks 
 The banks have been hammered by losses incurred by
mortgage related debt that has turned sour amid a fall in house
prices and a pickup in defaults  sparking a credit crisis that
has strangled the U S  and global economies 
 Obama s Treasury secretary  Timothy Geithner  has outlined
a new proposal to soak up as much as  1 trillion in assets
through a public private program 
 But investors have grown increasingly concerned that his
efforts are running into problems more than a month after he
outlined the plan 
 The slow start of the new Federal Reserve consumer lending
program this week has been seen as a sign that private capital
may shun the toxic asset plan because of public outrage over
large executive bonuses 
 Many big private investors are worried they could face
tough new rules in U S  financial rescue programs after
Congress pressed ahead with efforts to claw back bonuses paid
to executives at failed insurer American International Group
 
 The Wall Street Journal said the Treasury would match
private sector finance for the public private toxic asset funds
on a one for one basis in most cases 
 Washington would be a co investor also in the new FDIC
troubled loans program but could contribute 80 percent in some
cases  and would guarantee as much as  500 billion in loans
investments  the newspaper said in its report 
 The New York Times said the FDIC program could involve
government funding for up to 97 percent of the equity 
 It also said the plan is likely to offer generous taxpayer
subsidies  in the form of low interest loans  to coax investors
to form partnerships with the government

Economist and Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman referred to it as a  cash for trash  plan that recycle s ideas from the Bush administration  Mr  Krugman was an outspoken opponent of President Bush and has been a big Obama supporter 
 
 The common element to the Paulson and Geithner plans is the insistence that the bad assets on banks  books are really worth much  much more than anyone is currently willing to pay for them   he wrote  describing the goal of the plan as being the use of taxpayer funds  to drive the prices of bad assets up to  so called   fair  levels  
 
One of the main problems with the administration s proposals is that they provide a  one way bet  if asset values go up  the investors profit  but if they go down  the investors can walk away from their debt  So this isn t really about letting markets work  It s just an indirect  disguised way to subsidize purchases of bad assets  
 
The Times editors see the assumption on the part of the administration that values on the troubled assets will eventually recover as a major flaw of the policy  
 
 There is not much  beyond faith  to believe those assumptions will pan out  the editorial said  adding that  even if there were  it is hard to see how the plan is the best way to go  
 
Because of the fact that the government is putting up the vast bulk of the money to make the purchases and is lending to private investors for the balance   even a modest decline in the value of the purchased assets would endanger repayment of the loans   
 
The editors see additional problems with the plan even if values do increase 
 
 Successful sales will rid banks of some of their toxic assets  but not necessarily all or even most of them  To restore the banks to health  the sums expended would have to be enough to balance the banks  assets and liabilities  and provide a reasonable cushion to resume lending and absorb future losses  No one knows with any certainty how much that is  though some estimates put it north of  2 trillion  much more than what the administration is contemplating 
 
And even if you assume that the sums put up by the government are enough to cleanse the banks entirely  restoring the banks to health by throwing money at them   even with a sheen of private capital   would not be fair  It would be one big transfer of wealth from the government to bank investors  That would be better than an apocalyptic crash  but it is a near complete socialization of losses  with little value flowing to taxpayers 
 
In other banking crises  both in this country and abroad  resolution of a system wide problem has sooner or later involved separating solvent banks from insolvent banks  In the end  there is no getting around firing the executives at failing banks  acknowledging the losses  wiping out the shareholders and then deciding how the government can best restructure the institutions  The Obama administration has yet to explain why its approach is better than that   
 
Meanwhile  fund managers and analysts said the Public Private Investment Program  PPIP  may generate returns as high as 25   a figure that could drive demand  and prices  higher 
 
Hedge funds and other asset managers have an advantage because of the government financing and the FDIC backstop  Investors will be able to access non recourse  low interest loans for their share of the cost to purchase the bank s assets  estimated in some cases to be as little as 3   
 
Specific financing terms  including the haircut  duration of loans and other details have yet to be determined  the Treasury said in its statement  However  recent loans through the Fed s new Troubled Asset Backed Securities Lending Facility  TALF  have been provided for 2 52   fixed  or 1 53   floating  ",2009-03-24,LFB Forex,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/financial-sector:-more-on-the-geithner-plan-38898,38898
121382,342897,NYT,ANALYSIS Spain s unions  business seek deal but still far apart,news,"By Jason Webb
 MADRID  March 26  Reuters    Spanish companies and unions
have struck deals in the past to make the country more
competitive and now they agree they urgently need to do so again
   but their recipes for saving the nation from years of
economic misery are radically different 
 In pre euro days  Spain would devalue its way out of
economic slumps  but the world financial crisis now finds it
singularly ill prepared  following a decade in which its growth
was based on cheap debt  low skilled labour and building houses
which now stand unsold in their hundreds of thousands 
 With joblessness already hitting 15 percent  almost twice
the level of its pre crisis low in 2007  continuing rises in
unemployment will push Spain towards Depression levels 
  What can Spain do  It needs to become more competitive  but
it can t have a devaluation  because it s a euro country  So the
only alternative is wage cuts  which are desperately hard to
achieve   wrote Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman on
his New York Times blog  adding that the alternative to cutting
costs is years of stagnation 
 He estimated that Spain has to cut its costs by 15 percent
to become competitive again  after years in which it ran higher
inflation rates than its euro zone peers  Together with the
strong euro  this has made Madrid a more expensive city to live
in than London  according to the Economist Intelligence Unit 
 Avoiding strikes and social strife whilst making it cheaper
to do business here will be immensely difficult  But Spain does
have precedents for grand deals between government  business and
unions  and all these sectors are now pinning their hopes on
reaching a similar sweeping bargain 
 One of the two major unions  Comisiones Obreras  wants an
agreement with business which will switch the economy s focus
from construction to productive industry  And Francisco
Gonzalez  chairman of the country s second largest bank BBVA
  has called for a nationwide accord along the lines of
the  Moncloa Pacts  in 1978  when business and unions tightened
their belts for the good of the nation 
  This requires effort  sacrifice and involvement from all
sides   Gonzalez said at a shareholders  meeting 
  Our country has done it before  It did it 30 years ago  and
it can do it again   he said  shortly before facing questioning
from shareholders about whether a man with a 16 million euro
compensation package was doing his own share of belt tightening 
 
 STRIKE NOT ON AGENDA
 The Socialist government is sponsoring talks between
business lobby CEOE and the main unions  The companies want tax
cuts and for hiring and firing to be made cheaper  while the
unions want workers  benefits protected  but  so far  both sides
are playing down talk of any confrontation along the lines of
the general strikes hitting France 
  At this time  protests and general strikes aren t on the
agenda   said CEOE Secretary General Jose Maria Lacasa 
 Comisiones Obreras has backed away from earlier threats of a
strike if benefits are cut  and says it wants to give talks with
companies a chance 
 Comisiones Obreras  chief economist  Miguel Angel Garcia 
agreed that Spain s wage costs were a problem but argued that
businesses have to make sacrifices as well as workers 
  The price of goods or services is not only a product of
wage costs   said Garcia   It is also a product of the returns
on capital  which in Spain are pretty high  
 While it is relatively expensive and difficult to fire
someone in Spain  wages are much lower than in Britain or
Germany despite the high cost of living  and a majority of
workers earn 1 300 euros a month or less 
 During the boom years from 1997  the proportion of gross
domestic product given to wages fell by more than 2 percentage
points  as workers funded much of their consumption with debt 
 At the same time  Spain s corporate sector grew enormously 
with many of its leading players  like Banco Santander 
and Telefonica   becoming prominent on a world scale 
 Whatever Spain does it will be painful  But at least has
some Spain s advantages over fellow euro zone problem economy
Italy  which is even less competitive and has much higher levels
of public debt 
 Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research  who said the euro
meant Spain was effectively 10 percent overvalued  said the
country had a good chance of cutting costs  and a much better
chance than Italy 
  The experience of Germany in the early part of this decade
is that if you really grind the economy down you can actually
recover competitiveness quite fast   he said 
  So the question is  can Spain and Italy do that   And the
answer is  starting from 10 percent over the top  and with very
strong determination to be part of core Europe on the part of
the Spanish      you can reasonably guess that the Spanish will
bite the bullet and do the necessary   Dumas said  adding that
he thought Italy would fail

121383,342898,NYT,UPDATE 1 Developer Africa Israel swings to large Q4 loss,news,"  2 7 bln shekel loss as forecast vs year ago 278 mln profit
   Hurt by plunge in real estate valuations
   To book gain of 1 7 billion shekels in Q1
   To buy back own bonds
 
 By Joseph Nasr
 TEL AVIV  March 30  Reuters    Israeli real estate developer
Africa Israel Investments  on Monday reported a steep
quarterly loss due to a sharp decline in the value of its
properties 
 Africa Israel  75 percent owned by billionaire Lev Leviev 
posted a fourth quarter net loss of 2 69 billion shekels   637
million   compared with a profit of 278 million shekels a year
earlier 
  The fourth quarter and full year results were substantially
impacted by the global economic crisis and the uncertainty in
financial markets   Izzy Cohen  Africa Israel s chief executive 
said at a news conference in Tel Aviv 
 It estimated that due to accounting changes  it would post a
1 7 billion shekel gain in the first quarter of 2009 
 The crisis has hit Africa Israel hard largely due to sharply
dropping values of its properties in the United States and
Russia 
 The company earlier this month had warned it would record a
loss of about 2 7 billion shekels due to the decline in value of
some of its properties  including The New York Times building in
Manhattan  which it bought in 2007 
 Asked about ongoing talks to sell 49 percent of the
building to an Asian investment fund  Richard Marin  head of
Africa Israel USA  said   As part of restructuring  we might
bring in a partner  but that s very unclear at this time  
 Africa Israel s shares were down 0 4 percent in afternoon
trading but they outperformed losses of 2 2 percent on the
broader Tel Aviv bourse 
 Leviev said the company was detecting some signs of recovery
in Russia s devastated real estate market where its subsidiary
AFI Developments  has a portfolio valued at  2 billion
at the end of 2008  down from  6 billion a year earlier 
 Cohen said  without giving details  Africa Israel planned to
generate cash to meet the company s financial obligations by
selling off assets and refinancing bank loans 
 Africa Israel said it would buy back 70 million shekels of
its own bonds  which have taken a beating in recent months  It
estimated that buying back the bonds would result in significant
savings of future financing expenses and enable the company to
book a gain by reducing its obligations 
 The company s bond price  was 0 6 percent lower
after sliding 3 5 percent on Sunday 
 The Israeli units of Standard   Poor s and Moody s Investors
Service lowered their ratings for Africa Israel s bonds earlier
this month  citing payments of 1 8 billion shekels due in 2009
and 2010 
   1   4 22 shekels

121384,342899,NYT,Financial Sector  The Law Of Unintended Consequences   Stiglitz Runs The PPIP Numbers,news,"Apparently  U S  banks such as Citigroup  Goldman Sachs  Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase which have received government aid could become buyers of toxic assets under the Treasury s  1 trillion Public Private investment Plan  PPIP  
 
Critics are saying that the PPIP  which basically is set up to allow the private sector to make substantial gains with little risk  is intended to help banks sell troubled securities and loans and not purchase them 
 
The government plan does not allow banks to buy their own assets  but there is no ban on the purchase of securities and loans sold by others 
 
Banks have three options if they want to buy toxic assets  apply to become one of four or five fund managers that will purchase troubled securities  bid for packages of bad loans  or buy into funds set up by others 
 
Spencer Bachus  the top Republican on the House financial services committee  vowed to introduce legislation which would stop financial institutions from gaming the system to reap taxpayer subsidized windfalls  
 
Mr  Bachus added it would mark a new level of absurdity  if financial institutions were to swap assets at inflated prices using taxpayer dollars  
 
Lawmakers are going to have a difficult time understanding why banks will be allowed to purchase troubled securities when the entire purpose of the plan is to get them off bank balance sheets in order to free up lending  Allowing banks to make such purchases could leave the same amount of toxic assets in the system as before  but with the government  meaning the taxpayers  now liable for most of the losses through its provision of non recourse loans 
 
 It s an open program designed to get markets going   a Treasury official said   It is between a bank and their supervisor whether they are healthy enough to acquire assets   raising the possibility regulators may prevent weak banks from becoming buyers 
 
There s no question that the private sector stands to be the big beneficiary of any profits realized under the PPIP while at the same time the government  and therefore  the taxpayer  holds the majority of the risk  The way the PPIP is set up  the government is to provide about 92  of the money but would stand to receive only 50  of any gains 
 
Writing in the New York Times  Joseph Stiglitz  former chief economist of the World Bank and Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Clinton  works out the numbers  For example  let s say the price for an asset is bid 50  higher than its true worth of  100  In this case  the private sector puts up  12  and the government supplies the rest   12 in  equity  plus  126 in the form of a guaranteed  non recourse loan it makes to the private investor 
 
If after a year it turns out that the true value of the asset is zero  the private partner loses only the original  12 investment  because the loan made to fund the majority of the purchase is non recourse  and the government loses  138  the  12 investment plus the  126 loan  
 
Should the true value of the asset turn out to be  200  the government and the private partner split the  74 that s left over after paying back the  126 loan  But what s really happened is that the private partner more than triples his  12 investment while the taxpayer  having risked  138  gains just  37 ",2009-04-03,LFB Forex,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/financial-sector:-the-law-of-unintended-consequences...stiglitz-runs-the-ppip-numbers-42288,42288
121385,342900,NYT,FOREX Dollar edges up vs yen before US bank earnings,news,"  Many overseas players away for Easter holiday
   Focus on how stocks fare as US bank results come in
 TOKYO  April 13  Reuters    The dollar edged up against the
yen in quiet trade on Monday with many overseas players still
away for the Easter holiday and others waiting until the U S 
corporate earnings season gets into full swing 
 U S  banks including Goldman Sachs  JPMorgan and Citigroup
are set to report first quarter results this week  and traders
are keen to see how stock markets react to these earnings
reports 
 But after a relaxation of industry accounting standards 
analysts say it will be difficult to gauge losses from bad loans
in areas like real estate and consumer credit 
  Market participants generally stayed on the sidelines before
the U S  bank earnings and they are waiting for stocks  moves
following the results   said a dealer at a Japanese bank 
 Last week  the dollar rose against the yen  buoyed by a rally
in U S  shares after positive earnings guidance from U S  bank
Wells Fargo 
  If U S  earnings results show signs that the U S  is pulling
away from the worst of the economic downturn  risk appetite is
expected to grow  putting pressure on the yen   said Yoshihisa
Kanzaki  a currency dealer at Shinkin Central Bank 
 Others said the currency market has priced in positive U S 
earnings figures  so downward pressure on the yen could be
limited even if the results are better than expected  and that
the market is more likely to swayed by negative surprises 
 The dollar was trading around 100 37 yen compared with 100 22
yen in late Tokyo trading on Friday  The U S  currency touched
101 45 yen last week  its highest in six months 
 The euro was quoted at  1 3165  down from  1 3186 on Friday
when it also slipped to  1 3090  a level not seen since
mid March 
 Against the yen  the euro was at 132 16 yen  down from 132 24
yen  It climbed to 137 42 yen last week  its highest point in six
months 
 The Australian dollar rose above 73 00 yen  the highest since
October  before falling back to 72 51 yen 
 Retail investors had likely picked up the higher yielding
Aussie on expectations Japanese stocks would open higher  with
thin trade later exaggerating price swings  dealers said 
 Australia last week slashed its key cash rate by 0 25 basis
points to 3 0 percent  less than some had expected 
 Tokyo s Nikkei stock average edged down 0 1 percent after
moving in and out of positive territory 
 Market players were also looking to developments in China
after a report that the country was considering more stimulus
steps 
 China is planning a new economic stimulus package targeted at
boosting consumption  the China Securities Journal reported on
Monday  citing a senior official of the State Information Center 
which is affiliated with the country s top planning agency 
 If China expands its economic measures  it would help
increase investor risk tolerance as a strong economic recovery in
China would help the global economy  traders said 
 The U S  Treasury Department is directing General Motors to
lay the ground work for a bankruptcy filing by June 1  even
though the automaker has publicly stated it could reorganise
outside of court  the New York Times reported on Sunday 
 The immediate impact of the GM report on the currency market
was limited but players will be eyeing how U S  financial markets
react to it  dealers said 
 The market will also be watching a slew of U S  economic
data  including housing and labour market figures  as well as
Chinese gross domestic product data for the first quarter due

121388,342903,NYT,Words Of Warning  Get Your Money Out Of European Banks,opinion,If you still have money in European banks  you need to get it out  This is particularly true if you have money in southern European banks  As I write this  the final details of the Cyprus bailout are being worked out  but one thing has become abundantly clear  at least some depositors are going to lose a substantial amount of money  Personally  I never dreamed that they would go after private bank accounts in Europe  but now that this precedent has been set it should be apparent to everyone that no bank account will ever be considered 100  safe ever again  Without trust  a banking system simply cannot function  and right now there are prominent voices on both sides of the Atlantic that are loudly warning that trust in the European banking system has been shattered and that people need to get their money out of those banks as rapidly as they can  Even if you don t end up losing a significant chunk of your money  you could still end up dealing with very serious capital controls that greatly restrict what you are able to do with your money  Just look at what is already happening in Cyprus  Cash withdrawals through ATMs have now been limited to 100 euros per day  and when the banks finally do reopen there will be strict limits on financial transactions in order to prevent a full blown bank run  And of course anyone with half a brain will be trying to get as much of their money as they can out of those banks once they do reopen  So the truth is that the problems for Cyprus banks are just beginning  The size of the  bailout  that will be needed to keep those banks afloat will just keep getting larger and larger the more money that is withdrawn  Cyprus is heading for a complete and total banking meltdown  and because the economy of the island is so dependent on banking that means that the economy of the entire nation is going to collapse  Sadly  similar scenarios will soon start playing out all over Europe  So if you hear that a  deal  has been reached to  bail out  Cyprus  please keep in mind that the economy of Cyprus is going to collapse no matter what happens  It is just a matter of apportioning the pain at this point  According to   it looks like much of the pain is going to be placed on the backs of those with deposits of over 100 000 euros    The revised terms under discussion would assess a one time tax of 20 percent on deposits above 100 000 euros at the Bank of Cyprus  which has the largest number of savings accounts on the island  Because the Bank of Cyprus suffered huge losses on bets that it took on Greek bonds  the government appears to be taking depositors  money to help plug the hole  A separate tax of 4 percent would be assessed on uninsured deposits at all other banks  including the 26 foreign banks that operate in Cyprus  Does that sound bad to you  Well  if a deal is not reached  there is a possibility that those with uninsured deposits could lose everything  According to   EU officials are telling Cyprus to choose between a  bad scenario  and a  very bad scenario     The main question surrounds the future of the island s largest lender  Bank of Cyprus  If unsecured deposits  above 100 000 euros  at all Cypriot banks are taxed then large savings at Bank of Cyprus are likely to be taxed between 20 and 25 percent  If the levy is not imposed on deposits at other lenders  the haircut for Bank of Cyprus customers will be much larger  The option of a full bail in of Bank of Cyprus depositors is still on the table  As with the Popular Bank of Cyprus  Laiki   which is to go through a resolution process  the full bail in option could lead to deposits above 100 000 euros being lost  The only compensation for unsecured depositors will be shares in the  good  bank that will be created by a possible merger between the  healthy  Laiki and Bank of Cyprus entities  When asked by Kathimerini how the Cypriot economy will survive if all company and personal deposits above 100 000 euros disappear from the country s two biggest lenders  the EU official said   Unfortunately  Cyprus s choices are between a bad scenario and a very bad scenario   So what percentage of the deposits in Cyprus are uninsured deposits  Well  nobody knows for sure  but according to JPMorgan close to half of the total amount of money on deposit in EU banks as a whole is uninsured  Do you think that some of those people will start moving their money to safer locations after watching how things are going down in Cyprus  They would be crazy if they didn t  And if you think that  deposit insurance  will keep you safe  you are just being delusional  According to   very strict capital controls are coming to Cyprus  These rules will apply even to accounts that contain less than 100 000 euros    Financial controls are coming  Depositors with less than 100 000 euros may not lose their money outright  but they won t like the restrictions  no matter how much they have in the bank  Limits on withdrawals  limits on check cashing  and perhaps even outright conversion of checking accounts into fixed term deposits are coming  translation  you don t have a checking account  you have a bond from the bank   A lot of people are going to lose a lot of money in Cyprus banks  and a significant percentage of them are going to be Russian  And as I wrote about the other day  you don t want to have the Russians mad at you  According to   Moscow is already considering various ways that it might  punish  the EU    However  with   the growing optimism about a deal was accompanied by fears of retaliation from Moscow  Alexander Nekrassov  a former Kremlin adviser  said   If it is the case that there will be a 25  levy on deposits greater than  100 000 then some Russians will suffer very badly   Then  of course  Moscow will be looking for ways to punish the EU  There are a number of large German companies operating in Russia  You could possibly look at freezing assets or taxing assets  The Kremlin is adopting a wait and see policy   Could this be the start of a bit of  economic warfare  between east and west  One thing is for sure   the Russians simply do not allow people to walk all over them  Meanwhile  things in Cyprus are getting more desperate with each passing day  Because they cannot get money out of the banks  many retail stores find themselves   In a few more days many of them may not be able to function at all    Retailers  facing cash on delivery demands from suppliers  warned stocks were running low   At the moment  supplies will last another two or three days   said Adamos Hadijadamou  head of Cyprus s Association of Supermarkets   We ll have a problem if this is not resolved by next week   But do you know who was able to get their money out in time  The insiders  According to   the President of Cyprus actually warned  close friends  about what was going to happen and told them to get their money out Cyprus    Cypriot president Nikos Anastasiades  warned  close friends of the financial crisis about to engulf his country so they could move their money abroad  it was claimed on Friday  Overall  approximately 4 5 billion euros was moved out of Cyprus during the week just before the crisis struck  Wouldn t you like to get advance warning like that  Well  at this point it does not take a genius to figure out what to do about any money that you may have in European banks  The following is from a recent  by economist Laurence Kotlikoff    Whatever happens  no one is going to trust or use Cypriot banks  This will shut down the country s financial highway and flip Cyprus  economy to a truly awful equilibrium in a replay of our own country s Great Depression  which was kicked off by the failure of one in three U S  banks  Cyprus is a small country  Still  the failure of its banks could trigger massive bank runs in Greece  After all  if the European Central Bank is abandoning Cypriot depositors  they may abandon Greek depositors next  A run on Greek banks could then spread to Portugal  Ireland  Spain  and Italy and from there to Belgium and France and  you get the picture  to other countries around the globe  including  drum roll  the U S  Every bank in each of these countries has made promises they can t keep were push come to shove  i e   if all depositors demand their money back immediately  We ve seen this movie before  And not just in real life  Every Christmas our tellys show It s a Wonderful Life in which banker Jimmy Stewart barely saves his small town from economic ruin arising from a banking panic  Others are being even more blunt with their warnings  For example  Nigel Farage  a member of the European Parliament  is  to get their money out of southern European banks while they still can    The appalling events in Cyprus over the course of the past week have surpassed even my direst of predictions  Even I didn t think that they would stoop to stealing money from people s bank accounts  I find that astonishing  There are 750 000 British people who own properties  or who live  many of them in retirement down in Spain  Our message to expats now that the EU has crossed this line  must be  Get your money out of there while you ve still got a chance  And Martin Sibileau is proclaiming that if you still have an unsecured deposit in a eurozone bank that you should have your head examined    What are depositors of Euros faced with today  Anything but a clean bet  They don t know what the expected loss on their capital will be  because it will be decided over a weekend by politicians who don t even represent them  They don t really know where their deposits went to and they also ignore what jurisdiction they really belong to  Finally  depositors are paid mere basis points for their trust in the system vs  the 20  p a  Argentina offered in 2001  thanks to the zero interest rate policies of the 21st century   In light of all this  I can only conclude that anyone still having an unsecured deposit in a Euro zone bank should get his her head examined  So where should you put your money  I don t know that there is anywhere that is 100  safe at this point  But many are pointing to hard assets such as gold and silver  The following is what trends forecaster Gerald Celente had to say      People always say to me   Mr  Celente you are always talking about gold  What are you going to do with gold when everything collapses and there is no money   Well  let s say you are a Cypriot and all of the ATM machines are out of money and the banks are closed  Do you think those pieces of silver are going to buy you what you need  Do you think that ounce of gold is going to get you what you want  That s the real money  There is no other money  When it all comes down  gold and silver are the only things you have to buy what you need  get what you want  or even get out if you need to   I used to tell people that putting their money in U S  banks was safer than putting it other places because U S  bank deposits are covered by deposit insurance up to a certain amount  But now we see that deposit insurance means absolutely nothing  If they decide to  tax   i e  steal  your money from your bank accounts they will just go ahead and do it  So what should we all do  Personally  I think that not having all of your eggs in one basket is a wise approach  If you have your wealth a bunch of different places and in several different forms  I think that will help  But as the global financial system falls apart  there will be no such thing as 100  safety  So if you are looking for that you can stop trying  Our world is becoming a very unstable place  and things are going to get a lot worse  We are all going to have to adjust to this new paradigm and do the best that we can ,2013-03-25,Michael T.

121389,342904,NYT,Poland ETFs Could Be Attractive Eurozone Additions,opinion,There has been ample talk in recent weeks that Cyprus is on the brink of departure from the eurozone  but there is no Cyprus specific ETF for eager short sellers to pummel  However  most of the 17 members of the common currency program are tracked by a U S  listed ETF  Yes  there is even a Finland ETF  the iShares MSCI Finland Capped Investable Market Index Fund  BATS  EFNL   One nation represented by two country specific ETFs wants in on the euro despite currency s obvious woes  That country is Poland  On Wednesday  Polish prime minister  Donald Tusk said he is open to a referendum that would allow for a change to the country s Constitution  which could pave the way to joining the common currency regime  Under the current construction of Poland s Constitution  only the zloty can serve as the country s currency    While Poland s membership as a euro country is still at least several years away  the impact such a move could have on the iShares MSCI Poland Capped Investable Market Index Fund  EPOL  and the Market Vectors Poland ETF  PLND  is worth lamenting  Combined  the two ETFs have about  180 million in assets under management  a number that has previously been higher  Both ETFs have struggled this year on fears economic growth is slowing in Poland  Poland  which has been an economic juggernaut in Eastern and Central Europe  is expected to have GDP growth of just 1 2 percent this year    That estimate is down from the previous call of 1 8 percent growth and would represent Poland s most slack pace of growth in 12 years  Remember  Poland is classified as an emerging market  Many investors are not going to scurry to 1 2 percent growth rates with the subsequent emerging markets volatility when comparable if not better growth can be had in less volatile developed markets such as the U S  Not surprisingly  EPOL is down 14 1 percent year to date  PLND has not been a peach either with a loss of more than 12 percent  Call that an average loss of 13 percent for the Polish ETF pair  but it is still better than what investors would have gotten with the ETFs tracking several current Eurozone members  For example  the Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF  GREK  is offer more than 20 percent year to date  The iShares MSCI Italy Index Fun  EWI  is down 14 2 percent  The iShares MSCI Spain Index Fund  EWP  looks good by comparison  but over the past two years  EWP has plunged nearly 34 percent  EPOL and PLND have not been great over that time  but they have been better than EWP  It is not just the slack GDP forecast that has plagued Poland ETFs this year  The country s unemployment rate hit 13 4 percent in December  However  not to be trite  that would imply Poland would fit in quite well in the eurozone as unemployment in Greece and Spain is noticeably higher than 13 4 percent  Actually  the European Union should be courting Poland  not the other way around  Growth of 1 2 percent this year is still growth  something that is going to be hard to come by in eurozone s peripheral nations  The eurozone is already home to one emerging market in the form of Greece  To clarify  one index provider   Poland s economy  while dealing with obvious near term issues  has proven somewhat resilient to eurozone shocks  A growing middle class has fostered strong domestic demand  meaning EPOL and PLND are not ETFs that are deeply tied to a fragile export story  Another way of looking at the situation is if European leaders saw fit to let Cyprus and Greece into the eurozone  why not let in Poland in  Last year  only five countries that use the euro had larger economies than Poland   Germany  France  Italy  Spain and the Netherlands  Again  it will be a few years  if ever  that Poland adopts the euro  That might be good thing for EPOL and PLND because a case can be made that Poland brings more to the table than the euro offers in return BY The ETF Professor,2013-03-29,Benzinga ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/poland-etfs-could-be-attractive-eurozone-additions-160936,160936
121390,342905,NYT,On Stockman And Liquidation ,opinion,David Stockman s New York Times  has ruffled a lot of feathers  Paul Krugman disliked it  calling Stockman a cranky old man and criticising Stockman for throwing out a load of meaningless numbers that sound kind of scary  but are less so in context  Krugman is right on both counts  but what Krugman overlooks is Stockman s excellent criticism of crony capitalism  financialisation  systemic rot and Wall Street corruption of Washington  something Stockman has seen from the inside as part of the Reagan administration The Important PartEssentially there was a cleansing run on the wholesale funding market in the canyons of Wall Street going on  It would have worked its will  just like JP Morgan allowed it to happen in 1907 when we did not have the Fed getting in the way  Because they stopped it in its tracks after the AIG bailout and then all the alphabet soup of different lines that the Fed threw out  and then the enactment of TARP  the last two investment banks standing were rescued  Goldman and Morgan Stanley  and they should not have been As a result of being rescued and having the cleansing liquidation of rotten balance sheets stopped  within a few weeks and certainly months they were back to the same old games  such that Goldman Sachs got  10 billion dollars for the fiscal year that started three months later after that check went out  which was October 2008  For the fiscal 2009 year  Goldman Sachs generated what I call a  29 billion surplus     13 billion of net income after tax  and on top of that  16 billion of salaries and bonuses  95  of it which was bonuses Therefore  the idea that they were on death s door does not stack up  Even if they had been  it would not make any difference to the health of the financial system  These firms are supposed to come and go  and if people make really bad bets  if they have a trillion dollar balance sheet with six  seven  eight hundred billion dollars worth of hot money short term funding  then they ought to take their just reward  because it would create lessons  it would create discipline  So all the new firms that would have been formed out of the remnants of Goldman Sachs where everybody lost their stock values   which for most of these partners is tens of millions  hundreds of millions   when they formed a new firm  I doubt whether they would have gone back to the old game  What happened was the Fed stopped everything in its tracks  kept Goldman Sachs intact  the reckless Goldman Sachs and the reckless Morgan Stanley  everyone quickly recovered their stock value and the game continues  This is one of the evils that comes from this kind of deep intervention in the capital and money markets There are plenty of other writers who have pointed to this problem of propping up casino finance  including myself  But very few of them are doing so on the pages of the New York Times  So while it s rather disappointing to see Stockman railing against deficits when the evidence shows capital and labour markets are still very slack even with large deficits  and while it s rather disappointing to see him making technically incorrect claims about the United States being  bankrupt     sovereign lenders controlling their own currency cannot go bankrupt    we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater  Stockman is a cranky old man    but when it comes to drawing attention to real world problems with crony capitalism  he s doing a fine job  Many will say that just letting the banks liquidate was not an option  I tend to disagree    depositors could have been protected  and a new part nationalised banking system could perhaps have been built and capitalised just as quickly as the old dinosaurs were bailed out    but even if we assume liquidation to be impossible there are plenty of other options to bring the financial sector to heel  It is extremely disappointing to see the Obama administration fail to go after the banks in any meaningful way  The administration could have tried to break up the TBTF megabanks  reimpose Glass Steagall  impose the Volcker Rule  fire failed management  Perhaps even try to impose the Chicago Plan  Without Fed liquidity  the US banking sector is toast  so almost any reform is possible  Instead the banks took their bailouts without any discipline  and guess what  We ve had even more systemic corruption  carrying on in the same pre 2008 mould    the London Whale  Ina Drew  Kweku Adoboli  the theft of segregated deposits by MF Global  even while financial sector stocks have soared  Central banks have reinflated the markets  but with the same people who created the last bust still in charge  it looks much more like a reinflated bubble than a road to lasting prosperity  Papering over the cracks  The result of that is soaring corporate profits while employment and wages remain depressed  Feast for Wall Street  famine for Main Street  Obama may deploy plenty of populist rhetoric  but outcomes speak for themselves  Stockman has actually gone further in the past  criticising the toothlessness of Dodd Frank in dealing with the problem of Too Big To Fail  and even endorsing a return to Glass Steagall and the banning of corporate campaign donations  This 30 minute video is really worth watching In the long run  I think it will become patently clear that throwing liquidity at the financial system won t solve anything other than immediate liquidity concerns  The rot was too deep  The financial sector needed real reform in 2008  It still needs it today ,2013-04-01,John Aziz,https://www.investing.com/analysis/on-stockman-and-liquidation-161113,161113
121391,342906,NYT,Paul Krugman s New Japan  Reflation Is On,opinion,Paul Krugman s dream for Japan is finally coming true as the BOJ embarks on a round of massive monetary expansion   Paul Krugman  NYT   Let it not be said that the scribblings of academic economists have no effect  Some of us have been urging the Bank of Japan to get truly aggressive and adventurous on monetary policy   and it s happening    And it only took 15 years    Seriously  this is very good news  Japan is finally making a real effort to escape its deflation trap  We should all hope it succeeds   Indeed we should all hope that Japan s central bank can solve the nation s problems  which are ultimately structural in nature  Krugman is referring to the ongoing deflationary trend resulting from the burst of Japan s property bubble   as shown in the land price index below Japan s monetary base has already expanded dramatically over the past three years  and is now expected to grow to multiples of that Markets have responded in a  textbook  fashion  The yen sold off sharply  while banks and property shares rallied  The  reflation  of Japan is on ,2013-04-06,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/paul-krugman's-new-japan:-reflation-is-on-161884,161884
121392,342907,NYT,Why David Galland Is Buying Junior Minors Now,opinion,Natural resource investors have experienced a tough year  The price of gold bullion has fallen from its 2011 highs and the prices of good junior companies have been slashed to as little as half their former valuations  All the more reason to start returning broker phone calls according to David Galland  Casey Research managing director  speaking on the Friday eve of the webinar he is moderating that features some of the biggest names in the industry   The webinar   Downturn Millionaires  How to Make a Fortune in Beaten Down Markets   features Casey Research Founder Doug Casey  Sprott Global Resource Investments Founder Rick Rule  International Speculator Editor Louis James   Endgame  Author John Mauldin and Diary of a Rogue Economist Editor Bill Bonner  In this interview with The Gold Report  Galland shares the motivation behind assembling this all star cast for a golden wake up call  The Gold Report  You are moderating a webinar for Casey Research titled     This is going to air on Monday  April 8  It s an interesting title considering the current state of the precious metals market  Gold hasn t even flirted with  1 900 ounce   1 900 oz  since 2011 and dropped below  1 600 oz  Silver fell from  43 oz that same year to below  30 oz  Will this conference deliver the painful message that the bull market is over or do you have some good news for listeners  David Galland  We have some good news  The genesis of the webinar is somewhat interesting  Long term friend   founder and chairman of Sprott Global Resource Investments Ltd   sent an e mail saying   Guys  this is a real market capitulation and one of those rare opportunities to make serious money on the rebound   The proverbial light went off in our collective heads because we  too  have seen this sort of extreme opportunity several times during our careers  And so we scrambled to pull this webinar together in about a week to help make our subscribers and friends aware of the importance of the market capitulation and how to take full advantage  Simply  this is one of those rare moments when absolutely no one wants anything to do with gold stocks  even though gold bullion itself really hasn t sold off all that much compared to the gold stocks  which are off by as much as 50   The overarching purpose of the webinar  therefore  is to serve as a gut check and to help people focus on the opportunity  After all  the global demand for minerals is only going to continue to grow  and the role of precious metals is especially important given the complete lack of monetary and fiscal restraint on the part of the U S  and other large governments  The role of gold and silver is certainly not over  which points to a huge opportunity because the tremendous apathy and capitulation in the gold share market has knocked even the best companies flat on their backs  TGR  The demand argument makes sense  but were the smart people in this group able to come up with the reason why the stocks are doing so poorly compared to the bullion  DG  We discussed the stocks in depth  starting with the macro picture for precious metals  and then  by extension  why people want to own the stocks  The speakers had some great insights about why we ve gotten to this point  Then they focused on what they see ahead for the sector and specific ways to profit as the market bounces back  TGR  One of the featured speakers is   chairman of Casey Research  When we interviewed him in January for     he said  speculation is capitalizing on politically caused distortions in the marketplace   We ve had years of quantitative easing  but none of the inflation he predicted  Is the government winning  Is that answered in the webinar  DG  I wouldn t say we ve had none of the inflation  The government does its very best to cover it up but we all know that prices have gone up considerably on a lot of things  Look at the basics foodstuffs  energy and so forth  Are governments winning  No  they are just digging themselves and their respective economies a deeper and deeper hole  That said  you could certainly say that at this stage of the battle  people seem to have forgotten that there s a connection between money printing and inflation  It is baffling because deconstructing the Great German Inflation and other inflations around the world  it was clear to everyone that money printing was the primary culprit  Yet people seem to have once again forgotten that connection  The faculty in this webinar address the questions of where the inflation is heading  why hasn t it shown up and what can we expect when we see it  The consensus view among the faculty was that we re looking at inflation rates in the high double digits and maybe worse within the foreseeable future  maybe not tomorrow  but it will come  Governments around the world seem to think that their economies are like washing machines that can be fixed with a bit of tinkering  but they ll have serious trouble turning off the money printing machines  Social promises have been made  hundreds of millions of people now rely on governments for the bulk of their sustenance  Yet it s important to remember that governments don t actually make anything  except maybe wars  Where is the money going to come from for all these social programs  It s going to be magically whipped up out of thin air essentially  That will have an effect on the purchasing power of the currency units already in circulation  and it will have a positive effect on the prices of tangibles  most importantly gold and silver  TGR  Participant who is the editor of The Diary of a Rogue Economist  also watches macrotrends  Does he see any end to the emergency of the week theme playing out on the global stage  And does he have any suggestions for how investors can protect themselves from the fallout  DG  Bill completely understands the role that gold plays in preserving personal net worth  but doesn t usually discuss gold shares per se  Even so  in our webinar he said something that really got my attention   The time to buy these shares is when nobody wants to own them  when even you don t want to own them   That struck home with me because I ve been investing in this market since the 1970s  and long ago I learned that the time you really want to back up the truck is when you have exactly the kind of bombed out markets that we have today  As Bill spoke  it really resonated because I  too  have been ducking calls from my broker  and I have a lot of respect for my broker  Worst of all  my broker is calling me offering me financings on great companies that come with five year warrants  which is a very rare thing and only seen in periods of complete capitulation  But I didn t want to take the guy s calls because of the same mistake a lot of people are making at this point  which is just to assume that the market is dead forever when  in fact  that s very much not the case  TGR  So when David s scared  that s the time to buy  Is that what you re saying  DG  Well  not so much scared  I just didn t want to hear about the sector anymore  Listening to this webinar inspired me to spend time looking at stocks of companies that I know have great projects  and great management and cash in the bank  Universally  these great companies have sold off by 50 60  or more  Yet  there is nothing wrong with these companies other than this panic out of the risk on trades in the junior resource sector  That was a real wake up call  TGR  Webinar speaker   author of Thoughts from the Frontline  predicted  in a November interview with us      that politicians would find a way around the fiscal cliff that was looming at that time  but he warned that the economy would be in for a bumpy ride  In this webinar  did he have any predictions for when or how things would get better  DG  John jokes that even as a relative pessimist  he looks like an optimist when in the company of the Casey Research team  John still thinks there is the possibility of a political solution to the economic crisis  If there is  I haven t seen it  and nothing on the horizon looks like it s going to happen as far as I can see  Despite his cautious optimism  John was absolutely in sync with the rest of the speakers  opinions about the great contrarian opportunity in gold and the gold share market  an opportunity that most people will miss  but shouldn t  TGR  Another speaker  International Speculator Editor   stressed the importance of thinking long term when we interviewed him last September for the article     He said the junior market was looking  bottomish  and it looked like a good time to buy  Will he be mentioning what companies he likes in the webinar  DG  He talks about a couple of companies he likes as examples  He s also quite adamant about the criteria that people should use in deciding what precious metals shares belong in their portfolio and what shares people should be selling now  The reality is that a good number of these companies will not survive this downturn  If you re sitting on a company with no cash in the bank  an only so so project and average management  there s a reasonable chance it s going to go to  0 even though it may have already gone down by 50   In the webinar  Louis covers the specific aspects of companies you want to own in your portfolio and the ones you should lose  It s an important message because these things are  as Doug Casey likes to say  not family heirlooms but burning matches  And the ones that aren t going to make it just aren t going to make it  You have to come to that reality  But the good news is that by rotating into the certain winners you can claw back pretty quickly when the market sentiment shifts  as it most certainly will  TGR  Another one of the webinar speakers  Rick Rule  is a very popular expert with The Gold Report readers  When he spoke to our president  Karen Roche  last November for an article titled     he called gold  catastrophe insurance   Does he have any specific advice for how investors should adjust their portfolios in a downturn  DG  I would say similar to Louis  his message is very clear  There are definitely companies that aren t going to make it  and then there are companies that are going to make it and make it in a very big way  It was interesting because I ve known Rick for a couple of decades now and I have seen him give a lot of presentations  but he was very vocal in pointing to an urgency in this market that most people are missing  Rick  Louis  Doug and all of the people on this webinar are really on the same page about this  Investors need a wakeup call  They need to really be paying attention at this moment because it s one of those rare  once in a generation opportunities to  as John Mauldin says  get in front of a bubble  We ve seen this before  We saw this in July 1982  another classic capitulation with gold falling from over  800 oz in 1980 to below  350 oz  As you might imagine  the gold shares were completely sold off with the volume on the Canadian stock exchanges falling to next to nothing  But then there were a couple of discoveries in the Hemlo district of Canada  coinciding with a rally in gold  and the market skyrocketed  One of the companies involved in a Hemlo discovery  Golden Sceptre  went from a low of  0 41 share up to  31 share in about a year  Another  Goliath Gold  went from  0 45 share in March 1982 to  32 share in March 1983  an increase of over 7 000   That sort of opportunity is pretty much only available following periods of market capitulation such as we are experiencing today  People have forsaken reason  and they don t want to know about gold stocks  That alone should point the way to a classic contrarian opportunity where pretty much everybody who is going to sell has sold  leaving only one way to move up for the companies with the right combination of attributes to survive  TGR  So as painful as this has been for all of us over the last couple of years  after listening to these speakers  are you ready to say you welcome a down market for the opportunity it affords  DG  Absolutely  And as I said  it was a complete wakeup call for me  Until participating in the webinar  I had completely stopped paying attention to the sector  Now I am completely re engaged and talking to my broker again  TGR  Thank you for taking the time to talk to us  DG  It was nice to be with you  The free  Downturn Millionaires  How to Make a Fortune in Beaten

121393,342908,NYT,Rehn Calls Out France As Weak Link In Eurozone,opinion,The euro stumbled on Thursday morning and traded down to  1 30  Growing financial  political and social problems in the region have been weighing on the common currency recently  and many aren t expecting a resolution anytime soon The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs  Olli Rehn  warned that France is beginning to pose a large risk for the region on Wednesday Speaking at the presentation of a report which compared the health and competitiveness of eurozone economies  Rehn pointed out that France s size and position in the eurozone makes its health an important factor in the bloc s success The French trade balance has been falling since 1997 and though it avoided recession in 2010 and 2011  growth prospects for the future look bleak  France s labor market makes it difficult to reallocate workers to make the economy more efficient and for this reason  the report stated that French companies have the lowest profit margin in the eurozone He also pointed to Italy as a key factor in the European recovery  saying that labor costs in the country are bringing down productivity  The smaller  more specialized Italian companies are slowly being replaced by larger  more productive competitors in places like China According to the New York Times  the eurozone s gross domestic product is expected to contract 0 3 percent in 2013 The drop in GDP will be hard hitting  especially to those countries which are still trying to fix imbalances that allowed them to borrow more money than they were able to repay Rehn reiterated criticism of the bloc s austerity centered recovery plan  and called on Germany to help spur spending and kick start economic growth  Much like Jacob Lew  the US Treasury Secretary who met with European lawmakers earlier in the week  Rehn believes Germany holds the key to a swift recovery BY Laura Brodbeck,2013-04-11,Benzinga ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rehn-calls-out-france-as-weak-link-in-eurozone-162613,162613
121394,342909,NYT,Big Trade  Little Door,opinion,In ordinary times  the terrorist attack at the finish line of the Boston Marathon  officials are being careful not to call it  terrorism   but I m not an official so I can operate in the reality sphere  would absolutely trump anything that happened in the markets today and  in fact  would likely have been the cause of any market movement that actually occurred  That s because most of the time markets echo the framework of the rest of reality  most of the universe is space  and most market activity is just empty noise  This is the reason that traders who are continuously transacting in the markets are called  noise traders   But on Monday  there was plenty of market action and it had nothing to do with Boston  nor with the  from North Korea to South Korea  which stated that military action would  start immediately    N b   There were many losers today  but one of them surely must be reckoned as Kim Jong un  A tin pot dictator makes a threat  and is almost immediately knocked off the front page of the New York Times by events in Boston  That must really annoy him   Before the attack in Boston  however  there was already plenty of financial pain  The carnage in the precious metals pits came right on cue after the negative sell side reports of late last week had a chance to work on the psyches of investors  Gold fell 10   and silver nearly 14   This represents the worst two day fall in gold in thirty years  And  while  that the commodity  super cycle  certainly doesn t look like one  I can understand how the picture of gold in real terms looks like it may be completing something big  see chart of gold expressed in December 2012 dollars using CPI  source Bloomberg  There is considerable concern tonight that these losses may provoke selling in related markets as investors raise funds to meet margin calls  This is possible  although significant thumpings in the past in precious metals  it isn t like this is the first time we ve seen volatility in a commodity  didn t provoke dramatic related market action  To be sure  the avalanche is much more loaded now than it has been in the past  with equity markets sharply overvalued and investors already reaching a level of disgust with commodities  But I don t think it goes too far   Those may be my famous last words  What happened in gold and silver is a function of the big trade little door syndrome  more than anything else  News outlets blamed the weak data yesterday in the U S  and the small miss in Chinese GDP  7 7  versus 8 0  expected  but keep in mind that we all know these are made up numbers  for setting off the wave of selling  but that s just the latest straw  The break of technical levels on Friday  combined with the suddenly burning desire of hedgies to not be the last one through the little door  is what led to such a dramatic move today  It may well continue until everyone who wants to get through the little door has done so  Or  it may not   but I would admonish an investor who wants to buy gold here to think like a trader rather than a playground monitor  don t try to break up the fight  If the hedgies want to eat each other in a fight to get to the door  let them And  incidentally  remember that the big trade little door syndrome is not limited to gold and silver  Think about equity exposures too  If you re long by policy  fine  But if you re long stocks and feeling uncomfortable about it  then  sell down to the sleeping point  at least The irony of the timing of the gold rout is potentially juicy  with CPI tomorrow  The decline in precious metals is happening partly because so many investors are abruptly convinced that inflation has truly been defeated  It is incredible to me that this belief is so widespread  but perhaps this is the sine qua non for the next washout in financial markets and the setup for the long awaited up move in commodities  for  although the  super cycle  is evidently just now ending according to some observers  commodities prices have been in general decline for the last two years  Growth is falling short of expectations  but that doesn t have any implications for inflation  Tomorrow s CPI is forecast to be flat and  0 2  on core  holding core inflation constant at 2 0   Sentiment appears to be favoring a shortfall in those figures  but it is my belief that we are on the cusp of the next sustained move higher in core inflation  to be led by housing  Remember that the last two CPI figures haven t exactly been soothing  Two months ago  core inflation was  0 3  when the market was expecting  0 2   Last month  all eight major subgroups of CPI accelerated on a year on year basis  the first time that has ever happened since the current 8 subgroups have been in existence  I am loathe to pick the month where we re going to see Owners  Equivalent Rent finally break higher  because econometric lags are not written in stone  But it ought to be soon When it happens  expect sell side economists and pundits of all stripes  to say nothing of the Federal Reserve  to downplay the significance of it  I wouldn t expect a sudden rally in commodities or a rebound in breakevens  10 year breakevens are at the lows of the year  mainly because rates on the whole are declining   10y TIPS yields are also within 3bps of the year s low   but it might help stop the bleeding ,2013-04-16,Michael Ashton,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-trade,-little-door-163035",163035

121425,342940,NYT,WRAPUP 9 Obama makes historic White House visit,news,"  Obama at White House to talk economy  war  transition
   Obama urges Bush to back fast aid for US auto industry
   Obama plans no Cabinet announcement this week
   Obama advisers reviewing Bush executive orders
 By Matt Spetalnick and Deborah Charles
 WASHINGTON  Nov 10  Reuters    U S  President elect Barack
Obama visited the White House on Monday for his first
post election meeting with President George W  Bush  a
strikingly symbolic moment in the transition of power 
 Obama  who will take office on Jan  20 with the country
close to recession  urged Bush to back immediate emergency aid
for the struggling U S  automakers  The New York Times
reported 
 The president and first lady Laura Bush greeted the newly
elected president and his wife  Michelle  with smiles and
handshakes  even as Obama s advisers reviewed some of Bush s
executive orders with an eye to reversing them after he is
sworn in on Jan  20 
 The two men met privately in the Oval Office for over an
hour in talks thought to have encompassed the global financial
crisis  the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other daunting
challenges the Republican president will bequeath to his
Democratic successor 
 It was their first face to face encounter following Obama s
resounding victory over Republican John McCain in Tuesday s
election  which will make him the United States  first black
president 
 Obama  47  had repeatedly attacked Bush s  failed policies 
on the campaign trail  and the Illinois senator swept to power
on a theme of change    specifically  change from the unpopular
president s approach to economics and foreign affairs 
 Top congressional Democrats have asked the Bush
administration to consider aid to the automakers through the
financial bailout initiative that has so far covered banks and
other financial services companies  and Obama urged Bush to act
quickly at their meeting  according to The New York Times 
 Citing people familiar with their discussion  the Times
said Bush indicated he might support some aid for the auto
industry and a broader economic stimulus package if Obama
dropped his opposition to a free trade pact with Colombia 
 Obama s aides say after taking office he will likely move
quickly to roll back Bush s executive orders that limit stem
cell research and expand oil and gas drilling in some areas 
 But members of Obama s team cautioned on Monday he had not
yet decided whether to reverse executive orders 
 There was no outward sign of tension  however  when the
Obamas stepped from their limousine at the south portico of the
White House  Earlier  they had been cheered by crowds of
onlookers as their motorcade sped through the capital 
  Good morning   Laura Bush chirped  though it was well past
noon 
 Obama put his hand on Bush s back cordially as the two
couples entered the mansion  The leaders then strolled down the
colonnade side by side  chatting  Obama was the more animated
of the two  gesturing with both hands  He had never set foot in
the Oval Office before and was ushered in ahead of Bush 
 While their husbands met  the first lady gave Michelle
Obama a tour of the White House living quarters  which will
soon be her family s new home and where daughters Malia  10 
and Sasha  7  will be running the halls 
 SENSE OF URGENCY
 At the end of a two hour visit  Bush and Obama had nothing
to say to reporters and both camps were mostly tight lipped 
 White House spokeswoman Dana Perino would only say that
domestic and international issues were discussed and that Bush
 again pledged a smooth transition  
 Obama spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said the leaders agreed
on the need to cooperate in the changeover  in light of the
nation s many critical economic and security challenges  
 Later  as Obama s plane sat on the airport tarmac in
Washington before taking off for Chicago  journalists onboard
overheard snippets of a cell phone conversation the
president elect had with an unknown party 
  I am not going to be spending too much time in Washington
over the next several weeks   Obama said 
 Newly elected presidents traditionally visit the White
House between election and inauguration but usually wait longer
than Obama did  He came calling at Bush s invitation after only
six days  underscoring a sense of urgency in the transition 
 It will be the first wartime transfer of power in four
decades and comes amid economic upheaval at home and abroad 
 Financial markets  struggling in a global credit crunch 
are awaiting news of Obama s appointments for key jobs such as
Treasury secretary  but a spokeswoman for Obama said on Monday
he would not make any Cabinet announcements this week 
 Obama said in his first post election news conference on
Friday he would not be rushed into making hasty decisions 
 Underscoring Obama s assertion he will not act as a shadow
president during the transition  an aide confirmed what the
White House had been saying    that he will not attend a global
financial summit in Washington on Friday and Saturday 
 Bush  whose low approval ratings helped propel Obama to
victory  has said he will do all he can to help in the
changeover 
 Though visits by incoming presidents to the White House
before taking office are a ritual dating back decades  there
was little denying Obama s tour carried special significance 
 The son of a black father from Kenya and white mother from
Kansas  Obama made history by winning the presidency  an
achievement seen as a breakthrough in U S  race relations

 NEW YORK  Nov 11  Reuters    The White House said on
Tuesday President George W  Bush did not link support for
economic stimulus measures or further aid for U S  automakers
to congressional passage of free trade pacts in a meeting with
President elect Barack Obama 
  The president did not suggest a quid pro quo   White House
spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters 
 However  she said Bush did speak to Obama about the merits
of free trade during their meeting at the White House on
Monday 
  They did speak about a range of issues both domestic and
international and they did spend some time talking about the
economy   Perino said 
  But in no way did President Bush suggest that there was a
quid pro quo when it came to the Colombia free trade agreement
or the other free trade agreements  
 The New York Times  citing people familiar with the
discussion  reported that Bush indicated he might support
further aid to struggling automakers and a broader economic
stimulus package if Democrats in Congress dropped opposition to
a free trade pact with Colombia

121428,342943,NYT,UPDATE 4 Obama  Congress leaders to meet Monday on economy,news," Adds  buy American  comments  paragraphs 2  6 7 
 By Donna Smith
 WASHINGTON  Jan 2  Reuters    Both President elect Barack
Obama and Vice President elect Joe Biden will huddle with
Democratic and Republican congressional leaders on Monday to
try to advance a huge economic stimulus bill that Obama hopes
can be enacted quickly  despite Republican reservations 
 Obama s transition team said it is mulling  buy American 
provisions for the stimulus package that could favor U S 
companies over foreign competitors 
 Leadership aides in Congress said Obama s meeting is set to
begin around 3 p m  EST  2000 GMT  on Monday 
 But in the run up to the meeting  Republicans on Capitol
Hill were warning their Democratic counterparts that
legislation to improve the worsening U S  economy should not
spend too much money on government funded projects and should
not be rushed through Congress without adequate review 
 Democrats have been hoping to deliver the plan    which
could cost  675 billion to  775 billion or more    to Obama on
Jan  20  the day he becomes president  or shortly thereafter 
 One element of the plan could be  buy American  language
benefiting U S  industry   We are reviewing the buy American
proposal and we are committed to a plan that will save or
create 3 million jobs including jobs in manufacturing   Obama
transition spokeswoman Jen Psaki said by e mail 
 The New York Times on Friday quoted Daniel DiMicco 
chairman and chief executive of steel maker Nucor Corp  as
saying the steel industry was asking Obama to  deal with the
worst economic slowdown in our lifetime through a recovery
program that has in every provision a  buy America  clause  
 The newly elected Congress is to be sworn in on Tuesday   
two weeks before Obama  Hearings could push a final package
well into February 
 The Democrats  who have a majority in Congress  want the
economic stimulus to include tax relief for the middle class
and spending on schools  roads and other infrastructure 
States  which increasingly are having difficulties paying
health care costs for the poor  also would get federal money 
  1 TRILLION 
 But Republicans have voiced concern about possible waste
and say the tab could reach  1 trillion 
  I am concerned by media reports that suggest the
Democrats  emerging proposal may cost taxpayers up to 1
trillion in new government spending  with little debate or
public scrutiny of the still unseen legislation   House
Republican Leader John Boehner said in a statement on Friday 
  Let s be clear  it is essential that this legislation be
debated in a fair  open  and honest way   he said 
 At least five Democratic governors say  1 trillion is
necessary  The five  from New York  New Jersey  Massachusetts 
Ohio and Wisconsin  said on a conference call on Friday they
would like the package to include  250 billion for education
funding   250 billion for social services such as the Medicaid
health insurance program  and  500 billion for infrastructure 
 Massachusetts Gov  Deval Patrick said infrastructure should
be defined to include public housing  the power grid  and
electronic medical records as well as roads and bridges 
 Although the Democrats increased their majority in the
100 member Senate in the November election  they still need
Republican support to advance legislation 
 A Senate Republican aide  who asked not to be identified 
said Democrats could gain stronger  bipartisan support with an
economic stimulus measure costing less    about  500 billion 
 Global financial markets rallied on Friday  partly due to
hope that a stimulus bill will move through Congress soon 
 The meeting with Obama and Biden would include nine leaders
from the Senate and House of Representatives  including House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 
both Democrats  Republicans attending would include Boehner and
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell  aides said 
 Republicans said although their numbers in the Senate and
House were depleted in the election that brought Obama to
power  they would not rubber stamp a huge new spending plan 
  We hope that Democrats in Congress don t attempt to shut
the American taxpayer out of this process by trying to pass a
bill that hasn t been the subject of bipartisan review and that
hasn t been available for public inspection   McConnell said in
a statement on Friday 
 He and Boehner have called for extensive hearings to
scrutinize the economic plan

121430,342945,NYT,Lack of fame aids Geithner over US tax mistake,news,"By Matthew Bigg
 ATLANTA  Jan 15  Reuters    Timothy who 
 Wall Street knows all about him  but among ordinary
Americans on Main Street  the hiccup to a smooth nomination for
Timothy Geithner as the next U S  Treasury secretary seems
barely to have registered 
 President elect Barack Obama s pick appears to have avoided
sustained criticism over his admission that he did not pay all
of his taxes    partly because he is so little known 
  I don t know anything about it  the controversy   Did it
just come up in the last couple days   asked Bill Reynolds  48 
a printer in Cincinnati  Ohio  when asked about the issue  His
response was echoed by others in U S  cities on Thursday 
 Geithner s confirmation for the job by the U S  Senate
looked straightforward until Geithner    who is president of
the New York Federal Reserve    told a Senate panel this week
he had made mistakes over taxes while working for the
International Monetary Fund in 2001 2003 
 Geithner also said there had been a lapse in a
housekeeper s work papers during her employment by his family 
 Geithner is a familiar face on Wall Street but only 1
percent of people interviewed for a survey published on
Thursday by the Pew Research Center could name Geithner as one
of Obama s cabinet picks  Obama  a Democrat  takes office next
Tuesday 
 By contrast  56 percent could name former first lady and
former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  Obama s choice
for secretary of State 
  He is not a household name by any stretch  This is a
fairly low visibility appointment  not that the economy is
unimportant   said Michael Dimock  associate director at Pew 
 Obama aides have called the errors honest mistakes 
Geithner has amended his tax returns to repay about  42 700 in
back taxes and interest and several Republicans say they do not
expect the issue to derail his nomination 
 Even so  taxes are a sensitive issue in the United States 
where many people see taxes as an infringement on their
financial rights  Some people who were aware of Geithner s tax
problem were not happy about it 
  I don t understand why they would even entertain the idea
of appointing someone like that to that position  I mean  if
he s avoiding taxes or evading taxes  that s a basic American
responsibility that we all have   said Francis Charfauros  a
manager of a coffee shop in Scottsdale  Arizona 
 Others echoed disapproval of Geithner  including Trinette
McCrary  39  who works in a dental office in Chicago 
  I don t think it s fair  He s supposed to be a leader on
the economy and he didn t pay his taxes  That s just weird  
McCrary said 
 The little loved Internal Revenue Service is an
agency of the Treasury Department 
  TAINTED  
 Obama is taking office basking in wide public approval and
with a Democratic majority in both the U S  Senate and House of
Representatives 
 The New York Times said that despite the urgency of
nominating a Treasury secretary at a time when the United
States is facing its worst recession since World War Two  the
tax issue should not be overlooked 
  In a time of economic peril  the nation cannot afford a
Treasury secretary with a tainted ability to command respect
and instill confidence   the paper said in an editorial 
 Geithner s confirmation hearing is set for next Wednesday 
which could work against Geithner if it gives time for the
story to grow 
 Conservative talk show hosts Rush Limbaugh and Neal Boortz
said the flap over Geithner s taxes was not more prominent
because some news outlets had played it down to boost Obama 
  The word in Washington is that this was an innocent
mistake  Since when does the IRS  Internal Revenue Service 
acknowledge the concept of an innocent mistake   Boortz said on
his website

121431,342946,NYT,UPDATE 2 Obama pushes stimulus plan  meets economic team,news," Adds report Obama planning to tighten US financial regulations 
paragraphs 9 11 
 By David Alexander
 WASHINGTON  Jan 24  Reuters    President Barack Obama
sought to build public support on Saturday for an  825 billion
economic recovery plan  pledging in his weekly radio address to
use the funds to create jobs  improve healthcare and expand
renewable energy 
 The new president  who took office on Tuesday amid the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression  also met
with his economic advisers on Saturday after several days of
lobbying lawmakers for quick passage of the stimulus package he
advocates to lift the economy out of a yearlong recession 
 In addition to the stimulus plan  the administration is
working on reforms and new uses for the second half of the
Troubled Asset Relief Program  the  700 billion financial
rescue fund that Congress approved last year 
 The new money from the fund was expected to be used to
stabilize the the housing market  strengthen core U S  banks
and support credit markets to spur lending for autos  homes 
small businesses  commercial real estate  college students and
municipalities 
 The plan could be released as early as next week but would
more likely come the following week  a Treasury official said 
 With new signs of weakness in the financial industry  The
Washington Post said on Saturday that lawmakers were bracing
for a request for new funding for the federal bailout program 
but the Treasury official declined to comment on the report 
 The White House released few details of the economic team
meeting  saying only that  the president met with his economic
team again this morning to discuss the week s developments on
the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment plan and proposals going
forward including the budget  
 The session included Larry Summers  director of the
Economic Policy Council  Peter Orszag  director of the Office
of Management and Budget  and other aides and advisers  the
White House said  Treasury Secretary designate Timothy Geithner
did not attend because he has not yet been confirmed by the
Senate  said one official  The Senate is expected to vote on
his nomination on Monday 
 Late on Saturday  the New York Times said the Obama
administration plans to tighten the U S  financial regulatory
system  including stricter rules for hedge funds  credit rating
agencies and mortgage brokers 
 The broad changes include increased oversight of the
complex financial instruments that helped spawn the current
economic crisis  the newspaper said on its website 
 The newspaper based its story on interviews with officials
as well as confirmation hearings for senior administration
appointees  and a recent report by an international committee led
by Paul Volcker  one of Obama s chief economic advisers 
 Obama used his first weekly radio and Internet video address
as president to press the case for quick passage of the economic
recovery plan 
 Saying more people filed for unemployment this week than at
any time in the past 26 years  Obama warned joblessness could
hit double digits and the economy could fall  1 trillion short
of its full capacity if nothing was done 
  If we do not act boldly and swiftly  a bad situation could
become dramatically worse   he said  Obama hopes to sign an
economic recovery plan into law within a month 
 The White House posted a four page report on its website 
  on Saturday outlining the impact of the
stimulus plan  Aides said the report began to put  meat on the
bones  of Obama s previously stated goals 
 ENERGY EFFICIENCY
 Obama said the economic recovery plan would save or create
3 million to 4 million jobs while investing in clean energy
development  education and improving health care efficiency 
 He said he intended to double the U S  capacity to generate
energy from renewable sources like wind  solar and biofuels 
and also discussed building a new electricity grid with 3 000
miles  4 800 km  of transmission lines 
  We ll save taxpayers  2 billion a year by making 75
percent of federal buildings more energy efficient   he said 
 The plan also includes a Clean Energy Financing Initiative
with loan guarantees and other financing mechanisms that aim to
encourage  100 billion in private sector clean energy financing
in three years  an aide said 
 The president said the economic recovery program included
funds to computerize the country s health records in five
years  which he said would improve health care and save
billions of dollars 
 The recovery program includes what one aide said was  the
single largest investment in preventive health care in our
nation s history  to ensure people receive immunizations and
get help to stop smoking and reduce obesity  Officials did not
place a dollar figure on the program 
 Obama said the plan also had financing to modernize
schools  repair roads and expand mass transit

121432,342947,NYT,Obama plans fast action on financial regulation NYT,news,"NEW YORK  Jan 24  Reuters    The Obama administration plans to
tighten the nation s financial regulatory system  including
stricter federal rules for hedge funds  credit rating agencies and
mortgage brokers  the New York Times reported in Sunday editions 
 The broad changes include increased oversight of the complex
financial instruments that helped spawn the current economic
crisis  the newspaper said on its website Saturday night 
 The newspaper based its story on interviews with officials as
well as confirmation hearings for senior administration
appointees  and a recent report by an international committee led
by Paul Volcker  one of President Obama s chief economic
advisers 
 These officials want rules that would eliminate conflicts of
interest at credit rating agencies that gave top investment grades
to the ultimately shaky financial instruments that have been one
source of market turmoil 
 The officials pointed out that under the present system  the
agencies are paid by companies to help them structure financial
instruments    which the agencies then grade 
  Until we deal with the compensation model  we re not going to
deal with the conflict of interest and people are not going to
have confidence that the ratings are worth relying on  worth the
paper they re printed on   the newspaper quoted the newly
confirmed Securities and Exchange Commission head Mary Schapiro as
saying 
 Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner made similar written
and verbal comments before Senate Finance Committee  it said 
 The officials said the Obama administration has embraced
one of the themes of the Volcker report as a guiding principle   
that major companies and financial instruments that are mostly
unsupervised must be brought back under a larger regulatory
umbrella 
 While some actions will be require legislation  others
should be achievable through regulations adopted by federal
agencies  the Times said 
 FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR BROKERS
 The administration plans to propose new federal standards for
mortgage brokers who issued often unsuitable loans  but have been
mostly regulated by the states  They are also considering having
the SEC become more involved in supervising the underwriting
standards of mortgage backed securities  it added 
 Other goals include requiring that derivatives like credit
default swaps    insurance against loan defaults which were
central to the financial collapse    be traded through a
central clearinghouse and possibly on one or more exchanges 
 Additionally  the plan may include a broader role for the
Federal Reserve in protecting the economy from companies whose
troubles pose systemwide risks  as the report issued this month
under Volcker proposed 
 Officials have also begun studying ways to control executive
compensation  the Times said 
 Another component will provide the strategy for how the
government will go about shoring up the flagging banking industry 
the newspaper said 
 Senior aides vow to move quickly on the new financial
regulatory plan  it said

121435,342950,NYT,Is USA Government Debt Finally Under Control ,opinion,You should be concerned with those who claim debt is subsiding  and therefore the government should continue high spending to stimulate the economy  Paul Krugman in a  stated  But after peaking in 2009 at  1 4 trillion  the deficit began coming down  The  the deficit for fiscal 2013  which began in October and is almost half over  to be  845 billion  That may still sound like a big number  but given the state of the economy it really isn t  Bear in mind that the budget doesn t have to be balanced to put us on a fiscally sustainable path  all we need is a deficit small enough that debt grows more slowly than the economy  To take the classic example  America never did pay off the debt from World War II   in fact   in the 30 years that followed the war  But debt  of G D P  fell by three quarters over the same period  Right now  a sustainable deficit would be around   The surprise for most is that Professor Krugman is correct in what he said  The reality is that there are a few big but s  Here are four reasons to be concerned with any rationale which says debt build issue is behind us  1  Since 1965 Debt Size Does Correlate with Debt Percent of GDP  There is a very high correlation between size of debt and percent of GDP  2  Debt Constrains Economic Performance  There is enough evidence that sovereign debt constrains economic performance  From   Carmen M  Reinhart  Vincent R  Reinhart  and Kenneth S  Rogoff   We identify 26 episodes of public debt overhang where debt to GDP ratios exceed 90  of GDP since 1800  We find that in 23 of these 26 episodes  individual countries experienced lower growth than the average of other years  Across all 26 episodes  growth is lower by an average of 1 2    If this effect sounds modest  consider that the average duration of debt overhang episodes was 23 years  3  Economic Forecasts Never Forecast a Recession The Great Recession ended in 2009  When will the next recession hit  According to the Congressional Budget Office s data which Professor Krugman used   never  This just does not stack up against history   hat tip to Wikipedia for table below   Time Between Recessions in the USA  Recently recessions have occurred between 6 to 10 years following the end of the previous recession  The probability is that the next big one hits between 2015 and 2019  Where is the rainy day debt reduction  Again quoting Professor Krugman  Smart fiscal policy involves having the government spend when the private sector won t  supporting the economy when it is weak and reducing debt only when it is strong  Professor Krugman goes on to argue the economy is not strong   which requires more government debt  The problem is the next recession will hit without debt reduction and then the government will be forced to add to the debt because  the private sector won t   4  Using Economic Growth Forecasts to Argue the USA Will Reduce the Debt Economic forecasts are imaginary situations   and the longer the timeframe of the forecast  the more  Alice in Wonderland  it becomes  Going back to the referenced CBO study  they predicted nominal gdp to hit 6  or better in years 2015 to 2017  If one uses real GDP at 2    the results are significantly different for the possibility of debt reduction   Even if the CBO forecast is correct  the debt starts growing in 2018 with only and relatively insignificant reduction in the meantime  Never even coming close to getting under 90  of GDP  And who knows what the sequester talks will bring  Conclusion There is way too much evidence to believe it is safe for the government to go on a spending spree considering the current size of USA sovereign debt  Yet Professor Krugman may be correct that a pulse in government spending might be needed to reignite the economy to levels last seen in the 1990 s  The USA likely has few other choices than to nuke some or all of its debt to get it back to manageable levels  or simply stop accounting for it  The large size of the debt is limiting economic options  Other Economic News this Week  The Econintersect economic forecast for  continues to show weak but somewhat improving growth  The supply chain contraction we saw last month has dissipated with all of our check methods of measuring the economy clearly in expansion territory  ECRI now believes  in July 2012

121436,342951,NYT,Ten Years On  New Estimates Of The Economic Cost Of The Wars In Iraq,opinion,This week marks the tenth anniversary of the American invasion of Iraq  What have the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost the United States to date  What additional bills will come due in the future  Economists and budget analysts have made many estimates since the early 2000s  Only one regularity has emerged from their work  Each new round of estimates is higher than those before  Last week the  at Brown University released a new set of estimates  The numbers are  on the web site of the institute s Cost of War project and detailed in a  by Professor Neta C  Crawford  The institute s estimate of the total cost of the two wars now comes to just under  4 trillion  It wasn t supposed to cost so much The wars were not supposed to cost so much  As the administration of President George W  Bush was building a case for the Iraq war in 2002  with some 5 000 American troops already deployed in Afghanistan  the question of cost naturally came up  In September of that year  Lawrence B  Lindsey  then Chairman of the President s Council of Economic Advisers  estimated that a new Iraq war would cost  100 billion  maybe  200 billion at a maximum  With a midterm election on the horizon  the White House viewed that estimate as shockingly high  The President quickly dismissed Lindsey  Many observers saw his war cost estimate as a major reason  Later that year  Mitchel E  Daniels Jr   then head of the Office of Management and Budget  told the  that  50 to  60 billion would be a more realistic figure  the same or a bit less than the cost of the 1991 Gulf War  As it turned out  the cost of the Iraq war came to  770 billion over the next twelve years  measured by Defense Department appropriations alone  DoD appropriations for Afghanistan added another  609 billion  pushing the cost of the two wars to well over a trillion  or  1 379 billion to be exact  The following chart  which gives the year by year tally  makes Lindsey s estimates  let alone Daniels s  look preposterously optimistic Getting to Four Trillion  1 379 billion is a lot of money  but it still isn t  4 trillion  How do we get from the total DoD appropriations to the larger cost figure that Crawford gives  We start by adding in three budget items that represent war expenditures by agencies other than DoD  The State Department and U S  AID spent some  84 billion on reconstruction and development aid in Iraq and Afghanistan  Next comes  19 billion in military aid to Pakistan  Operation Noble Eagle added another  29 billion  largely for mobilizing the National Guard for homeland security operations  That brings the total to just over  1 510 billion  There is more  The Watson Institute study attributes several more expenditure categories either to the war itself or the climate of war that shaped U S  policy decisions after 9 11  These include   135 billion for medical care and benefits of Iraq and Afghan war veterans An estimated  743 billion in additions to the Pentagon s base budget  Although these funds were not spent directly in the war theaters  the researchers believe they would not have been appropriated had the wars not been undertaken  455 billion for homeland security  Again  the assumption is made that much or all of this spending would not have been undertaken but for the war and climate of war  130 billion in additional spending on war operations and war related base budget for 2014 We are now up to  2 973 billion  roughly  3 trillion  through the projected end of Afghan combat operations in 2014  However  the costs of war will have a long tail that extends for decades after American troops come home  One of the biggest components will be future expenditures for medical care and other benefits for war veterans  The Institute estimates those at  754 billion through 2053  for a total of  3 727 billion  Finally  there are interest payments  For the most part the wars were financed by borrowing  so the above costs added directly to the federal debt  The Institute study calculates the interest costs of war borrowing at  254 billion through the end of FY 2012  We have now arrived at Watson Institute s figure of just under  4 trillion  The Institute suggests that possible future interest payments might eventually add as much as  7 trillion more  but that is far more speculative  Although we can fairly say that war costs added directly to federal deficits in the early years  more recently the size of those deficits and the accumulated debt have begun to affect both taxes and spending for other programs  Without past war expenditures  the federal debt at the end of 2012 would have been about 51 percent of GDP rather than the actual 71 percent  That would have reduced the pressure to raise taxes as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations at the end of 2012 and to cut spending by letting the sequester go into effect in 2013  From 2012 on  then  it becomes less reasonable to say that the federal debt would be dollar for dollar lower without the wars  Saying that does not diminish the budgetary opportunity cost of war expenditures  It just means that as we go forward  we may bear them in the form of a squeeze on other programs or higher taxes rather than as interest payments on war debt  What about the cost of human life  The Watson Institute study addresses only the budgetary costs of the war  Beyond that  there are human costs  Most people would agree that the human costs of war are beyond quantification  and for the most part  I would go along with that  Still  to help put the budgetary costs of the war in perspective  we could try applying statistical value of life methodology to war casualties  Various U S  agencies apply statistical values of life to evaluate costs and benefits of life saving policy measures like improving road safety or reducing air pollution  Courts use statistical value of life numbers in awarding compensation for accidental death  The values of life used in such situations come  among other sources  from studies of the extra pay required to compensate for differences in risk of death among various occupations  These highly imperfect numbers tend to run in the range of  6 to  8 million for the life of an American of working age  The same method can be used to calculate proportionately smaller values for the reduction in quality of life as the result of disability  Just as a back of the envelope exercise  suppose we imagine what the additional budgetary cost would have been if the U S  government had paid a death benefit of  7 million dollars for each service member killed in action and a  1 million cash benefit for pain and suffering to each person wounded in combat  Applying those numbers to 5 200 killed and 50 000 wounded would add about another  85 billion to the cost of the war  That does not include the statistical value of life of more than 1 000 American soldiers and contractors who died from noncombat causes in the two war theaters  or the almost 1 400 allied military personnel who died there  The Watson Institute also  that between 158 000 and 202 000 civilians have been killed in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Pakistan during the war  I won t even pretend to suggest what statistical value of life would fairly compensate those war victims and their families  Pick your own number  multiply it out  and add it to the total  The bottom line Many people will object to the entire premise of the Watson Institute study and of this post  They will say that the dollar cost of the war and the statistical value of the lives lost in it are completely beside the point  The war was never about economics  it was about national security  national honor  and bringing peace and democracy to oppressed peoples in far away lands  Still  one can t help but wonder  If Congress had been told that the price tag would be not  50 billion  but  4 trillion  would it have voted so overwhelmingly for the Iraq War Resolution of October 2  2002 ,2013-03-18,Ed

121439,342954,NYT,The Great Cyprus Bank Robbery  No Bank Account Is Safe,opinion,The Great Cyprus Bank Robbery Shows That No Bank Account  No Retirement Fund And No Stock Portfolio Is SafeThe global elite have now proven that when the chips are down they are going to go after any big pile of money that they think they can get their hands on  That means that no bank account  no retirement fund and no stock portfolio on earth is safe  Up until now  most people assumed that private bank accounts were untouchable and that deposit insurance actually meant something  Now we see that there is no pile of money that is considered  off limits  by the global elite and deposit insurance means absolutely nothing  The number one thing that any financial system depends on is faith  If people do not have faith in the safety and stability of a financial system  it will not work  Well  the people that rule the world have just taken a sledgehammer to the trust that we all had in the global financial system  They have broken the unwritten social contract that global banking depends on  So now we will see a run on the banks  and this will not just be limited to a few countries in southern Europe  Rather  this will be worldwide in scope  Yoda may have put it this way   Begun  the global bank run has   All over the world  frightened people are going to start pulling money out of the banks  A lot of that money will go into gold  silver and other hard assets  And as money starts coming out of the banks  this could cause many of the large banks that have been teetering on the edge of disaster to finally collapse  Many of you may not believe that they would ever come after bank accounts  retirement funds or stock portfolios in the United States  Many of you may be entirely convinced that the Great Cyprus Bank Robbery could never happen in America  Well  where do you think this whole plan was dreamed up  It was the IMF that reportedly pushed the hardest for the wealth tax in Cyprus  and the IMF is headquartered right in the heart of Washington D C  Almost every nation on the planet has to deal with the IMF  It is an organization that is dominated by the United States and that is always involved when there is an international debt crisis  If the IMF thinks that it is a great idea to steal from bank accounts to solve a financial crisis in Cyprus  why wouldn t they impose a similar solution in other countries in the future  And if bank accounts are no longer safe  are there any truly safe places to put your money  You can trust the politicians when they tell you that an unannounced  wealth tax  will never happen where you live if you want  but that is the exact same lie that the politicians in Cyprus were telling their people until the day that it happened  The following is from an article  And after all  President Anastasiades had emphatically declared in his inauguration speech that  absolutely no reference to a haircut on public debt or deposits will be tolerated   adding that  such an issue isn t even up for discussion   Finance Minister Michalis Sarris made similarly reassuring statements  arguing that it would be lunacy for the EU to impose such a measure because it would threaten the euro system  At this point  politicians in Cyprus have been given two very unappealing options  Either they vote yes on the wealth tax and destroy all faith in the banking system of Cyprus  or they vote no and they are forced out of the eurozone  In either case  we will probably see the financial system of Cyprus collapse and their economy plunge deep into depression  At this point  the vote has been delayed until Tuesday  Apparently some additional  arm twisting  was required to get the needed votes  And there have been proposals to change the terms of the wealth tax  Reportedly  some politicians want to impose a maximum rate of  on bank accounts of over 500 000 euros so that the rate on smaller accounts can be decreased  It has also been announced that the earliest that banks in Cyprus will reopen will be Thursday  But what is happening in Cyprus is small potatoes compared to how this will affect the rest of the world  The entire planet is watching this unfold  and as a recent article by Lucas Jackson described  faith in the global financial system is being greatly shaken It would be hard to over emphasize how significant the Cyprus situation is  The EU demonstrated under no uncertain circumstances that they will destroy the rule of law to maintain their own power  It was a recognition of tyranny that many of us have always assumed was the case but yesterday became reality  The damage done here is not related to the size of the haircut   currently discussed between 3 and 13    but rather that the legal language which each and every investor on the planet must rely on in order to maintain confidence in the system has been subordinated to the needs of the powerful elite  To the power elite making the major decisions in DC  London  Berlin  France  Brussels  et  al   laws are like ice cream  easily melted  Which begs the question  who is next  Will it be Portugal  Greece  Spain  Italy  France    Will they impose a  one time  tax on your bank account  Your house  Your stocks and bonds  Retirement accounts  The global elite have declared open season on all large piles of money  and now many people all over the world will consider taking money out of the bank to be the rational thing to do  This will especially be true in countries in southern Europe since they would probably be the next to have wealth confiscated  This is so abundantly clear that  understands this    It s as if the Europeans are holding up a neon sign  written in Greek and Italian  saying  time to stage a run on your banks   Tomorrow and the days immediately following should be very interesting  The global elite have truly  crossed the Rubicon  by going after private bank accounts  It is almost as if they purposely chose the most damaging solution possible to the financial crisis in Cyprus  Many in the financial world are absolutely stunned by all of this  For example  David Zervos is describing this move as a  nuclear war on savings and wealth  All of us should really take a moment to consider what the governments of Europe have done  To be clear  they initiated a surprise assault on the precautionary savings of their own people  Such a move should send shock waves across the entire population of the developed world  This was not a Bernanke style slow moving financial repression against risk free savings that is meant to stir up animal spirits and force risk taking  This is a nuclear war on savings and wealth   something that will likely crush animal spirits  This is a policy move you expect from a dictatorial regime in sub Saharan Africa  not in an EMU member state  If the European governments can clandestinely expropriate 7 to 10 percent of their hard working citizen s precautionary savings after the close of business on a Friday night  what else are they capable of doing  Why even hold money in a bank account  Are they trying to start a bank run  So what motivated the global elite to do this  According to   one of the motivations was to go after the Russians that had been using the banking system of Cyprus to launder money    Indeed  the IMF is reported to have been keen on the levy as a way to stem the flood of Russian money into the island over the last few years which has prompted   Russian money accounts for about 25 percent of all money in the banking system of Cyprus  and obviously the Russians  by what the IMF and the EU have decided to do  Even Vladimir Putin is loudly denouncing this move  Russian President Vladimir Putin called the tax  unfair  unprofessional and dangerous   according to a statement posted on the Kremlin website  Russian companies and individuals have  31 billion of deposits in Cyprus  according to Moody s  And you haven t heard a lot about this in the western media  but the Russians have actually stepped forward and have offered to help Cyprus out of this jam  For example  there are reports that Russian investors  the two banks that were the primary cause of this bailout Officials have also said Russian investors are interested in buying a majority stake in Cyprus Popular Bank and increasing their holdings in Bank of Cyprus   the two biggest banks on the Mediterranean island  And according to   Gazprom has offered Cyprus a very large sum of money for the right to explore their offshore gas reserves that have not been developed yet The uncertainty comes as Russia s finance minister said his country would consider restructuring its loans to Cyprus  Russian energy giant Gazprom has also reportedly offered financial assistance to Cyprus in exchange for access to the island s gas reserves  So far the government of Cyprus has rejected the help of the Russians  but could they change their mind at some point  Apparently the Russians are offering enough money to completely fund the bank bailout According to   Gazprom made an offer over the weekend to the Cypriot government to fund the bank restructuring planned under the Cypriot bailout  which is set to cost up to  10bn  in exchange for exclusive exploration rights for Cypriot territorial waters  How reliable this story is remains to be seen  but it does hint at the geopolitical tension which we have been warning about  Gazprom is known to be very close to the Russian government and despite Russian President Vladimir Putin  the deposit tax   calling it  unfair  unprofessional and dangerous    it is unlikely that they would let this opportunity pass untouched  Fortunately  the Cypriot government is said to have rejected the deal off the bat  but if displeasure towards the eurozone and the EU grows  the Russian option may become increasingly appealing  It will be very interesting to see what happens  Meanwhile  some European officials are already suggesting that other nations in southern Europe should have a  wealth tax  imposed upon them  The following comes from an article  Joerg Kraemer  chief economist of the German Commerzbank  has called for private savings accounts in Italy to be similarly plundered   A tax rate of 15 percent on financial assets would probably be enough to push the Italian government debt to below the critical level of 100 percent of gross domestic product    A  tax  of 15 percent on all financial assets  Could you imagine if you woke up one morning and the government had decided to suddenly steal 15 percent of all the money that you had in bank accounts  retirement funds and stock portfolios  If I had a bank account in Italy I would be very nervous right about now  Under normal circumstances these kinds of things don t happen  but governments will use an  emergency  to justify all kinds of things  I recently came across an article that included a great quote by Herbert Hoover that put this beautifully   Every collectivist revolution rides in on a Trojan horse of  emergency   It was the tactic of Lenin  Hitler  and Mussolini  In the collectivist sweep over a dozen minor countries of Europe  it was the cry of men striving to get on horseback  And  emergency  became the justification of the subsequent steps  This technique of creating emergency is the greatest achievement that demagoguery attains   This is what the elite love to do  They love to create order out of chaos  And this is just the beginning  The Great Cyprus Bank Robbery was just a beta test for what is coming next  As the global financial system crumbles  the global elite are going to target our bank accounts  our retirement funds and our stock portfolios  You might want to start thinking about how you will protect yourself  So what are your thoughts on all of this  Please feel free to post a comment with your thoughts below ,2013-03-19,Michael T.

121440,342955,NYT,Yet More Of The Usual Eurocrisis Drama ,opinion,So the Cypriot parliament has rejected the terms of the Troika s rescue deal  Their finance minister is in Moscow and there were stories floating about that the quid pro quo for a Russian rescue of Cyprus would be a Russian naval base  via    Should the EU and NATO be concerned  I don t think so  The Russians had a chance to expand their geopolitical footprint in November but they passed  Here is what I wrote back then  see Europe dodges another bullet  Not the Catalan election    emphasis added   The wild card that I had been watching for is for Greece to turn to Russia instead of the Troika for financing  What if the Greeks got tired of the pain and turned to Putin for relief  Moscow has long had a historical desires for the warm waters of the Mediterranean for centuries  A financing deal could have shook up NATO and significantly shifted the geopolitical balance in the Eastern Med  The test case was Cyprus  Russian nationals have a large presence on that island  As its banks got into trouble because they were stuffed full of Greek debt  the Cyprus economy was in peril  As the  reported in June  The Russian government last year gave Cyprus a three year loan of 2 5 billion euros  or  3 1 billion at the current exchange rate  at a below market rate of 4 5 percent to help it service its debt  Cyprus now needs at least 1 8 billion euros  or  2 3 billion  by the end of this month to buttress its ailing banking sector  Instead of turning to the EU  they turned to Russia  emphasis added   Now many on this tiny island nation  whose banks and government are facing economic insolvency  are hoping for financial salvation from Russia rather than Germany and the European Union    I would much rather be saved by Moscow   said Elena Tsolia  30  an attendant at the department store Debenhams  where Russian shoppers snap up bottles of Dior and Chanel perfume   We are a small island and we don t want to be owned by Germany   I speculated that Russia could have not only rescued Cyprus  but Greece in return for naval basing rights  Cyprus would have been the test case of Russia flexing its financial and geopolitical muscle in the Eastern Med   Today Nicosia  tomorrow Athens  Can you say  Russian Black Sea fleet base in Athens  or Crete   So what happened  Cyprus turned back to the Troika instead of Moscow  A little noticed announcement came across my desk  The headline was   The Government of the Republic of Cyprus informed on the 25th of June 2012 the appropriate European Authorities of its decision to submit to euro area Member States a request of financial assistance from the EFSF ESM  Any talk of a rescue from Moscow is likely just that   talk  The Russians demonstrated their lack of interest in November when they had the chance Cypriot crisis tripwires Here is what I am watching for as signals that the markets believe that the Cyprus crisis is getting out of hand  The chart below shows the relative return of the ETF of Greek stocks  GREK  against large cap eurozone stocks  FEZ   The GREK FEZ ratio has declined and it is testing a relative support zone  Should it break support  then it s time to get more cautious I use this ratio for two reasons  Cypriot banks are highly exposed to Greek debt  As well  the Greek stock market is the high beta  canary in the coalmine  of risk in the eurozone Looking at a similar ratio of the Athens Index to the Euro STOXX 50  it gives me further comfort that the market isn t overly concerned about the Cyprus situation  This ratio isn t even testing the relative support level yet So take a deep breath and relax  The headlines represent the usual European negotiation drama in a crisis  with one or both sides leaking stories of catastrophe should there be no agreement On the other hand  the message from the markets is that this crisis will be resolved in a relatively benign manner  Listen to the markets  Calm down Disclosure

121463,342978,NYT,Herbalife Strife  Icahn   Ackman Duke It Out ,opinion,I have seen a lot of things in my two decades in the investment industry  but seeing a verbal cage fight between a senile 76 year old corporate raider and a white haired  46 year old Harvard grad makes for surprisingly entertaining viewing  The investment heavyweights I am referring to are the elder Carl Icahn  Chairman of Icahn Enterprises  and junior Bill Ackman  CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management  If getting a few billionaires yelling at each other on live TV is not enough to interest you  then how about adding some tongue laced f bombs coupled with blow by blow screaming from background traders  What s the source of the venomous  spitting hatred between these stock market tycoons  In short  it can be boiled down to a decade old lawsuit  profitable for both I might add   and a disagreement over the short position of a controversial stock  Herbalife  HLF   Regarding the legal spat  in 2003 the SEC was investigating Ackman while his Gotham Partners hedge fund was collapsing  so Ackman asked Icahn to buy shares of Hallwood Realty in hopes of salvaging his fund  Eventually  Icahn bought shares  but a difference in opinion over the transaction led to a lawsuit that Icahn lost  thereby forcing him to pay Ackman  9 million  Icahn also had a beef with Ackman s handling of Herbalife  Parading in front of hundreds of investors to self indulgently create a bear raid on an unsuspecting company is poor form in Icahn s view  and Carl wanted to make sure Ackman was aware of this investing faux pas  Normally  investing reporting over cable television is rather mundane  unless you consider entertainers like Jim Cramer yelling  booyah  amusing  On the other hand  if you enjoy billionaires embracing the spirit of the Jerry Springer Show by screaming purple faced profanities  then you should check out the CNBC cage fight in its entirety If you lack time in your busy schedule to soak in the full bloody battle  then here is a synopsis of my favorite highlights  Icahn on Ackman the  Crybaby    I really sort of have had it with this guy Ackman  I get a call from this Ackman guy  I m telling you  he s like the crybaby in the schoolyard  I went to a tough school in Queens  They used to beat up the little Jewish boys  He was like a little Jewish boy crying that the world was taking advantage of him   Ackman Referring to Icahn as a  Bully  and Himself as  Roadkill on the Hedge Fund Highway    Why did he  Icahn  threaten to sue me  He was a bully  Okay  I was not in a good place in my business career  I was under investigation by Spitzer  winding down my fund  There was negative press about Gotham Partners  I was short MBIA  MBI   They were aggressively attacking me and Carl Icahn thought this guy  Ackman  is roadkill on the hedge fund highway  This is not an honest guy  Icahn  who keeps his word  This is a guy who takes advantage of little people   Agitated Icahn Tearing a New One for Scott Wapner  CNBC Commentator    I didn t get on to be bullied by you  Wapner   I m going to talk about what I want to talk about  Okay  If you want to take that position  I will never go on CNBC  You can say what the hell you want  I m going to talk about what Ackman just said about me  not about Herbalife  I ll talk about Herbalife when I want to  not when you ask me  I m never going on a show with you again  that s for damn sure  Let s start with what I want to say  Ackman is a liar   Icahn on Another Ackman Rampage   I will tell you something  As far as I m concerned  he wanted to have dinner with me and I laughed  I couldn t figure out if he was the most sanctimonious guy or the most arrogant  the guy takes inordinate risk I don t have an investment with Ackman  I wouldn t have one if you paid me  if Ackman paid me to do it  I made a huge mistake getting involved with him After he won  the lawsuit   he planted some article in the New York Times pounding his chest telling the world how great he was  You know  as far as I m concerned the guy is a major loser   New CNBC Revenue Stream  There hasn t been this much fireworks since Professor  on the Pimco Boss s assessment that the  cult of equity is dying  last July  In retrospect  that minor tiff was child s play relative to the Icahn vs  Ackman battle  With CNBC viewership down from pre crisis levels  the network may strongly consider instituting a new pay per view revenue stream dedicated to battles between opposing investment enemies  I will even offer up my services to verbally smack down some of the enemies I ve written about previously  If my phones don t ring  then I can always offer up my American Investment Idol concept in which I can play Simon Cowell  This may or may not be the last round of the Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman fight  but the ultimate bragging rights may depend on the ultimate outcome of Ackman s Herbalife short  If Icahn makes a tender offer for Herbalife  I will anxiously wait for CNBC s Scott Wapner to invite Carl back on the show  I can hardly wait  Disclosure  Sidoxia Capital Management  SCM  and some of its clients hold positions in certain exchange

121464,342979,NYT,Germany Just Fired A Warning Shot At The Fed,opinion,Germany has the second largest Gold reserves in the world behind the US  Since the early  80s  it has stored the majority of these reserves with the NY Fed  45  vs  13  in London  11  in Paris and the remaining 31  in Frankfurt   With that in mind  everyone needs to be aware that last Monday Germany s Bundesbank announced it will be moving a major portion of its reserves from the US and all of its reserves from France back to Frankfurt  Nearly half of Germany s gold reserves are held in a vault at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   billions of dollars worth of postwar geopolitical history squirreled away for safe keeping below the streets of Lower Manhattan  Now the German central bank wants to make a big withdrawal   300 tons in all  On Wednesday  the Bundesbank said that it would begin moving some of the reserves  the second largest stock in the world after that of the United States  The goal is to house more than 50 percent of German gold in Bundesbank vaults in Frankfurt by 2020  up from a little less than a third today  the bank said  The new policy will include the complete withdrawal of 374 tons of German gold stored at the Banque de France in Paris  about 11 percent of the total  Bundesbank officials were quick to note that the decision was not a reflection of French trustworthiness  Rather  because France and Germany now share the euro  there is no need for reserves as insurance against currency crises  This announcement came with the usual political statements that the decision had nothing to do with a lack of trust between the Bundesbank and the US Fed or Bank of France  but the message is obvious  Germany sees the writing on the wall and is moving to secure its Gold reserves  Remember  Germany has spent the better part of two years preparing for financial chaos  Since the autumn of 2011  it has  1  Implemented legislation that would permit Germany to leave the Euro but remain a part of the EU  2  Revived its Special Financial Market Stabilization Funds  or SoFFin for short  allocating 480 billion Euros to the fund  and also providing German banks with a place to dump their Euro zone Government bonds if they need to   3  Implemented reforms that would allow it to close off its borders for as long as 30 days if it needed to  so individuals and capital couldn t leave Germany  4  Created a working group to assess both the economic impact of a Greek exit from the Euro as well as how to manage the impact of a collapse in France  5  Pulling all of its Gold from France as well as a major portion of its Gold from the US  All of these are verifiable facts that the Western Media has avoided talking about  It is very easy to connect the dots here  Germany is implementing a contingency plan to put a firewall around its financial system for when the EU finally breaks down  A final note here  the tension between the world s Central Banks just increased dramatically  Since the Great Crisis began in 2008  the world s Central Banks have collectively pumped  10 trillion into the global financial system  Every major Central Bank from Germany to the US and China wants to debase its currency to benefit exports and facilitate dealing with its debt load  even China sports a real Debt to GDP north fo 200    This competitive debasement has lead to increased tension between the world s Central Banks  You will never hear their stated outright for the simple reason that the single most important responsibility of the Central Banks is to maintain confidence in the system  However  underneath the veneer of goodwill and the occasional necessary coordinated intervention  tensions are rising between Central Banks  When the US debases the US Dollar it pushes the Euro higher  This hurts German exports which in turn angers the Bundesbank  The Bundesbank fired a warning shot at the Fed last autumn when it announced it wanted to have its Gold reserves at the Fed audited  To be clear here  no one of major financial import has ever questioned the Fed s trustworthiness before  However  at the time of this announcement Germany stated it had no intentions of actually moving its reserves  Fast forward to today and Germany has not only audited and checked its Gold reserves at the Fed but it is now moving them  In plain terms  Germany has told the world that A  it does not trust the Fed and B  it is through playing around  This situation will likely be getting worse going forward  The fact that Germany will be removing all of its Gold reserves from France certainly doesn t bode well for future German French relations if push ever comes to shove  it s not as though Europe has a history of getting along well   Remember  the only thing holding the financial system together is belief in the Central Banks  If the Central Banks  it was Germany s Bundesbank that is behind the Gold move  stop trusting one another or grow openly antagonistic  then things will get very bad very quickly  For months now we ve been asserting that the  improvements  in the global economy and financial system were a mirage  Germany s move has confirmed this  If the financial system was in fact safe and the global economy was improving  Germany would not feel the need to repatriate its Gold  Which begs the question  what exactly do German Central Bankers know that we don t ,2013-01-28,Phoenix Capital Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/germany-just-fired-a-warning-shot-at-the-fed-152627,152627
121465,342980,NYT,Seems Like The Whole World Is Now Bullish,opinion,A couple of weeks ago  see Big tests for stocks   I wrote that while sentiment models were showing crowded long readings  analysts were almost universally urging caution  which was actually bullish  Maybe I am over thinking this  The sentiment picture seems just a little too neatly packaged to me and it would be just a little too easy to be overly bearish here  Positive flows into equity funds after a long winter of negative flows could be interpreted as positively as the return of bullish momentum  Indeed   reported enormous buying of VIX calls last week as a bet on rising volatility  and falling markets   which is contrarian bullish  I heard several talking heads on CNBC late last week cited the same kinds of reasons to be bearish from a sentiment viewpoint While I understand that sentiment models  on an intermediate to longer term time horizon  can give a bearish picture  but is too much trader bearishness supportive of the markets here  The financial crisis is over  Fast forward to today  it seems that while the sentiment model readings remain largely unchanged  still overbullish   the tone of the commentary has turned universally bullish  As an example of this sentiment shift   reports that the latest consensus out of Davos is  the financial crisis is over   The hive mind of Davos has concluded that the financial crisis is done  finished  The new worry  a bubble in the credit markets There is no official declaration  or even a formal survey  But the chatter at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  is about the end of the financial crisis that began in 2008 and dragged on through last summer s spike in Spanish and Italian government bond yields   There s a crystallization of thought that the financial crisis is over   says Scott Minerd  managing partner and chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners  a Santa Monica  Calif   firm with about  160 billion under management   is trumpeting its  Great Rotation  into equities investment theme  The beginning stages of a great rotation in the markets create opportunities for cyclical and undervalued asset classes poised for recovery   This time last year  the risks to global growth were to the downside as the European debt crisis  China hard landing fears and the U S  fiscal cliff clouded the economic outlook   said Michael Hartnett  chief investment strategist at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research   For 2013  we expect the resolution of fiscal policy issues  another year of accommodative central bank actions and improving corporate profits to skew the macro and market risks to the upside   Soros less bearish on Europe Remember George Soros  endless warnings about Europe and how the European experiment was on the verge of failing  In June 2012  he sounded the alarm that  to solve its problems  In this   he said that Germany had to take leadership and stop obsessing about austerity as the solution  With the EU summit set to start on Thursday  pressure is on European leaders to find a way out of the euro crisis  Investor George Soros is pessimistic that a solution will be found and says time is extremely short  In an interview with SPIEGEL ONLINE  he warns that Germany could develop into a hated  imperial power  Today  he has conceded that   George Soros  one of the most outspoken critics of Germany s austerity policies to solve the European debt crisis  said that the euro is here to stay and will gain as other nations seek to devalue their currencies   Germany will always do  the minimum  to preserve the currency  Soros said yesterday at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  He forecast a  tense  two years for the euro region  Dalio bullish Other well known investors  such as Ray Dalio have turned more bullish  via    Dalio says 2013 is likely to be a transition year  where large amounts of cash will move to stock and all sorts of stuff   goods  services  and financial assets  People will spend more with the cash  they will invest in equities and gold   the cash will move  As much as I would have great respect for investors like Soros and Dalio  and would loathe to be on the other side of a Soros or Dalio trade   the sudden outpouring of bullishness  or in Soros  case  an easing of bearishness  is a short term red flag for traders A Front Page Cover sell signal I wrote about my nervousness last week  see Too far  too fast  and I reiterate my concerns about the outbreak of excessive bullishness   also pointed out that a New York Times front page article entitled  is a contrarian Front Page Cover sell signal Looking for a bearish trigger With sentiment at such crowded long readings  we just need a bearish trigger to spark a corrective selloff  As we are in the middle of Earnings Season  any negative surprise could spark a downdraft  My most likely candidate for a negative surprise is the Non Farm Payroll release on Friday  where  indicate that the employment situation deteriorated in January Approaching important relative resistance Speaking technically  the relative performance chart of SPY  stocks  vs  TLT  US long Treasury bonds  below as a measure of the risk on risk off trade shows the SPY TLT ratio in a strong rally and approaching an important relative resistance level  The relative resistance level consists of both the previous highs seen in March April 2012 and a Fibonacci retracement level  which suggests that the risk on trade has a high probability of stalling soon At this point  my base case calls for stocks to correct 5 10   at which the uptrend continues  However  that scenario is subject to change as circumstances change  We may be nearing an inflection point and will have to take

121469,342984,NYT,John Williams  How To Survive The Illusion Of Recovery,opinion,There is no economic recovery  and there are no signs that a recovery is coming  says Shadowstats com author John Williams  In this Gold Report interview  he blames mal adjusted inflation statistics for creating an alternate reality that overestimates economic activity in a way that is unsustainable  Williams warns that eventually the painful truth will be so difficult that even government manipulation won t be able to deny it and that is when hyperinflation will take its toll on those who have not taken his advice for preserving purchasing power and securing wealth  The Gold Report  The last few years have been very volatile for investors  particularly resource equity investors  The mainstream media  citing government statistics of improved employment rates and housing starts  called an end to the recession and is forecasting a slow recovery in 2013  You are looking at the same indicators  but coming up with different numbers  Let s start with the unemployment rate  What are you seeing and why is it different than what we are hearing everywhere else  John Williams  I contend that the economy effectively hit bottom in June 2009  followed by a period of somewhat volatile stagnation  and it is beginning to turn down anew  There never was a recovery and no economic data shows the type of recovery that the official gross domestic product  GDP  report is showing  The GDP shows levels of activity now that are above where the economy was before the recession  It s been above that level now for more than a year  No other major economic series has shown a full recovery  shy of perhaps inflation adjusted retail sales  which is due to a problem with the inflation rate used to adjust the series  Generally  the illusion of recovery has resulted from the government s use of understated inflation  TGR  Are you predicting a double dip recession  JW  It s more like the pattern a fellow would take going off a ski jump  A plunge and then moving forward  maybe up a little bit and then plunging anew  The economy officially will be recognized as a double dip recession at some point  but in reality it s all part of the ongoing economic crisis that we ve seen for the last five or six years  TGR  One of the indicators people look at to determine the existence of a recession is the unemployment rate  Why you are seeing a different number for that than some of the officially announced numbers  JW  Unemployment is a matter of how you define it  The government has six measures of unemployment  The headline number is the third level of unemployment  U3   That measures people actively seeking work in the last four weeks  That doesn t mean just reading newspaper want ads  it is people mailing resumes and doing interviews  That number was reported at 7 9  for January  but that s not the common experience  The broadest measure that the government has is U6  That includes the people defined as unemployed in U3 plus what they call  discouraged workers  and those who are working part time for economic reasons  people who are underemployed  U6 was at 14 4  in January  If you accounted fully for all discouraged workers  not those who have been discouraged for less than a year as counted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for U6  you d find that the unemployment rate is up around 23   The recession has gone on for so long that people have given up looking for work  but those individuals still consider themselves to be unemployed  If there were jobs available  they would take them  but the government doesn t count them in the headline labor force statistic  That is why the official unemployment rate is shrinking while the number of people who want to work  but can t find a job  has actually increased  TGR  Are some of these discouraged unemployed actually retired  JW  Whether individuals are just coming out of school or finding that they have to come out of retirement in order to make ends meet  so long as they are looking actively for a job  again  the government counts them as unemployed  Formerly retired individuals  who want to work but end up as discouraged workers  still are counted as unemployed in the broader measures  They re just not able to find work and have given up looking for work because there are no jobs  As to common experience  if you were to survey everyone in the country as to whether he or she was unemployed  you d get a response suggesting something close to the 23  unemployment rate  The average person doesn t have to think too long to tell you whether or not he or she is unemployed  He or she may consider him or herself unemployed  but may not necessarily be counted in the headline government s numbers  Again  the  accurate  unemployment number remains a matter of definition  Common experience is close to 23   TGR  Another indicator of the health of the economy is housing starts  You called December housing starts  not statistically significant   The Department of Commerce reported a 12 1  increase and analysts are saying it s the biggest jump in four years  Are you counting different things  JW  I m looking at the official numbers  The problem is that the official numbers are just not too meaningful  The 12  headline gain has a 95  confidence interval around it of     16   Within the Census Bureau s usual reporting error  the monthly gain was statistically insignificant  it just as easily could have been a monthly contraction  The current level of housing starts is still off about 70  from the peak of activity in 2006  We are certainly off the bottom in the housing market  but it s still at historically very low levels  The month to month numbers are not meaningful because of the uncertainties of the surveying and problems with seasonal adjustments  Seasonal adjustments have become much more volatile and increased the uncertainty around the reported month to month changes since we ve had this terrible downturn  Specifically for December  the housing series likely received some boost for the month from unseasonably mild weather and from rebuilding activity tied to Hurricane Sandy  Seasonal distortions are fleeting  and the rebuilding gains will be temporary  Separately  the mechanism is not in place for sustained growth here  That also applies to retail sales  In both instances  you re looking at problems in the banking system and at structural problems with consumer liquidity  TGR  Retail sales is another indicator people look at to determine the strength of the economy  You reported a contraction in the third quarter of 2012  The Census Bureau reported a 4 7  growth year over year based largely on increased car sales  Why are those numbers different and where do you see that going in the rest of this year  JW  I look at those numbers adjusted for inflation  and  as an aside  that third quarter contraction was quarter to quarter  not year to year  although the annual growth is close to new recession territory  The government adjusts the GDP for inflation as a way  theoretically  to measure underlying economic activity as opposed to measuring activity that can be affected heavily simply by rising prices  It is the same thing with retail sales    as is done by the St  Louis Fed  you ll find that a lot of the headline retail sales growth has been tied to inflation  but the official CPI inflation rate is understated  That results in too high an inflation adjusted growth rate  Again  we also face the fundamental issue of bad quality month to month numbers because of a variety of seasonal adjustment problems  That should leave the average person without much confidence in what s actually being reported month to month  You really need to look at the underlying fundamentals in order to make any sense of what is happening in the real world  Fundamentally  retail sales and housing growth are based on the condition of the consumer  The consumer increasingly is illiquid  Reports of median household income  adjusted for inflation  show that household income plummeted well into 2011 and has been stagnant at the lowest levels of the current cycle ever since  The average guy is not staying even with inflation  That is important  because income drives consumption  and consumption accounts for more than 70  of GDP  If  net of inflation  you don t have sustained growth in income  you re not going to have sustained growth in consumption  You can  however  experience temporary growth by borrowing activity through debt expansion  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recognized the deteriorating fundamentals of household income  and encouraged massive debt expansion in order to fuel ongoing economic growth  That  however  led to the debt panic in 2008  Debt fueled growth is not sustainable  and consumers  still lacking adequate income growth  now also lack the option of significant debt expansion in order to fuel consumption growth  Problems in the banking system continue to impair credit availability for consumers  TGR  Now that loans are more difficult to get  are you predicting that retail and housing probably aren t going to bounce up in 2013  JW  Exactly  The only type of loan growth to consumers has been in government lending of student loans  It has not been in the types of loans that drive auto or retail sales  With the shortfall in income  there s no way the consumer could support sustainable growth in consumption and without that you don t have sustainable growth in the GDP  That is why we haven t had an actual recovery in inflation adjusted GDP  Also  there is no recovery pending  and that has all sorts of terrible implications for the financial markets and the current fiscal circumstances in the United States  TGR  What does all of this mean for the stock market  If people believe the government numbers and have a false vision of the economy  does that really hinder investors if the rest of the market believes those same positive numbers  Don t we always hear that stocks move based on perception rather than reality  JW  For some time  I don t think stocks have been moving based on anything tied to reality  the market has had no appearance of being rational  There are other factors at work here with the result of some very unusual trading activity  What will happen  eventually  is that underlying economic reality will become undeniable  and even official reporting will be revised to a pattern of contraction  an official double dip recession  That likely will not be good news for stocks  TGR  If there is no real recovery  will the Dow drop or stagnate  JW  A weaker economy is not good for corporate profits  The government will try to compensate  which will just worsen the liquidity crisis  and sovereign solvency issues will increase  At some point  the global markets are going to turn very heavily against the U S  dollar  That will spike domestic inflation  which will lead to higher interest rates  Again  that is all generally bad news for the financial markets  but good for gold  TGR  You and I have talked quite a bit about the pros and cons of adjusting inflation figures in the past  The idea of a chain weighted urban CPI  CPI U  gained mainstream media attention during the fiscal cliff debate as a way to control costs by slowing Social Security outlays  How would that work  And how would this be different from what is already happening  JW  This is not new  The government went through a similar process back in the 1990s and did  in fact  change the way the CPI U was reported  The goal then was to reduce the reported rate of inflation along with a resulting reduction in the cost of living adjustments for programs such as Social Security  This enabled the government to reduce the deficit without anyone in Congress having to do the impossible voting to cut Social Security  What the government tried to do was change the CPI from a fixed weight index where it effectively measured the cost of inflation reflecting the ability to maintain a constant standard of living to a cost of living measure based on the idea that people would substitute hamburger for steak  for example  if steak got too expensive  This is a declining standard of living measurement  I can t imagine any use for such a measure other than government s playing games  But  even with these tricks  the CPI U still is not fully substitution based  The experimental chain weighted CPI  the C CPI  however  would be just that  fully substitution based  Using the C CPI would allow the government to knock another 0 6 1  off official inflation  further reducing the cost of living adjustments to Social Security  It s unconscionable  It s effectively a fraud  Shame on the government for trying to do that  This impacts people s retirements  There was some protest when the idea was floated as one way to deal with the Fiscal Cliff  and the politicians pulled back  I fully expect they will try to push it forward again  in the negotiations in the months ahead  Politicians should just be straightforward with the American people and say   We can t afford to pay the cost of living adjustments that we had contracted   At least people would know what is happening and could plan accordingly  TGR  Let s talk about what is happening using some real numbers  I m hearing a prediction of 2 3  inflation in 2013  up from 1 7  in 2012  You have your own alternative CPI U that s a measure of the amount needed to maintain a constant standard of living  Does that shadow the government figures  following the same general trend  but at a higher number or do the two numbers move independently  JW  The pattern generally is the same  I have gone back through the adjustments that the government has made and added them back in to the final inflation calculations  I m either adding in somewhat over 3  or somewhat over 7  to what the government reports  depending on whether I am using 1990  or 1980 based methodologies  TGR  If the trends are the same  aren t people using the government figures at least getting a true idea of the direction of inflation  whether things are getting better or worse  and a general idea of how much of a raise they will have to request in order to maintain their standard of living  JW  They may be getting the relative trend year to year  but  at the moment  the official numbers are well shy of the actual magnitude  The magnitude of actual inflation outweighs the magnitude of the short variation  at present  For example  there was a period in recent years where the official CPI went negative year to year  My numbers slowed  with year to year change softening  but they did not go negative  TGR  Let s talk about something that we can touch and hold and everyone understands precious metals  You have said that despite the Sept  5  2011   1 895 ounce   1 895 oz  gold price and the April 2011  48 70 oz silver price  precious metals have yet to re hit their 1980 historic levels  adjusted for inflation  How does the price of gold move historically versus inflation  JW  Gold is a basic inflation hedge  over time  Since the founding of the Federal Reserve  active in 1914   the U S  dollar has lost 95 7  of its purchasing power  based on the government s headline CPI number  Based on the ShadowStats inflation estimate  reflecting 1980 methodologies  the dollar has lost 98 9  of its purchasing power  In that same 99 year period  the dollar also has lost 98 9  of its purchasing power against gold  Gold has fully offset the pummeling effects of domestic inflation on the purchasing power of the U S  dollar  as measured over decades  TGR  Another place where reality often shows through is energy prices  gas and electricity  What did you see for inflation in energy prices in 2012 and what is the outlook for the energy commodities and the stocks behind them in 2013  JW  All this ties back to the fiscal crisis  the U S  government s effective long term insolvency  If the government cannot bring its annual budget deficit under control  eventually it will have to meet its obligations by printing money  That creates inflation  a hyperinflation  This is why the global markets are so cautious at present  Very few people want to hold dollars long term  A massive flight from the dollar  which is likely this year  would be the beginning of a major inflationary period  The problems with the dollar would boost oil prices in dollar denominated terms  with resulting higher gasoline prices and higher domestic inflation  This is despite not having a strong economy  TGR  So you re predicting higher gas prices  but a weaker economy  JW  Right  I m looking for a weaker economy with higher inflation driven by bad monetary policy reflected in a weak U S  dollar which will have a big impact on dollar denominated commodities  TGR  What is your overall prediction for 2013 inflation and would that change if quantitative easing ended  JW  I can t give you a hard number but I expect inflation to increase rapidly  It will certainly be picking up by the end of the year  It is unlikely that the Fed will be able to back off its quantitative easing  TGR  Based on this outlook  what can investors do to protect themselves  If we know the truth  how can that help investors prosper or at least survive  JW  First  concentrate on preserving the purchasing power of your wealth and assets  The best hedge is physical gold  silver and other hard assets outside the dollar  Look at stronger currencies  I still like the Swiss franc  the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar as hedges  You need to hold the hedge through the tough times  If gold is up at  100 000 oz  don t get excited and take profits  because the gain there just reflects maintenance of your purchasing power  It suggests the magnitude of the purchasing power you ve lost in the dollars you did not put into hard assets  Remain liquid so you can get through the tough times  If you preserve your wealth and you are liquid  you will have some of the most interesting investment opportunities that anyone has ever seen  once the system recovers  I can t put any timing on that  but it s not likely going to be a couple of months  It s more likely going to be a period of years  TGR  Thank you

121470,342985,NYT,Who Believes That  Things Are Getting Better  In America ,opinion,How can anyone not see that the U S  economy is collapsing all around us  It just astounds me when people try to tell me that  everything is just fine  and that  things are getting better  in America  Are there people out there that are really that blind  If you want to see the economic collapse  just open up your eyes and look around you  By almost every economic and financial measure  the U S  economy has been steadily declining for many years  But most Americans are so tied into  the matrix  that they can only understand the cheerful propaganda that is endlessly being spoon fed to them by the mainstream media  As I have said so many times  the economic collapse is not a single event  The economic collapse has been happening  it is is happening right now  and it will continue to happen  Yes  there will be times when our decline will be punctuated by moments of great crisis  but that will be the exception rather than the rule  A lot of people that write about  the economic collapse  hype it up as if it will be some huge  event  that will happen very rapidly and then once it is all over we will rebuild  Unfortunately  that is not how the real world works  We are living in the greatest debt bubble in the history of the world  and once it completely bursts there will be no going back to how things were before  Right now  we are living in a  credit card economy   As long as we can keep borrowing more money  most people think that things are just fine  But anyone that has lived on credit cards knows that eventually there comes a point when the game is over  and we are rapidly approaching that point as a nation Have you ever been there  Have you ever desperately hoped that you could just get one more credit card or one more loan so that you could keep things going At first  living on credit can be a lot of fun  You can live a much higher standard of living than you otherwise would be able to But inevitably a day of reckoning comes If the federal government and the American people were forced at this moment to live within their means  the U S  economy would immediately plunge into a depression That is a 100  rock solid guarantee But our politicians and the mainstream media continue to perpetuate the fiction that we can live in this credit card economic fantasy land indefinitely And most Americans could not care less about the future  As long as  things are good  today  they don t really think much about what the future will hold As a result of our very foolish short term thinking  we have now run up a national debt of 16 4 trillion dollars  It is the largest debt in the history of the world  and it has gotten more than 23 times larger since Jimmy Carter first entered the White House The chart that you see below is a recipe for national financial suicide    Of course things have accelerated over the past four years  Since Barack Obama entered the White House  the U S  government has run a budget deficit of well over a trillion dollars   and we have stolen more than 100 million dollars from our children and our grandchildren every single hour of every single day  It is the biggest theft of all time  What we are doing to our children and our grandchildren is beyond criminal  And now our debt is at a level that most economists would consider terminal  When Barack Obama first entered the White House  the U S  debt to GDP ratio was under 70 percent  Today  it is up to 103 percent  We are officially in  the danger zone   If things really were  getting better  in America  we would not need to borrow so much money  Our politicians are stealing from the future in order to make the present look better  During Obama s first term  the federal government accumulated more debt than it did under the first 42 U S presidents combined  That is utter insanity  If you started paying off just the new debt that the U S  has accumulated during the Obama administration at the rate of one dollar per second  it would take more than 184 000 years to pay it off  So what is the solution  Get ready to laugh  The most prominent economic journalist in the entire country  Paul Krugman of the New York Times  recently suggested the following in an article that he wrote entitled    Realistically  we re not going to resolve our long run fiscal issues any time soon  which is O K    not ideal  but nothing terrible will happen if we don t fix everything this year  Meanwhile  we face the imminent threat of severe economic damage from short term spending cuts  So we should avoid that damage by kicking the can down the road  It s the responsible thing to do  You mean that we might actually do damage to the debt fueled economic fantasy world that we are living in if we stopped stealing so much money from future generations  Oh the humanity  It is horrifying to think that all that one of the  top economic minds  in America can come up with is to  kick the can  down the road some more  Unfortunately  neither Paul Krugman nor most of the American people understand that our financial system is actually designed to create government debt  The bankers that helped create the Federal Reserve intended to permanently enslave the U S  government to a perpetually expanding spiral of debt  and their plans worked  At this point  the U S  national debt is more than 5000 times larger than it was when the Federal Reserve was first created  So why don t the American people understand what the Federal Reserve system is doing to us  It is because most of them are still plugged into the matrix  A Zero Hedge article that I came across today put it beautifully    US society in a nutshell  Chris Dorner has been around for a week and has 222 million results on Google  the Federal Reserve has been around for one hundred years and has 187 million results  If nothing is done about our exploding debt  it is only a matter of time before we reach financial oblivion  According to Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff  the U S  government is facing a  present value difference between projected future spending and revenue  of  in the years ahead  So how in the world are we going to come up with an extra 222 trillion dollars  But it is not just the U S  government that is drowning in debt  Just check out this chart which shows the astounding growth of state and local government debt in recent years    All over the United States there are state and local governments that are on the verge of bankruptcy  Just check out what is going on in Detroit  The only way that most of our state and local governments can keep going at this point is to also  kick the can  down the road some more  And of course most of the rest of us are drowning in debt as well  40 years ago  the total amount of debt in the U S  economic system  government   business   consumer  was   Today  the total amount of debt in the U S  economic system has grown to   Can anyone say bubble  The good news is that U S  GDP is now more than 12 times larger than it was 40 years ago  The bad news is that the total amount of debt in our financial system is now more than 30 times larger than it was 40 years ago    At the same time that we are going into so much debt  our ability to produce wealth continues to decline  According to the World Bank  U S  GDP accounted for 31 8 percent of all global economic activity in 2001  That number dropped to 21 6 percent in 2011  That is not just a decline   that is a nightmarish freefall  Just check out the chart in   We are becoming less competitive as a nation with each passing year  In fact  the U S  has fallen in the global economic competitiveness rankings compiled by the World Economic Forum   Most Americans don t understand this  but the United States buys far more from the rest of the world than they buy from us each year  In 2012  we had a trade deficit of  with the rest of the world  That means that more than 500 billion dollars that could have gone to U S  workers and U S  businesses went out of the country instead  So how does our country survive if hundreds of billions of dollars more is flowing out of the country than is flowing into it  Well  to make up the shortfall we go to the countries that we sent our money to and we beg them to lend it back to us  If that doesn t work  we just print and borrow even more money  Overall  the United States has run a trade deficit of more than 8 trillion dollars with the rest of the world since 1975  That is 8 trillion dollars that could have saved U S  businesses  paid the salaries of U S  workers and that would have helped fund government  But instead  our foolish policies have greatly enriched China and the oil barons of the Middle East  Sadly  politicians from both political parties continue to boldly support the one world economic agenda of the global elite  Just consider how destructive many of these  free trade  deals have been to our economy    When NAFTA was pushed through Congress in 1993  the United States had a trade surplus with Mexico of 1 6 billion dollars  By 2010  we had a trade deficit with Mexico of 61 6 billion dollars  Back in 1985  our trade deficit with China was approximately   million with a little  m   for the entire year  In 2012  our trade deficit with China was   That was the largest trade deficit that one nation has had with another nation in the history of the world  In particular  our trade with China is extremely unbalanced  Today  U S  consumers spend  on goods and services from China for every one dollar that Chinese consumers spend on goods and services from the United States  But isn t getting cheap stuff from China good  No  because it costs us good paying jobs  According to the Economic Policy Institute  the United States is losing half a million jobs to China every single year  Overall   manufacturing facilities in the United States have been shut down since 2001  During 2010  manufacturing facilities in the United States were shutting down at a rate of 23 per day  How can anyone say that  things are getting better  when our economic infrastructure is being absolutely gutted  The truth is that there are never going to be enough jobs in America ever again  because millions of our jobs are being sent overseas and millions of our jobs are being lost to technology  You won t hear this on the news  but the percentage of the civilian labor force in the United States that is employed has been steadily declining every single year since 2006  Younger workers have been hit particularly hard  In 2007  the unemployment rate for the 20 to 29 age bracket was about 6 5 percent  Today  the unemployment rate for that same age group is   If you are under the age of 30 and you aren t living with your parents  there is a really good chance that you are living in poverty  If you can believe it  U S  families that have a head of household that is under the age of 30 have a poverty rate of 37 percent  Our economy has been steadily bleeding huge numbers of middle class jobs  and many of those jobs have been replaced by low paying jobs in recent years  According to one study  60 percent of the jobs lost during the last recession were mid wage jobs  but 58 percent of the jobs created since then have been low wage jobs  And at this point  an astounding  of all American workers make less than  30 000 a year  Oh  but  things are getting better   right  Maybe if you live on Wall Street or if you are an employee of the federal government  But for most families this economic decline has been a total nightmare  Median household income in America has fallen for four consecutive years  Overall  it has declined by over  4000 during that time span  Sometimes people forget how good things were about a decade ago  About three times as many new homes were sold in the United States  as were sold in 2012  But we like to live in denial  In fact  a lot of families are trying to keep up their standards of living by going into tremendous amounts of debt  Back in 1983  the bottom 95 percent of all income earners in the United States had 62 cents of debt for every dollar that they earned  By 2007  that figure had soared   Fake it until you make it  right  But how much debt can our system possibly handle  Total home mortgage debt in the United States is now about 5 times larger than it was just 20 years ago  Total credit card debt in the United States is now more than 8 times larger than it was just 30 years ago  We are a nation that is completely addicted to debt  but as the financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated  all of that debt can have horrific consequences  As the economy has slowed in recent years  the Federal Reserve has decided that  the solution  is to recklessly print money in an attempt to get the debt spiral cranked up again  Have they gone overboard  You be the judge    And of course this won t have any affect on the value of the money that you have been saving up all these years right Wrong Every single dollar that you own is continually losing value    Overall  the value of the U S  dollar has declined by more than 96 percent since the Federal Reserve was first created  As the cost of living continues to go up and wages continue to go down  millions of American families have fallen out of the middle class and into poverty  If you can believe it  the number of Americans on food stamps has grown from about  in the year 2000 to more than  today  But  things are getting better   right  Incredibly   public school students in the United States are homeless  This is the first time that has ever happened in our history  But  things are getting better   right  There are now  that spend more than half of their incomes on housing  That represents a 46 percent increase from 2001  But  things are getting better   right  In 1999  64 1 percent of all Americans were covered by employment based health insurance  Today  only 55 1 percent are covered by employment based health insurance  But  things are getting better   right  Today  more Americans than ever have found themselves forced to turn to the federal government for help  Overall  the federal government runs nearly 80 different  means tested welfare programs   and at this point more than 100 million Americans are enrolled in at least one of them  According to the U S  Census Bureau   of all Americans live in a home that receives direct monetary benefits from the federal government  Back in 1983   of all Americans lived in a home that received direct monetary benefits from the federal government  So is it a good sign or a bad sign that the percentage of Americans that are financially dependent on the federal government is at an all time high  And in future years the number of Americans that are receiving benefits from the federal government is projected to absolutely skyrocket  Back in 1965  only one out of every 50 Americans was on Medicaid  Today   Americans is on Medicaid  and things are about to get a whole lot worse  It is being projected that Obamacare will add  to the Medicaid rolls  If you take a look at Medicare  things are very more sobering  As I wrote   it is being projected that the number of Americans on Medicare will grow from 50 7 million in 2012 to  in 2025  At this point  Medicare is facing unfunded liabilities of more than 38 trillion dollars over the next 75 years  That comes to approximately  for every single household in the United States  Are you ready to contribute your share  Social Security is a complete and total nightmare as well  Right now  there are approximately 56 million Americans collecting Social Security benefits  By 2035  that number is projected to soar to an astounding   Overall  the Social Security system is facing a  over the next 75 years  Oh  but don t worry because  things are getting better   right  I honestly do not know how anyone can look at the numbers above and come to the conclusion that the economy is in good shape  We have accumulated the largest mountain of debt in the history of the world  our economic infrastructure is being gutted  we are bleeding good jobs  government dependence is at an all time high and we are getting poorer as a nation with each passing day  But other than that  everything is rainbows and lollipops  right  If you want to see the economic collapse  just open up your eyes  And if dramatic changes are not made quickly  things are going to get much  much worse from here  Please share this article with as many people as possible  Time is quickly running out and there are a whole lot of people out there that we need to wake up while we still can ,2013-02-11,Michael T.

121498,343013,NYT,Congress Avoids The Cliff By Selling US Down The River  ,opinion,With the possible exception of the New York Times  editorial board  and the cast of The Jersey Shore   everyone on the planet understood that the United States Government needs to cut spending  increase taxes  or both  Instead  after months of political posturing and hand wringing  the Federal Government has just delivered the exact opposite  a deal that increases spending and decreases taxes  The move lays bare the emptiness of budget legislation  which can be dismantled far easier than it can be constructed   One question that should be now asked is whether Moody s Research will finally join S P in downgrading the Treasury debt of the United States  After the Budget Control Act of 2011  which resulted from the Debt Ceiling drama  Moody s extended its Aaa rating  saying in an August 8 statement       last week s Budget Control Act was positive for the credit of the United States     We expect the economic recovery will continue and additional budget deficit reduction initiatives will be put in place by 2013  The political parties now appear to share similar deficit reduction objectives    Now that Moody s has been proven wrong  and the straight jacket that Congress designed for itself has been shown to be illusory  as I always claimed it was   will the rating agency revisit its decision and downgrade the United States  Given the political backlash that greeted S P s downgrade in 2011  I doubt that such a move is forthcoming    For now  the real budget negotiations have been supposedly pushed later into 2013  when the debt ceiling will be confronted anew  But who can really expect anything of substance  The latest deal emerged from a Congress that is nearly two years removed from the next election  As a result  Congressmen were as insulated from political pressures as they could ever expect to be  Nevertheless  they still chose political expediency over sound policy  If Congressional leadership  an oxymoron that should join the ranks of  jumbo shrimp  and  definite maybe   could not put the national interest in front of political interests now  why would anyone expect them to do so later  They will continue to ignore our fiscal problems until a currency crisis forces their hand  I expect deficits to approach  2 trillion annually before Obama leaves office  Unfortunately  at that point the solutions would be far more draconian than anything economists and politicians are currently considering   In light of the extensions of the popular middle class tax rates  the loudly trumpeted tax increases on those individuals making more than  400 000  and couples making more than  450 000  will not be enough to translate into higher tax revenues  Instead they will result in perhaps  60 billion per year in new revenue to the Federal government that will be more than offset by the new spending announced in the agreement  However  the increases will result in many individuals in high tax states like California and New York paying more than 50  of their income in taxes   While many economists are cautioning that higher taxes on the wealthy will take a bite out of spending  in my opinion it is more likely to result in lower business investment  which is far more detrimental to the economy  When faced with diminishing discretionary income  most rich people would sooner cut back on savings and investment than they would on health care  education  home improvements and vacations    But it should be clear that the rate increases are just the opening crescendo in a symphony of tax hikes on the nation s entrepreneurial class  President Obama has recently stated that he will consider needed cuts in spending and entitlement programs only if they are coupled with additional tax increases on the wealthy  In other words  as far as the President is concerned  the hikes included in the budget agreement that was just passed didn t count for anything   It cannot  or should not  be denied that Washington s latest fig leaf will have a major impact on the markets  The New Year s  relief rally  is understandable given the clear implications that the government will simply print its way out of trouble for as long as it can  In the past  fiscal profligacy was held in check by investors who would sell bonds and push interest rates higher whenever it appeared that the government was not serious about national solvency  But with the Federal Reserve now buying the vast majority of U S  government debt  no such roadblock exists  With monetary and fiscal stimulus pushing up stock and bond prices  and no immediate fear of a rally killing spike in interest rates  there is no reason to stay on the sidelines  Markets are now driven by stimulus  not fundamentals  and the stimulus is firmly at the wheel   For more on this   see the article in the January edition of Euro Pacific s Global Investment Newsletter   But it is important to look at the nature of the rally  We would bring investors  attention to the increase in gold and oil and rally against the dollar of every major currency except the Japanese yen  which is being deliberately debased by a newly elected government   Our new Newsletter edition also includes an analysis of some of the more promising overseas markets   But by taking the nominal risk out of investing  the government is insuring that the risks to the U S  economy will grow exponentially  We are now   and will remain   a debt fueled economy for as long as the rest of the world permits this to continue  But this is no way to create real  sustainable economic growth  On the contrary  it will simply permit the growth of government  the depletion of economic vitality  and ultimately the collapse of the U S  dollar      In the meantime  President Obama and Congressional leaders will take credit for a tax cut that is in reality a huge tax increase in disguise  Government spending is the real source of taxpayers  pain and it is only a matter of time before the bill comes due in the form of inflation  See our Newsletter for fresh analysis as to why inflation may already be higher than you think  Because the deficits will grow even larger  more purchasing power will be lost in this manner than would have been lost had all the Bush tax cuts been allowed to expire  In addition  though entitlements cuts were taken off the table  the real value of benefits could be slashed  as cost of living adjustments fail to keep up with skyrocketing consumer prices  That s a Fiscal Cliff that will not be so easy to avoid BY Euro Pacific Capital,2013-01-04,Euro Pacific,https://www.investing.com/analysis/congress-avoids-the-cliff-by-selling-us-down-the-river-149610,149610
121499,343014,NYT,The Recovery s Death Knell,opinion,Call it the  shot heard round the world   Its aim was ostensibly to reduce the U S  budget deficit  its effect was tantamount to a bullet in the chest of the consumer recovery Bad TimingLast week the U S  working class was hit with a significant payroll tax increase  a blow that couldn t have occurred at a worse time  Just as the economic recovery was starting to gain some traction  our elected officials took the proverbial wind out of its sails by raising taxes  A tax increase is the last thing needed when the economic undercurrents are deflationary  as they are now  This measure will eventually beget even more deflation as consumers reign in spending once they see their paychecks diminished courtesy of the U S  Congress Reading through scads of news articles and blog postings pertaining to the tax hike  I m amazed at the lack of outrage among its victims  Few seem to realize the enormity of the situation  a  100 month paycheck cut is coming for many wage earner in the U S  this year  yet few seem to grasp the implications To put into perspective just how much  100 a month is for the typical American  let s look at the expected cost of living increases for the coming year  Along with smaller paychecks because of Social Security and healthcare deductions  Americans also face higher grocery bills  Retail food costs for 2013 are projected to rise 4 percent  according to AOL Daily Finance  That adds up to about  40 a month for the average family  The  Little  ThingsHealth care premiums will rise by  20 a month  once the new rates are implemented in February  Internet service will increase by  2 a month as service providers raise rates once again  Cable TV will also go up  5 a month due to rising rates  This means your total expenses could be  70 a month higher this year  assuming gas prices remain the same  and do not exceed  4 a gallon  observes John Matarese of EW Scripps Co  For even more perspective  consider the findings of a recent study by the Center for Responsible Lending  the typical American has only  100 after monthly expenses  The study found  after controlling for inflation  the typical household had less annual income at the end of 2010 than it did at the beginning of the decade  Moreover  as worker productivity increased  the workplace has seldom rewarded them with higher pay  The study went on to say that the combined effect of stagnant wages  unemployment and under employment is forcing many families to curb spending and use any available assets to remain financially solvent  It concludes with this warning  In order for the U S  economy to grow again  individual households must find themselves in a position to increase their spending  This will be difficult as long as households continue to face stagnant incomes  increasing expenses  increasing levels of debt  and declining net worth It s not a stretch  then  to surmise that the the tax hike represents at least one nail in the coffin of the U S  consumer s recovery  Much of what Wasington has done in the last four years to revive consumer spending has been sacrificed by this thoughtless act  The  self inflicted wound  the president spoke of before the vote has become reality And Employment The bi partisan tax hike also undermines the claim by Congress that lowering the unemployment rate is its top priority  As Sal Gentile observed in an MSNBC article  The political class has apparently convinced itself that unemployment is no longer a problem  despite the fact that only 58  of Americans have jobs  essentially the lowest number since 1983 and virtually unchanged since the end of the recession  The expiration of the payroll tax cut will likely make it worse  Writes Gentile  According to the Congressional Budget Office  the payroll tax cut did much more to stimulate the economy than income tax cuts  because most households pay more in payroll tax than income tax Adding insult to injury  whatever money was earned for deficit reduction as a result of the tax hike was immediately squandered  As Gentile wrote  The payroll tax increase  it turns out  will save about  95 billion in 2013 alone  But Congress turned around and gave most of that savings away in tax breaks for businesses like NASCAR  Hollywood studios and Wall Street  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates those so called  tax extenders   tucked into the bill with little notice  will cost  68 billion in 2013  Despite what members of Congress may think  it s the middle class that is the backbone of the U S  economy  Responding to the problem of diminished tax revenues by raising taxes on the those already financially distressed won t do anything to solve the government s fiscal problem  Lowering taxes on middle wage earners would have been the more sound approach Socialism s Last Stand Credit David Knox Barker  LongWaveDynamics com  with this interesting observation  Even the New York Times recognizes the lousy job government does in spending the taxes it collects  The flight from France after tax increases is increasing the conversation on whether government has gone too far  The article concludes  No matter how high the taxes  there is never enough  In France and the U S   the tax grab and will evoke its own reversal The Future Of InflationDespite the clear deflationary implication of Congress  latest act  many on Wall Street are actually worried about inflation It s Not Too Early to Worry about the End of Fed Easing  proclaimed one recent news headline  The article was written in response to the release of the minutes from the U S  Federal Reserve s latest meeting which were released last Thursday  The minutes revealed that Jeffrey Lacker  Richmond Fed Bank President  is concerned that the Fed s bond buying stimulus plan will eventually stoke inflation It is unlikely that the Federal Reserve can push real growth rates materially higher than they otherwise would be  on a sustained basis  said Lacker  I see an increased risk   that inflation pressures emerge and are not thwarted in a timely way  The minutes showed several members of the Federal Open Market Committee foresaw a chance that asset purchases would need to be slowed or halted altogether before the end of 2013 Don t Forget The End Of QEJust like that  Wall Street has a new worry going forward  viz  the end of quantitative easing  QE   This is in marked contrast to Wall Street s worry of just a few weeks ago that the Fed was going overboard with QE  Investors are now apparently torn between the fear of inflation and the worry that the Fed s efforts at re infllating the financial market will end too soon A straight forward reading of the long term Kress cycles tell us that inflation won t be a major concern until after 2014  The dominant long term components of the 120 year cycle  the 40 year and 60 year cycles  will both bottom around October 2014  The increasing descent of these cycles into late 2014 is expected to create significant deflationary pressures on the economies of developed nations  particularly the U S This is one of the main reasons why the Fed s intensive efforts at re stimulating the economy through QE have been relatively ineffective  As the following graph vividly shows  each successive QE has resulted in a less vigorous increase in equity prices  to say nothing of economic output Inflation is also being kept at bay through the deflationary policies of the U S  Congress  payroll taxes  Obamacare taxes  etc   as well as the austerity policies of other major governments around the globe  The year 2013 will ultimately tell the tale of whether the Kress deflationary scenario comes to pass  My best guess is that we ll start seeing an erosion in retail sales by the second quarter with increasing deterioration in each subsequent quarter  By the end of the year corporate profits will be in decline  then the real

121500,343015,NYT,If Obama Can Create A Trillion Dollar Coin  Then Why Pay Taxes ,opinion,If Barack Obama can  solve  the debt ceiling crisis by printing up some trillion dollar coins  then why does the federal government need our money  As another debt ceiling showdown approaches  many in the liberal media are suggesting that if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling that Obama should just have the U S  Treasury create a trillion dollar platinum coin and use it to pay our bills  It sounds crazy  but many notable voices    are supporting this idea  But if the federal government has had the power to create trillion dollar coins out of thin air all this time  then why do we have to pay taxes  Not only that  why do we have a national debt  If the federal government can just create money whenever it wants  then why does the federal government ever have to borrow it from others  The U S  Constitution actually grants Congress the power to  coin money   so why is the Federal Reserve doing it  Those are some very important questions  Most Americans don t even realize that the U S  government never actually needed to borrow a single penny from anyone else  The U S  Congress has the authority to create debt free money whenever it wants to  Conceivably  the entire federal government could be funded without ever borrowing a single dollar and without ever receiving a single dollar from any of us in taxes  Just imagine that   a nation without a single penny of national debt  no income tax and no IRS  What a wonderful world that would be  Of course there would be other potential dangers under such a system  such as runaway inflation   and those dangers would have to be addressed  But the truth is that we don t have to have an income tax or 16 trillion dollars of government debt  We only have those things because we have chosen to have those things  Sometimes  a crisis can illuminate options that most people had not considered previously  As another debt ceiling crisis draws closer  many are looking for ways for the U S  government to be able to continue to pay its bills if Congress does not authorize an increase in the debt ceiling  If a debt ceiling agreement is not worked out  the U S  government will soon only be able to pay about half the bills that are coming due after interest payments on the national debt  which will almost certainly be prioritized  are made  That is why a lot of people on the left are pushing the  trillion dollar coin  alternative  So how would this work exactly  The mechanics were recently explained by Jim Pethokoukis on his     There are limits on how much paper money the U S  can circulate and rules that govern coinage on gold  silver  and copper  BUT  the Treasury has broad discretion on coins made from platinum  The theory goes that the U S  Mint would create a handful of trillion dollar  or more  platinum coins  The President would then order the coins deposited at the Fed  who would then put the coin s  in the Treasury who now can pay all their bills and a default is removed from the equation  The effects on the currency market and inflation are unclear  to say the least  In my opinion  if anyone in the federal government is going to be creating money out of thin air  it should be the U S  Congress  After all  according to   it is the U S  Congress that has been granted the authority to  coin Money  regulate the Value thereof  and of foreign Coin  and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures   But those that are pushing Obama to create a  trillion dollar coin  point to a law that Congress passed that allows the U S  Treasury to mint platinum coins  The following is from a recent     Normally  the Federal Reserve is charged with issuing currency  But U S  law  specifically   also grants Treasury permission to  mint and issue platinum bullion coins and proof platinum coins   This section of law was meant to allow for the printing of commemorative coins and the like  But the Treasury Secretary has the authority to mint these coins in any denomination he or she sees fit  But it wouldn t quite be that easy  According to a recent   some elements of the coin design would have to be determined by legislation    The more difficult part comes sometime after the decision is made to coin the platinum and before the Mint gets to work in sculpting the pieces  At that point  the American people must decide whose face will adorn the trillion dollar trinket  The process to determine the  specs  of the coin  U S  Mint Public Affairs Specialist Genevieve Billia warns  must be  determined by legislation   creating the potential for another congressional impasse  So we would likely end up back at square one  But if printing up a  trillion dollar coin  does not work out  Paul Krugman of the New York Times has come up     Don t like the platinum coin option  Here s a functionally equivalent alternative  have the Treasury sell pieces of paper labeled  moral obligation coupons   which declare the intention of the government to redeem these coupons at face value in one year  It should be clearly stated on the coupons that the government has no  repeat no  legal obligation to pay anything at all  you see  they re not debt  and therefore don t count against the debt limit  But that shouldn t keep them from having substantial market value  Of course there is a very  very low probability that any of these wild ideas will ever be tried  but this debate has raised some very interesting points  The truth is that we do not have to have a system where more money is only created   We could have a system where the federal government directly creates  that is spent directly into circulation by the federal government  In fact  this has happened before  As I have written about   during the presidency of JFK a limited number of debt free United States Notes were issued by the U S  Treasury and spent by the U S  government directly into circulation without any new debt being created  In fact  each bill said  United States Note  right at the top  Unfortunately  after JFK s presidency no more debt free United States Notes were ever issued  But even before JFK  there were times when debt free United States Notes were being used  According   United States Notes were first used during the Civil War     They were originally issued directly into circulation by the U S  Treasury to pay expenses incurred by the Union during the American Civil War  Over the next century  the legislation governing these notes was modified many times and numerous versions have been issued by the Treasury    So why are we using debt based Federal Reserve Notes today instead of debt free United States Notes  If the Federal Reserve did not exist and the U S  government directly created money instead of borrowing it  it is conceivable that we could have a national debt of  0 00 today instead of  16 432 707 263 449 56  Which option do you think our children and our grandchildren will wish that we had opted for  In a system where the government directly created money  it is also conceivable that we could completely do away with the income tax and the IRS completely  The U S  once prospered greatly without an income tax  and it could do so again  And the truth is that our system of taxation is broken beyond repair  If you doubt this    So what would the downside be to such a system  Well  of course rampant inflation would be a huge danger  Allowing Congress to print up money whenever they wanted to would be playing with fire  That is why it would be imperative for there to be a hard cap on what the federal government could spend  For example  you could set the cap on spending by the federal government at 20 percent of GDP  That way we would hopefully never end up looking like the   And the current federal debt could be paid down a little at a time using newly created debt free currency  This would have to be done slowly to keep inflation under control  but it could be done  Of course if you wanted to continue to fund the federal government through taxation  there are other options that would still allow you to do away with the income tax  For example  one of the ways that our founders intended for the federal government to be funded was through tariffs  and we could definitely raise a lot of money that way  Plus  that would have the added benefit of making American companies much more competitive again and it would reduce the flow of American jobs   So am I in favor of having Barack Obama create a trillion dollar coin to get around the debt ceiling crisis  Most definitely not  If it does not violate the letter of the Constitution  which I believe it does   it sure does violate the spirit of it  But if the U S  Congress decided to shut down the Federal Reserve and the IRS and they decided to abolish the income tax  and instead they started directly issuing debt free currency directly into circulation  that is something I would very much be in favor of  Yes  that system would not be perfect either  but it would be far more preferable to what we have today  So what do you think  Should we keep our current system of debt based money  or would a system of debt free money be better  Please feel free to post a comment with your opinion below   ,2013-01-08,Michael T.

121501,343016,NYT,Federal Government Hands Out Money To 128 Million Americans Every Day,opinion,The number of Americans receiving money directly from the federal government has grown from 94 million in the year 2000 to over 128 million today  A shocking new research paper  contains that statistic and a whole bunch of other very revealing numbers  According to their research  the federal government hands out money to 41 3 percent of the entire population of the United States each month  Overall  more than 70 percent of all federal spending goes to what they call  dependence creating programs   It is the most massive wealth redistribution scheme in the history of the world  and it continues to grow at a very rapid pace with each passing month  But can we really afford this  Of course we never want to see a single person go without food to eat or a roof to sleep under  but can the federal government really afford to support 128 million Americans every month  If millions more Americans keep jumping on to the  safety net  each year  how long will it be before it breaks and it is not there for anyone  The federal government is already   This year the U S  national debt will easily blow past the 17 trillion dollar mark and we are rapidly heading toward financial oblivion  We are stealing more than 100 million dollars from our children and our grandchildren every single hour of every single day with no end in sight  If we don t get our finances in order as a nation  what will the end result be  According to   federal spending on entitlement programs has been rising more than 6 times as fast as population growth has in recent years    Between 1988 and 2011  spending on dependence creating federal government programs has increased 180 percent versus  only  a 62 percent increase in the number of people who are enrolled in federal government programs  and a 27 percent increase in the population  Not only are more people enrolled in government programs than ever before  but more US taxpayer dollars are being spent on each recipient every year  But even though the numbers that Tyrrell and Beach present in their paper are incredibly shocking  the truth is that they have probably underestimated the true scope of government dependence in America today  Just consider the following numbers    Food Stamps Back in the year 2000  there were about 17 million Americans on food stamps  That number has exploded to  today  Medicaid If you can believe it  today  are on Medicaid  and it is being projected that Obamacare will add  to the Medicaid rolls  Social Security Right now  there are  on Social Security  and that number is projected to absolutely explode as huge waves of Baby Boomers retire in the coming years  Medicare As I wrote about   the number of Americans on Medicare is expected to grow from 50 7 million in 2012 to  in 2025  And those are only four examples of government programs that have seen their numbers explode in recent years  There are so many more that could be mentioned  Overall  the federal government runs nearly 80 different     and almost all of them are experiencing explosive growth  So is the  128 million  figure that Tyrrell and Beach have come up with actually too low  I believe that it is  But in any event  nobody can deny that the  welfare state  in the U S  has absolutely mushroomed in size since the turn of the century  According to one recent poll   of all Americans say that they have received money from a safety net program run by the federal government at some point in their lives  We are a nation that has become very comfortable leaning on Uncle Sam for help  And poor people from all around the globe see how good things are here and they are eager to get a seat at the table  In a   I talked about a federal government website      that actually teaches new immigrants how to apply for welfare once they are able to get into the United States  Will we all eventually becoming dependent on the government  If that happens will we still be free men and women  Once someone is dependent on the government  they become forced to do what the government tells them to do in order to survive  If we all eventually become dependent on the federal government  how much power will that give them over us  That is something to think about  Another thing to ponder is how the U S  middle class is rapidly disappearing  There will always be poor people  and we should always take care of them  but what we should be truly alarmed about is how the middle class in America  in recent years  One of the biggest reasons why so many Americans are applying for government assistance these days is because there simply aren t enough jobs for everyone  Politicians from both political parties have fully embraced the one world  free trade  economic agenda of the global elite  and as a result   Big corporations can either choose to pay U S  workers a living wage with benefits  or they can choose to set up shop on the other side of the globe where it is legal to pay workers slave labor wages with no benefits  Plus there are much fewer taxes and regulations to deal with typically on the other side of the globe  As long as this nation pursues this  one world economic agenda   there will never be enough jobs in the United States   Chronic unemployment will become the new normal  Our formerly great manufacturing cities will continue to degenerate into   Apologists for the current system continue to insist that the answer is  more education   but the truth is that government dependence is even exploding among those with advanced degrees  The following is a brief excerpt from a recent article on     People who don t finish college are more likely to receive food stamps than are those who go to graduate school  The rolls of people on public assistance are dominated by people with less education  Nevertheless  the percentage of graduate degree holders who receive food stamps or some other aid more than doubled between 2007 and 2010  During that three year period  the number of people with master s degrees who received food stamps and other aid climbed from 101 682 to 293 029  and the number of people with Ph D  s who received assistance rose from 9 776 to 33 655  according to tabulations of microdata done by Austin Nichols  a senior researcher with the Urban Institute  He drew on figures from the 2008 and 2011 Current Population Surveys done by the U S  Census Bureau and the U S  Bureau of Labor  After reading that  does anyone still believe that  more education  is the answer to our problems  What we need is more jobs  and lots of them  Unfortunately  our politicians continue to pursue policies that absolutely kill American jobs  So the number of Americans that are forced to turn to the government for assistance will continue to grow  as will our   Sadly  most Americans still don t realize what is happening  Most of them are still listening to those in the mainstream media that are insisting that everything is going to be just fine  For example  the most famous economic journalist in the country    recently wrote that the deficit crisis has been  solved     True  there are projected problems further down the road  mainly because of the continuing effects of an aging population  But it still comes as something of a shock to realize that at this point reasonable projections do not  repeat do not  show anything resembling the runaway deficit crisis that is a staple of almost everything you hear  including supposedly objective news reporting  So you heard it here first  while you weren t looking  and the deficit scolds were doing their scolding  the deficit problem  such as it was  was being mostly solved  Oh really  I don t know how in the world Paul Krugman can get paid to write such nonsense  but the truth is that our government debt problems are only just beginning  In a   I explained that the unfunded liabilities of the federal government are growing so rapidly that we could not cover them even if we raised the highest tax rate to 100     According to Chris Cox and Bill Archer  two men who served on Bill Clinton s Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform  there is no way in the world that we could raise taxes high enough to pay for all of the obligations that we are currently taking on  They say that even if we taxed all corporations and all individuals at a 100  tax rate on all income over  66 193     Yes  Paul Krugman  we do have a spending problem  Even if Bill Gates gave every single penny of his fortune to the federal government  it would only cover the U S  budget deficit   We simply cannot go on spending money like this  If anyone out there believes Paul Krugman and is convinced that the federal government is no longer facing a massive debt problem  please read this article      But if we can t afford to do all of this spending  then why are we doing it  Well  it is because there are a whole lot of people out there that are really hurting   is absolutely exploding  and the gap between the wealthy and the poor has grown to unprecedented heights  According to a recent article posted on   the bottom 60 percent of all Americans only own 2 3 percent of all the financial wealth in the nation combined  That is astounding  If you live in a wealthy area of the country  you may look around and things may look really good to you  But in many other areas of the country things are worse than they have ever been in the post World War II era  For the first time ever   public school students in the United States are homeless  That number has risen by  since the 2006 2007 school year  Can you imagine that  We have over a million kids that are attending our public schools that do not have a home to go back to at night  Our economy desperately needs more jobs  but we just continue to lose more of them  On Thursday  it was announced that American Express is eliminating   More announcements like this come out just about every day now   of all Americans expect  to be a year of  economic difficulty   and there aren t a whole lot of reasons to be optimistic about things at this point  When you lose your job  it can feel like your entire life is falling apart  The competition for jobs is absolutely fierce  and a lot of workers have fallen through the cracks  In this rough economic environment  there are millions of Americans that have never been able to put the pieces of their lives back together  A recent  profiled a 42 year old woman up in Oregon named Lynette who has had her life totally turned upside down by unemployment    I m a single mom with a son in high school  Three years ago  I was laid off from a job working at a propane company  I had just gotten back on my feet after battling breast cancer  then cervical cancer  but the economy tanked  and I was the first to go  I am now 42  and the cancer is gone  But it appears my employability is also gone  She used to work in a position that helped others find government assistance  but now she is the one who has been forced to seek it    Before I was diagnosed with cancer  I worked for the state of Oregon and was the number one service manager for the Department of Human Services  My job was to help low income families find work and get food stamps and insurance  Now  I cannot even get a job at McDonalds  and I m the one living on social assistance ,2013-01-11,Michael T.

121502,343017,NYT,What Is The Liquidity Coverage Ratio For Banks And Why Should We Care,opinion,   read the headline in the print edition of Monday s Financial Times      wrote Simon Johnson in a blistering post on his New York Times blog  At issue was a rule called the liquidity coverage ratio promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  If you are a banking wonk  the headlines would have been enough  but in case you are among those who are hazy on just what the liquidity coverage ratio is  what the Basel Committee does  and why we should care  read on  What is the Basel Committee  Bank regulators of individual countries do not act alone in setting rules for bank capital  If they did  the result would all too likely be a race to the bottom in which each country tried to gain market share for its banks by issuing rules that were as lax as possible  In an attempt to prevent that from happening  the world s bank regulators get together to coordinate regulations through the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision  The Committee meets at the Bank for International Settlements  an international organization  founded in 1930 that fosters monetary and financial cooperation and acts as a bank for central banks  The Basel Committee periodically issues  accords  that set out international standards for bank capital  liquidity  and other aspects of bank operations  The first Basel Accords  now called Basel I  were issued in 1988  They were replaced by a new set of standards  Basel II  in 2004  Unfortunately  Basel II did not prevent the most recent global financial crisis  Failure or near failure of banks like Citibank  RBS  and Fortis required rescues and restructurings that ran to billions of dollars  pounds  and euros  It was back to the drawing boards to devise a new set of regulations  The world s bank regulators agreed on the main outlines of Basel III at the end of 2010  but the technical details and the timing were left to be worked out later  That is what all the fuss is about now  Global banks have tirelessly lobbied the working groups assigned to fill in the details of the regulations  and their efforts seem to have paid off  The final rules now being issued look much weaker than the strictest rules that would have been allowed under the outline approved in 2010  What is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio  Banks need liquidity because they cannot always control the timing of their needs for cash  Unexpected withdrawals by depositors  the favorite example of textbooks  are just one of many reasons that banks need liquidity  Other contingencies include sudden unavailability of interbank loans  a need for cash to meet line of credit agreements  and the need to honor off balance sheet obligations  Reserves of liquid assets provide a first line of defense  but as those are depleted  a bank may have to sell less liquid assets at  fire sale  prices below book value  Doing so erodes its capital and may lead to insolvency  During a crisis  a liquidity spiral may develop that spreads problems from weaker to stronger banks  Early in the crisis  a few weak banks are forced to dump assets to cover deposit losses  collateral calls  or other liquidity needs  Falling asset prices weaken the balance sheets of other banks  and force them  too  to sell assets at fire sale prices  Soon even healthy banks are subject to stress  In the fall of 2008  just such a liquidity spiral helped spread the financial crisis throughout the globe from its origins in the U S  subprime mortgage market  Regulations can moderate liquidity risk by setting rules for both the asset and liability sides of bank balance sheets  On the asset side  regulations can require minimum cash reserves  including reserve deposits at central banks  and encourage holding of additional liquid assets like short term government bonds  On the liability side  regulations can limit banks  reliance on volatile wholesale funding while encouraging use of stable funding like insured retail deposits  Negotiations leading up to the 2010 Basel III agreements focused on two major kinds of liquidity regulation  One was a proposal for a liquidity coverage ratio sufficient to guarantee that a bank could survive a 30 day stress period  hopefully long enough to permit recapitalization or orderly wind up  Another proposal called for a net stable funding ratio that would have encouraged banks to hold more liquid assets and rely less on potentially unstable liabilities   These ratios are described in greater detail in    Both kinds of liquidity regulation require measuring the liquidity of various kinds of assets and liabilities  Are the long term bonds of all governments equally liquid  Are AAA corporate bonds 50 percent as liquid as government bonds  or 40 percent as liquid  What is the risk of a run on consumer bank deposits compared to a run on wholesale funding like repurchase agreements  The answers to questions like these determine the weights that are incorporated in the final regulations  One set of weights could put real teeth in the regulations  another could make them toothless  It now appears that banks  lobbying efforts have paid off  Early on  they managed to relegate the net stable funding ratio to a committee for years of further study  Now it appears that the final weights for assets and liabilities incorporated in the liquidity coverage ratio will be close to what the banks wanted wanted  That means business as usual  so bank shares are soaring  Why Should We Care  All this sounds pretty technical  so why should we care  If banks are happy to operate with less liquidity  aren t they the best judges  Wouldn t it be best just to let them take the risks and let their shareholders pick up the pieces if things go wrong  Unfortunately  things aren t so simple  When banks fail  the pain quickly spreads beyond their shareholders  One reason is that the rest of the economy suffers when bank failures suddenly dry up essential credit flows  The other is that banks are politically powerful  In past crises  they have succeeded in transferring a large share of their losses to taxpayers  Privatize the profits  socialize the losses  Of course  banks are not altogether indifferent to risk  They check your credit score before they make a loan  they hedge their currency risks when they borrow or lend internationally  and so on  Still  there are some kinds of risks that they do not always adequately control  The most problematic are so called negatively skewed risks  Those are risks that have a very small chance of actually happening  but that involve very large losses if they do occur  Banks tend to take inadequate precautions against such risks for two reasons  One is the expectation that  although they themselves may bear losses that are merely large  rare but truly catastrophic losses can be shifted to the government  Bonus based compensation systems also encourage bankers to pursue strategies that provide profits most of the time  even at the risk of occasional catastrophic loss  Top executives almost never go to jail when their strategies suffer spectacular failures  At worst  they lose their jobs  while retaining bonuses they have banked in the past and golden parachutes that were written into their contracts in better times  Liquidity risks  by their nature  are negatively skewed  In the normal course of business  banks don t have to worry much about liquidity  If they need more cash  they can depend on selling assets at fair market prices or they can borrow from their financial peers  Systemic liquidity crises  when sound assets can be sold only at fire sale prices and lines of credit dry up  are rare  Regulations like liquidity coverage ratios and net stable funding ratios are supposed to tame the appetite of bankers for negatively skewed liquidity risks  if they are not weakened beyond all effectiveness  That  then  is what all the fuss is about  It now looks as if Basel III liquidity regulations are going to be weak  There won t be as much protection against the risk of a new banking crisis as it seemed a couple of years ago  when the outline of Basel III was first issued  To mix a metaphor  it appears that once again  we are going to leave the vampire squid to guard the henhouse  For more on the liquidity coverage ratio

121529,343044,NYT,Europe Dodges Another Bullet  And It s Not The Catalan Election  ,opinion,I have written in the past about how tail risk is diminishing in the eurozone  Another recent event occurred which further racheted down the probability of another black swan event  No  it wasn t the results of the Catalan election  where the ruling secessionist CiU underperformed expectations that it would get between 60 and 64 seats  via    Instead  it appears to have won a measly 50 seats  with the left wing separatist ERC in second place with 21 seats  Together they could form a majority that could call for a referendum  However  Masa Serdarevic of FT Alphaville noted  It s also important to notice that the independent parties together are instead expected to obtain a clear majority  United  they could thus still approve a motion calling a referendum on independence  It would however be a completely unusual coalition centred on the conservative CiU and the leftist ERC  The Russian Black Sea Fleet in Athens  No  the wild card that I had been watching for is for Greece to turn to Russia instead of the Troika for financing  What if the Greeks got tired of the pain and turned to Putin for relief  For centuries Moscow has had an historical desire for the warm waters of the Mediterranean  A financing deal could have shaken up NATO and significantly shifted the geopolitical balance in the Eastern Mediterranean  The test case was Cyprus  Russian nationals have a large presence on that island  As its banks got into trouble because they were stuffed full of Greek debt  the Cyprus economy was in peril  As the  reported in June  The Russian government last year gave Cyprus a three year loan of 2 5 billion euros  or  3 1 billion at the current exchange rate  at a below market rate of 4 5 percent to help it service its debt  Cyprus now needs at least 1 8 billion euros  or  2 3 billion  by the end of this month to buttress its ailing banking sector  Instead of turning to the EU  they turned to Russia  emphasis added   Now many on this tiny island nation  whose banks and government are facing economic insolvency  are hoping for financial salvation from Russia rather than Germany and the European Union    I would much rather be saved by Moscow   said Elena Tsolia  30  an attendant at the department store Debenhams  where Russian shoppers snap up bottles of Dior and

before development  the company said   The gas discovery in the exclusive economic zone of our country creates great prospects for Cyprus and its people  which we shall seriously  prudently and collectively exploit to serve public interest   Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said at a press conference in Nicosia today   Cyprus is coming into Europe s energy map with prospects of substantially contributing to the EU s energy security   Cyprus would have been the test case of Russia flexing its financial and geopolitical muscle in the Eastern Mediterranean   Today Nicosia  tomorrow Athens  Can you say  Russian Black Sea fleet base in Athens  or Crete   On Friday however  a little noticed announcement came across my desk  The headline was   The Government of the Republic of Cyprus informed on the 25th of June 2012 the appropriate European Authorities of its decision to submit to euro area Member States a request of financial assistance from the EFSF ESM   This

121531,343046,NYT,Euro Falls On Concerns About The Future Of The Eurozone,opinion,The euro fell again on Thursday morning  trading near  1 2931  After three long meetings in three weeks  European Union finance ministers and International Monetary Fund Director Christine Lagarde were able to reach an agreement regarding Greece s troubled finances and their next installment of bailout money   The plan they created has been under fire by critics who say it is too optimistic about Greece s ability to grow and get its finances in order  The plan requires that EU members lower Greece s borrowing rates and extend the maturities of their bonds  making the loans much less profitable  and in some cases expensive  to the lending countries   Critics believe that the plan and release of aid is little more than a band aid covering the larger problem  Many expect that EU countries like Germany will eventually have to write off the struggling country s debt  despite their very vocal opposition to that notion   The plan also calls for tougher cuts  a prospect the already weary Greek people have not accepted with open arms  After years of austerity measures  Greece  much like most countries in southern Europe  has struggled with protests and demonstrations as citizens reject spending cuts and tax increases   Weeks ago in Spain  several shocking suicides shook the country as many of its people faced eviction from their homes as a result of unpaid debts  Now  as banks prepare to cut their budgets in order to restructure and receive rescue funds  it is the employees who will pay the price  The New York Times reported that Bankia will cut more than 6 000 employees  nearly 28 percent of its workforce   The cuts in Spain have lead to a resurgence of a Catalonian independence movement  as residents and politicians in the wealthy region believe their tax dollars are being mismanaged and used to bail out struggling parts of the country   Throughout Europe  social unrest seems to be a common thread as countries suffer cut after cut with little progress on solving their debt issues  Some believe that the only solution is to discontinue bailout packages and allow countries to default in order to create more incentive to keep budgets tight   By Laura Brodbeck,2012-11-30,Benzinga ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/euro-falls-on-concerns-about-the-future-of-the-eurozone-145570,145570
121532,343047,NYT,On Giving Obama Power To Trash The Debt Ceiling,opinion,The topic headlined above is currently being debated on Capitol Hill  pushed by  Little Timmy  Geithner and either ignorantly or duplicitously reported on by the usual apparatchiks  The New York Times  Bloomberg News  The Washington Post  L A  Times et al  Lest Obama s loyal minions embarrass themselves by reflexively supporting this nitwit idea like so many others they ve embraced in the past  here s something for them to ponder from   one of my very favorite reads  Editor Bill Buckler drops a well deserved turd in the punch bowl with his trenchant  succinct analysis   If the US Dollar was not the world s reserve currency and U S  Treasury IOUs were not the world s preferred holding of reserves behind their own currencies and financial systems  the Treasury s debt limit would have been done away with a long time ago  But the US Dollar IS the world s reserve currency so the debt of the US government IS the underpinnings of the global financial system  That being the case  the system stands or falls on the continuing perception that Treasury debt paper is a viable form of  reserve  and that the debt of the US government will NEVER become  unsustainable   An announcement by the US government that it was getting rid of any  limits  to its debt generating capacity would put that perception at risk   quite possibly at grave risk   That is the reason why the debt limit remains   even though it has not been an impediment to ever increasing Teasury indebtedness for well over half a century  It is easy to laugh at the seeming absurdity of a Treasury  debt limit  and many people do  Take it away  however  and the fiction that sovereign debt is  sustainable    let alone any  confidence  in its eventual repayment   would be MUCH harder to maintain  Absurdities abound in history  and the more abject the absurdity  the more tenacious it tends to be  Today  a US Treasury debt  limit  is a very necessary absurdity  This does not mean that the debt limit will NOT be abolished  But it does mean that the new Congress convening early next year will be very reluctant to take such a step  ,2012-12-03,Rick Ackerman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/on-giving-obama-power-to-trash-the-debt-ceiling-145934,145934

121535,343050,NYT,Three Cheers For China s New Data ,opinion,The big news in the past two weeks has been a slew of economic data suggesting that China has firmly turned the corner on its economic slow down  Growth is up  investment is up  and inflation is down  The following  for example  is the New York Times  a newspaper whose website is no longer available in China without a VPN  The Chinese economy grew faster than expected last month even as inflation slowed  official statistics showed on Friday  as the government continued heavy lending through its state owned banks to rekindle growth  The latest data  including industrial production  retail sales  fixed asset investment and electricity generation  were stronger than most economists had anticipated  They presented a consistent picture of an economy that is starting to show real growth again after a very weak spring and summer   It has become increasingly clear that the Chinese economy is now moving in a better direction   Zhou Xiaochuan  the governor of the People s Bank of China  the central bank  said at a news conference Thursday  before the October figures were publicly released  Bank economists increasingly agree   October s growth data delivered pleasant upside surprises across the board  providing fresh evidence that the economy has indeed bottomed out thanks to the filtering through of Beijing s policy easing   Sun Junwei  a China economist at HSBC  wrote in a research report Friday afternoon    Australia   New Zealand Banking said in a research note that the latest figures were consistent with 8 percent economic growth in the last quarter of this year and even faster expansion in the first quarter of next year    The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics said Friday that industrial production had risen 9 6 percent in October from the same month a year earlier  compared with 9 2 percent in September and 8 9 percent in August  Retail sales were up 14 5 percent in October from a year earlier  compared with 14 2 percent in September  even though slower inflation at the consumer level was acting as a brake on the increase in retail sales  Fixed asset investment was up 20 7 percent for the first 10 months of this year  after having been up 20 5 percent for the first nine months of this year  China releases only year to date figures for fixed asset investment  partly because of the difficulty in tracking when money is actually spent on big construction projects  Consumer prices were up only 1 7 percent in October from a year ago  compared with an increase of 1 9 percent in September  Western economists had expected inflation in China to stay steady in October instead of slowing  Producer prices were down 2 8 percent in October from a year ago  a slightly faster pace than the 2 7 percent decrease that economists had expected but not as fast a decline as in September  when they were down 3 6 percent  A lot of analysts are hailing the news as evidence that the Chinese economy has  truly bottomed out   in the  of Ting Lu at Merrill Lynch  Credit Agricole is  more bullish   astonishingly so  in my opinion   It s pretty clear that there is no hard landing risk  that the economy will improve in the fourth quarter and we re going to see 9 per cent year on year growth in the first half of next year   Dariusz Kowalczyk  senior economist and strategist for non Japan Asia  Credit Agricole CIB  told Reuters  I think we need to be very cautious and refrain from allowing ourselves to get too caught up in the huge sigh of relief that the sell side is heaving  Growth rates in China will continue to slow dramatically in the next few years  and if there are temporary lulls  as there must be  these do not represent any sort of  bottoming out  at all  They simply represent the fact that Beijing cannot afford politically to allow the adjustment to taker place too quickly  and from time to time Beijing is are going to step on the investment accelerator to speed things up temporarily  More CreditDoing so of course will only make the adjustment longer and more painful  but given how difficult politically the transition to a balanced economy is likely to be  we would be crazy to expect otherwise  One reason for worry was listed in the New York Times article cited above  But the renewed growth has been fueled by rapidly mounting debt  as state owned banks and the central bank have funneled hundreds of billions of dollars in additional lending to state owned enterprises and government agencies to finance further investment projects  You can get as much growth as you like if you expand credit  but once expanding credit has become the problem  it cannot also be a permanent solution to slower growth  The country s balance sheet continues to deteriorate   and the most recent growth spurt implies faster deterioration   and this  ultimately  is the main constraint of the Chinese growth model  Within the banking sector we are seeing all kinds of strains as companies and banks stretch for liquidity  Large company receivables are growing quickly  as are payables  no one  it seems  wants to part with cash   loans simply are not getting repaid  and deposits are no longer growing  perhaps because flight capital is more than enough to offset China s very high trade surplus  Here is an article in the Financial Times  China notched up its biggest trade surplus in nearly four years in October  giving the country s economic recovery an extra boost but potentially adding fuel to foreign criticism of Beijing s support for its exporters  Chinese exports increased 11 6 per cent last month  topping market expectations and pushing the trade surplus to  32bn  China s largest since January 2009  Remember that thanks to disguised flight capital and commodity stockpiling the surplus is almost certainly a lot larger than reported  and yet banks are still feeling the liquidity squeeze  And for all their happy noises  the authorities nonetheless are worried  at least about certain parts of the banking system  According to an article in the South China Morning Post  The mainland s bond regulator has stopped approving debt sales by governments below provincial level  underscoring concerns of defaults arising from a flood of bond issues by local government financing vehicles this year   The National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors  appointed by the central bank to supervise the interbank bond market  had suspended applications to issue medium term bills by local governments other than provinces  municipalities  provincial capitals and other specially designated cities  industry sources said   The suspension  expected to last until the end of next month  was aimed at controlling risk after  shell companies  without any cash flows or assets applied to issue debts on behalf of some local governments  a source close to the association said  Most worrying of all Charlene Chu  perhaps the only analyst who actually understand what is happening in the banking system  released a new report with Fitch Ratings that is described in a Reuters article  Fitch Ratings says faster growth of broad credit in Q312 was one factor behind the recent improvement in Chinese economic data  In a comment published today  the agency highlights that  after slowing from Q411 to Q212  broad credit is back on track to surpass CNY17trn  USD2 7trn  in 2012   Fitch s measure of broad credit includes shadow and offshore sources omitted from the central bank s official total societal financing metric   This marks the fourth year in a row that net new credit will exceed one third of GDP   said Charlene Chu  Head of Chinese banks  ratings at Fitch  At current growth rates  by 2013 China s banking sector assets will have expanded by nearly USD14trn since 2008  This is equivalent to replicating the entire US commercial banking sector in just five years  Such massive balance sheet expansion has limits  according to the agency  You Can Accelerate Investment ForeverIt is  to me  astonishing that China in just five years is  replicating the entire US commercial banking sector   and yet so many analysts are expressing delight with China s return to growth  Of course you can generate growth if you force such a tremendous expansion in credit  but this is simply unsustainable  I know I ve said this many times  and I apologize for boring regular readers  but while I expected that politics would require a jump in growth over the rest of this year and the beginning of the next  this  good growth  tells us nothing about the health of the underlying economy  It only tells us how difficult politically the transition is likely to be  My guess is that the more difficult the consolidation of power  the longer the period of above 7  growth   so the happier the sell side analysts are  the more worried long term investors should be  At some point growth will start dropping rapidly again  and of course the same analysts who are now hailing the return to rapid growth will assure you  when growth begins to slow sharply again  that this was part of Beijing s plan and was fully predictable  China is slowing because Beijing wants it to slow  they will say  and that s a good thing  Meanwhile the fact that China is speeding up is also a good thing  For those who are interested  I discuss some of this in a debate with the estimable Nick Lardy in last week s Wall Street Journal   was held on November 2 and  on November 7  I also published for Foreign Policy last week a longer  on the challenges facing the new leadership in China  My main argument in the Foreign Policy piece is that both historical precedents and a common sense understanding of the rebalancing process suggest that politics  not economics  will determine China s success  So far Beijing has succeeded largely because of its ability to collect and control the total savings of the country  and unleash waves of investment whenever necessary  Many countries have done the same things  but once credit expansion is no longer efficiently invested  few countries have made the transition to a different growth model  Powerful groups who benefitted from the old growth model   in China they are referred to generically as  vested interests    have always succeeded in diluting or preventing the necessary reforms  The rebalancing always occurs anyway  either in the form of a debt crisis and negative growth or in the form of a long period of no growth and slow rebalancing  Some times   very rarely   the country completes the rebalancing and then moves swiftly on to becoming a developed country  but this doesn t happen often  Of the dozens of developing economies that have experienced investment driven growth miracles in the past 100 years  the only ones that have managed the transition to developed country status are South Korea  Taiwan  and maybe Chile  This is a pretty limited success ratio  China s previous success  in other words  tells us noting about how it will manage the next stage  and the precedents give us little reason to assume that the country can t help but advance to the next stage of development  In fact the more confident Beijing is that it will manage the transition successfully  the less likely it is to succeed  which is why I am delighted that policy advisors seem so much more pessimistic than sell side analysts  What happens to China will be determined largely by the political decisions it will make in the next few years  and it is foolish to assume we know how things will turn out  This is an abbreviated version of the newsletter that went out three weeks ago  Academics  journalists  and government and NGO officials who want to subscribe to the newsletter should

121566,343081,NYT,Hedge Fund Fees May Be Even Higher Than I Thought,opinion,The entire eastern seaboard of the United States is waiting tentatively for Hurricane Sandy s arrival  Our patio furniture has been safely stored indoors  Batteries and candles are well supplied in anticipation of the inevitable power loss  and with preparations done we wait for the slowly arriving worst storm many of us have ever seen  So naturally  I turned to Gretchen Morgensen s article in the New York Times today       Gretchen focuses on the costs of active money management and questions whether society has received much benefit from the increasing share of GDP that is represented by the financial services industry  It s a worthy question and one that society has a right to ask given events of the past few years  In this she highlights a recent academic paper     and in clicking on the hyperlink to this paper I was fascinated to see included an estimate of hedge fund fees  Readers of my book  will be familiar with my assertion that fees had consumed fully 98  of the investor profits in excess of t bills through 2010  I even posted a illustrating the fact on my blog a few months ago  If you look at the chart you ll note that the 2  sliver of pie denoting the clients  share only lasts through 2010  Including 2011 wipes it out  but since I couldn t conceive of a negative slice of pie in two dimensions the schematic had to run only through 2010  The Alternative Investment Managers Association  AIMA  in London  whose sorry task it is to defend past practices of their paymasters in the hedge fund industry  has made a couple of to respond to the chief finding of my book  that all the money ever invested in hedge funds would have been better off in treasury bills   but even AIMA has not attempted a robust defense of the 2   20 fee structure  AIMA s recent paper was effectively demolished   They do rather lamely offer that fees have amounted to 3 5  per annum  and even though that sounds high to most people it s based on the same flawed structure used throughout their paper which relies on a hypothetical investor with an equally weighted portfolio started in 1994  Whether such an investor actually exists or not is another matter   I think it s more realistic to measure how ALL the money has done  and in 1994 while investors did well there weren t that many of them  So I was interested to note that in the Greenwood and Scharfstein paper referenced above  hedge fund fees are found to be similar to my numbers  For example  the paper states that hedge fund fees reached  69BN in 2007  remarkably close to the  70BN estimate that I found and included in my book  Greenwood and Scharfstein weren t focused on hedge fund fees necessarily in their paper  and they make a good point that active management can lead to more efficient security pricing and greater diversification which ultimately lowers the cost of capital for companies  you ll have to read their paper to see why this makes sense  but I think it does   So they re not highly critical of hedge funds  although they feel fees are too high  and they reach a similar place to me on fees  But then I came across an earlier paper by Kenneth French in the 2008 Journal of Finance      and although Kenneth French focuses just on equity long short hedge funds he estimates that the average annual drag of fees from 1996 2007 is 6 5   virtually double what AIMA rather hopefully suggested  In fact  if I d used his methodology I would have come up with even higher estimates in my book  If some observers feel I ve treated hedge funds too kindly on the fee issue  I can now understand why  It seems academic papers are all around showing that it s been at least as bad as I ve described ,2012-10-29,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hedge-fund-fees-may-be-even-higher-than-i-thought-141468,141468
121567,343082,NYT,Lessons From Sandy  Market Manipulation 101,opinion,As Hurricane Sandy hit the US east coast  the  reported that institutions found work arounds for trading their portfolios  Even with the U S  stock market closed  investors found ways to trade   You can work around it to a certain extent   said Nanette Buziak  head of equity trading at ING Investment Management  On Monday morning   where I would have been trading in stocks  we ended up trading what we needed to in futures  We re also still trading where we need to in international markets   This brings to mind the risks of market manipulation  Even with a relatively thin market  traders can find work arounds to arbitrage away attempts at manipulation  Consider this  story about the Romney contract on intrade com about a week ago  emphasis added   For a moment it looked as if Mitt Romney s chances of becoming the next president were up  way up   His odds of winning the election soared around 10 a m  Tuesday to nearly 49 percent on the betting site Intrade  up about eight percentage points from a few minutes earlier   The numbers on Intrade  which have put the odds of President Obama s winning on Nov  6 at over 60 percent for the last several weeks  are closely watched by pundits and Wall Street traders because they are constantly updated based on wagers on the changing election odds  In 2008  the site s users correctly predicted an Obama victory  But the system is relatively thinly traded and so a few politically motivated bettors with money to burn can place strategic wagers that push around the numbers displayed on the site   Was it an attempt at manipulation or just a naive trader pushing up the price of the Romney contract   As I write these words  the  Obama contract is steady at about 63  and Romney at 37   which are roughly the levels they were at during the summer If I had a few bucks to throw around and I was intent on moving the presidential election odds around in Romney s favor  here is what I would need to do in order to cover all the  work arounds  that other traders would try  First and foremost  I would push the price of the Obama contract down and the Romney contract up and I would need sufficient capital to maintain them at the levels I want  Next  I would need to manipulate the   Perhaps push CO and VA into the leaning Republican category and move OH into either a tossup or leaning Republican state  Since those contracts are relatively thin  it shouldn t be that hard to move them and maintain prices at desired levels Even though trading on intrade is relatively thin  don t forget that intrade prices can be arbitraged  So don t forget to push the odds around on UK based sports betting sites such as    and  Also don t forget other prediction markets like the  too  Whew  Market manipulation is hard  That s because markets are relatively efficient  at least in a crude way  Even in thin markets  the Invisible Hand can find work arounds if the market manipulator isn t careful  The moral of this story  If intrade odds move around in a dramatic fashion between now and election day  look at these secondary indicators to gauge if someone is trying to manipulate markets in order to give a false picture Cam Hui is a portfolio manager at     Qwest    This article is prepared by Mr  Hui as an outside business activity  As such  Qwest does not review or approve materials presented herein  The opinions and any recommendations expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not reflect the opinions or recommendations of Qwest  None of the information or opinions expressed in this blog constitutes a solicitation for the purchase or sale of any security or other instrument  Nothing in this article constitutes investment advice and any recommendations that may be contained herein have not been based upon a consideration of the investment objectives  financial situation or particular needs of any specific recipient  Any purchase or sale activity in any securities or other instrument should be based upon your own analysis and conclusions  Past performance is not indicative of future results  Either Qwest or Mr  Hui may hold or control long or short positions in the securities or instruments mentioned ,2012-10-31,Cam Hui,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lessons-from-sandy:-market-manipulation-101-141826,141826
121568,343083,NYT,Asset Management And The Future Global Pension Crisis ,opinion, Prichard is the future  we re all on the same conveyor belt  Prichard is just a little further down the road    Michael Aguirre  New York Times  22 December 2010 Introduction  In 2009 the small Alabama city of Pritchard  outside Mobile became the first city in America to stop paying pensions to its retired workers   For years the city had been warned that if it did not put more money aside its pension fund would run dry  It was even ordered to do so by the State court   The City Mayor ignored the court order  deciding it would be better to keep hospitals open  street lights on and paying teachers  salaries  The additional money to fund the city pension liabilities simply didn t exist   Many of the affected retirees have now filed for bankruptcy or gone back to work  The Future of PensionsThis is the future across the developed world   Private sector workers in rich countries already know the days of defined benefit pensions on retirement are long gone   Employees in the private sector have realised that they are in charge of looking after their own retirement  Their existing employers will contribute something but are in no way responsible for providing a comfortable income on retirement nor will they backstop the performance of their private pension fund   The big change over the next couple of decades will be in the public sector   This will be the inability of rich world governments to fund their public sector employee pensions   Governments across the rich world have already accrued gigantic unfunded pension liabilities  the majority of which are of the defined benefit kind  i e  guaranteeing a pension based on final salary   In most cases these future liabilities are not even included in national debt figures   The slow realization by both governments and their state employees that the money to fund their retirements does not exist  will be one of the defining themes of the next 30 years   Rich governments are already finding it difficult to fund even existing public services under crushing national debt  There is no way they can feasibly fund additional future pension liabilities as populations decline  birth rates stagnate and life expectancy increases   In the US public pension funds from Illinois to Philadelphia to San Diego are all under enormous strain  This will exacerbate over the coming years as more people retire and live longer  healthier lives   However  at least the US has a replacement birth rate  In Europe  outside of the UK  France and Ireland  birth rates have plummeted over the last 4 decades  This has been particularly marked in Eastern and Mediterranean Europe where many countries are in significant population decline   Populations in many European countries have not saved anything whatsoever for retirement  leaving it wholly in the hands of their governments to provide a satisfactory income for their twilight years  These same governments are now sinking under massive public debt   The German economy may be healthy now  but its population is due to fall 15  by the middle of the century  Trying to maintain a high standard of living and pay generous pension benefits will be impossible  It is no wonder they save so hard   Train drivers in France famously retire at 50  In Poland army and military officers retire after 15 years  33 year old pensioners exist across the country   Other countries are actually going backwards  In an attempt at maintaining his declining popularity Putin s Russia has just completely scrapped employee contributions towards their pensions  This from a country that already has 87 pensioners for even 100 workers  and which is forecast to reach 100 pensioners to 100 workers by the end of this decade    Worse  some governments have already raided state and private pension funds to finance their existing economic difficulties  for example Argentina and Ireland  leaving their future national retirement funding particularly precarious   The future global pension crisis will likely come with a bang and not a whimper  This is because large voting numbers of older workers make reform unpalatable and unpopular  Politicians seeking re election will not suggest fundamental pension reform  Unions will not allow it   Instead state pension coffers around the world will simply run dry  Court cases will be mounted by those affected and probably won by them too   but that won t change a thing   The money to pay the rich worlds enormous unfunded pension obligations does not exist  What this means for asset management Why is this so relevant to the asset management industry   Public sector workers worldwide will slowly come to realise what private sector workers already know   you are in charge of funding your retirement   For those in asset management this will be a very positive development   There will be a long term surge in demand for successful fund managers  those who can generate alpha and provide stable long term returns   All this could mean an avalanche of new capital into the industry  Far more savings and investment will be directed towards asset management as the rich world s public sector workers try and adequately fund their future retirement   Individuals will have to contribute more of their income  Governments will be made to properly fund their future  smaller  pension liabilities   their existing funding shortfalls having been so comprehensively exposed in the years ahead   The hunt for yield will increase the demand for a variety of assets and investment types  This will expand the reach of Alterative Investments  such as Hedge Funds  and increase their allocation by retail investors   The long term nature of many pension investments may also mean opportunities for Private Equity managers  Those invested in long term company turnarounds or stable infrastructural projects  roads  bridges etc  may be an attractive multi decade investment   The future parallel commodities boom will also mean huge growth opportunities for resource focused managers  The 50  increase in world population by mid century and the declining reserves of many minerals  metals and energy will result in a huge increase in demand for these commodities and their related investments  e g  mining services  technology and exploration    This could be particularly prevalent in agriculture and energy  The world s attempts to feed a burgeoning population and provide cheap renewalable energy to its population  could dovetail nicely with an expansion of investment in those areas by global pension funds  ConclusionStein s Law tells us that  If something cannot go on forever  it will stop    This is what Pritchard  Alabama shows us   The governments of the rich world do not have the financial assets to match their unfunded pension liabilities  The unthinkable can and will happen in the years ahead   Private sector workers already know they are in charge of funding their retirement  In the years ahead  government workers will come to realise this too  As people live longer  they will have to save far more for their retirement   The long term nature of this retirement trend indicates a bright future for the asset management industry   The huge future demand for pension investments represents an enormous opportunity for asset managers

121569,343084,NYT,Book Review  Greg Smith s Why I Left Goldman Sachs,opinion,By now you ve undoubtedly heard that Greg Smith s Why I Left Goldman Sachs  A Wall Street Story  Grand Central Publishing  2012  has little to add to  or even to support  the charges he leveled against the firm in his New York Times op ed piece  Those looking for evidence that Goldman really is  in Matt Taibbi s phrase  a great vampire squid  will have to turn elsewhere   It s hard to fathom how the author levered his op ed into an alleged  1 5 million advance except perhaps to suggest that he really did learn how to rip people off at Goldman  As long as I m being snarky  I might as well point out Smith s fixation with status and salary  He regularly compares himself to others who advanced through the ranks more quickly than he did  And  although he was initially euphoric over his salary  he begins to feel shortchanged  In the London office  making less than  500 000  he was miffed  he asked for  and not surprisingly did not get  a  1 million bonus   Smith  who was an intern in the summer of 2000 and became a full time employee in 2001  essentially divides Goldman into the pre  and post financial crisis eras  Pre financial crisis the firm had the highest ethical standards  the client always came first  Post financial crisis  with former trader Lloyd Blankfein at the helm  the firm lost its moral compass in the search for profits  Such a stark contrast is undoubtedly unwarranted  We mustn t forget that Smith himself was transitioning from a wide eyed newbie to a somewhat jaded employee who was not convinced the firm appreciated him sufficiently   When Smith isn t being polemical or self serving  however  he tells a compelling coming of age on Wall Street story  He learned what to wear on the trading floor  Brooks Brothers khaki dress pants and dress shirts in different shades of blue  and to how to hang onto clients  even if it meant intentionally losing at ping pong  It was pounded into him that he had to admit and rectify any trading mistake quickly  as he proudly announces  he made only one  which cost Goldman all of  80   and I guess it was a matter of personal judgment just how smashed he could get with clients   The eager to please junior trader is a much more sympathetic character than the vice president who balked when offered the London job  He  London  I don t know what he expected  Getting sent abroad is often part and parcel of moving up at Goldman  I used to socialize on weekends with a Goldman partner who had earlier logged several years in Hong Kong and London  It was part of the drill   I m glad I read this book if for nothing else than the descriptions of trading floor action  But Goldman lawyers won t have to stay up late worrying about the potential fallout from Why I Left Goldman Sachs  And I suspect that much more public relations damage was done with the op ed piece than will be done with this book ,2012-11-07,Brenda Jubin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/book-review:-greg-smith's-why-i-left-goldman-sachs-142652,142652
121571,343086,NYT,Gold Dealer Commercials With Obama Victory Scaring Conservatives,opinion,Watch for Glenn Beck and Right Wing Media to Advertise More Gold Dealer Commercials With Obama Victory Scaring Conservatives Into Buying High Commission Gold CoinsI noticed quite a few hits on my site for the search term  Glenn Beck and gold  this morning  which means Glenn Beck is using the fear of what an Obama election can bring to America in getting investors to buy gold from the gold dealer that he recommends and gets paid to recommend  By  you will find the search terms on my website buygoldandsilversafely com just from three hours this morning where Glenn Beck was searched for multiple times  While it may be true that Glenn Beck has much to be fearful of with four more years of an Obama administration  and gold is a good way for one to insure themselves from the future inflation that the additional debt burden will bring  one should ask one question of all gold dealers before buying their gold  If I buy these coins from you today at price  x that you quoted me  and sell them immediately back to you today  how much will you give me for them  But be careful with the answer they give you  A firm may tell you they only charge you 1  on the buyback of the coins  but you need to get the exact price since that buy back price can be 15  to 30  or more lower than what you paid for the coins  Also  some dealers may say they don t have any charge to you their customer when you sell the coins back  but you still need to get a buyback price from them since again  that price may be much lower than you think  Also  keep in mind  it s easy for gold dealers to rip off their customers by selling them gold because most people don t know anything about buying gold  the Fed doesn t like competition   The company Glenn Beck touts sold  500 million in coins last year  I am confident Glenn Beck got a good chunk from them since according to a New York Times reporter who interviewed me   they have a shrine to Glenn Beck over there   I don t need to mention their name here  but they are advertised all over Glenn Beck s site since they have an exclusive deal with him to promote their company  You can also Google   Santa Monica city sues gold company  to learn more  Said company  according to the lawsuit  can no longer use the term  confiscate   but I still know of many gold dealers who still try to scare their clients into buying high commissioned gold by still saying certain coins  like European or Numismatic pre 1933 coins  might be confiscated  Lower Buyback Prices On European Coins and Numismatic Coins These lower buy back prices are typically charged on European coins or Numismatic coins  pre 1933 U S  coins   For European coins  this would be the Swiss 20 Franc  British Sovereign or French 20 Franc Rooster to name a few  I have had clients call me that tell me the dealer wanted to charge them upwards of 30  on these coins  The problem is  the salesman tell the caller they  might have more value to them someday because they are rate  or  might not be confiscated  or  non reportable   Baloney  The same goes for numismatic coins like the St  Gaudens or Indian Head early American gold coins  They might be a piece of history  but not worth paying up for  If we ever did get to a barter situation again  all the vendor who has the things you want is interested in will be   what is the weight content of the gold you have   The Only Gold You Need To Buy The only gold you need to buy from any dealer  not just mine  is the kind of gold that has the lowest premium to the current spot price  We here at Buy Gold and Silver Safely only charge a 1  fee on top of the current ask price which we list on our site   There are no bait and switch tactics  There are no sales come ons about why one type of gold that is rare or even a proof coin might do better than bullion coins  In fact  we here at Buy Gold and Silver Safely don t even sell the European  Proof or Numismatic coins  It is a philosophy we have that simply says  our clients will benefit from having the most gold or silver in their hands and should not have to pay more for it  Yes  we survive as a company on a small margin of profitability  but we also don t have the overhead expense of paying for 100 s of sales people and those internet  TV and radio ads that the high commissioned companies pay for  How else do you think they can afford these commercials except by charging you high commissions  While Glenn Beck may be good at telling the story of our Founding Forefathers and understand how our nation is turning for the worst with the added debt our government and the Fed is accumulating  especially with Presidents who do nothing about curtailing their spending but just increase the deficits  George W  Bush included   I don t think even he would pay 15  to 30  commission to buy gold coins  In fact  I can t call those who do so  stupid   and one would think Glenn Beck s not stupid  perhaps greedy    but please do your homework folks  Gold is the answer to this spending madness  but buy the right kind and ask the right questions  Just do your homework and buy the right kind of gold and ask the right questions  If you haven t read my free report   4 Ways Gold Dealers Rip You Off   click here to read On the gold front  I go against most in my industry and am still dollar bullish because of the mess in Europe  the Euro makes up 54  of the U S  Dollar Index   which we are now seeing the EUR USD break lower under 1 28  I have been consistently warning of the dollar getting stronger over the short term and based on my research and the data I see  Europe is in much worse shape than the U S   as bad as it is here   The best way to invest in gold is to dollar cost average into a position of gold bullion coins or gold bars  hope the price goes lower so you can get a better overall price and let our government take care of the future price appreciation through their spending programs they never curtail  because they always have a complicit Federal Reserve to pay for things  ,2012-11-09,Doug

121572,343087,NYT,The Truth About Earnings And How Forecasting Earnings Is The Key,opinion,In part one of this two part series on the importance of earnings I focused on the historical relationship between earnings and market price utilizing cyclical companies to illustrate the validity of my thesis  In this part two  I am going to focus on how since we learned from the past how important and highly correlated the earnings and price relationship is  that it only logically follows that future results will also be a function of future earnings achievements  Therefore  I confidently state that forecasting future earnings is the key to long term investing success   Furthermore  I want to acknowledge that I believe that investors cannot escape the obligation to forecast  our results depend upon it  However  we should not just guess  nor should we merely play hunches  Forecasting should be approached as analytically and even as scientifically as possible  Our goal is to calculate reasonable probabilities based on all factual information that we can assemble  We should then apply analytical methods that are employed based upon our underlying earnings driven rationale  The endgame is providing us reasons to believe that the relationships producing earnings growth in the past will persist in the future  Maybe not at the precise historical rate  but at least at a rate that should compensate us for the risk we are assuming   I believe the best way to accomplish a forecast that is reasonable within an acceptable range of probabilities is by applying both a macro and micro analysis  However  by macro I am not implying attempting to forecast the economy or political events  Instead  I believe that investors should focus on the major macroeconomic trends that identify the possibilities of major future investment opportunities  There are two that quickly come to mind  analyzing and monitoring demographics  and focusing on the potential of technological advancement   The Macro Approach  Regarding demographics  perhaps the most important factor to recognize is what I like to call our population s current bimodal distribution  namely  the graying of America and the baby boomer generation  Both of these powerful demographic forces are currently merging to create a powerful demographic associated with the aging of our population  By understanding the consumption tendencies of these and other demographic segments will allow us to make informed forecasts on the future health of several industries that will serve these large and growing markets  Of course  two obvious industries would be healthcare and financial services associated with retirement planning   Regarding technological enhancements  there are just too many to single out  I believe the best way to learn more about this is to buy the New York Times best selling book  Abundance  The Future is Better Than You Think  by Peter H  Diamandis and Steven Kotler  The book is just out  and the following are just a sampling of the many excellent reviews pouring in    A manifesto for the future that is grounded in practical solutions addressing the world s most pressing concerns  overpopulation  food  water  energy  education  health care and freedom      The Wall Street Journal    a godsend for those who suffer from Armageddon fatigue      The Economist Magazine   This is a vital book  Diamandis and Kotler give us a blinding glimpse of the innovations that are coming our way and that they are helping to create      Matt Ridley  Author of The Rational Optimist  I would like to add that there are unbelievably exciting opportunities described in this  what I believe  is a groundbreaking book  However  I would also add that there are some very frightening possibilities that the book also points out  Nevertheless  the book is about the exponential growth potential from new ideas that are capable of changing our entire economic paradigm  But most importantly  many of these game changing technology advancements are already available  In my opinion  the ideas in the book are mostly for the better  but there are also issues that will need to be dealt with  To my way of thinking  anyone that has investment capital at risk should get a copy of this book   The Micro Approach  From the macro  the individual investor needs to move to the micro because ultimately  it is the individual security  or stock selection that produces long term returns  As I ve previously discussed in part one  long term returns are a function of earnings past  present and future  And  I believe there s no better way to come up with a reasonable forecast of future earnings than by conducting a thorough and comprehensive fundamental analysis on every company under consideration  However  the focus should be on attempting to determine whether said company possesses the future earnings power to provide you the returns required that are commensurate to the amount of risk you are taking to achieve them   As serendipity would have it  I received a communiqu  from MorningStar promoting a new growth stock product they are offering  Keep in mind that they are specifically speaking about growth stocks  however  I believe the underlying principles apply to all stock investing  There are two excerpts from their promotion that I thought succinctly spoke to what I m discussing in this article  the first is as follows    The central question for successful growth investing  as we see it  is this  how long can above average growth continue  Answer this question correctly  and you can make a lot of money  no matter how much you pay for a company s stock  Compounding growth is a powerful force     The second excerpt talks about companies sustaining and building their moats    How can investors spot growth that s unlikely to fizzle out   Our answer  focus on the economic moat trend  A company s ability to shield its business franchise not only protects its current profits  but also its growth prospects  Rather than simply focusing on companies already benefiting from strong competitive advantages  or focusing on companies that already have wide economic moats  we look at companies still building and growing their economic moats  We believe this brand of growth investing leads to high quality companies that can consistently compound their intrinsic values year after year   In other words  we buy not only growing companies  but also sustainably growing companies    To my way of thinking  MorningStar s above advice is extremely important when trying to determine the future growth potential of any company you are analyzing  On the other hand  it s often easier said than done  Recognizing and correctly evaluating a company s strategic advantage is a difficult task indeed  Furthermore  this is a process and not a one time act  In other words  it s imperative that the investor owner continues to monitor  check and recheck a company s strategic advantage on a continuous basis  Due diligence must be ongoing  Perhaps the good news is the company s prospects usually don t change overnight or in the blink of an eye  Therefore  the diligent investor would have ample time to reevaluate each company s prospects   A Quick Review of History Learning from the Past  In part one of this two part series we used four examples of cyclical companies that illustrated the undeniable earnings and price relationship and correlation  Although this  part two  is essentially focused on the future  there is much that can be learned from the past  So before we move on to a closer examination of the future  let s review the past by including one of our example cyclical companies from part one  and compare it to a company with a stronger history of earnings growth  For perspective  we re going to add a plotting of free cash flow to our F A S T  Graphs  research tool   Our first example once again looks at Caterpillar Inc   CAT  from the earnings and price correlated relationship with a free cash flow overlay  orange shaded area marked with a capital F  added  Clearly we see that Caterpillar  CAT  does generate free cash flow which is a sign of a strong and healthy business  However  we also see that price tracks earnings in a much more correlated fashion than it relates to free cash flow  In other words  from the graph below it becomes clear that when evaluating the intrinsic value  fair value  of Caterpillar  earnings are the key  But most importantly  focus on the cyclical nature of Caterpillar s earnings  When we move on to forecasting future earnings  the cyclical nature of the earnings history of this company will become a very important consideration With our second example we look at Ross Stores  ROST   a company with a much stronger and more consistent record of historical earnings growth  Once again we see a company that generates healthy levels of free cash flow  orange shaded area marked with a capital F   but note how price followed earnings higher even though free cash flow was falling during calendar years 2010 and 2011  However  as we suggested above with our cyclical choice  notice how the historical earnings growth of this company has been both strong and consistent  When evaluating the future prospects of this company  its historical record will once again become a very important consideration Starting with Consensus Analyst EstimatesThere tends to be a lot of controversy when talking about the consensus estimates from leading analysts following a given company  Most of the controversy deals with people s opinions about the accuracy  or lack thereof  of analysts  published expectations  In my opinion  these criticisms fail to recognize that estimating a company s future earnings is not  and cannot  be an exact science  Since estimates are forecasts  much of the facts that they are dealing with or are attempting to calculate are mostly unknowns  Although  as I stated earlier  estimates should not be mere guesses  instead  they should be reasonable projections based on all the factual data the analyst can assemble  coupled with reasonable projections of the future Consequently  when I am utilizing analyst estimates to evaluate a business  I always think in terms of ranges and probabilities rather than precise numbers  In other words  if the consensus of leading analysts says they expect the company to grow earnings at a rate of 15  over the next five years  I translate that to mean something  for example  like a range of 12  to 17   Moreover  when running my numbers to their logical conclusions  I will always run a best case  worst case and my most reasonable case  These  what if  scenarios allow me to assess risk more clearly  Therefore  I believe that I can make sound decisions that are neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic  Furthermore  by having a range of probabilities  I am more likely to have actual numbers fall somewhere within my range  than I am

121573,343088,NYT,Fiscal Cliff Will Mostly Hit Middle Class,opinion,Given all the rhetoric coming from the President Obama over the past year  one might be excused if they believed that the impending fiscal cliff largely impacted upper income individuals  Reality is a cruel mistress  it turns out  A recent New York Times article  involved in the fiscal cliff  From reading over this  it becomes obvious that the vast majority of tax increases would hit the middle class  The chart below provides a breakdown If you prefer this in pie chart form  you are in luck If we break these taxes down by which groups they will impact  I come up with these results  This does not paint a rosy picture of the  fiscal cliff  at all  Indeed  only 9 8  of the projected revenue in the  fiscal cliff  seem to definitively impact upper income earners  There are three groups of taxes cited above that might impact various groups  the estate tax  Obamacare taxes  and  short term breaks   The estate tax would at least  on the face of it  seem to impact upper income earners more  The Obamacare taxes are a mixed bag  and the short term breaks I m not totally sure about  but I d wager to guess that a significant bit of those hit the middle class  as well  An educated guess here would suggest that about 75  of the taxes in the fiscal cliff will hit lower and middle income earners  while the other 25  would hit the upper class  This makes suggestions by left wing political pundits such as Paul Krugman to not make a deal seem all the more asinine  It also emphasizes the lack of realism inherent in the President s position  Even with significant tax increases on upper income earners  it looks like  at best the Administration can increase tax revenues by maybe  130 billion  The current budget deficit is  1 1 trillion  with a  T    That means if we enacted on the taxes on the wealthy  we d only cut the budget deficit by 11   and even that is based on optimistic assumptions about future growth  In reality  by raising taxes  we might undercut growth and put ourselves in a worse position long term  What all this suggests is that there is no way to fix America s fiscal mess without deep reforms  We have to cut military spending  we have to reform Medicare  Medicaid  and Social Security  We have to make the American economy more competitive with the rest of the world  There s no way to tax our way out of the mess and even the significant tax increases in the fiscal cliff  which would harm the middle class significantly  would likely not even half the budget deficit ,2012-11-13,Jake Huneycutt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fiscal-cliff-will-mostly-hit-middle-class-143408,143408
121575,343090,NYT,Frankenstorm  The Not So Black Swan  Climate As The New Risk Variable ,opinion,While waiting for the power to go out  which it did a couple of hours later  as we sat at home in Connecticut and Sandy approached  we read this comment by Elizabeth Kolbert in the New Yorker Blog  As with any particular  weather related loss event   it s impossible to attribute Sandy to climate change  However  it is possible to say that the storm fits the general pattern in North America  and indeed around the world  toward more extreme weather  a pattern that  increasingly  can be attributed to climate change  Just a few weeks before the Munich Re report appeared  scientists at NASA s Goddard Institute for Space Studies  in New York  published  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the apparent increase in extreme heat waves  Extreme summertime heat  which just a few decades ago affected much less than one per cent of the earth s surface   now typically covers about 10  of the land area   the paper observed   It follows that we can state  with a high degree of confidence  that extreme anomalies  i e   heat waves  such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small   It is worth noting that one of several forces fuelling Sandy is  along the East Coast     Watching Sandy  Ignoring Climate Change   Elizabeth Kolbert  New Yorker blog  Sandy has been one of a sequence of unusual weather events that have followed hard upon each other  And until Sandy  there seems to have been a cone of silence on the subject of climate change in the United States  This is noteworthy because climate change is discussed as a matter of concern in most of the countries on this planet  with one notable exception already referenced  Is this American exceptionalism  Or American denialism  Or are there other forces at work  And why should you care anyway  Bernie Madoff  Climate Change Denial  and Talking Books  It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it     Upton Sinclair If you re a Republican  there s a 75  chance that you disbelieve the scientific evidence behind the concerns about climate change  If you re a Democrat  a 75  chance that you accept that evidence  Considering that the facts are out there in abundance  the discrepancy is  on the surface  mystifying  It s more mystifying that there was NO discrepancy between party affiliation and view of climate science a mere fifteen years ago  What happened  From Why We Resist the Truth About Climate Change by Clive Hamilton   The opening of the gulf was due to the fact that Republican Party activists  in collaboration with fossil fuel interests and conservative think tanks  had successfully associated acceptance of global warming science with  liberal  views   It is as if Republicans mostly decided that the Detroit Tigers won the just completed World Series  not the San Francisco Giants  because the New York Times  a noted liberal newspaper  reported that the Giants had won  Sound absurd  There is a bit of cognitive dissonance in a country whose technological capability  which is  by coincidence  based on scientific research  is the most respected in the world  yet whose collective ability to grasp the implications of scientific research is negatively exceptional  If you do happen to have Republican climate change denying tendencies and this is making you angry  chill  We could have quoted Mein Kampf  the part where Hitler talks about the use of propaganda and the reasons why truth has to be a casualty in maintaining total control of the people  Then you d be really mad  There is an increasing amount of evidence that the people who have bought into climate science denial were victims of a fraud perpetrated by a group of people pulling one of the oldest tricks on Wall Street  talking their book  Certain investors  financial interests are adversely affected by the conclusions to which climate science points  The implications of climate science were easy enough to dismiss as long as real time dislocations were minimal  most people can t imagine the future until it washes over them  One could ask whether the attempt to manipulate climate science for personal gain is fair game in the Ayn Rand ian world view  but we won t  A more benign view is that fossil fuel interests  attempt to protect their financial position is akin to playing poker  Everyone at the table has the same objectives  and the attempt to  sell  your hand is an accepted part of the game  Poker is a zero sum game  Whatever happens at the poker table affects only the other players at the table  When the playing field is the planet  there are collateral  socialized  costs and benefits that result from the process of producing profits  The beneficiaries of many government programs  whether health  welfare  or even FEMA  do not generally pick up the costs  as is oft pointed out  Equally  the beneficiaries of tobacco sales have not generally had to pick up the socialized health costs that have been shown to result from tobacco sales  although they did have to deal with relatively marginal legal costs  And unless the economic interests benefiting from the climate science disinformation campaign have vacation homes on the coast in the northeastern United States  they are unlikely to bear any of the socialized costs  now about  50 billion  resulting from Hurricane Sandy  They may  in fact  benefit from short term product dislocations  One may question the degree to which responsibility attaches to those who may have intentionally distorted the public view of climate change  One may consider the asymmetric effect of neutralizing discourse in the global economic leader on a subject that affects future generations so profoundly  Eventually someone may try to quantify the socialized costs of the disinformation campaign  as solutions were stymied because of a concerted attempt to discredit the science  Not to belabor the point  but there is an increasingly strong argument to be made that a chunk of the American population  some of it attached to gobs of money  has been fooled by the same sort of techniques that worked for Bernie Madoff  create a feel good atmosphere decreasing motivation to look too closely at the facts  and encourage people to take comfort in the fact that some other wealthy guys believe it  Call it the Lead Investor Scam  if you will  Portfolio managers are mere mortals  we hear  and may occasionally be susceptible to letting others think for them  In principle  the investors who generate true alpha often march to a different drummer from the rest of the pack  and are used to taking positions that may cause social discomfort when they re with their peers  Clash of the Titans  Men  it has been well said  think in herds  it will be seen that they go mad in herds  while they only recover their senses slowly  one by one     Charles MacKay  Extraordinary Popular Delusions   the Madness of Crowds If certain pockets of capital can distort science  it s only a matter of time before other pockets of capital respond by correcting the record as they see their interests threatened  Make no mistake about it  fossil fuel interests already ARE threatened  If you told Exxon or Lukoil that  in order to avoid wrecking the climate  they couldn t pump out their reserves  the value of their companies would plummet  John Fullerton  a former managing director at JP Morgan who now runs the Capital Institute  calculates that at today s market value  those 2 795 gigatons of carbon emissions are worth about  27 trillion  Which is to say  if you paid attention to the scientists and kept 80 percent of it underground  you d be writing off  20 trillion in assets    Bill McKibben    Rolling Stone   McKibben makes a critical point  investors harmed by climate change will rapidly become motivated to set the record straight on climate science once and for all   20 trillion in assets seems like a lot  and you can understand why folks who control assets in that amount might be a tad defensive  But it s not all that much  compared to real estate  for instance  The value of all real estate in New York City alone  a timely example  comes to about  850 billion Current estimates of Sandy damage in the City are no less than  18 billion  with area costs currently estimated at up to  50 billion  A 2  hit to overall New York property values is one thing if it s a one time event  if there s reason to believe that such a black swan event is turning grey or white  the game really changes  As it happens  the estimated total value of real estate in the United States is currently about  19 trillion  And that real estate is subject to such weather events as the drought that currently is drying out about 50  of the United States  A quick review of desert land prices should help real estate investors focus on the problem  The moment real estate investors around the world view their investments as being threatened by fossil fuel investors  misrepresentations of climate science  Republicans who invest in real estate and Democrats will once again reach a consensus on the facts  If the oil guys live in drought areas  they might even come along too  It s a Brave New World  Isn t That What You re Paid to Recognize  Financial markets discount the future  As financial markets begin to discount changes in the relative attractiveness of fossil fuel investments versus green investments  with real estate values being repriced to reflect climate effects  professional investors will get all the reality therapy they could ever need  Financial markets also price risk  Insurance companies spend a lot of time evaluating the right price for certain risks  And the moment climate issues are no longer black swans  you can bet that they will reprice their insurance upwards to reflect their risk perception  And investors may have to reprice their waterfront assets as a result  There s a two week old  that says  in part  Nowhere in the world is the rising number of natural catastrophes more evident than in North America  The study shows a nearly quintupled number of weather related loss events in North America for the past three decades  compared with an increase factor of 4 in Asia  2 5 in Africa  2 in Europe and 1 5 in South America  Anthropogenic climate change is believed to contribute to this trend  though it influences various perils in different ways  Climate change particularly affects formation of heat waves  droughts  intense precipitation events  and in the long run most probably also tropical cyclone intensity  The view that weather extremes are becoming more frequent and intense in various regions due to global warming is in keeping with current scientific findings  as set out in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC  as well as in the special report on weather extremes and disasters  SREX   Up to now  however  the increasing losses caused by weather related natural catastrophes have been primarily driven by socio economic factors  such as population growth  urban sprawl and increasing wealth Don t you just love it when insurance companies talk dirty  Our suspicion is that we are now reaching the tipping point where people start to price their assets factoring in climate risks  Things don t all have to be underwater for that to happen  it requires only for enough people to realize that it has become a risk greater than 0 05   and that the risk is increasing

121613,343128,NYT,Obama And Romney Both Favor A One World Economic System ,opinion,Either way this election turns out  American jobs are going to continue to get slaughtered by the millions  During this campaign  Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have both attempted to portray each other as the     Unfortunately  they are both right  Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have both participated in the outsourcing of American jobs  and both are openly admitting to the American people that they favor the emerging one world economic system which will continue to destroy millions of American jobs  In fact  they argue with each other about which of them will be more aggressive in pursuing more  free trade  agreements over the next four years  Unfortunately  the  free trade  agreements that the U S  government enters into are never  fair trade  agreements  As a result  over the past decade we have lost tens of thousands of businesses  millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of national wealth  This year alone  we will buy about half a trillion dollars more stuff from the rest of the world than they will buy from us  This trade deficit will be about 7 times larger than the trade deficit of any other nation on earth  Our economy will continue to bleed jobs at a horrifying pace  but Obama and Romney insist that the answer to our problems is even more  free trade   What makes all of this even more dreadful is that most Americans continue to fall for this nonsense  It doesn t take a genius to figure out that merging our labor pool with the labor pools of nations where it is legal to pay slave labor wages was going to kill American jobs and drive down wages for the jobs that remain in the United States  Why should some giant predator corporation pay you 15 dollars an hour plus benefits when they can pay a worker on the other side of the planet a dollar an hour with no benefits to do the same job  During the second presidential debate  when Obama was asked why high tech products such as the iPhone could not be made here in the United States  Obama openly admitted that there are some jobs   But why does that have to be so  Why can t those jobs come back to America  It seems to me that if you cracked down on nations that are cheating such as China  imposed a system of common sense tariffs and cut the corporate tax rate to a level more consistent with the rest of the world that you could get a lot of those jobs flooding back in by the end of next year  But Obama is so blinded by his faith in the emerging one world economy that such measures are unimaginable to him  In recent years  the Obama administration has entered into new  free trade  agreements with Panama  South Korea and Colombia  In addition  the Obama administration is making the Trans Pacific Partnership      a very high priority  Considering what a nightmare the first NAFTA was  do we really need another one  The Trans Pacific Partnership is a treaty that would essentially   It is being touted as one of the most comprehensive  free trade  agreements in history  and it would open up the door for millions more good jobs to be shipped out of the country  The workers of America simply cannot afford another four years of Barack Obama  In fact  the Obama administration has actually spent billions of taxpayer dollars to create jobs in other countries  The following is from     Over his four years in office  Obama promised that he would focus on creating  jobs that pay well and can t be outsourced   However  as he racked up trillions in new debt  billions of dollars did go to create jobs that were outsourced or spent overseas  Whether it is electric cars made in Finland or solar panels in Mexico  taxpayers would be astonished to learn that their hard earned money went abroad for jobs that weren t created in the United States    You can get all the details   Needless to say  the Obama administration has been an absolute disaster on these issues  So would Romney be an improvement when it comes to trade  That is very doubtful  The truth is that Mitt Romney was involved in outsourcing jobs while he was at Bain Capital  The following is from a recent article posted     David Corn of Mother Jones reports that  according to government documents       Romney  when he was in charge of Bain  Capital   invested heavily in a Chinese manufacturing company that depended on US outsourcing for its profits and that explicitly stated that such outsourcing was crucial to its success   This didn t happen after 1999  when Mitt Romney says he left Bain Capital to run the Salt Lake City Olympics  Corn was one of the first reporters to raise questions  now gaining wide exposure  of whether Romney really left Bain then   but the year before  On April 17  1998  Brookside Capital Partners Fund  a Bain Capital affiliate of which Romney was the sole shareholder  sole director  president  and chief executive  invested an estimated  14 2 million in Global Tech  an appliance maker in Dongguan  China  Global Tech made products for American companies like Sunbeam  Hamilton Beach  Mr  Coffee  and Proctor Silex  In September 1998 Global Tech s CEO announced that the company was postponing a factory expansion because Sunbeam was slowing its rate of outsourcing  and said   Although it appears that customers such as Sunbeam are not outsourcing their manufacturing as quickly as we had anticipated  we still believe that the long term trend toward outsourcing will continue   Since Romney left  Bain Capital has become even more aggressive with outsourcing jobs  In fact  Bain Capital has been forcing American workers to train their Chinese replacements even in the midst of this campaign  Aren t they concerned that they are making their former boss look bad  The following is from an article written  that is having his job shipped to China by Bain Capital    On Monday  November 5th Bain Capital is outsourcing my job to China  On Tuesday  November 6th I m casting my vote against Mitt Romney  Yes  I blame Mitt Romney for the loss of my job  Here s why  I ve worked at the same factory in Freeport  Ill  for thirty three years  making sensors and controls for the auto industry  It s tough work  but it pays a living wage with health benefits that folks can count on  and it fuels our town s economy and tax base  That s been changing since Bain Capital came to town  Two years ago  our factory was sold to Sensata Technologies  a company created by Bain Capital  and they told us that by December 2012  all 170 of our jobs would be shipped to China  They even made us train our Chinese replacements  Layoff notices have been sent out  and some folks have already been laid off  Where there was once lots of people and energy and life  now there s only the discoloration on the floor where the machinery used to be  It s depressing  They re not just dismantling the equipment and the plant  they re dismantling our community  All of this outsourcing is killing America  Back in 1950  the population of this country was less than half of what it is now  and yet there were more Americans working in manufacturing back in 1950 than there are today  The decline in manufacturing jobs in the United States has been really dramatic since the year 2000  In 2000  there were  Americans working in manufacturing  but now there are     I think that it is interesting to note that China joined the WTO in 2001  Since that time we have been losing jobs to them at an astounding pace  According to a new report   U S  trade with China  cost more than 2 7 million jobs between 2001 and 2011   The Chinese slap huge tariffs on many of our goods  they manipulate currency rates to make sure that U S  companies cannot compete  they steal our intellectual property and they deeply subsidize their own businesses  And yet Obama and Romney insist that this is  free trade   What a joke  And our tax structure is absolutely killing us as well  The following is from a recent article     A U S  manufacturer exporting to China pays the 35  Corporate Tax and a 17  VAT when its exports reach Shanghai  A China manufacturer exports tax free to the U S    Are you starting to get the picture  Our trade policy is a complete and total disaster  and yet Obama and Romney continue to insist that we just need to become even more integrated with the emerging one world economic system  Well  in a  I listed 22 statistics which prove that the current path that we are on has been absolutely disastrous for American workers     1 One professor has estimated that cutting the U S  trade deficit in half would create  in the United States   2 The United States has a trade imbalance that is  than any other nation on earth has   3 Overall  the United States has run a trade deficit of more than 8 trillion dollars with the rest of the globe since 1975  That 8 trillion dollars could have gone to support U S  businesses and pay the wages of U S  workers  Federal  state and local taxes would have been paid on that 8 trillion dollars if it had stayed in the United States   4 When NAFTA was passed in 1993  the United States had a trade surplus with Mexico of 1 6 billion dollars  In 2010  we had a trade deficit with Mexico of    5 In 2001  American consumers spent 102 billion dollars on products made in China  In 2011  American consumers spent  on products made in China   6 The Chinese undervalue their currency by about 40 percent in order to gain a critical advantage over foreign competitors  This means that many Chinese companies are able to absolutely thrive while their competition in the United States goes out of business  The following is from a recent      To keep Chinese products artificially inexpensive on US store shelves  Beijing undervalues the yuan by 40 percent  It pirates US technology  subsidizes exports and imposes high tariffs on imports   7 According to   a Jeep Grand Cherokee that costs  27 490 in the United States costs about  85 000 in China thanks to all the tariffs   8 The U S  trade deficit with China during 2011 was   That was the largest trade deficit that one nation has had with another nation in the history of the world   9 Back in 1985  our trade deficit with China was only about   million with an  m   for the entire year   10 U S  consumers spend  on goods and services from China for every one dollar that Chinese consumers spend on goods and services from the United States   11 The United States has actually lost an average of about  a month since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001   12 According to the Economic Policy Institute  America is losing about  to China every single year   13 The United States has lost  manufacturing facilities since 2001   14 During 2010 alone  an average of  closed their doors in America every single day   15 Since the auto industry bailout  approximately  of all GM vehicles have been built outside the United States   16 As I have written about previously   of the jobs lost during the last recession were middle class jobs   17 According to Professor Alan Blinder of Princeton University   more U S  jobs could be sent offshore over the next two decades if current trends continue   18 The percentage of working age Americans that are employed right now is actually smaller than it was at the    19 The average duration of unemployment in the United States is  as long as it was back in the year 2000   20 Due in part to the globalization of the labor pool   of all jobs in the United States are  good jobs  at this point   21 Without enough good jobs  more Americans than ever before are falling into poverty  Today   are on welfare   22 In recent years the U S  economy has embraced  free trade  and the emerging one world economy like never before  Instead of increasing the number of jobs in our economy  it has resulted in the worst stretch of job creation in the United States      If any single number captures the state of the American economy over the last decade  it is zero  That was the net gain in jobs between 1999 and 2009 nada  nil  zip  By painful contrast  from the 1940s through the 1990s  recessions came and went  but no decade ended without at least a 20 percent increase in the number of jobs    At this point   of all working age Americans do not have a job  and the vast majority of the new jobs that are being created are   Median household income has fallen   In fact  median household income is down by more than  4000 since Barack Obama entered the White House  One recent survey found that  of all Americans have  500 or less in savings  We are a country that is full of broke people  What we need are more good jobs  But Obama and Romney are both determined to keep shipping good jobs out of the country  The path that we are on will only lead to disaster  Please wake up America ,2012-10-22,Michael T.

121615,343130,NYT,Mingling With Financial Advisers At The Investment News Alternative,opinion,I spent the day in Chicago where I d been invited to debate the merits of my book   with a pleasant fellow named Ed Butowsky who runs a fund of hedge funds  I ll leave it to the audience to decide who won   it is the season of debates after all  I ll simply say that I continue to much prefer taking my side of the debate than the other  What I did find interesting though was the clear focus of so many financial advisers on alternatives in various forms of packaging  The tyranny of low interest rates is causing investors to look high and low for something that can generate a return greater than bonds while not blowing up in a collapsing equity market  There are  liquid alternatives   which are mutual funds that do some hedging  business development companies that offer some very attractive yields  REITs and managed futures  There probably are some interesting investments among some of these offerings  However  it s still asset allocation that is the most important decision  and bond avoidance must surely be a cornerstone with negative real yields as far out as one can forecast  A barbell consisting of one part equities with four parts cash can provide the same return as the ten year treasury note as described in previous blogs  assuming 4  annual growth in S P500 dividends  and bonds are unlikely to be much of a diversifier since rising bond yields  whenever that happens  will no doubt cause a sell off in equities  I ve noticed has seen a drop in Obama s odds of winning  now down to 58  although he s still the favorite  It does seem to me though that the likeliest outcome is a return of the status quo in two weeks at which point we ll be looking to the same legislators who brought us to the brink of fiscal disaster with the debt ceiling crisis last year to resolve the fiscal cliff with only 12 days when Congress is in session  I don t see how we can expect an agreement much before the very end of the year  timing which we ensure each side has extracted what it can in negotiations but will not be kind to any business that relies on capital spending or solid forecasts of consumer demand  Most recently we sold a little of our natural gas E P exposure since we continue to like the sector but valuations had made it somewhat less attractive  The  ran a piece over the weekend warning investors that profits in natural gas are hard to find  However  it could also have been called  Don t Invest with Aubrey McLendon  Chesapeake s CEO  based on the examples the writer used  Less leveraged companies with lower production costs are still to be found  but overall we have about one third less direct exposure to this sector than was the case six months ago  The biggest position in our Deep Value Equity Strategy remains the Gold Miners ETF  GDX  which we think is supported by efforts at central bank reflation on the downside and should rise with other commodities if equities resume their rally  We re also awaiting news from Corrections Corp  CXW  on their possible conversion to a REIT  We expect the company to provide an update in the next few weeks ,2012-10-24,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mingling-with-financial-advisers-at-the-investment-news-alternative-140923,140923
121617,343132,NYT,U S  And China Share Problem Of Rising Income Inequality,opinion,Growing income inequality can be a major issue as the gap between the rich and the poor can have long term implications on both a society and economy  Income inequality can create a class system that is determined by wealth  both earned and inherited  and de emphasizes the importance of opportunity and innovation  Separation can lead to social tensions as the  have s  and  have not s  are divided with opportunity to bridge that gap becoming limited  Such tensions could lead to political instability as was the case in Egypt and in Syria that were driven by a young population seeking economic opportunity and a better way of life  Furthermore  economic growth and the benefits that come with it  are not being shared equally  specifically the middle class which comprises the bulk of the population  Those that are left behind and do not take part could lead to under consumption on an aggregate level  For an economy such as the U S   this is a significant since consumer spending accounts for seventy percent of economic growth  That said  income inequality in the U S  has been rising for many decades  As mentioned in the New York Times article    by Annie Lowrey  income inequality has been an issue even before the Financial Crisis  Based off the work by economists  Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty  she wrote the following From 2000 to 2007  incomes for the bottom 90 percent of earners rose only about 4 percent  once adjusted for inflation  For the top 0 1 percent  incomes climbed about 94 percent Furthermore and despite the collapse of the stock market and financial asset prices which typically affects the rich  she stated that the Great Recession did not derail the widening gap  The rich continued to become rich through higher income gains even after the recovery Data that the two economists released in March showed that the top 1 percent of earners got nearly every dollar of the income gains eked out in the first full year of the recovery  In 2010  the top 10 percent of earners took about half of overall income The U S  is hardly alone with this problem  China with all of its economic growth is experiencing a similar problem  In fact  China has a bigger problem that is growing at an alarming rate according to Societe Generale s Albert Edwards and Dylan Gracie  In their latest Global Strategy Weekly  they wrote the following Regular readers will know that we have been concerned about the social tensions that have resulted from 2008 The Great Recession and its aftermath  Our concerns were especially heightened by the extremely rapid rise in inequality in many countries in the decade running up to the crash most especially  but not exclusively  in the US  But not only is China more unequal than the US  it has become more unequal at a faster rate This is evident by using the Gini Coefficienet which measures inequality among values where zero represents perfect equality while a value of one represents maximum inequality  The Economist by way of Societe Generale provided the following chart showing Gini Coefficients on various countries with China at the top of the list In addition  Societe Generale cited the recent results from Pew Research which shows that Chinese citizens are becoming more concerned of government corruption and income inequality Rising income inequality and the potential for social unrest in China could have significant implications from an economic standpoint  Given the fact that China has been and should continue to be one of the main drivers of global growth  any disruption which would be exacerbated by the distribution of income could send waves around the world and to the shores of the developed world Disclaimer  The above content is provided for educational and informational purposes only  does not constitute a recommendation to enter in any securities transactions or to engage in any of the investment strategies presented in such content  and does not represent the opinions of Bondsquawk or its employees ,2012-10-25,Bondsquawk,https://www.investing.com/analysis/u.s.-and-china-share-problem-of-rising-income-inequality-141076,141076
121627,343142,NYT,Increasing Corporate Disclosure By Firms And Politicans,opinion,While many researchers have started studying corruption  as of yet  the field is remarkably bereft of tangible policy choices that would yield reduced corruption  As I read  by A  K  Bhattacharya in the Business Standard  and  by David Barboza in the New York Times  which describes the modus operandi of the New York Times   of corruption in China at the level of the Prime Minister  also by David Barboza   I thought there is one tangible policy lever through which we can combat corruption  Increase the transparency of companies and increase the transparency of politicians  On firms  it is useful to think at two levels  Transparency about the activities of companies created by politicians  and transparency about the activities of the big companies that pay bribes  I am reminded of the   One element of this is an attempt to change the behaviour of repressive regimes  e g  Russia  by forcing the companies that deal with them  e g  BP  to behave differently  Even if the politicians are irredeemably bad  we can change things by modifying the incentives of the firms that pay bribes At present  the MCA 21 database is clumsy and painful  but it s a step forward in one respect  It does yield some information about many companies  This has been of value in tracing the activities of the companies controlled by politicians and their business partners  This process needs to be carried forward in many dimensions At present  the P L statement of  public  companies is publicly visible in MCA 21  This definition needs to be widened so that the P L statement for many more companies become publicly visible The disclosure environment for listed companies in India is quite good  There is no quarterly balance sheet  the shareholding pattern statement is misleading  there are a few other blemishes  But the information access for listed companies is vastly greater when compared with what s in MCA 21  Many features of the disclosure regime for listed companies  where the work is led by SEBI  need to go into the disclosure regime for all companies  were the work is done by the Department of Company Affairs  If private limited companies become more transparent  politicians will try to use trusts and limited liability partnerships for their activities  Improvements in transparency should extend to LLPs  trusts and partnership companies also Alongside a push for greater transparency by firms  both the big listed companies and the firms created by politicians   we should be pushing towards greater transparency by politicians  The comprehensive financial lives of MPs  MLAs  and their next of kin should be in the public domain  The transparency regime should kick in when a person wins an election  and should stay in place for atleast 10 years from that starting date  Any company or LLP with shareholding of more than 1  by an MP or an MLA or their next of kin should have to comply with the comprehensive disclosure manual of SEBI for listed companies  Any trust when an MP or an MLA or their next of kin is a trustee should have to similarly fall into a high quality disclosure framework There is a tradeoff between privacy of citizens and corruption control  There is value in protecting the privacy of the business dealings of individuals  Perhaps  at the early stages in the formation of the Republic  where we re grappling with basics of governance  there is a good case for violating the privacy of individuals in the quest for improved cleanliness in public life  Over the years  as the State falls into place  a greater push for privacy would be desirable ,2012-10-28,Ajay Shah,https://www.investing.com/analysis/increasing-corporate-disclosure-by-firms-and-politicans-141405,141405
121656,343171,NYT,Local Governments And States Hiding Entitlement Funding Gap Data ,opinion,Today s New York Times reported   The Chicago Teachers  Pension Fund has about  10 billion in assets  but is paying out more than  1 billion in benefits a year  much more than it has been taking in  That has forced it to sell investments  worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year  to pay retired teachers  Experts say the fund could collapse within a few years unless something is done  A  1 billion shortfall  And that is just one group of public employees in one large city  That begs the question of how big is this problem for the entire United States  That size of the funding gap is not available anywhere  No one knows  But obviously the annual funding gap has to be about  500 billion just from state and local governments alone  And I would not be surprised if the total annual funding gap for all entitlements including the Federal governments was at least a trillion dollars Just to be clear  each year governments need to set aside funding for future entitlement payments  What I am looking for and concerned about is the amount being underfunded  and not being paid  by governments who would rather pay current bills then future obligations For a frame of reference   9 6 trillion is the annual US pretax income  So if the funding gap to actually pay future entitlements for state and local governments is half a trillion dollars  that is equal to 6  of all pretax income and 25  of total taxes collected  There is no way the US economy can afford to pay an extra  500 billion  And none of that includes how much the Federal Government will be required to pay for entitlements  Printing money will work until the day it stops and when that happens  all the state  local and federal governments will have to be restructured While there is plenty of information about total unfunded pension liabilities  what I was unable to find out is the size of the current actual annual funding gap  In other words  how much more money should we be paying now to fund future entitlements in order to be able to pay what has been promised  As I said above  my guess is half a trillion dollars  plus or minus a hundred billion or so Our Madeline Schnapp reports that Sonoma Country is stonewalling about current and even historic entitlement funding gaps  Why  I am sure Sonoma County officials are not alone in not wanting to fess up that in essence they made promises to pay entitlements they knew were unaffordable  Is that not fraud This lack of transparency about this huge issue says to me that today s New York Times story means that we have entered the opening phase of the biggest bubble burst of all time  Governments have made entitlement promises costing trillions upon trillions of dollars  Euro  Yens  whatever  And there is absolutely no way most of these governments can afford to pay their future bills In the past egregious promises made by governments were somehow made good by the 25 year global economic boom from 1983 to 2007  During that 25 year boom more people as a percentage of the global population became calorie sufficient than ever before in history On the other hand  unfortunately  that boom led governments to believe they could continue to make ever bigger entitlement promises  They based that promise upon the ridiculous assumption that economic growth would continue at a world record pace through infinity and beyond Believe it or not  I am actually quite optimistic for the future  Why  We literally hold the future in our hand  The iphone is not a really a phone  rather it is our personal gateway to a global social community or commons  Imagine the economic possibilities of a future global on line world after we get governments out of the way  Imagine if we could restructure global entitlements so that they are based upon what the underlying economies can sustainably provide and not just based upon government promises If we could do that  this generation will have done something worth passing along to future generations Below you may find the video ,2012-09-21,Charles Biderman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/local-governments-and-states-hiding-entitlement-funding-gap-data-137177,137177
121657,343172,NYT,Fiscal Cliff  Will A 1937 Repeat   2013 Dead Meat ,opinion,The presidential election is upon us and markets around the globe are beginning to factor in the results  More important  in my view  will be the post election results of the  fiscal cliff  discussions  which will determine whether  600 billion in automated spending cuts and tax increases will be triggered  Similar dynamics in 1937 existed when President FDR  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  felt pressure to balance the budget after his 1933 New Deal stimulus package began to rack up deficits and lose steam What s Similar TodayJust as there is pressure to cut spending today by Republicans and  Tea Party  Congressmen  so too there was pressure for FDR and the Federal Reserve in 1937 to unwind fiscal and monetary stimulus  At the time  FDR thought self sustaining growth had been restored and there was a belief that the deficits would become a drag on expansion and a source of future inflation  What s more  FDR s Treasury Secretary  Henry Morgenthau  believed that continued economic growth was dependent on business confidence  which in turn was dependent on creating a balanced budget  History has a way of repeating itself  which explains why the issues faced in 1937 are eerily similar to today s discussions The ResultsFDR was successful in dramatically reducing spending and significantly increasing taxes  Specifically  federal spending was reduced by  17  over two years and FDR s introduction of a Social Security payroll tax contributed to federal revenues increasing by a whopping  72  over a similar timeframe  The good news was the federal deficit fell from  5 5  of GDP to  0 5   The bad news was the economy went into a tail spinning recession  the Dow crashed approximately  50   and the unemployment rate burst higher by about  3 3  to  12 5  Source  New York TimesSource  Blue Mass GroupWhat s Different This Time For starters  one difference between 1937 and 2012 is the level of unemployment  In 1937  unemployment was  14 3   and today it is  8 1   Objectively  today there could be higher percentage of the population  under employed   but nonetheless the job market was in worse shape back then and labor unions had much more power Another major difference is the stance carried by the Fed  Today  Ben Bernanke and the Fed have made it crystal clear they are in no hurry to take away any of the monetary stimulus  until we have experienced a long lasting  sustainable recovery  Back in early 1937  the Fed increased banks  reserve requirements twice  doubling the requirement in less than a year  thereby contracting monetary supply drastically Furthermore  we live in a much more globalized world  Today  central banks and governments around the world are doing their part to keep growth alive  Emerging markets are large enough now to move the needle and impact the growth of developed markets  For example  China  the  2 global superpower  continues to cut interest rates and has recently implemented a  158 billion infrastructure spending program Net NetWhether you re a Republican or Democrat  everyone generally agrees that job creation is an important common objective  which is consistent with growing our economy  The disagreement between parties stems from the differing opinions on what are the best ways of creating jobs  From my perch  the frame of the debate should be premised on what policies and incentives should be structured to increase competitiveness  Without competitiveness there are no jobs  At the end of the day  money and capital are agnostic  Cold hard cash migrates to the countries in which it is treated best  And where the money goes is where the jobs go There is no single silver bullet to solve the competiveness concerns of the United States  Like baseball  since playoffs are quickly approaching   winning is not based solely on hitting  pitching  defense  or base running  All of these facets and others are required to win  The same principles apply to our country s competitiveness In order to be a competitive leader in the 21st century  here are few necessary areas in which we must excel Education  Chicago school unions have been in the news  and I have no problems with unions  if accountability can be structured in  Unfortunately  however  it is clear to me that for now our system is broken  We cannot compete in the 21st century with an illiterate  uneducated workforce  Our colleges and universities are still top notch  but as Bill Gates has stated  our elementary schools and high schools are  obsolete    Entitlements  Social safety nets like Social Security and Medicare are critical  but unsustainable promises that explode our debt and deficits will not make us more competitive  Politicians may gain votes by making promises in the short run  but when those promises can t be delivered in the medium run or long run  then those votes will disappear quickly  The sworn guarantees made to the 76 million Baby Boomers now entering retirement are a disaster waiting to happen  Benefits need to be reduced and or criteria need to be adjusted  i e   means testing  increase age requirements   The problems are clear as day  so Americans cannot walk away from this sobering reality   Strategic Government Investment    Government played a role in building our country s railways  highways  and our military   a few strategic areas of our economy that have made our nation great  Thoughtful investments into areas like energy infrastructure  e g   smart grid   internet infrastructure  e g   higher speed super highway   and healthcare  e g   human genome research  are a few examples of how jobs can be created while simultaneously increasing our global competitiveness  The great thing about strategic government investments is that government does NOT have to do all the heavy lifting  Rather than write all the checks and do all the job creation from Washington  government can implement these investments and create these jobs by providing incentives for the private sector  Strategic public private partnerships can generate win win results for government  businesses  and job seekers  If  however  you re convinced that our government is more efficient than the private sector  then I highly encourage you to go visit your local DMV  post office  or VA to better appreciate the growth sucking bureaucracy and inefficiency   Taxes   Regulations   Laws  Taxes come from profits  and businesses create profits  In order to have a strong and competitive government  we need strong and competitive businesses  Higher taxes  excessive regulations  and burdensome laws will not create stronger and more competitive businesses  I acknowledge that reckless neglect and consumer exploitation will not work either  but reasonable protections for consumers and businesses can be instituted without multi thousand page regulations  Reducing ridiculous subsidies and loopholes  while tightening tax collection processes and punishing tax dodgers makes perfect sense so why not do it   Politics are sharply polarized at both ends of the spectrum  but no matter who wins  our problems are not going away  We may or may not have a new president of the United States this November  but perhaps more important than the elections themselves will be the outcome of the  fiscal cliff  legislation  or lack thereof   If we want to maintain our economic power as the strongest in the world  solving this  fiscal cliff  is the key to improving our competiveness  Avoiding a messy 1937  and 2011  political repeat will prevent us from becoming dead meat  DISCLOSURE  Sidoxia Capital Management  SCM  and some of its clients hold positions in certain exchange traded funds  ETFs   but at the time

121659,343174,NYT,U S  Budget Deficit Worse Than You Might Think  Here s Why,opinion,By One Key Budget Indicator  the Structural Primary Balance  Even Greece is Doing Better than the United States  Why that should Worry us We in the United States know that we have a deficit problem  but when we hear news of the ongoing crisis in Europe  we feel a little better  At least we re in better shape than Greece  Italy  and the other Eurozone basket cases  Aren t we  Think again  By one key measure of fiscal health  the structural primary balance  SPB   we are in worse shape than any EU country  In fact  among the members of the OECD  only Japan is deeper in deficit as the following chart shows  Not just Greece and Italy  but even the Portugal  Ireland  and Spain  the other derisively styled  PIIGS   score better better than the United States on this chart  That does not mean that their economies are in better shape overall  They have a lot of problems that we do not  which we will come back to later  What their structural primary balances do show is how far they have come in making the fiscal adjustments needed to make their budgets sustainable in the long run   The United States has barely started those adjustments  and Japan has not even thought about them  Let s look more closely  Just what is the structural primary balance  The budget measure that usually makes the headlines in the United States a deficit of 8 7 percent of GDP for fiscal 2011 is the federal government s current balance  That is the difference between the government s total spending and its total income in a given year  expressed as a percentage of the GDP that the economy actually produced  The structural primary balance differs from the current balance in two main ways  First  the term  structural  means that it is adjusted to remove the part of the deficit or surplus that is attributable to the state of the business cycle  Right now  partway through an incomplete recovery from a deep recession  the U S  economy is operating well below its potential level  When output drops below its potential  tax revenues fall  unemployment benefits rise  and certain other automatic stabilizers move the current balance toward deficit even if there are no changes in policy  Similarly  during a boom  when output is above its natural level  automatic stabilizers cause the balance to move toward surplus  The structural balance is the surplus or deficit that would prevail  with given policies  if GDP were right at its potential level  Some economists prefer the term cyclically adjusted budget balance  Second  the  primary  part refers to the fact that the SPB  on the spending side  considers only program expenditures  Program expenditures include all government purchases of goods and services and all entitlement outlays  but not interest on government debt  The logic is that policies governing program expenditures  along with tax policies  are causes of budget imbalances  whereas interest on the government s accumulated debt is a result of past policy imbalances  For completeness  we should add that the OECD methodology on which the chart is based makes two other adjustments to facilitate international comparisons  One is to include all levels of government in order to allow for differences in the centralization of government from country to country  That adjustment is less important for the topic at hand than it might seem  The U S  federal government accounts for nearly all of the total government deficit  while most states operate under balanced budget rules  Also  the OECD data adjust for the effects of one off budget operations like tax amnesties or privatization revenues  Those are important for some countries  but much less so for the United States  The OECD uses the term underlying primary balance to refer to its version of the SPB  Some basic budget arithmetic To understand why the SPB is a key indicator of long run fiscal sustainability  we need to review some basic budget arithmetic  In order to be sustainable  the government s debt must not grow endlessly as a percentage of GDP  If it did  eventually it would get to a point where interest payments alone used up all available tax revenue  Well before that happened  the government would face the stark choice of either defaulting on its debt outright or defaulting indirectly through hyperinflation  However  as long as the economy is growing  sustainability does not require that the government stop borrowing altogether  It can issue new debt without increasing the debt to GDP ratio up to the point where the rate of growth of the debt equals the rate of growth of GDP  To take the simplest case  consider a government that has debt equal to 100 percent of GDP  If nominal GDP grows at 5 percent  and the government finances a current deficit equal to 5 percent of GDP with new borrowing  the debt to GDP ratio will not change  If it has less debt to start with  the maximum borrowing consistent with a constant debt to GDP ratio is lower  If we assume an initial debt of 50 percent of GDP and leave the rate of GDP growth at 5 percent  the current deficit must be held to 2 5 percent of GDP to keep the debt to GDP ratio from growing  More generally  if the debt to GDP ratio is D and the rate of growth of nominal GDP is Q  the maximum permissible deficit is D times Q  Looking at the primary deficit instead of the entire deficit simplifies the calculation of the maximum borrowing consistent with a constant debt to GDP ratio  The reason is that for most countries  the long run average rate of growth of nominal GDP tends to be about equal to the average nominal rate of interest on government debt   You can do the calculation in real terms if you prefer  by subtracting the rate of inflation from both the interest rate and GDP growth   If that is the case  the debt will remain constant as a share of GDP as long as the primary budget is in balance  regardless of the initial level of the debt  In practice  the average rate of interest is not always exactly equal to the rate of GDP growth  but the difference tends to be small when averaged over a long period  To the extent that the two are different  the interest rate tends to average slightly higher than the rate of growth  When that is the case  the country needs a slight surplus on the primary budget balance to keep the debt to GDP ratio constant  For example  from 1988 to 2007  the relatively stable 20 year period leading up to the recent financial crisis  nominal GDP in the United States grew at an average rate of about 5 6 percent and the average rate of interest on federal debt held by the public was about 6 percent  If those numbers were to prevail in the long run  the structural primary balance would have to be in surplus by 0 4 percent of GDP in order to keep the debt to GDP ratio from growing  For some shorter periods  as in 2004 through 2006  the rate of growth has slightly exceeded the rate of interest  When that happens  the debt to GDP ratio can be held constant with the primary balance slightly in deficit  These differences of a fraction of one percent one way or another do not significantly undermine the usefulness of the SPB as a measure of fiscal sustainability  Finally  we need to take into account the possibility that a country may not want just to hold its debt to GDP ratio constant over time  but actually to reduce it  In the case of the EU  budget rules require that countries have a debt to GDP ratio of 60 percent or less  A dozen countries  including France and Germany  now exceed that limit  To get their debts back down to the 60 percent mark  those countries will have to keep their SPB well in the surplus range  At least one country has already done so  From 1996 to 2011  Sweden reduced its debt to GDP ratio from 84 percent to 49 percent by keeping its SPB in surplus by an average of just under 2 percent of GDP  The United States  of course  is not subject to EU rules  but many economists think it would be desirable to reduce the net federal debt from its current level of nearly 80 percent of GDP  Doing so will take even greater spending cuts or revenue increases than would be needed just to stabilize the ratio  Looking for patterns in fiscal policy We have seen  then  that the SPB must be held at or close to long run balance to make the debt sustainable and in surplus to reduce the debt over time  However  that does not mean that sustainable policy requires the SPB to be unchanged from year to year  There are three patterns for the SPB that are consistent with the long term goal of holding the debt to GDP ratio constant over time or gradually reducing it  Under a cyclically neutral pattern  the government would hold the SPB constant year after year  regardless of the state of the business cycle  Automatic stabilizers would produce moderate current deficits during recessions offset by current surpluses during expansions  As discussed in   Chile has achieved excellent fiscal health by following the cyclically neutral pattern Under a countercyclical policy  the government would undertake discretionary fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts or spending increases during recessions  which would move the SPB toward deficit  The stimulus would be offset with discretionary tax increases or expenditure cuts during expansions  leaving the SPB in balance or slightly in surplus on average over the cycle  That is the pattern  has followed to get its debt under control  Such a policy has the potential to improve economic performance by moderating excessive cyclical booms and busts  but it requires a high level of political maturity and budget discipline In theory  a country could follow a third pattern under which the current budget would be kept in balance each and every year  Such a policy would require procyclical tax increases or expenditure cuts during recessions  moving the SPB toward surplus and making the downturn more severe  It would then call for tax cuts or expenditure increases during expansions  adding fuel to the upturn  Proposals to amend the Constitution to require an annually balanced budget are a recurrent feature of U S  political life  However  for reasons explained in   mainstream economists tend see such proposals as counterproductive How the United States has gotten into its budget mess The United States has gotten itself into its present budget mess by not following any of the sustainable patterns just outlined  Instead  it has followed an unbalanced discretionary policy that cuts taxes and increases expenditures to stimulate the economy during recessions  and then cuts taxes and increases spending again for short term political gain during periods of prosperity  That pattern is evident in the following chart   The chart shows a healthy surplus of the structural primary balance 1 7 percent of GDP  on average from 1994 to 2001  Over that period  net government debt  by the OECD s measure  fell from 54 4 percent of GDP to 34 6 percent  Countercyclical considerations could justify the sharp reduction in the surplus during the brief and mild recession of March to November 2001  but after that  things went badly off course  Instead of moving back into surplus as the economy recovered  the SPB moved strongly into deficit during the cyclical expansion of 2002 to 2007  Two unfunded wars  substantial tax cuts  and new expenditure programs like Medicare Part D moved the SPB into an average deficit of 2 4 percent of GDP in those years  a swing of more than 4 percent of GDP from the surpluses of the 1990s  By 2007  the debt to GDP ratio had risen back to 48 percent of GDP  The increased debt and deficit left the government with reduced room for maneuver when the economy again fell into recession at the end of 2007  Nevertheless  faced with an alarming global crisis  the government undertook vigorous stimulus measures  In 2008  the last year of the Bush administration  a tax rebate and other programs increased the structural primary deficit to 4 6 percent of GDP  Further stimulus measures during the first two years of the Obama administration sent it soaring to over 7 percent  We are now well into the third year of a tepid cyclical recovery  Real GDP has been above its pre recession peak for a year already  Most of the money from the 2009 fiscal stimulus has been spent  although some countercyclical tax cuts remain in force  And still  the OECD expects the United States to show a structural primary deficit of 5 percent of GDP for 2012  We are not on a sustainable policy trajectory  Where to next  Discussion of what lies ahead focuses mostly on two scenarios  One scenario is that of the dreaded   a combination of mandatory spending cuts and tax increases that would amount to an adjustment of about 4 percent of GDP in 2013  That would reverse most of the slippage of 2002 to 2007 in a single year  Many observers think that path to adjustment is too strongly front loaded  although it is not quite as stringent as what Greece has gone through  According to the OECD  Greece will have moved from a structural primary deficit of 10 1 percent to a structural primary surplus of 3 2 percent just from 2009 to 2012  That is the equivalent of four fiscal cliffs in a row  Theoretically  the adjustment is enough to put Greece on the path to long run fiscal sustainability  but in the short run  it has meant rioting in the streets  True  the United States today is not in quite as bad a fiscal condition as Greece was in 2009  Still  the  that the cliff would put the U S  economy back into recession  Furthermore  it would not fully erase the 5 percent structural primary deficit as measured by the OECD  For the United States to achieve the 3 percent structural primary surplus that Greece is aiming for would require two consecutive fiscal cliffs  The second scenario is that Washington s warring factions will reach a comprehensive budget deal during the post election session of Congress a deal that is not so strongly front loaded and would therefore pose less threat of recession  A recent  article tells us that negotiators are aiming at a package of revenue increases and spending cuts that would total  4 trillion over ten years  Such a deal would be very welcome but even that might not be enough  What would be enough  The most detailed calculations I have seen recently are those in an update of the Simpson Bowles plan  or Bowles Simpson  if you prefer  that has just been released by the  The CBPP version of Simpson Bowles foresees a total of  6 257 billion in spending cuts and tax increases over the ten years from 2013 to 2022  Of that  about  1 5 trillion of spending cuts have already been enacted  leaving about  4 750 billion to go  That is significantly more ambitious than the hypothetical post election deal outlined by the New York Times  which aims for  4 trillion of cuts including those that have already been made  The CBPP analysis allows us to project the debt to GDP ratio and the primary budget balance over a ten year time horizon  as shown in the next chart  A world of caution  The primary balances shown there are only roughly comparable to the OECD numbers given earlier  First  they are estimates of current primary balances for each year  not the structural primary balances  Second  they use somewhat different assumptions both for baseline policy and economic growth than those used by the OECD  Even with those caveats  the results offer a dramatic contrast to the large structural primary deficits of our earlier charts  If you want to know what an economically adequate fiscal consolidation plan would look like  this is as good a blueprint as you will find   The big question is whether any such plan is politically feasible  There is room for doubt  In last week s first presidential debate  the candidates paid no more than the most lukewarm lip service to Simpson Bowles  GOP candidate Romney rightly characterized President Obama s failure to embrace the plan when it first appeared as a failure of leadership  However  he refused to endorse it himself  Here is the key segment  taken from  of the debate  21 31 34  MODERATOR JIM LEHRER  Governor  what about Simpson Bowles  Do you support Simpson Bowles  21 31 34  ROMNEY  Simpson Bowles  the president should have grabbed that  21 31 35  LEHRER  No  I mean  do you support Simpson Bowles  21 31 36  ROMNEY  I have my own plan  It s not the same as Simpson Bowles  But in my view  the president should have grabbed it  If you wanted to make some adjustments to it  take it  go to Congress  fight for it  21 31 48  OBAMA  That s what we ve done  made some adjustments to it  and we re putting it forward before Congress right now  a  4 trillion plan       The Romney plan and the President s adjusted version of Simpson Bowles differ from each other and from the CBPP s version in the way they divide budget adjustments between spending cuts and revenue increases  According to the CBPP  the Simpson Bowles plan envisioned a ratio of spending cuts to tax increases of something between 1 to 1 and 1 4 to 1  depending on how you treat interest savings  President Obama suggested during the debate that he was aiming for a 2 5 to 1 ratio in his modified plan  Romney s plan  although notoriously short on details  purports to achieve fiscal adjustment entirely through spending cuts  The trouble is  no plan that is so heavily loaded toward spending cuts is likely to pass the Senate  and no plan that includes significant revenue increases is likely to pass the House  at least as those bodies are presently constituted  That leaves us with the prospect of continued political gridlock unless one party or the other takes over all three branches of government  unlikely  or both parties give up political posturing and get down to realistic compromise  only slightly more likely   Meanwhile  if politicians in Washington do nothing  budget realities will continue to unfold according to their inexorable arithmetic  The structural primary balance will remain deeply in deficit and the debt to GDP ratio will continue to rise  Does that make the United States the Greece of North America  with gasoline bombs in the street and laid off civil servants digging for food in the dumpsters  Hopefully  not  The United States has many economics strengths compared with Greece  Despite what we hear from some commentators  our labor and product markets are less tangled in bureaucratic red tape  Despite the ugly realities of pay to play  SuperPacs  and the rest  our political system is arguably less corrupt  Above all  we have our own central bank  as much on the defensive as it might be  and our own sovereign currency  Still  each year that we fail to make the needed fiscal adjustments  we are squandering those advantages  Greece caused itself much unnecessary pain by waiting too long to face up to fiscal realities  Will we do the same ,2012-10-08,Ed

121660,343175,NYT,John Williams On Lies  Damned Lies And The 7 8  Unemployment Rate,opinion,Shadowstats com Author John Williams wonders if politics are at play behind the latest jobs report  which shows 114 000 new U S  jobs since September and a 0 3  drop in unemployment since August  Investors need to know how seasonal factors and month to month volatility affect the Bureau of Labor Statistics  reports  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Williams explains why he doubts that we are in a recovery  The take away  Look at the unadjusted figures before you sell your gold  The Gold Report  John  as Mark Twain famously quipped   There are three kinds of lies  lies  damned lies and statistics   The Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  just came out with new jobs numbers that show the country added 114 000 jobs since September and the unemployment rate dropped to 7 8   down from 8 1  in August  On Shadowstats com  you argue that the numbers are wrong and pointed to politics as a possible reason for the incorrect figures  Are unemployment statistics being manipulated and if so how  John Williams  I normally put out a commentary on the numbers  and  in this one  I raised the possibility of politics as a factor  The problem is very serious misreporting of the numbers and the result is what appears to be a bogus unemployment rate  The BLS reported a drop in the unemployment rate from 8 1  to 7 8   three tenths of a percentage point  which runs counter to what is being experienced in the marketplace  What few people realize is that the headline unemployment rate is calculated each month using a unique set of seasonal adjustments  The August unemployment rate  which was 8 1   was calculated using what BLS calls a  concurrent seasonal factor adjustment   Each month the agency recalculates the series to adjust for regular seasonal patterns tied to the school year or holiday shopping season or whatever is considered relevant  The next month  it does the same thing using another set of seasonal factors  Rather than publish a number that s consistent with the prior month s estimate  it recalculates everything  including the previous month  but it doesn t publish the revised number from the previous month  The assumption is that the monthly recalculations don t make much difference over time  but they do  The depth and the protraction of the current severe economic downturn have thrown off the annual seasonal factor adjustments  The result is very volatile seasonal factors month to month  That means the new calculations for the September number may have resulted in a very significant revision to the August number  Again  though  the BLS doesn t publish that  so the headline August to September 2012 change in the unemployment rate is not consistent and not comparable  Last December  when the BLS put the seasonal adjustments on a consistent basis for the year  as it does once per year  the November 2011 unemployment rate had just been reported as showing four tenths of a percentage point drop an unusually large monthly decline that never took place  When revised to a consistent basis  the drop in headline November unemployment revised to two tenths of a percent  That is a big change  I think something like that happened here  The BLS knows what the actual number is  It has an actual estimate for August  which is consistent with September  but it doesn t publish it because it says it  doesn t want to confuse data users   But it is putting out numbers that have no meaning month to month  One month before the election and a month after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced Quantitative Easing  QE  3  is not a time to have inaccurate numbers  The BLS should publish the consistent numbers now  TGR  You have said that BLS has been using this recalculation method for years  Do you feel that this month the numbers were more skewed than usual because of the political timing  JW  Because there is no transparency in the calculation and reporting process  it leaves open the possibility of manipulation  What has happened here  though  is that in the wake of the economic collapse  the seasonal factors have been heavily distorted and are not stable on a month to month basis  Where the concept originally might not have made that much of a difference  it does make a big difference now  I suspect that is why we woke up to such a screwy unemployment rate this time around  The 114 000 jobs growth in the payroll survey  which reflects the number of payroll jobs  counting multiple jobholders more than once  also is suspect and subject to concurrent seasonal factor adjustments  There  however  the BLS publishes revised estimates for the two prior months that are on a consistent basis with the headline number  Nonetheless  jobs in even earlier months are not re reported  although they too are recalculated each month  with the effect that jobs reported in earlier periods can be moved into present reporting  boosting the current numbers  without the related earlier changes being revised in the published historical numbers  Nonetheless  the purported 114 000 jobs gain was not statistically significant  From the household survey  which gives us the unemployment rate and counts the number of people who are employed  multiple job holders are counted but once   the headline gain in employment was 873 000  the largest seasonally adjusted monthly increase since Ronald Reagan s first term  That number clearly is nonsense and again suggests there is a severe problem with the seasonal factors  TGR  Do you think the unemployment rate was manipulated on purpose or did the bad economy just make the reporting more confusing  JW  It could have been manipulated  I do not know and do not have direct evidence of current political massaging of the data  I know for certain that there have been direct political manipulations by different administrations  since the days of President Lyndon Johnson  involving various data sets that have included the gross domestic product  GDP   the trade numbers and the employment and unemployment numbers  From what I ve seen of the Obama administration  the reporting has been reasonably clean  Nonetheless  at best  the administration is using seriously flawed data  and the reporting and calculation process has the potential for manipulation  The timing of the announcement of such a big downside swing in unemployment certainly is a fortuitous circumstance for the administration s political needs  Main Street U S A   however  has a much better sense on the economic reality than do the government s economic statisticians  If the headline unemployment rate is not as advertised  a goodly portion of the public will not buy it  Past experience has shown gimmicked reporting often backfiring on the manipulators  TGR  What is the correct unemployment rate  What would be a reliable data set  JW  I don t know of one  The unemployment rate comes out of government surveying and data manipulation  and the base number is wrong  What are good in theory are the un adjusted numbers  although unemployment definitions still suffer  Those don t get revised for the seasonal factors  But there you have regular annual patterns of economic activity  so you ll see the unemployment rate go up and down as it follows the normal flow of annual business activity through the various seasons  Even so  it makes some sense to look at that unadjusted series over time  The average person doesn t think of himself or herself as employed on a seasonally adjusted basis  but a lot of people  according to the government  are so employed  If you surveyed everyone in the country as to whether he or she were unemployed  you d get an unemployment rate above 22   instead of the headline 7 8   The difference is in how the government defines whether someone is unemployed  versus the view from common experience  TGR  What are the ultimate consequences of inaccurate statistics on the stock market  commodity prices and everyday people  JW  Right now  the impact of the unemployment numbers is mostly political  although the Federal Reserve has made it part of its targeting in terms of QE3  But the primary political concerns are on the impact to the upcoming election  which is what makes the timing of this release so suspect  There is a serious problem with the reporting  If it has been used to manipulate the public  that eventually will come out  If it hasn t  the simplest thing is for the BLS just to publish the actual numbers  They have them  They don t have to do any recalculations  They ve already done that  They just need to publish them in a timely manner  TGR  There seemed to be an impact on the stock market  The Dow ended Friday up  Was that simply a coincidence  JW  Yes  the market jumped all over the place  But I see no rationale whatsoever behind the movements in the stock market  Any numbers will be used to spin a story that will explain what s happening with stocks at a given point in time  TGR  What about commodity prices  What will this do to gold  JW  You had some sell off in gold Friday  Again  that could all be spin  Was it due to people thinking Bernanke was not going to have to ease monetary policy as much  I m not into day to day calling of the markets  The stock market is absolutely irrational  You can make up all sorts of stories based on that  Markets respond to lots of really worthless information the 114 000 gain in payrolls for example is not statistically meaningful  It could have been a contraction as well as a gain  when the 129 000 job margin of error is considered  Yet  the markets gyrate wildly over very small changes that have no relationship to what s actually happening in the economy  I think traders just love to trade  It s like going to the racetrack and betting on a horse because of how it wiggles its ears  It has little to do with the underlying fundamentals  TGR  Is there an ultimate consequence of having faulty data  Do incorrect numbers build on themselves and become more inaccurate over time  Will we see a jump in the unemployment rate in December when they are recalculated after the election  Are there other consequences  JW  When governments use bad numbers  and believe them  they don t respond appropriately to problems like unemployment and inflation  People don t properly target their investment returns or adjust their income projections  There are good reasons for having accurate information  but accurate numbers just are not coming out of the U S  government at the moment  TGR  You mentioned the correlation with the announcement of QE3  When we talked in May  you called QE  dangerous  and said it would eventually lead to a massive decline in the U S  dollar  triggering new dollar selling and lead to dollar inflation  spikes in oil prices and eventually hyperinflation  Your special commentary on inflation and systemic conditions comes out next week on ShadowStats  Can we expect any good news  JW  The outlook hasn t changed  I ve been looking at this for a long time  Let me put it this way  The economy is not suddenly improving  Underlying fundamentals have not changed  You just are getting bad quality numbers  The average guy has a pretty good sense of what is going on  When Main Street suddenly starts getting jobs and businesses pick up  then we will know the economy is picking up  Shy of that  I d be wary of anything I hear out of the government on business activity  TGR  So the reports that we are in a recovery aren t accurate  What indicators should we be watching  JW  Over time  you will find the better quality statistics are confirming that we never had an economic recovery  and that we re not about to get one  When you have faulty numbers  you need to look at the underlying fundamentals to see what s happening  The problem is the consumer doesn t have the liquidity  either from the standpoint of income growth or credit availability  to sustain positive growth in the GDP  TGR  Thank you for your time  John  We will check in with you periodically to see

121661,343176,NYT,China  Japan  Taiwan And US  Four To Party In Diaoyutai ,opinion,With Bin Laden and Gaddafi out of the picture  the geopolitical headline is now shifting to Asia China  The most recent excitement came from a 3 way bitter territorial feud over eight small and uninhabited islands in the East China Sea   Historically  these uninhabited islands are rich fishing grounds with military strategic importance  It was also discovered in 1968 that there could be oil and gas reserves under the sea near the islands  It is estimated that the East China Sea region may hold as much as 160 billion barrels of oil  Today  these islands have different names depending on whom you talk to   Diaoyu in China  Diaoyutai in Taiwan  and Senkaku in Japan Duel in the East China Sea Physically  Taiwan is the closest to Diaoyutai among the three  however  China and Japan have been portrayed as seemingly the only two players by the western media in this island row  Taiwan has always maintained a low profile in most international or diplomatic matters  But that changed about two weeks ago when Taiwan officially asserted its claim on Diaoyutai by dispatching 12 coast guard vessels along with some 50 civilian fishing boats to the islands  The resulted water cannon duel between the vessels of Taiwan and Japan has officially landed Taiwan squarely on the map of Diaoyutai  so to speak  before the eyes of world media  Japan Purchase Angers Chinese The history of this dispute has been a regional  undercurrent  that could be traced all the way back to   But tension erupted high above surface after Japan s attempt to  nationalize  these islands by purchasing them from a private owner for 2 05 billion yen   26 18 million   This tactic  not that much different from the provocation by Japan to start the previous two Sino Japanese Wars  has brought up lots of bad memories  Needless to say  Chinese  from both sides of the Strait  are livid and large scale anti Japan protests have broken out in a dozen of cities in Mainland and Taiwan  Japan Sales Crash China was Japan s largest trading partner last year  and Japan is China s second biggest trading partner after the United States with two way trade totaling  342 9bn  China is also the largest auto market in the world and represents one significant  life line  for Japanese automakers  The renewed anti Japanese backlash in China has already caused the   of up to 50  YoY in China last month   Japan s loss is another rival s gain as BMW  GM and Korea s Hyundai are reporting surging YoY sales in September  China Daily  IHS Automotive that output and sales for Japanese automakers in China is estimated to be cut by 200 000 units this year  or 20  of sales  China communist party also threatened that Japan s economy could suffer for up to 20 years if China chose to impose sanctions over the escalating territorial row  The Role of U S  in Diaoyutai  Based in historical documents  Diaoyutai Islands were formally part of China  but Taiwan  along with the associated islands including Diaoyutai Islands  was ceded to Japan by the Qing Dynasty in 1895 via         after losing the First Sino Japanese War  Taiwan was returned to the Republic of China formed by the Nationalist Party  KMT  in 1945 after the end of WW II in accordance of   and   However  Diaoyutai was not returned to China along with Taiwan  And in the aftermath of a civil war in China  and two treaties between the US Allied and Japan  without the presence of China  the U S  somehow ended up  administering  the Diaoyutai Islands from 1945 before transferring the  administration  to Japan in 1972  which is part of the basis of Japan s claim and in essence the direct cause and effect of the current 3 way row  Further Reading    NYT  Sep  19  2012   Communist China did launch a protest at the time of the administrative transfer by the United States to Japan  So a logical question would be  Why did the U S  return the  administration  of Diaoyutai to Japan in 1972 with China protesting knowing full well there was an unresolved territorial dispute  How  Neutral  Can The U S  Be  So far  the U S  has tried hard not to get involved by simply asserting  a neutral position on the competing claims of Japan and China over the islands   However  the U S  also affirms that it will protect Diaoyutai as part of  the territories under the administration of Japan  according to the US Japan Security Treaty  With that gold plated safety blanket in the back pocket  it is not a surprise that Japan resorts to anything less than the so called  diplomatic blunder  to force the claim over Diaoyutai via an outright purchase  It is also part of the reason China is calling the United States to    regarding being neutral on the China Japan territorial dispute  Global Multi lateral Implications Now  this regional diplomatic row has evolved into a global multi lateral economic and geopolitical event when China s Finance and Central Bank officials  along with several Chinese major bankers  boycott IMF and World Bank meetings in Tokyo this week  Ratings agency Standard   Poor s already warned that  if the political confrontation  between China and Japan  drags on and further worsens ties between both countries  it may hurt Japan s macro economy and affect the credit quality of rated Japanese companies on a large scale   Alarmed by the recent development  Christine Lagarde of IMF also warned that China and Japan should not be distracted by territorial division as  the current status of the global economy needs both Japan and China fully engaged    China   Taiwan   Not Nemesis on Diaoyutai  China and Taiwan have remained hostile to each other ever since the separation some 60 years ago  Both sides disagree on almost anything and everything for decades  However  the common bond of defending Chinese sovereignty from Japan seems to have pushed them closer  China asked Taiwan to have a joint sovereignty claim  which was turned down by Taiwan   and said it will continue vessel patrols and will extend protection to Taiwan civilian fishing boats around Diaoyutai  Then interestingly  after China Daily

Aircraft Carrier Worries Many What has raised quite a few heart beats from the Kremlin to the Pentagon was that as a show of force to Japan  China put its first aircraft carrier  Liaoning into commission right in the middle the Taiwan Japan vessel showdown  Partly in response to the Chinese carrier launch as well as the increasing tension over Diaoyutai  two nuclear powered aircraft carrier strike groups of the US Navy s 7th Fleet have been  since mid September to the Western Pacific Backing Down Is Politically Incorrect  Right now  the political environments in Taiwan  China and Japan would suggest it is highly unlikely any of them would back down from their current stance  Many are keeping a watchful eye as China has been beefing up its military defense budget with quite a sizable naval fleet in the Pacific region to boot  Meanwhile  the U S  has been preoccupied with the Middle East region  particularly since 9 11  leading to a much diminished presence in the Asia Pacific  However  with so much more than just oil reserves in the East China Sea at stake  it is now almost impossible to really have a third Sino Japanese War  Nevertheless  when push comes to shove  China still has the bigger gun over Japan on many other levels  and the U S  most likely has to at least sit in the bed it s made so far  And also don t discount the potential wild card role of China s nemesis   Taiwan either ,2012-10-12,EconMatters,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/china,-japan,-taiwan-and-us:-four-to-party-in-diaoyutai-139521",139521

121666,343181,NYT,China s Power Pyramid,opinion,China celebrated another achievement last week  as Mo Yan became the first Chinese citizen to win a Nobel Prize for literature  The selection of Mo was praised by a Chinese nationalist tabloid as a sign that mainstream China could  no longer be refused by the West for long    Mo grew up in Shandong province in northeastern China  and during the Cultural Revolution  he left school to work in the fields  finishing his education in the army  according to The Guardian  The author draws upon his rural upbringing in his novels  mixing historical perspective with mythical elements  His real name is Guan Moye  but he chose  Mo Yan  as a pen name meaning  don t speak   to reflect the culture in which he grew up   Old Enough To RememberThe new Nobel laureate is of the same generation as the new leaders set to take over the Politburo Standing Committee next month after the convening of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China  This group of men  and one female contender  are  old enough to remember the suffering of the Cultural Revolution  but also young enough to fully experience how China has grown through Deng  Xiaoping  s opening of the economy to market forces   says CLSA China Strategy research   They ve seen vast political reforms take place  transforming China  from a country ruled by the contradictory personal whims of Mao to one ruled through institutions and rules   says William H  Overholt in The Washington Quarterly  During these decades   freedoms blossomed  affecting everything from clothing to haircuts to job or marital choices to social and political speech   says Overholt As a result of these policies  they ve been able to witness China s incredible growth  with GDP averaging 10  per year and more than 500 million people moving out of poverty over the past 30 years Now after three decades of tremendous expansion  this new generation of leaders will have to carefully maneuver the country into the next decade  towing the line between maintaining the stability created during the previous Hu Wen administration and continuing the political and economic reform necessary to adjust to the country s slowing growth China s pyramid of power is headed by the Politburo Standing Committee  PSC   which will likely have seven to nine new members led by Vice President Xi Jinping and Vice Premier Li Keqiang  selected by a vote of the Central Committee Changing DegreesUnlike prior committee members who were mostly engineers  the new PSC members have varying liberal arts backgrounds  including history  law and economics  which may help to  address social concerns after decades of focusing mostly on growth   according to CLSA These leaders tend to be more globally aware than their predecessors  They are better traveled  and many have family members  relatives or friends who have gone to school overseas and have foreign residency   The rapid proliferation of mobile phones  broadband  internet has made unbiased information much easier to access   says CLSA Incoming President Xi Jinping is a princeling who was born into privilege as the son of Xi Zhongxun  who was among the first generation of Chinese leadership and  one of the most liberal leaders under Deng   His father s claim to fame was in creating a special economic zone in Shenzhen  which transformed the area from a small village to one of the fastest growing cities in the world and one of the busiest container ports in China Premier Li Keqiang comes from a more common background  as his father  Li Fengsan  was an official of the local government  After the Cultural Revolution  Li was one of the  Class of  77  when only 273 000 people won admission to universities out of a total of 5 7 million candidates   By comparison  58 percent of nine million people in 2007 won admission to universities  according to a 2008 article in The New York Times   He spent 16 years at the Central Communist Youth League  and then 10 more years in the Henan and Liaoning Provinces before becoming a member of the standing committee The LineupUnderneath the PSC is the Politburo with 25 members  then the Central Committee with 371 members  who then dictate to more than 80 million Communist party members  So What Direction Will The Next Generation Of Leaders Take  This remains a  great enigma   says Overholt  Xi has been  extremely cautious  about stating his opinions  however   he has the confidence that comes from being a princeling and from having some military background   In addition  the other members of the PSC have agendas that are  ambitious and outspoken   The tensions and inconsistencies that exist within the committee members could be  creatively dynamic or immobilizing   says Overholt   CLSA believes that the new leadership will likely push for reform since they will be  forced to adapt to China s slowing growth   The research firm says that historically  large reforms successfully occurred after a crisis  including Tiananmen Square and the Asian Financial Crisis   A nearly 500 page document by the World Bank and China s Development Research Center of the State Council may give  promising insight into China s future policy   says CLSA  The comprehensive report called China 2030 identifies a long term strategy for Chinese policymakers  The report says that  after more than 30 years of rapid growth  China has reached another turning point in its development path when a second strategic  and no less fundamental  shift is called for    It irons out six areas that need to be addressed Structural reforms to strengthen the foundation for a market based economy need to be implementedInnovations need to be acceleratedThe country should pursue  green  opportunitiesAll citizens need opportunities and social securityThe fiscal system needs to be strengthenedChina needs to seek mutually beneficial relations with the worldThe report concludes by saying that  a successful outcome will require strong leadership and commitment  steady implementation with a determined will  coordination across ministries and agencies  and sensitive yet effective management of a consultation process  that encourages the support of the public  The potential for China to be a  modern  harmonious  and creative high income society  is there  however  but  achieving this objective will not be easy   says the report   Global CorrelationIn November  the U S  will be focused on its own political situation as Americans head to the polls  While staying active and involved in national politics is important  I believe it s just as vital to pay close attention to how the leadership change will unfold in the second largest economy in the world   U S

121688,343203,NYT,Why Romney s Choice Of Ryan Won t Help America Debate The Big Issues,opinion,I keep hearing that Mitt Romney s pick of Paul Ryan  enables the country to have the debate it needs to have   or  permits us to have a grownup discussion   or  finally presents America with a real choice   The New York Times oped page proclaims   Let the Real Debate Begin  Debate  What debate Romney isn t even standing by Ryan s budget plan  He s been distancing himself from it from the moment he tabbed Ryan for the ticket   I m the one running for President   he keeps saying in response to reporters  questions about whether he agrees with Ryan Not even Ryan will say publicly what the Romney economic plan entails   We haven t run the numbers yet   he repeats   as if there were numbers in the Romney plan to run  But the numbers in Romney s plan are like the numbers in Romney s tax returns   they re invisible to anyone who might have an interest in knowing But even if Romney were to adopt Ryan s budget plan intact we still wouldn t have a real debate because Ryan s own plan itself lacks specifics that add up None of the budgets Ryan has come up with as chair of the House Budget Committee indicate which tax loopholes he d close and exactly which programs for lower income Americans he d eliminate in order to balance the budget Ryan claims that his revenue targets can be met by  broadening the tax base   but he hasn t said how he d do it  He s insisted on keeping two of the biggest loopholes that overwhelmingly favor the wealthy  the preferential tax rates on capital gains and dividends In fact  Ryan s budget is larded with so much defense spending and so many tax cuts for the wealthy that it doesn t even lower the debt   when exposed to realistic assumptions It baldly assumes that tax cuts for the rich will generate revenues totaling 18 4 percent of the economy over the next decade  That s supply side nonsense  When the non partisan Tax Policy Center looked at Ryan s budget plan  it calculated that revenues would average only 16 3 percent over the decade    4 trillion less  Under that revenue estimate  Ryan s budget would increase debt as a share of the economy for more than four decades   pushing the public debt to over 175 percent of GDP by 2050 We can t even have a clear debate about programs like Medicare  because Romney and Ryan seem determined to sow as much confusion as possible about their proposed voucher system   At least Romney says his own approach to Medicare is  almost identical  to Ryan s  They ve been charging all week that President Obama s Affordable Care Act  robs  Medicare of more than  700 billion over the next decade  In reality  the Romney Ryan plan saves exactly the same amount  But it does so by shifting costs to seniors whose vouchers won t keep up with the projected cost of health care  Obama s savings come from reduced payments to medical providers What s really driving Medicare costs   as well as future federal budget deficits   is the increasing costs of health care overall  combined with aging boomers  But don t expect a debate over how to reign in healthcare costs because Romney and Ryan haven t put forward a healthcare plan  All they want to do is repeal the Affordable Care Act  leaving 50 million Americans without health insurance coverage We won t have a clear debate over whether to raise tax rates on the wealthy because Romney and Ryan are sticking to the conservative bromide that the wealthy and big corporations need more tax cuts in order to create jobs   even though America s top earners are now taking home more of the nation s income than they have in eighty years  and corporations are sitting on more than a trillion dollars of cash they don t know what to do with We won t even have a debate over how to prevent another meltdown of Wall Street or a taxpayer bailout of  too big to fail  banks because Romney and Ryan don t have a plan for preventing another Wall Street crisis  All they want to do is repeal the Dodd Frank act Romney s choice of Ryan won t usher in a  real debate  about much of anything except  perhaps  the danger to our democracy of billionaires like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson  whose blessing Ryan immediately sought this week  who are pouring tens of millions of dollars into negative advertising   Adelson alone has committed  100 million of his fortune  Those negative ads  by the way  are making it all the harder for average Americans to sort out the truth from well financed big lies   and understand  let alone debate  the big issues this election year ,2012-08-17,Robert B.

121689,343204,NYT,Paul Ryan s Faux Populism,opinion,On Friday  Paul Ryan  the presumptive Republican vice presidential nominee  made the most populist speech of this campaign season  It s the people who are politically connected  it s the people who have access to Washington that get the breaks   he told an enthusiastic crowd of over 2 000 at a high school gym in Virginia  Well  no more  We don t want to pick winners and losers in Washington     Hardworking taxpayers should be treated fairly and it should be based on whether they re good  whether they work hard and not who they know in Washington  That s entrepreneurialism  That s free enterprise  Sounds good  but earlier this week   three days after being picked as Romney s running mate   Ryan went to Las Vegas to pay homage to Sheldon Adelson  the casino billionaire who is the poster boy for using money to become  politically connected  in Washington  and getting the  breaks  that come with it  Adelson has promised to donate up to  100 million to make sure Romney and Ryan are in the White House next year Much of Adelson s fortune comes from his casino in Macau  in China  via his money greased access to Washington When China s pitch for the 2008 Olympics was endangered by a House resolution opposing the bid because of China s  abominable human rights record   Adelson phoned Tom DeLay  then House majority whip and recipient of Adelson s political generosity   urging him to block the resolution  which DeLay promptly did  The next day  according to the New York Times  a Chinese vice premier promised Mr  Adelson an endless line of gamblers to the Macau casino The money Adelson has committed to putting Romney and Ryan into the White House is a business investment  Adelson has a lot riding on the 2012 election Last year  his Las Vegas Sands Corporation came under investigation by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act   bribing Chinese officials to help expand its casino in Macau The U S  attorney s office in Los Angeles  meanwhile  is investigating whether the Sands Corporation violated federal money laundering laws by accepting more than  100 million from high rolling gamblers accused of drug trafficking and embezzlement  rather than reporting the suspicious funds to the government Ryan has also been a major recipient of contributions from billionaire energy moguls Charles and David Koch  Koch Industries PAC has donated more than  100 000 to Ryan s campaigns and his leadership PAC   more than any other corporate PAC  according to a NY Times analysis of campaign records You see  Koch industries spans a variety of oil and gas investments   whose value would be compromised if Congress and the White House got serious about climate change Small wonder Paul Ryan has emerged as one of Congress s most outspoken skeptics of climate change  He has also repeatedly voted against energy efficiency standards  including a House vote to prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases Several months ago  when I debated Paul Ryan on ABC TV s  This Week   he said we need to shrink the size of government because big corporations and wealthy individuals otherwise use government to their advantage  If the power and money are going to be here in Washington  that s where the influence is going to go   that s where the powerful are going to go to influence it   he said It s an odd argument coming from Ryan because his proposed budget doesn t shrink government by cutting benefits and payments to big business and the rich  He increases military payments to defense contractors  for example  slashes Wall Street regulations  and gives giant tax benefits to the rich His budget shrinks government mainly by cutting benefits and payments to the poor and lower income Americans  Over  of his spending cuts target programs for Americans in the bottom third of the income ladder Ryan is correct when he says  it s the people who are politically connected  it s the people who have access to Washington that get the breaks  But his faux populism obscures the main point  A much smaller government still dominated by money would continue to do the bidding of billionaires like casino mogul Sheldon Adelson  energy moguls like the Koch bothers  military contractors  and other high rollers now actively trying to put Ryan and Romney into the White House It just wouldn t do anything for the rest of us ,2012-08-19,Robert B.

121695,343210,NYT,9 11 And Gold  Money And Power ,opinion,With the rise of central banking  gold as money began a three century decline  Gold as power  however  continued on as usual    In 1971  when the US cut the ties between money and gold  gold as money ceased to exist  Gold as power  however  continued  But because gold is power there is little real information on the connection between the two  and that information is often misleading as the powerful prefer secrecy and the true movements of gold are no exception   I would like to share some information I discovered about the world of gold and power that will shed light on some very critical issues  and  because of power s purposefully hidden path  the truth here can only be approached obliquely   What I offer is a name  The name is Bruce Rappaport  Twenty five years ago  in extenuating circumstances I had met Howard Hughes  private banker  Dr  Norman Bernard Thirion  Prior to working for Hughes  Dr  Thirion had worked for Daniel K  Ludwig  a man even wealthier and more secretive than Hughes   Because of the unique circumstances under which we met  Thirion told me about events he had told few others  events that led to  among others  the name of Bruce Rappaport  The events centered on the embezzlement by the Reagan White House of funds Thirion had solicited from the Saudi royal family   The funds   500 million  intended to aid the Afghan freedom fighters never reached them  Instead they were later discovered in a secret CIA Swiss bank account co mingled with proceeds from the Iran Contra arms scandal  another illegal Reagan operation  The bank account was controlled by an Israeli Swiss banker  Bruce Rappaport  later connected to the events surrounding 9 11   It was because of what Howard Hughes  private banker told me in 1987 that I recognized Rappaport s name when it came to my attention last year in 2011  this time in connection with 9 11 and events far from Norman Thirion and the Reagan White House  events that will reveal the continuing connection between gold  money and power   SECRET LIES AND HIDDEN TRUTHS   The name of Bruce Rappaport brings together events  nations and individuals tangled in interlocking webs of deceit and deception  The covert life of Bruce Rappaport is similar to a USB hub that connects crime  power  politics and money  and it was Rappaport s relationship with William Casey Nixon s Chairman of the SEC  Reagan s Director of the CIA and Rappaport s golfing buddy that gave Rappaport his lubed entry into the international sewers of power and money   On August 22  1999  an article in the New York Times  Russian Money Laundering Investigation finds a Familiar Swiss Banker in the Middle  focused on Russian money laundering being carried out at Rappaport s bank  the Bank of New York  The New York Times  article on Bruce Rappaport  i e  the  familiar Swiss banker   and his bank  the Bank of New York  did not  however  mention Rappaport s close ties to Israel  the Reagan administration and to US intelligence   Regarding these omissions by the New York Times  Robert Parry wrote   the article sketched Rappaport s biography from his birth in Haifa  now part of Israel  through his founding of Inter Maritime Bank in Geneva to his acquisition of the Bank of New York but left out was an important piece of the mystery  Rappaport s close relationship to Israel s Labor Party  the Reagan administration and U S  intelligence  Rappaport had been linked to some of the Reagan administration s most controversial actions These included  the Iran contra affair  an Israeli bribery case that involved a U S  backed oil pipeline in Iraq  the scandal over the Bank of Credit and Commerce International  a curious shipment of weapons through a melon farm in Antigua to Colombian cocaine kingpins  and the October Surprise mystery  the allegations that the 1980 Reagan campaign sabotaged Carter s negotiations to free 52 American hostages held in Iran WHAT YOU DON T KNOW EXPLAINS WHAT YOU DON T UNDERSTAND  On September 24  2011  the name  Bruce Rappaport  was mentioned on the website Veterans Today  Bruce Rappaport and Lee Wanta  a former US intelligence operative  who  like Rappaport  was involved with Reagan s illegal Iran contra activities  had also been active in US covert efforts to destabilize the Russian economy   Wanta s story along with Bruce Rappaport s offers a telling glimpse into the secretive world of power  politics  money and gold  The story in Veterans Today  titled  Classified  The Wanta Chronicles  the Covert Economic War  connects Lee Wanta and Bruce Rappaport to      a vast international criminal conspiracy at the heart of the American government      beginning  with the criminal prosecution of former Reagan intelligence coordinator  Lee Wanta Charges allege that the 9 11 attacks were planned and executed in order to cover financial crimes   The financial crimes and events that revolved around US efforts to destabilize the Russian ruble are myriad and complex  and include far more than the activities of Rappaport and Wanta   They not only explain the events surrounding 9 11  they also reveal the source of funding for America s covert activities after WWII  thousands of tons of gold stolen from China by the Japanese and later again stolen by the US   CHINA S STOLEN GOLD  Professor Chalmers Johnson s review of Gold Warriors  America s Secret Recovery of Yamashita s Gold by Sterling and Peggy Seagrave tells of the widespread looting of China s riches by Japanese forces before their defeat in WWII     Yamashita s gold  describes the vast wealth looted from China then hidden by General Yamashita  Countless tons of gold  precious stones and stolen treasures were secretly buried by General Yamashita in the Philippines prior to Japan s surrender  Ferdinand Marcos  later president of the Philippines  also had found  Yamashita s gold    The Americans moved quickly to suppress any knowledge of this vast hoard of gold  and  rather than returning it to its rightful owners  Chalmers Johnson writes    it was decided at the highest levels  presumably by Truman  to keep these discoveries secret and to funnel the money into various off the books slush funds to finance the clandestine activities of the CIA   Among these clandestine activities was the destabilization of Russia s ruble in which Rappaport and Wanta were involved  in which  240 billion of 10 year securities were issued on September 10  1991 to buy up Russia s industrial base  and it was to destroy evidence of these covert securities and their source that the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked on September 11  2001   According to Veterans Today  the primary targets on 9 11 in the World Trade Center were Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers  major dealers in US securities  The primary target at the Pentagon was the Office of Naval Intelligence which had been investigating the covert securities   41  of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from two companies that managed U S  government securities  Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers  31  of the 125 fatalities in the Pentagon were from the Naval Command Center that housed the Office of Naval Intelligence     The covert securities  used to accomplish the original national security objective had ended up in the vaults of the brokers in the World Trade Center   and  were destroyed on September 11  2001  the day before they came due for settlement and clearing   THE COVERUP  The Veterans Today article notes The federal agency mostly involved in investigating those transactions was the Office of Naval Intelligence  On September 11 those same three organizations  the two largest government securities brokers and the Office of Naval Intelligence in the US took near direct hits  What happened inside the buildings of the World Trade on September 11 is difficult  but not impossible to discern  The government has put a seal on the testimony gathered by the investigating 911 Commission  and instructed government employees to not speak on the matter or suffer severe penalties  but there are a number of personal testimonies posted on the internet as to what happened in those buildings that day  Careful reconstruction from those testimonies indicates the deliberate destruction of evidence not only by a targeted assault on the buildings  but also by targeted fires and explosions  In the event that either the hijacking failed  or the buildings were not brought down  the evidence would be destroyed by fires  Even more revealing would be the actions of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission on that day  and in the immediate aftermath  As one of many coincidences on September 11  the Federal Reserve Bank was operating its information system from its remote back up site rather than its downtown headquarters  The SEC and Federal Reserve system remained unfazed by the attack on September 11  All of their systems continued to operate  The two major security trading firms had their trade data backed up on remote systems  Nevertheless  the Commission for the first time invoked its emergency powers under Securities Exchange Act Section 12 k  and issued several orders to ease certain regulatory restrictions temporarily  On the first day of the crisis  the SEC lifted  Rule 15c3 3  Customer Protection Reserves and Custody of Securities   which set trading rules for certain processes  Simply  the  GSCC  Government Securities Clearing Corporation  was allowed to substitute securities for the physical securities destroyed during the attack  Subsequent to that ruling  the GSCC issued another memo expanding blind broker settlements  A  blind broker  is a mechanism for inter dealer transactions that maintains the anonymity of both parties to the trade  The broker serves as the agent to the principals  transactions  Thus the Federal Reserve and its GSCC had created a settlement environment totally void of controls and reporting   where it could substitute valid  new government securities for the mature  illegal securities  and not have to record where the bad securities came from  or where the new securities went   all because the paper for the primary brokers for US securities had been eliminated  This act  alone  however was inadequate to resolve the problem  because the Federal Reserve did not have enough  takers  of the new 10 year notes  Rather than simply having to match buy and sell orders  which was the essence of resolving the  fail  problem  fails occur when securities are not delivered and paid for on the date scheduled by the buyer and seller   it appears the Fed was doing more than just matching and balancing   it was pushing new notes on the market with a special auction  If the Federal Reserve had to cover up the clearance of  240 Billion in covert securities  they could not let the volume of capital shrink by that much in the time of a monetary crisis  They would have had to push excess liquidity into the market  and then phase it out for a soft landing  which is exactly what appears to have happened  In about two months  the money supply was back to where it was prior to 9 11  It was the rapid rotation of the securities settlement fails in the aftermath of September 11th that appears to have allowed the Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve to engage in a securities refinancing that resulted in the American taxpayer refinancing the  240 billion originally used for the Great Ruble Scam  The reports published by the Federal Reserve argue that the Federal Reserve s actions increasing the monetary supply by over  300 billion were justified to overcome operational difficulties in the financial sector  What appears to be the case is that the Federal Reserve imbalances reported on three consecutive days in the aftermath were largely concentrated at the Bank of New York  which is reported to represent over 90  of the imbalance  suggesting the Bank had been the recipient of massive fund transfers  and unable to send out transfers  This supposedly was due to major communication and system failures  In fact  none of the Bank of New York s systems failed or went non operational  The Bank of New York s suspicious actions after 9 11 were noted by The Wall Street Journal   There is every reason to believe activities in the Bank of New York in the aftermath of September 11th are worthy of suspicion    At one point during the week after September 11  the Bank of New York publicly reported to be overdue on  100 billion in payments    It is not a coincidence that the bank in question  the Bank of New York  was owned by Bruce Rappaport  the  familiar Swiss banker  in whose secret Swiss bank account the Iran Contra proceeds were deposited along with the  500 million Saudi Afghanistan fund skimmed by the Reagan White House The article in Veterans Today concludes   It suggests that certain key unknown figures in the Federal Reserve may have been in collusion with key unknown figures at the Bank of New York to create a situation where  240 billion in off balance sheet securities created in 1991 as part of an official covert operation to overthrow the Soviet Union  could be cleared without publicly acknowledging their existence  Bruce Rapport s Bank of New York along the Federal Reserve was at the very epicenter of the events behind 9 11  Once again  gold  money and power were at stake and the bankers provided sufficient cover for the guilty to make sure no one knew what had happened  and no one did at least not until the document that explained 9 11  Collateral Damage  appeared on the web ILLICIT POWER  ILLICIT GOLD The source material for the allegations in Veterans Today is a remarkable 58 page document  Collateral Damage  US Covert Operations and the Terrorist Attacks on September 11  2001 attributed to  EP Heidner    Heidner s document is a covert Rosetta Stone  shedding light on the hidden world of power and intrigue  where death and destruction are considered collateral damage  Collateral Damage not only confirms the role of gold as power  it reveals the pivotal role of Barrick Gold  the world s largest gold mining company  in the laundering of China s stolen gold  US Intelligence operations had been siphoning off the gold  China s stolen gold  for three decades  However in 1986 Vice President George Bush took over the gold from Marcos and the gold was removed to a series of banks  notably Citibank  Chase Manhattan  Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation  UBS and Banker s Trust  and held in a depository in Kloten  Switzerland  In 1992  George Bush served on the Advisory Board of Barrick Gold  The Barrick operation would create billions of dollars of paper gold by creating  gold derivatives   and would become an investment for nearly every gold bullion bank associated with the Marcos gold recovery  China s stolen gold   These banks would loan gold to Barrick  which would then sell the borrowed gold as derivatives  with the promise of replacing the borrowed gold with their gold mining operation  Barrick  which has no mining operations in Europe  used two refineries in Switzerland  MKS Finance S A  and Argor Heraeus S A    both on the Italian border near Milan  a few hours away from the gold depository in Zurich The question that Barrick and other banks needed to avoid answering is  what gold was Barrick refining in Switzerland  as they have no mines in that region  Barrick would become a quiet gold producing partner for a number of major banks  and its activities became subject to an FBI investigation into gold price fixing  The records on this investigation were kept in the FBI office on the 23rd floor of the North Tower which was destroyed by bomb blasts shortly before the Tower collapsed  p  11  Collateral Damage  US Covert Operations and the Terrorist Attacks on September 11  2001  EP Heidner  2008   Collateral Damage contains information that the media ignored  buried or denied  Today  societal control in America is maintained through the media  In the media  the American public the unknowing  unwitting and gullible read lies  half lies and half truths believing them to be fact  But to find the truth  especially where power s concerned  it s necessary to look hard  deep and elsewhere  Deep Black Lies  the website of former UK banker  David Guyatt is such a place where one can find the dark truths that belie the claims of legitimate power proffered on behalf of those who rule  Guyatt delves deeply into the dark machinations of power surrounding gold  money and power  and like Heidner s Collateral Damage  Guyatt s website  Deep Black Lies  provides answers to questions the powerful would wish to remain unasked and unanswered  The story of Howard Hughes  banker  Dr  Norman Bernard Thirion  is an example of such  It involved the Reagan White House embezzlement of funds solicited for the Afghanistan muhajadin  funds later discovered in a secret CIA Swiss bank account controlled by an Israeli Swiss banker  Bruce Rappaport  owner of the Bank of New York later involved in the financial machinations surrounding 9 11  According to Thirion  representatives of Transglobal Productions  ostensibly a New York movie production company  approached Thirion in 1983 to solicit funds from the Saudi royal family to support the Afghan resistance movement  The chairman of the alleged movie production company was General Robert E  Cushman ret   former Commandant of the US Marine Corp  former Deputy Director of the CIA and a member of the Reagan White House inner circle  Why was a former Commandant of the US Marines Corps approaching a private banker to solicit funds for the Afghan resistance  And why was Cushman  the former Deputy Director of the CIA  using the cover of a New York movie production company to do so  The story  told to me by Thirion  explains the covert front behind which members of the Reagan White House solicited  then embezzled  millions of dollars meant for the muhajadin  believing that as private citizens using a private company and a private banker to approach the Saudis  they could legally divert money from public funds where as public servants they could not Because of his close ties to the Saudi royal family  Norman Thirion successfully raised the  500 million  but none of the money was to reach the Afghan resistance and Thirion himself was to be cut out of the deal after he strongly objected to General Cushman s proposal to buy captured Soviet arms with Saudi money from Israel  When Thirion later told the Saudis what had happened  that General Cushman through Transglobal board member  Rabbi Morton Rosenthal  had bought Soviet arms from Israel captured after the Six Day War using Saudi money and then resold them at a profit to the Afghan resistance Thirion said the Reagan White House moved swiftly against him  Thirion was arrested in Switzerland one year later on trumped up charges of receiving illegal loan fees  then extradited to the US where he was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison  Thirion was convinced the Reagan White House was responsible for his arrest and imprisonment and immediately filed an appeal  When his appeal was denied  Thirion put his story in the hands of a third party and threatened to release the information unless the Reagan White House released him  and while Thirion s bid for freedom failed  I was  the third party  to whom Thirion had entrusted his story for safekeeping  I now had the details about covert corruption at the highest levels in the US government  I soon discovered  however  that the media had no interest in a story involving the White House  the CIA  Afghanistan  the Saudis and the embezzlement of millions of dollars by Reagan insiders  The media was interested in protecting power  not questioning it  Nonetheless  during the years that followed I couldn t forget what Thirion had told me and in 2004  I became curious about one of the participants  Dr  Nake Kamrany  a professor at the University of Southern California  Thirion had been introduced to Dr  Kamrany in 1983 as a means of contacting the former King of Afghanistan  Zahir Shah  then living in exile in Paris  under whose auspices the funds were to be raised  Thirion believed Professor Kamrany was a  true Afghan patriot  and did not believe Kamrany knew about the White House use of the Afghan cause to embezzle funds meant for the muhajadin  In June  2004 I contacted Professor Kamrany to find out what he knew about Thirion s story  Kamrany confirmed he knew Norman Thirion and had heard rumors about a  private venture  but strongly denied any knowledge of a White House skim  Professor Kamrany then asked why I was inquiring about events that had happened so long ago  When I told him I was doing research for a book  Kamrany unexpectedly asked me if I knew anyone in the movie business Kamrany s question would lead to us meeting in person  His son  a USC film school graduate  was looking to enter the film industry  and Rawson Marshall Thurber  the son of my close friend from law school  Marshall Thurber  had recently written and directed a soon to be mega million dollar hit movie  Dodgeball Marshall had arranged for a private pre premiere showing in Los Angeles and Martha and I were flying in for the event  Marshall extended our invitation to include Professor Kamrany s party and  after the movie  Professor Kamrany confirmed some of what I had been told two decades before by Norman Thirion Kamrany said he had seen Russian weapons in Afghanistan used by the muhajadin and wondered how they had come by them  These were the weapons responsible for General Cushman cutting Thirion out of the deal and  ultimately  for Thirion ending up in a US prison where those in power hoped his story about Republican corruption in the White House would be buried forever along with him  The story wasn t buried  at least not forever  I now had it  but like all stories that implicate the powerful  the media didn t want to tell it  MARSHALL THURBER S POSITIVE DEVIANT NETWORK AND NORMAN THIRION S STORY In 2005  Marshall Thurber created the Positive Deviant Network  the PDN  an experiment that would bring  positive deviants  together in a networks  and Marshall asked us Martha  my wife  and I to join  It had not published  Light in a Dark Place  We then published it and presented it to the PDN  The book was filled with stories  commentaries  poetry and spiritual observations written during my 10 year federal prison sentence on drug related charges  Norman Thirion s story was in the book as were the circumstances under which our unlikely paths had crossed in 1987  If no one else would tell Norman s story  I would  However  we did not promote Light in a Dark Place because a book I had never planned to write but did intervened  That year I wrote How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper in the Process  a book about the coming economic crisis  In March 2007  I presented that book to the PDN predicting a severe economic crisis was about to happen  and within months  my predictions began to come true  I began writing on economic issues and How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper in the Process was ordered by readers in 25 countries  My emergence as a writer on issues of money  banking and economics delayed my intent to reveal the story Thirion had told me  but there is another far more fundamental reason Norman Thirion s story hasn t been told in the media The real truth is Americans don t want to know the truth  Most Americans deny the truth to feel better about their country and what s been done in their name  Today  after the contrived emergency of 9 11 and the repeated disillusionments in its wake  perhaps Americans are now willing to consider that those who lead our nation  those entrusted with sending Americans into battle and making decisions that will affect the nation for generations to come have not been concerned about what s best for America as they have led us to believe but  instead  as Norman Thirion s story shows  they ve been concerned with what s best for themselves  THE BANKER S GRAVE  The victims of 9 11 are considered collateral damage by those who pursue gold  money and power to no other end  Howard Hughes  banker  Norman Thirion  was fortunate to have escaped with his life when he crossed the powerful elites who controlled the Reagan White House   Other bankers  e g  Roberto Calvi  Michele Sindona and Edmund Safra  were not so lucky  Roberto Calvi  former chairman of Banco Ambrosiano  was hung by the neck beneath Blackfriar s Bridge in London in 1982  Michele Sindona  former owner of Franklin National Bank  died after drinking coffee laced with arsenic in an Italian prison in 1986  and Edmond Safra  owner of Republic National Bank  burned to death barricaded and trapped in his heavily guarded penthouse in Monaco in 1999   Each banker knew the secrets of the powerful who ultimately determined their interests were best served with the three bankers dead  Calvi and Sindona were murdered after their banks collapsed but Safra s death was different  Safra died with his financial empire intact but  of the three  Safra s death was the most curious as the prosecution s explanation was both convoluted and unconvincing in the extreme   The commonly accepted and highly improbable version of Safra s death can be found at Wikipedia  where Safra s attorney alleged in court that Safra s killer  nurse and former Green Beret  Ted Maher     did indeed start the fire in order  but  to gain acceptance from Mr  Safra He did not intend to kill Mr  Safra  He just wanted Mr  Safra to appreciate him more  He loved Mr  Safra   A far more plausible explanation for Safra s fiery demise is found at The Institute for the Study of Globalization and Covert Politics  ISGP  website regarding the secretive 1001 Club of which Safra was a member   Edmond Safra  the late head of the New York based Republic National Bank  gave evidence to the FBI concerning the diversion  of a  4 8 billion IMF  stabilization credit  for Russian that never reached those for whom it was intended   Geneva prosecutor Bertrand Bertossa  maintains  Safra was murdered for giving evidence to both the FBI and Swiss prosecutors concerning the diversion of the IMF credit  the USD 4 8 billion credit went from the New York Federal Reserve Bank to  Safra s  Republic National Bank and then to various banks in Switzerland and elsewhere  but not to Russia   at the start of autumn 1999  Russian oligarch  Boris Berezovsky visited Safra at his estate in southern France  The two men   had a three hour conversation in  raised voices   after which Safra fled in a panic to his heavily fortified Monte Carlo residence  where two months later he was burned to death in his penthouse    One year before his death  Safra s Republic Bank had also provided information to the FBI on Russian money laundering activities at the Bank of New York  Bruce Rappaport s bank   The night Safra was killed  Safra s Israeli trained bodyguards were conveniently off duty  Dead bankers don t talk   THE 1001 CLUB  Edmond Safra was a member of The 1001 Club  a highly secretive organization founded by Prince Bernhard  the former president of the Bilderberg Group  The membership of The 1001 Club reads like a Who s Who of those on whose behalf the Bilderbergers toil   When I came across the 1001 Club s membership list  I looked for Bruce Rappaport s name  Though not a member  Rappaport was mentioned in relationship to 1001 Club member  Dr  Alfred Hartmann  Swiss gnome extraordinaire  former director of Rothschild banking group and former high ranking executive at the notoriously corrupt and infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce  BCCI   Dr  Hartmann s provenance makes Bruce Rappaport look like Mother Teresa  If Bruce Rappaport was a USB hub of covert criminality  illusory respectability and political sociopathy  Dr  Alfred Hartmann was an  ber hub  David Whitby and Alan A  Block in The Organized Criminal Activities of the Bank of Credit and Commerce  BCCI  refer to Dr  Hartmann as follows   6   footnote  Dr  Alfred Hartmann  director of Swiss Military Intelligence  former general manager of Union Bank of Switzerland and later chairman of Hoffman LaRoche  Hartmann resigned from La Roche following a price fixing scandal involving the European Community Main board director Rothschild family bank holding companies and general manager Rothschild A G  Zurich  Resigned after payments by  Rothschild A G  Zurich  to the alleged assassins of Roberto Calvi  Banco Ambrosiano    director of Intermaritime Bank  Bruce Rappaport   Royal Bank of Scotland  Switzerland   Hartmann was chairman of BCCI s audit committee  Luxembourg  but has never been investigated by the SFO  Serious Financial Office Switzerland  or the FBI   45   footnote  Gold played an integral part in BCCI s money  laundering operations  BCCI gold dealings for Colombian drug cartels were passed through BCP  Banque de Commerce et de Placement  in association with Rothschild A G  Zurich  Dr  Albert Hartmann    More on the activities of Dr  Hartmann is found at David Guyatt s Deep Black Lies website    Of more than passing interest in these matters is Dr  Alfred Hartmann  who had run the Banque de Commerce et de Placement  BCP   Geneva  for many years large sums of money earned by    market rigging activities were laundered through the BCP  Hartmann was also the Vice Chairman and General Manager of Rothschilds Bank A G  and the vice president of the CIA connected Inter Maritime Bank  Bruce Rappaport s bank   The BCP is also said to have played a part in the Iran Contra affair   This cannot come as any great surprise  for Hartmann was known as a long term CIA asset  His contact or  controller  was none other than Edwin Wilson  the CIA operative who we earlier learned specialized in gay and pedophile blackmail stings against political targets He is also known to have specialized in creating financial  fronts  for the CIA  Dr  Hartmann  meanwhile  would later become a senior executive in BCCI  the bank that provided a full service to drug lords  gun runners  terrorists  gangsters and the US and European intelligence community   The information on The 1001 Club and Edmond Safra came from the Institute for the Study of Globalization and Covert

Rappaport s golfing buddy   etc The ostensible purpose of The 1001 Club is to raise funds and support the World Wildlife Foundation  Whether The 1001 Club is a true service organization or the Rotary Club for the Dark Side is unknown   AMERICA  AMERICA WHAT HAS BECOME OF THEE The only difference between the killing of Trayvon Martin in Sanford  Florida and the US invasion of Iraq is scale  On February 26  2012 Trayvon Martin was no more armed and no more a threat to George Zimmerman than on March 19  2003 Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was a threat to the United States of America

121697,343212,NYT,Advancing Towards A World Without Jobs,opinion,This has been robot week  seemingly precipitated by a New York Times article   Rapid improvement in vision and touch technologies is putting a wide array of manual jobs within the abilities of robots    in many applications  robots are already more cost effective than humans  Mish jumped on board with adding more detail to the discussion  A large banner at Flextronics  FLEX  plant near San Francisco proudly proclaims  Bringing Jobs   Manufacturing Back to California   but the assembly line runs 24 hours a day  seven days a week with nearly all robots and few human workers  Automation and productivity improvements have been my concern to achieve full employment  Pundits continue to spout about weak or moderate jobs growth  but the population in the USA is not static  Comparing just the difference in the number of jobs in between various periods gives you a very misleading view of the overall jobs situation  The above graph comparing the ratio between employment and the population clearly show no real jobs growth  We inflation adjust GDP  calling it  Real  GDP   but ignore population adjusted employment  The above graph is  real  employment growth   or should we say  lack  of employment growth  Poor employment growth is blamed on the government  emerging economies  poor economic conditions     Could it be employment itself   manifesting with the elimination of jobs   is a major reason for poor economic growth  and not the other way around  After all  robots are not very good consumers  Historically  gains in technology have opened more employment opportunities than those eliminated  But if a jobs elimination machine is invented   then technology only eliminates jobs  This is a very serious issue for employment going forward  as I stated in another post this past week  In a 24 hour   seven day a week environment  the robot would be advantageous in any environment where the cost of labor exceeded  1 per hour  Robots hardly get sick  do not sue their employer  and will work in terrible   hazardous conditions  Robots literally are making the cost of manufacturing labor  1 per hour around the world  Fellow Econintersect Contributor Sig Silber  mused what would the effect of robots be  The robots do not need to be fed so people will not be food for the robots  What role would humans perform for robots that they would be unable to perform for themselves  Perhaps robots might find a zoo with humans in it entertaining Perhaps the robots would find fishing for humans amusing  Catch and release hopefully Some of Sig s random thoughts Will robots have prejudice against humans because of our inferior skills  Will humans revolt   maybe there will be anti robot laws Who will inform the robots of their share of the National Debt Will Obamacare speed up the replacement of workers with machines Half a century ago futurists predicted a world to come where automation would eliminate the need for humans to do many jobs  This was proclaimed to be a great thing for future generations  freeing them from drudgery tasks and enabling the growth of the human experience beyond the mundane experience of 9 5 jobs  Somewhere between that time and the present someone forgot to plan how these  liberated  people would get enough money to be able to afford to  grow the human experience   Things may not work out as well for people going forward  The estimates of population growth may also prove to be way overstated   if people are not valuable  maybe there will be less of them  In the meantime  robotic technology will relentlessly eliminate jobs  Other Economic News this Week  The Econintersect economic forecast for  shows continues to show moderate growth  Overall

121704,343219,NYT,The Student Loan Debt Bubble Is Creating Millions Of Modern Day Serfs,opinion,Every single year  millions of young adults head off to colleges and universities all over America full of hopes and dreams  But what most of those fresh faced youngsters do not realize is that by taking on student loan debt they are signing up for a life of debt slavery  Student loan debt has become  which has shattered the financial lives of tens of millions of young college graduates When you are just starting out and you are not making a lot of money  having to make payments on tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt can be absolutely crippling  The total amount of student loan debt in the United States has now surpassed the total amount of credit card debt  and student loan debt is much harder to get rid of  Many young people view college as a     but when the party is over millions of those young people basically end up as modern day serfs as they struggle to pay off all of the debt that they have accumulated during their party years  Bankruptcy laws have been changed to make it incredibly difficult to get rid of student loan debt  so once you have it you are basically faced with two choices  either you are going to pay it or you are going to die with it  But we don t warn kids about this before they go to school  We just endlessly preach to them that they need a college degree in order to get a  good job   and that after they graduate they will easily be able to pay off their student loans with the  good job  that they will certainly be able to find  Sadly  tens of millions of young Americans have left college in recent years only to find out that they were lied to all along  As I have written about   college has become a giant money making scam and the victims of the scam are our young people  Back in 1952  a full year of tuition at Harvard was only  600  Today  it is over  35 000  Why does college have to cost so much  At every turn our young people are being ripped off  For example  the cost of college textbooks  over the past decade  Has it suddenly become a lot more expensive to print books  Of course not  The truth is that an entire industry saw an opportunity to gouge students and they went for it  The amount of money being spent on higher education in this country is absolutely outrageous  One father down in Texas says that he will end up spending about  on college expenses for his five daughters before it is all said and done  Unfortunately  most young adults in America don t have wealthy fathers so they have to take out large student loans to pay for their educations  Average student loan debt at graduation is estimated to be about  right now  That is a crazy figure and it has absolutely soared in recent years  In fact  student loan debt in America has grown  since 1999  And student loan debt will follow you wherever you go  If you do not pay your loans when you graduate  you could end up having your wages  your tax refunds and even your Social Security benefits garnished  In addition  your account could be turned over to the debt collectors and they can be absolutely brutal  The student loan debt bubble is the best thing to happen to debt collectors in ages  The following is what one professional who works in the industry said in a recent article that he wrote      As I wandered around the crowd of NYU students at their rally protesting student debt at the end of February  I couldn t believe the accumulated wealth they represented   for our industry  It was lip smacking  At my right  to graphically display how she was debt burdened  was a girl wearing a t shirt emblazoned with the fine sum of  90 000  another with  65 000  a third with  20 000 and over there a really attractive  120 000 was printed on another shirt  Guys were shouldering their share  with t shirts of  20 000   15 000   27 000   33 000 and  75 000  There is no way that our young people can afford to take on those kinds of debt loads  and that is one reason why student loan delinquency rates   In fact  the student loan default rate in the United States  since 2005  Today   Americans that owes money on a student loan is in default  One out of every six  And it is going to get a whole lot worse  At this point there are about  Americans that are at least 12 months behind on their student loan payments  So could the bursting of the student loan bubble do tremendous damage to our financial system  Don t worry   Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  that the student loan debt bubble won t cause a crisis  And you can trust him  right  For those living with the burden of unpaid student loan debt  life can be really tough  Some try to avoid the debt collectors  but it is easier said than done  The following is from a recent article      Hiding from the government is not easy   I keep changing my phone number   said Amanda Cordeiro  29  from Clermont  Fla   who dropped out of college in 2010 and has fielded as many as seven calls a day from debt collectors trying to recover her  55 000 in overdue loans   In a year  this is probably my fourth phone number   Unlike private lenders  the federal government has extraordinary tools for collection that it has extended to the collection firms  Ms  Cordeiro has already had two tax refunds seized  and other debtors have had their paychecks or Social Security payments garnisheed  The biggest problem  of course  is that there are not nearly enough jobs for the hordes of college graduates that our system produces each year  During 2011   of all Americans with a bachelor s degree under the age of 25 were either unemployed or underemployed  So without a good job  how are those young people supposed to service their student loans  Once upon a time  a college degree was a guaranteed ticket to   Sadly  those days are long gone  Today  millions upon millions of college graduates have taken jobs that do not even require a college education  The following is from      In the last year  they were more likely to be employed as waiters  waitresses  bartenders and food service helpers than as engineers  physicists  chemists and mathematicians combined  100 000 versus 90 000   There were more working in office related jobs such as receptionist or payroll clerk than in all computer professional jobs  163 000 versus 100 000   More also were employed as cashiers  retail clerks and customer representatives than engineers  125 000 versus 80 000     You probably know young people who have experienced the  wake up call  that comes as a result of entering the  real world  in this horrible economic environment  It is not easy out there  And this can be extremely disappointing for parents as well  How would you feel if your daughter got very high grades all of the way through college and ended up working as a waitress because she couldn t find anything else  Even those that pursue advanced degrees are having an extremely challenging time finding work in this economy  For example  a  from a while back profiled a law school graduate named Erin that is actually on food stamps     She remains on food stamps so her social life suffers  She can t afford a car  so she has to rely on the bus to get around Austin  Texas  where she lives  And currently unable to pay back her growing pile of law school debt  Gilmer says she wonders if she will ever be able to pay it back    That has been really hard for me   she says   I have absolutely no credit anymore  I haven t been able to pay loans  It s scary  and it s a hard thing to think you re a lawyer but you re impoverished  People don t understand that most lawyers actually aren t making the big money   And the really sad thing is that the quality of the education that our young people are receiving is very poor  I spent eight years attending U S  universities  and most parents would be absolutely shocked at how little our college students are actually learning  Going to college really has become a ticket to party for four or five or six years with a little bit of  education  thrown in  But our society has put a very high value on those little pieces of paper called  diplomas  so we all continue to play along with the charade  Some college students are finding other  creative  ways to pay for their educations other than going into tremendous amounts of debt  For example  an increasing number of young women are seeking out  sugar daddies  who will  sponsor  their educations  The following is from a  about this disturbing trend     On a Sunday morning in late May  Taylor left her Harlem apartment and boarded a train for Greenwich  Conn  She planned on spending the day with a man she had met online  but not in person  Taylor  a 22 year old student at Hunter College  had confided in her roommate about the trip and they agreed to swap text messages during the day to make sure she was safe  Once in Greenwich  a man who appeared significantly older than his advertised age of 42 greeted Taylor at the train station and then drove her to the largest house she had ever seen  He changed into his swimming trunks  she put on a skimpy bathing suit  and then  by the side of his pool  she rubbed sunscreen into the folds of his sagging back    bracing herself to endure an afternoon of sex with someone she suspected was actually about 30 years her senior  Of course that young woman will probably deeply regret doing that later on in her life  Once graduation comes  millions upon millions of our young people are discovering that it is really hard to be financially independent if you are drowning in student loan debt and you can t find a good job  So what are they doing  They are moving back in with Mom and Dad  One poll discovered that  of all Americans in the 25 to 34 year old age bracket are still living with their parents  Ouch ,2012-09-11,Michael T.

121736,343251,NYT,The Problem Isn t Outsourcing,opinion,The Problem Isn t Outsourcing  It s that the Prosperity of Big Business Has Become Disconnected from the Well Being of Most AmericansPresident Obama is slamming Mitt Romney for heading companies that were  pioneers in outsourcing U S  jobs   while Romney is accusing Obama of being  the real outsourcer in chief  These are the dog days of summer and the silly season of presidential campaigns  But can we get real  please The American economy has moved way beyond outsourcing abroad or even  in sourcing   Most big companies headquartered in America don t send jobs overseas and don t bring jobs here from abroad That s because most are no longer really  American  companies  They ve become global networks that design  make  buy  and sell things wherever around the world it s most profitable for them to do so As an Apple executive told the    we don t have an obligation to solve America s problems  Our only obligation is making the best product possible   He might have added  and showing profits big enough to continually increase our share price  Forget the debate over outsourcing  The real question is how to make Americans so competitive that all global companies   whether or not headquartered in the United States   will create good jobs in America  Apple employs 43 000 people in the United States but contracts with over 700 000 workers overseas  It assembles iPhones in China both because wages are low there and because Apple s Chinese contractors can quickly mobilize workers from company dorms at almost any hour of the day or night  But low wages aren t the major force driving Apple or any other American based corporate network abroad  The components Apple s Chinese contractors assemble come from many places around the world with wages as high if not higher than in the United States  More than a third of  ends up in Japan  because that s where some of its most advanced components are made  Seventeen percent goes to Germany  whose precision manufacturers pay wages higher than those paid to American manufacturing workers  on average  because German workers are more highly skilled  Thirteen percent comes from South Korea  whose median wage isn t far from our own  Workers in the United States get only about 6 percent of what you pay for an iPhone  It goes to American designers  lawyers  and financiers  as well as Apple s top executives  American based companies are also doing more of their research and development abroad  The share of R D spending going to the foreign subsidiaries of American based companies rose from 9 percent in 1989 to almost 16 percent in 2009  according to the  What s going on  Put simply  America isn t educating enough of our people well enough to get American based companies to do more of their high value added work here Our K 12 school system isn t nearly up to what it should be  American students continue to do poorly in math and science relative to students in other advanced countries  Japan  Germany  South Korea  Canada  Australia  Ireland  Sweden  and France all top us American universities continue to rank high but many are being starved of government funds and are having trouble keeping up  More and more young Americans and their families can t afford a college education  China  by contrast  is investing like mad in world class universities and research centers Transportation and communication systems abroad are also becoming better and more reliable  In case you hadn t noticed  American roads are congested  our bridges are in disrepair  and our ports are becoming outmoded So forget the debate over outsourcing  The way we get good jobs back is with a national strategy to make Americans more competitive   retooling our schools  getting more of our young people through college or giving them a first class technical education  remaking our infrastructure  and thereby guaranteeing a large share of Americans add significant value to the global economy But big American based companies aren t pushing this agenda  despite their huge clout in Washington  They don t care about making Americans more competitive  They say they have no obligation to solve America s problems They want lower corporate taxes  lower taxes for their executives  fewer regulations  and less public spending  And to achieve these goals they maintain legions of lobbyists and are pouring boatloads of money into political campaigns  The Supreme Court even says they re  people  under the First Amendment  and can contribute as much as they want to political campaigns   even in secret The core problem isn t outsourcing  It s that the prosperity of America s big businesses   which are really global networks that happen to be headquartered here   has become disconnected from the well being of most Americans Mitt Romney s Bain Capital is no different from any other global corporation   which is exactly why Romney s so called  business experience  is irrelevant to the real problems facing most Americans Without a government that s focused on more and better jobs  we re left with global corporations that don t give a damn ,2012-07-19,Robert B.

121738,343253,NYT,The Terrible Economy And The Anti Election Of 2012,opinion,The worst economy since the Great Depression and you might think at least one of the candidates would come up with a few big ideas for how to get us out of it But you d be wrong  Neither candidate wants to take any chances by offering any large  serious proposals  Both are banking instead on negative campaigns that convince voters the other guy would be worse President Obama has apparently decided against advancing any bold ideas for what he d do in the second term  even if he has a Congress that would cooperate with him  He s sticking to a worn script that says George W  Bush caused the lousy economy  congressional Republicans have opposed everything he s wanted to do to boost it  it s slowly on the mend anyway  the Bush tax cuts shouldn t be extended for the rich  and we shouldn t take a chance electing Romney Yet the public wants bigger ideas from the President  and wants to know what he ll do in his second term to get us out of this mess  A New York Times CBS News poll released last week showed that a majority of voters believe the president  can do a lot about  the economy  That s a double digit jump from the fall of 2011 The President could propose a new WPA  modeled after the Depression era jobs program that hired hundreds of thousands of jobless Americans to rebuild the nation s infrastructure  or a new Civilian Conservation Corps  He could suggest permanently exempting the first  25 000 of income from payroll taxes  and making up the lost revenues by eliminating the ceiling on income subject to it  He could propose resurrecting the Glass Steagall Act and breaking up the big banks  so Wall Street doesn t cause another financial collapse But you won t hear any of this  or anything else of this magnitude  because the White House doesn t want to take any risks  Polls give Obama a slight edge in the critical eight or so battleground states  so  the thinking goes in the Obama camp  why say anything that might give Romney and the GOP a target  Besides  polls also show Romney isn t well liked by the electorate So Obama has decided to campaign as the anti Romney Mitt Romney is playing it even more cautiously  His economic plan is really a non plan  more tax cuts for the rich  undefined spending cuts  and no details about how he d bring down the budget deficit  No presidential candidate since Herbert Hoover in 1928 has been more vague about what he d do on the critical issues facing the nation Romney s advisors assume Obama can t possibly be reelected with the economy this bad  Just 44 percent of registered voters in a Washington Post ABC News poll earlier this month approve of the job the president is doing on the economy  while 54 percent disapprove  Even more encouraging for Romney is that 41 percent of those polled  strongly  disapproved of Obama s economic performance  while just 21 percent  strongly  approved   an enthusiasm gap of major proportion So Romney s advisors have concluded that all Romney has to do between now and Election Day is avoid a mistake that might give Obama and the Democrats something to shoot at Romney has decided to campaign as the anti Obama The two anti the other guy strategies fit with a ton of negative advertising that s just begun but will reach mammoth proportions after Labor Day  Much of it will be financed by super PACs and by political fronts already taking in hundreds of millions of dollars in secret donations  Romney s camp hopes to out negative Obama by almost two to one So whatever happens on Election Day  the next president will have to contend with two handicaps  The public won t have endorsed any new ideas or bold plans  which means he won t have a clear mandate to do anything on the economy The only thing the public will have decided is it fears and distrusts the other guy more  Which means the winner will also be burdened by almost half the electorate thinking he s a scoundrel or worse  The worst economy since the Great Depression  but we re in an anti election that will make it harder for the next occupant of the oval office to do a thing about it ,2012-07-30,Robert B.

121739,343254,NYT,The Race For Resources,opinion,The world watched in awe as American swimmer Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympian of all time  I ve read he s been training in the pool for an average of 6 hours a day  6 days per week  which equates to about 30 000 hours since age 13 and about 10 000 calories burned during a training day  It s inspiring to see the incredible results of his tremendous sacrifice and commitment Investing in global markets requires the same sort of stamina  especially at times like this week  when the month s reading on the manufacturing industry was not encouraging  The J P  Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI of 48 4 for July was the lowest since June 2009 However  I believe there are encouraging pockets of strength to energize and inspire investors For example  we re coming up on the anniversary of the first stimulus move that kicked off the global easing cycle  On August 31  2011  Brazil unexpectedly cut rates by 50 basis points  and since then  ISI says 228 stimulative monetary and fiscal policy moves have been initiated across several countries  including the Philippines  China  France  and Colombia In June and July alone  there were nearly 70 moves the most since the world began this massive easing Generally  by the time central banks make a fiscal or monetary easing move  economic deterioration has already occurred  Even with these moves  it still takes several months for the stimulative measures to take effect and work their way through But while the world wades in the shallow end of the pool waiting for the economy to warm up  Asia has taken a deep dive into the energy space as they ve recently announced acquisitions of Canadian resources companies In my presentations  I ve discussed how resources companies have significantly underperformed their underlying commodities  During 2009 and most of 2010  the performance between oil and the S P 500 Oil   Gas Exploration and Production Index was closely correlated  By the middle of 2011  oil and oil stocks started to separate  with crude continuing to rise while stocks deteriorated  Even with the recent drop in oil prices  oil stocks have continued to lag I ve also discussed the strikingly similar trend occurring between gold and gold stocks  There s been a spectacular pop in gold stocks recently  but it hasn t been enough to catch up to gold s performance The disparities mean that the cheapest resources are not found in the ground they re listed  and it s been confirmed by recent energy company acquisitions Chinese oil company CNOOC put in a bid of  15 billion to purchase Canada s Nexen  This was at a 61 percent premium to Nexen s share price on July 20  according to Bloomberg  As you can see below  not only did the takeout announcement close the gap  now the company is outperforming the price of oil If CNOOC s deal is approved  the state run oil giant gets even bigger  gaining access to significant energy stores in several areas of the world  including Canada  the Gulf of Mexico  Colombia and West Africa  as shown below With a rapidly growing middle class and rising urbanization  Chinese leaders know they need to fill their country s tremendous energy demands and are continually finding innovative ways to keep their country powered  CNOOC s acquisition is one way China continues to acquire not only the resources needed to power the country  but also the technological innovations that come from countries with free markets and lower barriers to entry  According to The New York Times  China  has been garnering advanced production technologies to better draw oil and gas from nontraditional areas like deepwater fields and hardened rock formations  The other announcement came from Malaysia s state owned and natural gas giant Petronas  which will purchase Canada s Progress Energy Resources Corp  Petronas is one of the largest producers and shippers of supercooled LNG fuel in the world  According to the Vancouver Sun  the company is  anxious to increase its market share in Asia  where analysts expect demand to surge 75 percent by the end of the decade  After Petronas  original bid was announced  Progress increased 74 percent a record gain for the company  says Bloomberg  As shown below  Progress now dramatically outperforms the underlying commodity Ready To Be A Buyer Like Asia If you re contrarian investor  there may be an additional reason to jump into the market today  According to research from J P  Morgan  institutional investors have become extremely negative  as hedge funds  essentially short the market   meaning that their expectation is that stocks will fall  J P  Morgan looked at the rolling 21 day beta of macro fund returns compared to the S P 500 Index returns and found that the ratio is at an extreme level of  0 26  Research shows that the last two times the ratio fell this low in September 2010 and February 2012 stocks rallied  In 2010  the S P 500 climbed 26 percent in five months  in 2012  stocks rose 8 percent in two months  These signs the market is sending out make it an especially attractive time to  mine  for investment opportunity  In July  we began to see energy stocks and oil get recharged  as the energy sector in the S P 500 was the second best performer  increasing 4 17 percent and crude oil rose 3 68 percent  Unlike the start of an Olympic race  in investing

121740,343255,NYT,Where Wealth Thrives And Innovates,opinion,A surprising wealth of information about the world s most prosperous people can be discovered in two new reports  The Chinese Millionaire Wealth Report 2012  put together by GroupM and the Hurun Report  found that there are now a million millionaires in China  On average  a Chinese millionaire is 39 years old  has an average of four luxury watches  vacations in France  and owns a business  found that there are 18 000 centa millionaires  those with  100 million in disposable assets  in Southeast Asia  China and Japan more than those in North America  17 000  and in Western Europe  14 000   And most of the wealthy with  10 million or more are business owners  And over the next five years  wealth is set to rise rapidly across the Asian continent  KPMG estimates that centa millionaires may increase by 114 percent in India  76 percent in Russia and 65 percent in Hong Kong  This compares to a slower rise in wealth in the U S   at 23 percent We believe it s important to follow where wealth is being created and where these successful people reside  travel and do business  I believe these trends reveal subtle clues about how well money is treated around the world  especially from governments  Do countries pursue capitalist policies to encourage these wealthy people to stay  create businesses and grow jobs  Or do governments put in place socialistic policies that restrict innovation or push wealthy individuals to take their money elsewhere There are many reasons 50 000 Germans live in Silicon Valley  and 500 startups in the San Francisco Bay area have French founders  says The Economist  In the U S   the land of meritocracy and opportunity  businesses not only have the  freedom to fail  and plenty of funding for entrepreneurs  they also don t have the level of bureaucracy like you see in France For example   the cost of paying out large severance packages  six months of severance pay is typical even for very recent hires  can be a huge drain for a small company   says the magazine  European startups also find it difficult to offer stock options and free shares because of the  legal complexity of giving new hires free shares is prohibitive   There are so many limits in countries across Europe that there s a  dearth of the sort of entrepreneurial successes which would serve to inspire others  very few people think that going to work for a loony in a garage offers a long shot at millionairedom  In other words  companies such as Apple  FedEx  Walmart  Starbucks and McDonald s aren t as likely to be created in Europe the barriers to entry are too high In The Wealth Report  Mr  Buiter believes there will continue to be a greater leaning toward socialistic tendencies  He says   Government may use more taxation instruments and globally there may be a further attack on tax havens  Recent governmental and intergovernmental activity in these areas is not a passing phase   The latest example making headlines these days is the proposed 75 percent tax increase on the wealthiest people in France in order to  pay for one of Europe s most generous social welfare systems and a large government   This tax increase is causing many individuals and businesses to consider relocating   indicated that  many companies are studying contingency plans to move high paid executives outside of France   Start ups those businesses that are especially sensitive to any added cost to business are also said to be delaying plans of investing in the country  says The Times If this proposed tax rate is approved  it would put France on top for having the highest individual income tax margin  surpassing Sweden  Japan and Britain  all with tax margins of 50 percent or more How does this affect global investors and hard working Americans  I believe that when governments pursue overly stringent policies that discourage profitability and innovation  wealth leaves  And with the money goes the capital to create jobs and improve conditions for all Disclaimer and Disclosure  All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice  Some of these opinions may not be appropriate to every investor  By clicking the links above  you will be directed to third party websites  U S  Global Investors does not endorse all information supplied by these websites and is not responsible for their content  The following securities mentioned were held by one or more of U S  Global Investors Funds as of 6 30 12  Apple Inc  Google Inc  Starbucks  Wal Mart ,2012-08-13,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/where-wealth-thrives-and-innovates-132709,132709
121742,343257,NYT,Choice Of Ryan As VP Puts Tax Reform Back On The Table,opinion,I am thrilled by Mitt Romney s selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate  I say that not because of its effect on the outcome of the election  which has yet to play out  but because it puts tax reform squarely back on the table  Fixing the tax code is a two part process that simultaneously lowers tax rates and broadens the base by closing loopholes  Those elements of reform are essential whether they are implemented in a way that increases revenue or are revenue neutral  Ryan has been very clear about the first element  He advocates a two bracket personal income tax with 10 and 25 percent rates  He is not so clear about the second  In principle  he also endorses broadening the base  but he has refused to specify just which deductions  exclusions and preferences will have to go  As long as he was just Congressman Ryan  head of the Budget Committee  he had a convenient alibi for his reluctance to be specific  As he told  back in March   That s what the Ways and Means Committee is supposed to do  That s not the job of the Budget Committee   It was the old Wernher von Braun defense  In the words of Tom Lehrer s song   Once the rockets are up  who cares where they come down  That s not my department  says Wernher von Braun   As vice presidential candidate  Ryan will find it harder to use that dodge  The presidential team is supposed to lead  not sit back and wait for Congress to make back room deals  If an interviewer or debate opponent asks just which tax breaks should go  there is no place for Ryan to hide  nor is there any place for Romney to hide  since he is the one who put tax reform back on the table by choosing the Wisconsin Congressman  That brings us to Romney s own tax situation  Things would be easier for the GOP team if his failure to release more returns indicated nothing more than a   but that is not all that is at stake  As I argued   Romney s taxes highlight what is wrong with the whole system  especially the perverse way that high corporate tax rates interact with low personal rates on capital income  Candidate Ryan is going to face frequent  pointed questions about his often stated views on tax reform  How is he going to answer  I see three possibilities  1   Don t be frightened off by my rhetoric  We aren t really serious about tax reform  we ll be happy just to keep rates low for top earners and leave the rest of the system as it is   2   I was serious when I told  that  The tax code is patently unfair  many of the deductions and preferences in the system   which serve to narrow the tax base   were lobbied for and are mainly used by a relatively small group of mostly higher income individuals   I stick by what I have said  the wealthiest Americans should pay an effective tax rate of around 25 percent  and that starts with my running mate   3   As a team  we re serious about the concept of tax reform  but we re going to let Congress fill in the details  If you re among the 16 percent of Americans who think Congress has been doing a good job  vote Romney Ryan   Somehow  all of these answers seem awkward  but Paul Ryan is a smart guy  Maybe he ll think of something better ,2012-08-14,Ed Dolan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/choice-of-ryan-as-vp-puts-tax-reform-back-on-the-table-132862,132862
121743,343258,NYT,Post Olympic Recession Depression,opinion,Yesterday the London 2012 Olympics ended with a spectacular finish  leaving the UK proud to have pulled off such a historical event  Across the globe the world s media have sung our praises on the success of such a great 16 days The London Olympics was just one of a handful of events which the UK  particularly London  has been preparing for  for a good while now  Its completion signifies what I suspect will be a speedy fall back to earth for British citizens who have had party after party to look forward to for many years The country has been in full Union Jack waving mode for over a year  with everyone looking forward to the next street party or day off First we had the Royal Wedding in April 2011  this was announced late 2010 so the country had been in wedding frenzy from that point  We then had the Diamond Jubilee in May which has been an excuse for major Royal Family tours and events since the beginning of the year and into late 2012 Then of course came the London 2012 Olympics  a phenomenal effort and impressive show which took years of planning  months of  the sky will fall on your heads  warnings from Boris Johnson  literally weeks  worth of moans from the majority of London s City workers and just days of learning how to renegotiate the  efficient  Olympic lanes put in place  But we have enjoyed it and embraced it  I even heard an Australian tourist comment on how much friendlier Londoners seemed compared to his last visit 20 years ago That s how happy we all are  Even Londoners are being nice to tourists What comes after the Olympics David Segal of the New York Times wrote   The Games have hit this country like an extra strength dose of a mood enhancing drug  The question being asked here now is whether this national euphoria can last or  better yet  lead the country out of its recent economically driven malaise  One Guardian writer wrote the Games will  mark the end of Britain s age of decline  Mark the end of our age of decline  Will this optimism and party atmosphere really last so long as to get us out of this economic mess I suspect not  after the party comes the hangover  Not only do our problems  which we decided to put to one side during the party  remain but they re now much bigger  demanding our attention and that massive hangover we have won t help us to deal with them I suspect the majority of British citizens know things are bad  but when the first 12 pages of every newspaper is full of Wedding Jubilee Olympics news  with each image showing some form of Olympic triumph it s difficult not to believe that this will all just blow over Sir Mervyn King warned us over the weekend that  the games cannot alter the underlying economic situation we face    Whilst our confidence grew the closer we got to the Games  it certainly remained unchanged when it came to the belief in the government fixing the economy  Since June 2011 our confidence in the government has dropped dramatically This decline is most likely thanks to concerns over household finances  pensions and employment worries  Unemployment stands at 8 1   whilst it is likely to stay this way for the rest of the year  analysts fear that once employers realise the recovery will not come as speedily as they hope  this number will increase significantly Other depressing data which shows we are do not deserve a gold medal for our economic aptitude includes the UK trade balance which is at its lowest since 1997  in the last quarter construction shrank 5 2pc   the largest drop since the first quarter of 2009  Services output contracted 0 1pc Savers  the bedrock of our economy  the sensible ones to whom we all should have listened during the boom are those who have been hit the hardest  In 2007 the average savings rate across all products in the UK was 4 12   today it stands at just 1 09   seeing a fall in gross annual returns to savers fall to  7 9bn from  29 8bnMeanwhile the Bank of England has admitted that perhaps their only solution  to implement QE  might not have worked so well  In the nine months to June   125billion of QE led to a money supply increase of only  30bn Looking like JapanThe central bank s response and the economy s recovery have prompted parallel s to be drawn with Japan  There  the central bank also expanded the balance sheet with fear of deflation  yet this failed to increase the money supply or have any desired effects at all  In the UK  10 year gilt yields are now at a historic low of 1 5  and show no signs of recovery  this may be for similar reasons to Japan where their own 10 year yields have also been knocking around 2  since their crash Fear of Japanese stagflation is prompting investors to call for further QE from the BoE  reasons given is that Japan implemented QE too early  so therefore we should carry on printing  Scary stuff and will no likely lead to greater problems if the BoE heeds this advice One thing Japan didn t have was the Eurozone as its largest trading partner  Represented by 17 totally dissimilar economies  the single currency area becomes more fractured and desperate each day  The ECB last week issued stark warnings of the health of Eurozone  for the UK Q2 trade with the single currency area is down 9 9  on last year We can do very little to improve the Eurozone crisis  there are enough problems of our own  however it may be worth heeding Nomura s research which suggested we may look to leaving the EU as we attempt to save our skin  Passing the baton  The handing over of the Olympic flag from London to Rio de Janeiro was symbolic but not just for the Olympics  It was almost the handing over of economic doom from the UK to Brazil   In March this year  Brazil overtook the UK as the world s sixth largest economy  Whilst the UK only grew by 0 8  in 2011  the largest South American country grew by 2 7   Brazil has seen the biggest growth in the middle classes  showing their promotion from  developing to developed   Yet in recent months economic reports from Brazil show that whilst there has been a slowdown in the  supercharged credit growth  which was causing some concern   The economy is not expected to maintain its success over the next two decades and will struggle to keep up with the other BRIC nations  Industrial production only grew by 0 2  last quarter  far less than expected   Piecemeal  stimulus measures have been taken by the government but little growth has been seen as a result   From Japan to Brazil  via the Eurozone the world is in economic turmoil  Why some think our comparatively tiny island would suddenly recover thanks to a two week long sports day  I do not know  People power  As we have said before on these pages  the economy s future will remain bleak for some time  Perhaps we should be following in Team GB s steps and go for gold  The gold price has climbed recently and gold bullion investment has seen an increase in interest  Perhaps it s our Olympic success which has driven this  or maybe the downturn is turning everyone towards the safe haven   What really made the Olympics  Yes  the venues are impressive  yes we saw the most amazing sporting achievements ever  but that wasn t what everyone s talking about  What everyone has praised  unfailingly  was the hard work and enthusiasm of the 70 000 volunteers  The Olympics came down to people power   So whilst we might not have any money left  our leaders may be completely delusional and our central bank clueless  we know that we have an aptitude for pulling together when the world doubts our abilities  Let s hope that this can ring true in the financial crisis  we won t be able to fix it  bypass it or speed through it  but we can show the world that we know how to put on a brave face and get through it ,2012-08-14,Jan Skoyles,https://www.investing.com/analysis/post-olympic-recession-depression-132889,132889
121770,343285,NYT,The Fed s Evolving Yield Curve,opinion,On Wednesday the Federal Reserve released their third set of detailed interest rate forecasts this year  Following Ben Bernanke s philosophy of open communication  the FOMC publishes forecasts for short term rates from each voting member  While they don t link a name with each number  you can see what members expect short term rates will be at the end of this year  2013  2014 and over the long run  whose start is not defined  In effect you can construct a crude yield curve incorporating their collective outlook  Comparing their yield curve with the market is fascinating  although market yields and implied rate forecasts have been steadily diverging from those issued by the Fed  In fact  the Fed s own forecast has been remarkably stable even while ten year treasury yields have traversed a 1  range reaching 2 5  before falling recently to 1 5   The chart below is derived from the average of all FOMC member s rate forecasts at year end  So there s a clear discrepancy between the Fed s statement that short term rates will remain low through the end of 2014 and the six FOMC members who expect rates to be higher  three of whom target hikes as soon as next year   At the same time that the Fed extended Operation Twist to the end of this year  they reaffirmed that the long run equilibrium short term rate is around 4   Long term bonds continue to trade at yields that defy that forecast  The Long Run is still some ways off  but today s bond buyers are fairly warned There is growing evidence that the  Fiscal Cliff   looming in January 2013  will take a toll on the economy before its arrival  Although reports suggest that both parties are discussing a resolution to the sudden tax hikes and spending cuts that will take place under current law on January 1st next year  there s little tangible evidence of such  There is growing evidence that companies are managing their businesses by incorporating this uncertainty into today s spending decisions  It occurs to me that  while most economic forecasts project a substantial  3    GDP hit in 1Q13 IF no action is taken  few have considered that waiting until December s lame duck session of Congress to do the inevitable is quite likely to depress growth in the meantime  The non partisan view surely blames both sides for placing the purity of their own political beliefs ahead of the pragmatism of removing at least one element of uncertainty The comments from many Congressmen that the planned tax hikes and spending cuts will assuredly be rolled back would be more credible if they didn t insist on waiting until the last possible moment do do so For our part  we remain generally fully invested across our strategies  Owning steady  dividend paying stocks combined with a beta neutral hedge provides an uncorrelated source of return while markets are being buffeted around  Our most recent decisions have been to exit the last remaining shares of Family Dollar  FDO  which no longer provides compelling value given its recent increase in price  We have added modestly to Coeur d Alene  CDE  which recently announced a share buyback given the large discount of its stock price to the estimated net asset value of its gold and silver reserves We have largely exited the short Euro position which has been held in our Fixed Income strategy as useful protection for the holdings of bank debt  given their equity sensitivity   It worked well for quite a while  but a few weeks ago I heard a reporter from the New York Times confidently announce on a radio interview that the Euro was going down and Greece would soon exit  Short Euro is probably too widely held  and isn t that interesting any more Disclosure  Author is Long CDE,2012-06-24,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fed’s-evolving-yield-curve-127428,127428

121772,343287,NYT,Are Market Expectations Too Low ,opinion,The market expectations going into the European summit last week was extremely low  When the leaders of Europe announced the usual plan to have a plan  the markets surged  Despite the weekend s chorus of how the devil is in the details of the plan and why the plan won t work  European stock markets continued to rise on Monday  This begs the question  Are market expectations too low  As I wrote last week   The Chinese hard landing story Consider the case of how the market is reacting out the story on China and the possibility of a hard landing  On the weekend  Barron s published a cover story called   summarized by the subtitle  The Chinese economy is slowing and is likely to slow a lot more  Get ready for a hard landing    China  the article says  is an accident waiting to happen  The points made aren t anything new for those of us who have been watching China for a while  After three decades of annual growth averaging 10   China s bullet train economy is slowing markedly  Economic problems in Europe and the U S  are stunting export growth  long the primary driver of China s economic miracle  Growth in industrial production has likewise been decelerating for months  This year growth in gross domestic product could slip to 8  and it may get a lot worse from there  Though recently announced interest rate cuts and a ramp up in the government s already massive infrastructure spending could postpone the day of reckoning  to us it looks like the Great China Growth Story may be falling apart  For those without a Barron s subscription  Josh Brown has a good summary of the article    Overnight Sunday  both China s official PMI fell to 50 2 from 50 4 and the HSBC manufacturing PMI fell to 48 2  indicating weakness   What did the market do in the face of all these negative stories  The Shanghai Composite ended up flat on the day Monday and rose on Tuesday  In my last post  see Can China hold things together    I pointed out a number of extreme risks that are not outlined in the Barron s article  but current market conditions indicate few signs of financial stress Is the US slowing  As the sun rose on Monday across the globe  individual country PMIs were reported and the reports were generally punk  Contraction  rather than expansion  was the word of the day  As the US market opened yesterday  the Markit US PMI came in weaker than expected and ISM missed with a 49 7 reading  compared to market expectations of 52 0  Ed Yardeni has a  summarizing the broad nature of the slowdown  He cites initial unemployment claims  durable goods orders  regional business surveys  consumer sentiment and consumer spending as sources of economic weakness   Treasuries rallied hard on the news of economic weakness  but stocks ended the day flat  On the other hand  housing is showing signs of a rebound  The  reported last week  Announcements of a housing recovery have become a wrongheaded rite of summer  but after several years of false hopes  evidence is accumulating that the optimists may finally be right  The housing market is starting to recover  Prices are rising  Sales are increasing  Home builders are clearing lots and raising frames   also pointed out that the number of cities with increasing prices were on the rise What s going on  Is the American economy tanking or recovering

121773,343288,NYT,What Is Financial Reform In China ,opinion,Premier Wen s recent attack on the Chinese banking system last month has highlighted what was already a very interesting debate on Chinese banks and the Chinese financial system  There is a growing sense that the Chinese banking system is deeply flawed and needs to be reformed But why should China reform its banking   hasn t the financial system been a key component of China s economic success in the past three decades   Just as importantly  what does financial reform mean   what kind of changes would need to be implemented for a real reform to have occurred Before addressing these questions we should be clear that there is no meaningful difference between China s banking system and its financial system  Commercial banks dominate the country s financial system and they largely determine pricing even in the informal banking system and in non bank financial institutions  It also seems pretty clear that much of the funding within that ambiguous thing called the informal banking sector originates in the commercial banks  For example SOE s seem to be increasingly involved in financing activity  but they are probably doing so largely as a function of the  arbitrage  between the rates at which they can obtain funding from the banks and the rates at which they can lend  So China s financial system is  for the most part  its commercial banks  and the key characteristic of the banking system is what we would call financial repression  What is a financially repressed system and why does it matter   In a recent paper   Financial Repression Redux   Finance   Development  June 2011  Carmen M  Reinhart  Jacob F  Kirkegaard and M  Belen Sbrancia described a financially repressed system this way Financial repression occurs when governments implement policies to channel to themselves funds that in a deregulated market environment would go elsewhere  Policies include directed lending to the government by captive domestic audiences  such as pension funds or domestic banks   explicit or implicit caps on interest rates  regulation of cross border capital movements  and  generally  a tighter connection between government and banks  either explicitly through public ownership of some of the banks or through heavy  moral suasion  Financial repression is also sometimes associated with relatively high reserve requirements  or liquidity requirements   securities transaction taxes  prohibition of gold purchases  or the placement of significant amounts of government debt that is nonmarketable  In the current policy discussion  financial repression issues come under the broad umbrella of  macroprudential regulation   which refers to government efforts to ensure the health of an entire financial system  As the passage above implies  most savings in financially repressed countries  like most of the countries that followed the Asian development model  are in the form of bank deposits  The banks  furthermore  are controlled by the policymaking elite  and they determine the direction of credit  socialize the risks  and set interest rates  Financial repression is a way of describing a system in which the rates of return and the direction of investment of domestic savings are not determined by market conditions and individual preferences but rather are heavily controlled and directed by financial or political authorities  At the extreme the financial system is often little more than the fiscal agent of the government If the central bank   or whichever institution has the appropriate responsibility   sets at an excessively high level the rates that household savers earn on their savings  it is effectively transferring resources from borrowers to depositors  If it sets the rate excessively low  of course  it does exactly the opposite  In most countries that create the conditions of financial repression   for example the countries that broadly followed the Asian or Japanese development model   interest rates have been set extremely low  This is very clearly the case for China  as I have discussed many times in this newsletter  Normally under these circumstances we would expect the losers in the system  the depositors  to opt out of depositing their savings in local banks  but it is extremely difficult for them to do so  There are usually significant restrictions on their ability to take capital out of the country and there are few local investment alternatives that provide similar levels of safety and liquidity Depositors foot the billDepositors  in other words  have little choice but to accept very low deposit rates on their savings  which are then transferred through the banking system to borrowers  who benefit from these very low rates  Very low lending and deposit rates create a powerful mechanism for using household savings to boost growth by heavily subsidizing the cost of capital The ones who lose under conditions of financial repression are net depositors  who tend for the most part to be the household sector  The ones who win are net borrowers  and in most countries in which financial repression is a significant policy tool  these tend to be local and central governments  infrastructure investors  corporations and manufacturers  and real estate developers  Financial repression transfers wealth from the former to the latter But  as the case of China shows us  the fact that net depositors  lose out  is not necessarily a cause for concern  If the amount of growth generated by the system is so high that households still experience rapid growth in their incomes even as their share of GDP declines  then there is no reason to criticize the system   and in fact until recently nearly all China focused analysts characterized China s banking system as well organized and a critical source of China s economic success But there was nonetheless a serious flaw in the banking system and this flaw  I would argue  has been at the heart of the imbalances that will ultimately force China into a difficult rebalancing  To see why  it makes sense  I think  first to understand under what conditions the system adds value  To do so it is useful to go back to the work of the Ukrainian born American economist  Alexander Gershenkron  1904 78  Gershenkron posited in the 1950s and 1960s the concept of  backwardness   and argued that the more backward an economy was at any point in time   with relatively low manufacturing capacity and infrastructure  and perhaps higher levels of social capital   the more growth could be generated under conditions in which consumption would be constrained in favor of investment and the savings rate forced up  see  for example  Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective  Cambridge  1962  Belknap Press   He argued that because of failures in the private financial sector to identify investments with positive externalities  there was likely to be  and ought to be  a greater reliance on state directed banks to allocate capital In a 2003 book review Columbia University economist Albert Fishlow very usefully elucidated Gershenkron s position   Review of Economic Backwardness in Historical Perspective   February 13  2003  EH net  Relative backwardness creates a tension between the promise of economic development  as achieved elsewhere  and the continuity of stagnation  Such a tension takes political form and motivates institutional innovation  whose product becomes appropriate substitution for the absent preconditions for growth The greater the degree of backwardness  the more intervention is required in the market economy to channel capital and entrepreneurial leadership to nascent industries  Also  the more coercive and comprehensive were the measures required to reduce domestic consumption and allow national saving  The more backward the economy  the more likely were a series of additional characteristics  an emphasis upon domestic production of producers  goods rather than consumers  goods  the use of capital intensive rather than labor intensive methods of production  emergence of larger scale production units at the level both of the firm as well as the individual plant  and dependence upon borrowed  advanced technology rather than use of indigenous techniques  The more backward the country  the less likely was the agricultural sector to provide a growing market to industry  and the more dependent was industry upon growing productivity and inter industrial sales  for its expansion  Such unbalanced growth was frequently made feasible through state participation This of course sounds a lot like the Chinese growth model  and that of a number of other countries that experienced growth  miracles  in the 20th Century   In fact countries undergoing the process described by Gershenkron were able to generate fairly substantial increases in wealth for long periods of time   as clearly happened in China  at least during the first fifteen or twenty years since the reforms of 1978  But the case of China  and every other case of an investment driven growth miracle  suggests that the model cannot be sustained indefinitely because there are at least two constraints  The first has to do with the constraint on debt financed investment and the second with the constraint on the external account  and one or both constraints have always eventually derailed the growth model Overcoming backwardnessTo address the first constraint  in the early stages for most countries that have followed the investment driven growth model  when investment is low  the diversion of household wealth into investment in capacity and infrastructure is likely to be economically productive  After all  when capital stock per person is almost non existent  almost any increase in capital stock is likely to drive worker productivity higher  When you have no roads  even a simple dirt road will sharply increase the value of local labor The longer heavily subsidized investment continues  however  the more likely that cheap capital and socialized credit risk fund economically wasteful projects  Dirt roads quickly become paved roads  paved roads become highways  and highways become super highways with eight lanes in either direction  The decision to upgrade is politically easy to make because each new venture generates local employment  rapid economic growth in the short term  and opportunities for what economists politely call rent seeking behavior  while the costs are spread throughout the entire country through the banking system and over the many years during which the debt is repaid  and since most debt is rolled over continuously  this means effectively that the cost is repaid over the next fifteen to twenty years  It also seems easy to justify intellectually the infrastructure upgrades  After all  rich countries have far more capital stock per person than poor countries  and those investments were presumably economically justified  so  according to this way of thinking  it will take decades of continual upgrading before China comes close to overbuilding The problem with this reasoning of course is that it ignores the economic reason for upgrading capital stock and assumes that capital and infrastructure have the same value everywhere in the world  They don t  Worker productivity and wages are much lower in China than in the developed world  This means that the economic value of infrastructure in China  which is based primarily on the value of labor it saves  is a fraction of the value of identical infrastructure in the developed world  It makes no economic sense  in other words  for China to have levels of infrastructure and capital stock anywhere near that of much richer countries since this would represent wasted resources   like exchanging cheap labor for much more expensive laborsaving devices Of course credit risk is ultimately socialized   that is all borrowing is implicitly or explicitly guaranteed by the state  Socialized credit risk means the lender does not need to ask whether or not the locals can use the highway and whether the economic wealth created is enough to repay the cost In fact the system creates an acute form of what is sometimes called the  commonwealth  problem  The benefits of investment accrue over the immediate future and within the jurisdiction of the local leader who makes the investment decision  The costs  however  are spread widely through the national banking system and over many years  during which time  presumably  the leader responsible for the investment will have been promoted to another post in another jurisdiction  With very low interest rates and other subsidies making it hard to determine whether investments actually reduce value or create it  the commonwealth problem ensures that further investment in infrastructure is always encouraged The problem of overinvestment is not just an infrastructure problem  It occurs just as easily in manufacturing  When a manufacturer with privileged access to the banking system can borrow money at such a low rate that he effectively forces most of the borrowing cost onto household depositors  he doesn t need to create economic value equal to or greater than the cost of the investment  Even factories that systematically destroy value can show high profits  and there is substantial evidence to suggest that in China the state owned sector in the aggregate has probably been a value destroyer for most if not all the past decade  but is nonetheless profitable thanks to household subsidies And these subsidies are substantial  A mainland think tank  Unirule  estimated in 2011 that monopoly pricing and direct subsidies may have accounted for as much as 150 percent or more of total profitability in the state owned sector over the past decade  I calculate that repressed interest rates may have accounted for another 400 to 500 percent of total profitability over this period  Monopoly pricing  direct subsidies  and repressed interest rates all represent transfers from the household sector At some point  in other words  rather than create wealth  capital users begin to destroy wealth  but nonetheless show profits by passing more than 100  of the losses onto households  The very cheap capital especially means that a very significant portion of the cost   as much as 20 40  of the total amount of the loan   is forced onto depositors just in the form of low interest rates  How   Because artificially lowering a coupon on a ten year loan by 4 percentage points effectively represents debt forgiveness equal to 25  of the loan  Lowering the coupon by 6 percentage points represents forgiveness of 35  of the loan  Although most bank loans in China have maturities of less than ten years  these loans are rarely repaid and are instead rolled over for very long periods of time  so increasing the value of the implicit debt forgiveness  Low interest rates are effectively a form of substantial debt forgiveness granted  usually unknowingly  by depositors  The rise of debtUnder these circumstances it would take uncommonly heroic levels of restraint and understanding for investors not to engage in value destroying activity  This is why countries following the investment driven growth model   like Germany in the 1930s  the USSR in the 1950s and 1960s  Brazil in the 1960s and 1970s  Japan in the 1980s  and many other smaller countries   have always overinvested for many years leading  in every case  either to a debt crisis or a  lost decade  of surging debt and low growth    The second constraint is that policies that force households to subsidize growth are likely to generate much faster growth in production than in consumption   growth in household consumption being largely a function of household income growth  In that case even with high investment levels  large and growing trade surpluses are needed to absorb the balance because  as quickly as it is rising  the investment share of GDP still cannot increase quickly enough to absorb the decline in the consumption share  This is what happened in China in the past decade until the crisis in 2007 08  after which Beijing had to engineer an extraordinary additional surge in investment in order to counteract the contraction in the current account surplus  As Chinese manufacturers created rapidly expanding amounts of goods  the transfers from the household sector needed to subsidize this rapid expansion in manufacturing left them unable to purchase a constant share of the goods being produced  The result was that China needed to export a growing share of what it produced  and this is exactly what it did  especially after 2003 As long as the rest of the world   primarily the United States and the trade deficit countries of Europe and Latin America   have been able to absorb China s rising trade surplus  the fact that domestic households absorbed a declining share of Chinese production didn t matter much  A surge in American and European consumer financing allowed those countries to experience consumption growth that exceeded the growth in their own manufacture of goods and services But by 2007 China s trade surplus as a share of global GDP had become the highest recorded in 100 years  perhaps ever  and the rest of the world found it increasing difficult to absorb it  To make matters worse  the global financial crisis sharply reduced the ability and willingness of other countries even to maintain current trade deficits  and as we will see this downward pressure on China s current account surplus is likely to continue So China has probably hit both constraints   capital is wasted  perhaps on an unprecedented scale  and the world is finding it increasingly difficult to absorb excess Chinese capacity  For all its past success China now needs urgently to abandon the development model because debt is rising furiously and at an unsustainable pace  and once China reaches its debt capacity limits  perhaps in four or five years  growth will come crashing down Defining financial sector reformSo Gershenkron s argument  that when the private financial sector can t do it  let the public financial sector do it  requires both that elites can identify economically viable projects and that elites only invest in what they believe are economically viable projects  Relax either condition and it can t work  The various pricing distortions  most importantly in the cost of capital  of course make it very hard to determine exactly whether or not a project is economically viable  and this problem is exacerbated because much of the value of an infrastructure project may come in the form of externalities  which are always hard to measure accurately  Part of the problem with valuing externalities is that they depend in part on the assumptions you make about future growth  If we assume  for example  that Chinese worker productivity will grow very rapidly over the next twenty years  the present value of infrastructure today can be significantly higher than if we assume much slower growth in productivity Unfortunately this reasoning has a tendency to be self reinforcing  The more we invest today  the higher GDP growth and also the higher the recorded level of productivity growth  in which case we can more easily justify additional investment  Of course if we overestimate current productivity growth  in part because the infrastructure we build turns out to be excessive   we are likely to overinvest  in which case lower than expected productivity growth will ensure that the debt associated with the infrastructure becomes a greater drag on future growth than the investment s positive impact on current growth Have we passed the point at which the Gershenkron model works   There is still a great deal of debate about whether or not China is overinvesting and to what extent it is  but rapidly rising debt levels  the rising ratio of credit expansion to GDP growth  the continuing contraction in the household share of GDP  and evidence from the manufacturing sector that capital is being wasted all suggest strongly to me  at least circumstantially  that we have long passed the point at which a financially repressed banking system is useful for Chinese growth  Recently the Economist had an article arguing that China is not overinvesting  it is  they claim  malinvesting  I am not sure that I fully understand the distinction  but I do not think it is meaningful in the context of this debate  The key point is that if the debt servicing costs associated with the investment  adjusted of course to exclude subsidies and repressed interest rates  are greater than the additional debt servicing capacity generated by the investment  adjusted to include externalities   then either debt is rising at an unsustainable pace  wealth is being transferred from some sector to cover the difference  usually but not necessarily the household sector   or both If we have reached or passed that point then I would argue that financial sector reform is meaningful only if it does the following Reform corporate governance   Banks have to stop allocating credit based on the very skewed incentives that reward local officials or businesses with privileged access to credit who engage in large investment projects whether or not these are economically viable in the long run   This means that the state should not socialize credit risk and local officials and SOE heads should have much less ability to influence local lending decisions  Liberalize interest rates   This means  in effect  letting rates rise substantially   There are two reasons for doing this   First  higher deposit rates will reduce the large transfers from the household sector  and so will raise both the household income and household consumption share of GDP   Second higher interest rates will make it much more expensive for investors to fund projects that are not economically viable What reform Last week at a conference in San Diego  in which I was lucky enough to share the panel with the very knowledgeable Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute  my attempt to be provocative may have shocked several people  although not  I think  Lardy  when I asserted that there had been no meaningful financial sector reform in China in the past decade  What about reforms to the QFII and QDII system  in the use of derivatives  in the stock exchanges  in internationalization of the RMB  and so on   They didn t matter  I argued  None of these reforms is really meaningful unless it involves corporate governance reform or interest rate liberalization  and none of the reforms so far have seriously involved either  Since the banking system drives everything else in China s financial sector  distortions in the way credit is allocated by the banks and the way interest rates are set drive almost everything else  even on so called  market  instruments If I am right  then no changes in the banking system really matter unless they involve one of the two reforms I identify above  and I would argue that neither corporate governance nor the setting of interest rates has changed much in the past decade  There is of course a very serious debate taking place within China on just these issues  and I interpret Premier Wen s April 3 radio interview  in which he attacked the banks  as part of this debate  What did Premier Wen say in the interview   A very meager  on Xinhua says  in its entirety    Premier Wen Jiabao has called the country s big bank a monopoly that needed to be broken during his visit in East China s Fujian province few days ago  This was the first time that top leadership acknowledged the monopoly of State owned banks  following last month s announcement of a pilot project to reform the financial sector in Wenzhou  an eastern coastal city with a tradition of entrepreneurship  The country s big four banks raked in a combined profit of over 600 billion yuan last year  despite a backdrop of slowing economic growth    David Barboza at the New York Times  Premier Wen s comments in a little more context    Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China said on Tuesday that the nation s biggest state run banks have too much power and ought to be broken up because they earn far too much money  The remarks  delivered during a national radio address while the prime minister was traveling in southern China  were unusually bold and appeared to be a direct challenge to others in the nation s Communist Party leadership to speed up reforms of the nation s financial system    According to China National Radio  Mr  Wen said   Frankly  our banks make profits far too easily  Why  Because a small number of major banks occupy a monopoly position  meaning one can only go to them for loans and capital      That s why right now  as we re dealing with the issue of getting private capital into the finance sector  essentially  that means we have to break up their monopoly   he added  Mr  Wen  who is expected to step down later this year as part of a once in a decade leadership change  has been striking an increasingly vocal tone in recent months about political and economic reform and suggesting that vested interests in the Communist Party leadership were stubbornly protecting their hold on power and derailing his reform efforts    This it seems brings us full circle to the beginning of the newsletter  Liberalizing interest rates means that those sectors of the economy who have benefitted from very low lending rates   SOEs  local and municipal governments  real estate developers  and other large borrowers   are likely to find many reasons to oppose interest rate liberalization  Likewise corporate governance reform is also likely to be opposed by a number of very powerful interests    So how will banking reform in China turn out   In the long run everything must balance  and one way or another financially repressed interest rates must adjust  One way this can happen is through a sharp increase in interest rates  but it is important to remember  as Japan showed us  that it can also happen by a collapse in GDP growth rates  In either case the spread between the nominal growth rate and the nominal lending rate contracts  and so the extent of financial repression is sharply reduced  The alternative   that the household share of GDP continues to decline as depositors subsidize rapid GDP growth and even more capital misallocation   simply cannot be sustained ,2012-07-04,Michael Pettis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-is-financial-reform-in-china-128508,128508

121779,343294,NYT,The Illusory Economic Benefits Of Bringing Back The Draft,opinion,Writing in Tuesday s   Thomas E  Ricks makes a plea for reinstating the draft  His argument is largely based on supposed economic benefits that I find questionable  Here is why Ricks  proposal would expand the draft beyond the military to make it a form of near universal national service  Under his plan  combat units would continue to be filled by volunteers who would receive full military training  pay  and benefits  much as they do now  In addition  Ricks would add two new categories of service    One new category would consist of uniformed conscripts who would not be deployed  but would instead do paperwork  mow lawns  paint barracks  and drive generals around  They would receive no weapons training  The Washington Post s  envisions a stirring movie   Top Broom   about the exploits of these valiant troops    The other new category  would be a civilian corps for young people who did not want to serve in uniform  These conscripts  who would have a slightly longer term of service  would teach in low income areas  clean parks  rebuild crumbling infrastructure  or aid the elderly  The concept is similar to that of AmeriCorps  except for an element of compulsion    The compulsion would not be absolute  There would be an exemption for libertarians who object on principle to the idea of forced labor  However  those seeking the exemption would not get a free ride  they would have to forgo future claims on Medicare  mortgage guarantees  and other government benefits    Both categories of noncombatant conscripts would receive minimal pay  Ricks suggests  15 000 per year   housing  and  one supposes  although Ricks does not mention it  healthcare coverage  while in service  At the end of their term  they would receive  excellent post service benefits  including free college tuition     To Ricks  this makes great economic sense  True  it would cost billions  but  he says  it would also save billions  Much of the labor that the military currently contracts out to the private sector could  he says  be performed by conscripted 18 year olds for much less  What a bargain    Really  I m not sure Ricks has much grasp of basic economics  The whole idea looks far more costly to me than he makes it out to be    First  the direct costs would not be as low as he seems to think  True  the pay  at  15 000 a year  is little more than the minimum wage  but that s just the start  Housing is not going to be free  He talks about putting people in barracks on closed military bases and in spare rooms in VA hospitals  but those may not handy to where the grass needs to be mowed or the meals on wheels delivered  Even if they are  they require maintenance  heat  and other utilities  I can easily imagine that even the most Spartan barrack accommodations might cost  250 a month  Throw in another  250 a month for health insurance  and the cost for 18 months of national service is up to  31 500  Contributions to social security and Medicare would add another  1 500 or so    Then there are the costs of those  excellent post service benefits  including free college tuition   OK  let s be stingy  Assume that  free college tuition  means only bare tuition and fees at an in state public university   calculates those at  8 244 per year  or  32 976 for a four year program   Tuition and fees  by the way  are only about one third of the cost of attending a state university  Since conscripts would not be able to save much from their minimal pay  they would still be on the hook for student loans or family support to make up the difference   Let s not even adjust tuition and fees for inflation  even though college costs have been rising much faster than the cost of living in general  Even so  the college benefits put the total cost of 18 months of national service up to roughly  66 000    How much work would we get out of the conscripts  If they put in a 40 hour week  they would potentially supply 3 000 hours of labor over their 18 months  However  some of that time would have to go into training  Even those conscripts assigned to painting and mowing lawns are going to need some basic orientation that would probably burn up most of their first month of service  Eighteen year olds who are expected to teach or rebuild crumbling infrastructure could well require more training  Let s suppose  then  that on average conscripts supply 2 800 hours of actual work  Suddenly  the conscripts are costing us almost  24 per hour  Costs of supervision and administrative overhead would easily put that up to  30 an hour  Is that really a whole lot less than the Pentagon now pays private contractors to perform similarly menial tasks    Most important of all  though  Ricks makes no allowance at all for opportunity cost  The opportunity cost of using conscripts to mow military lawns or provide civilian eldercare is the value of whatever it is that those 18 year olds would otherwise be spending their time on  What would that be    Some would be unemployed   The unemployment rate for people aged 16 to 19 years is currently 23 7 percent  although it is usually a little lower than that   On the face of it  it might seem that there would be no opportunity cost to conscripting an unemployed teenager  but that is not necessarily true  Some of them might very well be doing something useful with their time  like mowing their parents  lawns or delivering meals to their grandparents  Even for the unemployed  then  there is some opportunity cost    Another group of teenage conscripts would otherwise be working at unskilled  minimum wage jobs  The opportunity cost of conscripting them would be the cost of replacing them in their former positions  There would be zero economic gain to moving them from one low productivity job to another    A third group of conscripted teenagers would be taken away from jobs that pay more than the minimum wage  say  construction or factory jobs  The opportunity cost of putting them into national service would be the difference between their productivity in their civilian jobs and their productivity in national service  That could be substantial    The greatest opportunity cost  though  would come from conscripting those teenagers who would otherwise be going to college  Something like two thirds of all high school graduates go to college  and about half of them end up getting four year degrees  The opportunity cost of national service  for them  would be an 18 month delay in going to college  and hence  an 18 month delay in beginning their post college careers  Their post college jobs  even for those with less than a bachelor s degree  would in almost all cases pay more than minimum wage  in some cases a lot more  What the national service obligation would do  then  is shift a year and a half of each college bound conscript s labor from high productivity post college work to low productivity lawn mowing or park cleaning    When all the different kinds of opportunity costs are considered  it would be reasonable to suppose that the costs of national service would at least double  to something like  60 per hour  Instead of a pool of cheap labor  the program would   in reality  be an extremely costly way to mow the grass    Rather than relying on the illusory promise of a cheap pool of labor  some proponents of the draft use a different line of argument  For example  Ricks cites   former commander of international forces in Afghanistan  another supporter of conscription  In fact  though  McChrystal s argument is quite different  His concern is that a volunteer army does not spread the cost of fighting foreign wars broadly enough   I think if a nation goes to war  every town  every city needs to be at risk  You make that decision and everybody has skin in the game   says the general    There is something to the notion that voters might too casually endorse foreign military adventures if they see the cost as falling on someone else  Insofar as the cost of war means the risk of having your son or daughter die in it  an all volunteer military does let a majority of voters off the hook  But  in a different way  a military draft does much the same thing  Because conscripts do not have to be paid as much as volunteers  a draft lowers the apparent budgetary cost of fighting a war  even though the opportunity cost of using draftee is much more than the budgetary cost  for the reasons given above    In effect  a draft transfers the opportunity cost of war from taxpayers to conscripts  Voters who are themselves subject to the draft  or whose sons and daughters are  might be more reluctant to vote to go to war  but at the same time  other taxpayers will be less reluctant  On balance  it is far from clear that the  skin in the game  argument would make it all that much harder to get majority political support for a foreign war    The bottom line  If there is a case to be made for universal  compulsory national service  whether military or civilian  it must be made on grounds other than economics  War is very costly  both in economic terms and in lives lost  Civilian national service  even if less hazardous to life  is not much less costly in economic terms  The best way to minimize the economic burden of both is to make the costs as transparent as possible  not to hide them through an implicit tax on teenagers  No one should casually vote to take even 18 months from the life of a young citizen  let alone ask them to risk their life in combat  under the illusion that doing so is clever way to save money ,2012-07-12,Ed

121781,343296,NYT,The Libor Scandal Is Becoming a Central Bankers  Scandal ,opinion,The Libor Liebor scandal is gradually becoming a central bankers  scandal  which is as it should be   Relatedly  much of what we know so far about Libor lies also sheds a new light on the frightening days of the autumn of 2008 as seen from London  Washington  and Wall Street  and it doesn t illuminate anything very flattering for anyone involved   The Missives of October  On October 21  2008  then Prime Minister Gordon Brown emailed Paul Tucker  then the head of markets at the Bank of England  asking why the UK Libor spreads weren t falling   The next day  Tucker sent emails to the CEO of Barclays  John Varley  and the head of its investment banking  Bob Diamond   Cld I talk to one or other of you about libor pl    Four days after that  October 26  Tucker emailed Barclays again to say that he was  struck that your govt gnteed bond was issued at around 140 over gilts  That s a lot   His problem  then  was that Barclays had to pay more for its funding  even with a government guarantee  than Tucker or Downing Street expected  This wasn t helping the powers that be  which were eager to restore an atmosphere of something like normalcy to banking   The following March  Tucker would be elevated to his current position at the BoE  Deputy Governor  Financial Stability    Tucker s email about the  140 over gilts  reached the in box of one Bob Diamond  in October 2008 a rising star in Barclays  executive ranks  credited with just having snagged the best assets of Lehmann Brothers out of the bankruptcy court   Diamond replied   I m abroad  So can t meet I m afraid  But cld talk by phone in about an hour    Tucker did talk to Diamond on the phone three days later  although it isn t clear that this was exactly the follow up Diamond had had in mind  After that October 29 discussion  Diamond wrote a note for the file saying that Tucker had said that  it did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as we have recently  in connection with Barclays Libor submissions   Tucker himself says he didn t make any corresponding note of the same phone call  He was too busy  But in his own testimony to a committee of Parliament he doesn t really contest the accuracy of Diamond s note  beyond saying rather lamely that it  gives the wrong impression    The Right Impression  Actually  the impression that one would get from hearing a Bank of England official say it does not always need to be the case that you report numbers as high as you ve been reporting them  just three days after he had said much the same thing  more explicitly  in connection with the  140 over gilts   is pretty clear   The impression I would get  certainly  is that  our regulators want us to pretend that funding is easier for us to get than it now is   Further  in the circumstances of October 2008  anyone remember     One could be forgiven for thinking it one s patriotic duty to go along with such an appeal   Tucker was a central banker  and manipulating interest rates is what central bankers do  A little friendly suasion in an email exchange or a telephone call doesn t seem an extraordinary way to go about achieving that ordinary goal   If all this publicity starts making people wonder whether any central authority  public  private  or on the borderline of the two  ought to be manipulating interest rates  whether indeed rates and indexes ought to be left to market forces in ways and to a degree that has not been the case in the developed world since roughly the time of the first world war   those thoughts are healthy  and I for one wish to encourage them   Lilacs Out of the Dead Land   But let us move back in time a bit  before the Lehman bankruptcy in September  even before the U S  Congress voted  in July  to give the Treasury authority to backstop Fannie and Freddie  It was on April 11th of 2008  less than a month after the disappearance of Bear Stearns from the Wall Street forest that someone from Barclays spoke to Fabiola Ravazzolo  of the Federal Reserve  Ravazzolo has  for this purpose  a usefully unambiguous set of initials    FR asked her Barclays  contact  after a good deal of friendly chit chat about British versus American English accents  vocabulary  etc    why it was that LIBORs weren t reflecting actual market trading   why do you think that there is this  this discrepancy    After some hemming and hawing  her  unnamed  contact gets to the gist of the answer   So  we know that we re not posting  um  an honest LIBOR    Does FR respond to this with indignation  No  She replies   Okay    His interlocutor continues   And yet and yet we are doing it  because  um  if we didn t do it    If essence of what follows is that if they didn t do it they would draw unwanted attention  In other words  they manipulated their LIBOR numbers because everyone else was  and not doing so would have put them out of line  FR found this perfectly reasonable   The New York Times made this a front page story Saturday  July 14  2012  This Bastille Day news helped close a circle   Yes  the numbers were phony  They were  it appears  known to be phony in the relevant circles  and quite openly spoken of as such  to and without shocking regulators  And when those regulators saw fit  they took advantage of that phoniness for their own ends

121802,343317,NYT,Corrective Position Adjusting Continues Before The BOE ,opinion,The dollar is mostly marginally softer against the major foreign currencies as corrective position adjusting continues  Many suspect that one way or the other  Spanish banks will get the necessary funds and that some how the government will be able to avoid a full burden of conditionality   is emphasizing the sheer size of Spain  Simply put  it ain t tiny Greece  and that  it says  gives it a stronger hand    Spain s bonds were well received in today s auction  Bid to covers were firm and while yields rose  investors were relieved that they did not go up more  For example  the 10 year was auctioned at 6 04   up from 5 74  at the last auction but below the 6 14  that was in the secondary market  Moreover  Spanish bonds have rallied strongly in recent days  Recall the 10 year yield peaked last Wed around 6 7   Today  it briefly dipped below 6 10     Spain is going to announce the appointment of a new central bank governor today  It will be interesting to see  not in terms of monetary policy bias  but in terms of politics  The ECB  which has been critical  in a diplomatic way of  Spain s Rajoy  has been encouraging the appointment of its Gonzalez Paramo  whose term on the governing council ended last month  However  the state news wire Efe reports that the government will likely name Linde  who was director general of the central bank and was named to the board on May 25  seen as a sign he was going to replace Ordonez      After the BOE  the focus shifts to Bernanke  The market is looking for insight into the Chairman s thoughts  It seems clear that many if not most observers are concluding the Fed will respond to the loss of economic momentum  The issue is how  Yellen did not shed much light on the issue    She did seem to suggest that the forward guidance channel may have limited effectiveness   The real debate among participants is whether the Fed will respond changing the composition of its balance sheet or the size    The dollar declined 7 8  against the yen from March 15 to June 1  That move seems to be over  arrested as it were not so much by the recent escalation of verbal intervention  after all material intervention itself has a poor track record  from a medium term perspective   but by the position adjusting phase ahead of the Greek elections and amid rumblings of  yet  another triage induced European reforms and institutional capacity building     The conventional narrative of yen strength as a function of safe haven does not jive  however  with the weekly MOF portfolio flow data  During the yen s rally  foreigners actually bought fewer Japanese bonds and stocks than in when the yen had been declining earlier    The most recent data covers the week through June 1  Foreigners have bought an average of JPY71 mln a week for the past four weeks and were net sellers of JPY69 5 Japanese bonds and stocks on average over the past 12 weeks  For the period ending March 9  the foreigners averaged net purchases of JPY133 mln of the four week period and almost JPY95 mln on average over proceeding 12 week period     If the dollar bottomed near JPY77 65 on June 1  it can rise toward JPY81  It is also predicated on the continued position adjustment of risk assets more broadly  A pullback in the yen could also help the Nikkei which plunged nearly 20  during this period  Modest yen weakness should not discourage fund managers from bargain hunting in Japan  Lastly  Australia continues to surprise  Yesterday it was Q1 GDP  up more than twice what the market expected  Today it is the employment report  Despite the tick up in the unemployment rate  the economy grew 46 1k jobs   well above expectations  Recall  at the IMM  there were record shorts and the 2 4  rally this week reflect many being squeezed out and bottom pickers coming in  A 25 bp rate cut in July that was discounted after the RBA cut only 25 bp is being reconsidered  As long as the AUD stays above  0 9880  the move to parity should be expected ,2012-06-07,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/corrective-position-adjusting-continues-before-the-boe-125797,125797

121808,343323,NYT,The Public s Growing Disdain For The Supreme Court May Help Obamacare,opinion,The public s growing disdain of the Supreme Court increases the odds that a majority will uphold the constitutionality of Obamacare The latest New York Times CBS Poll shows just 44 percent of Americans approve the job the Supreme Court is doing  Fully three quarters say justices  decisions are sometimes influenced by their personal political views The trend is clearly downward  Approval of the Court reached 66 percent in the late 1980s  and by 2000 had slipped to around 50 percent As the Times points out  the decline may stem in part from Americans  growing distrust in recent years of major institutions in general and the government in particular But it s just as likely to reflect a sense that the Court is more political  especially after it divided in such partisan ways in the 5 4 decisions Bush v  Gore  which decided the 2000 presidential race  and Citizen s United  which in 2010 opened the floodgates to unlimited campaign spending  Americans  diminishing respect for the Court can be heard on the right and left of our increasingly polarized political spectrum A few months ago  while a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination  Newt Gingrich stated that the political branches were  not bound  by the Supreme Court  Gingrich is known for making bizarre claims  The remarkable thing about this one was the silence with which it was greeted  not only by other Republican hopefuls but also by Democrats Last week I was on a left leaning radio talk show whose host suddenly went on a riff about how the Constitution doesn t really give the Supreme Court the power to overturn laws for being unconstitutional  and it shouldn t have that power All this is deeply dangerous for the Court  and for our system of government Almost 225 years ago  Alexander Hamilton  writing in the Federalist  Number 78  June 14  1788  noted the fragility of our third branch of government  whose power rests completely on public respect for its judgement The Executive not only dispenses the honors  but holds the sword of the community  The legislature not only commands the purse  but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated   Yet lacking sword or purse  the judiciary  is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered  awed  or influenced by its co ordinate branches  and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office  this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution  and  in a great measure  as the citadel of the public justice and the public security The immediate question is whether the Chief Justice  John Roberts  understands the tenuous position of the Court he now runs  If he does  he ll do whatever he can to avoid another 5 4 split on the upcoming decision over the constitutionality of the Obama healthcare law My guess is he ll try to get Anthony Kennedy to join with him and with the four Democratic appointees to uphold the law s constitutionality  relying primarily on an opinion by Judge Laurence Silberman of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia   a Republican appointee with impeccable conservative credentials  who found the law to be constitutional ,2012-06-10,Robert B.

121809,343324,NYT,Weighing The Week Ahead  Search For Leadership,opinion,I cannot do justice to the concept of leadership in one article  but let us hit the highlights    Leadership is what most market commentators want when they complain about  politicians    They want leaders of democracies to ignore the demands of constituents and do what is right  Unfortunately  the punditry has widely varying views on the best course of action    The search for leadership is hitting center stage    Leadership requires more than accepting and following opinion polls  It includes finding solutions and convincing people that this is the right path  Bringing contending parties together  Finding compromises  Personal charisma  A persuasive presence  Confidence in the face of crisis    The need for strong leadership is readily apparent  but why the focus right now   I see three factors  The upcoming Greek election  which may well determine whether Greece leaves the Eurozone and on what terms Increased urgency among European leaders  as austerity programs fail both with voters and in economic results Intensifying US politics  with a new focus on the personal skills of the candidates This last point  highlighted by Obama s press conference comments  will be the big topic for the weekend talk shows and featured in financial news this week  It is difficult to find a really neutral link for this subject  and you can easily find many on your own  but this provides both facts and context  It shows the actual statement and plenty of quotations from Republicans  but also some data    I ll offer some thoughts on this in the conclusion  but first let s do our regular review of the events and data from last week    Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead    There are many good sources for a list of upcoming events  With foreign markets setting the tone for US trading on many days  I especially like the comprehensive calendar from Investing com  There is also helpful descriptive and historical information on each item    In contrast  I highlight a smaller group of events  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios    This is unlike my other articles where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context    Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market    Last Week s Data   Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components   The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good The US economic data last week was more positive than in recent weeks  Technical selling was averted  This was a big fear last week  Josh Brown  of explaining why this might not happen  I hope readers followed our link to his analysis ISM Services index showed continued expansion   of analyzing the internal elements and also provides a helpful chart Spain has agreed to accept outside aid for its banking system  The  125 billion is three times the amount cited by the IMF as needed      The terms were structured with an emphasis on bank reforms rather than new austerity measures  German officials praised Spain  This is the sort of face saving compromise action that investors should be watching as a sign of progress  as I suggested in my  article Sentiment continues to be very negative  which is positive for markets   the increased bearishness in the Ticker Sense survey of bloggers  including here   The Bespoke Investment Group shows the  US household balance sheets are  1 trillion better than in 2007    that this has not led to the widely predicted economic implosion The Bad There was also some bad news on the economic data front  France lowers the retirement age by two years  to age 60 for some workers The European bank job  continues    good story from  US debt will reach 200  of GDP by 2037    if Congress extends current tax policy without cutting entitlements Initial jobless claims remain at unacceptably elevated levels   I see this as the most important of the weekly data series   The  shows why Big US banks face downgrades according to  Moody s Investors Service has said it is likely to reduce by the end of June credit ratings for 17 large global banks  including five of the six biggest U S  financial firms by assets  The downgrades are expected to raise borrowing costs and crimp some lucrative trading businesses at the banks    PMI reports from around the world have been weaker   Dr   about the differences between the US  China  and Europe   The US is holding up best  but there is a general weakening pattern as you can see from this chart The Ugly   The Greek television talk show wins this week s  ugly  award  The  neo Nazi politican is now on the lam after slapping and slugging a woman from the Communist party  The New Athenian is one of our featured sources  so we recommend this video of the incident  where    Speculation ranges widely on what effect this might have on the upcoming election  No guesses here    The Indicator Snapshot   It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators  The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions    The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses    The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found   I ll explain more about the C Score soon  We are working on a modification that will make this method even more sensitive  None of the recession methods are worrisome  Bob also has a group of coincident indicators  Like most of the top recession forecasters  he uses these to confirm the long term prediction  These indicators are also not close to a recession signal    For comprehensive recession forecasting we recommend the RecessionAlert team  They have reverse engineered the ECRI approach and improved on the recession forecasting power  Since they have not gotten the mainstream recognition they deserve  you can still enjoy the advantage from their methods  You should consider s covering various time frames and GDP forecasting   Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  This week we continued as  bearish  and were 1 3 short via DOG in trading accounts during the week  The ratings are close to neutral  There are sectors in the buy range which might emerge from the penalty box  so this is a very fluid situation  It is bearish  but marginally so     For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer     The Week Ahead   I was correct last week in my prediction that the financial news would have a Fed fixation  All of the Fed speeches  including Bernanke s testimony  passed uneventfully  The Beige Book showed a the economic strength that the Fed sees but traders do not  Yellen offered some QE hope  but Bernanke did not  We are now waiting until next week s FOMC report without any further direction    There is plenty of data this week  but little that I see as important  I don t expect much on the inflation front and I do not care about regional surveys like the Empire State Index    On Thursday we will see initial jobless claims  still in the survey period for the next employment report  On Friday we get industrial production  capacity utilization  and Michigan sentiment  Then we get pre weekend speculation about Greece and options expiration    I expect the first part of the week to focus on the leadership questions  with attacks on Obama as  out of touch     Trading Time Frame   We have been partially invested in trading accounts  in a bearish position with 1 3 of our position profitably in bond ETFs and another 1 3 in an inverse  short  ETF  as I predicted last week  Felix has now sent the bond position to the penalty box  so we have a cautious short position    Investor Time Frame   For investment accounts I have been buying on dips in stocks that we like  I tried to explain the most important concept for individual investors in this article about the Wall of Worry  I have had many emails from people who had a personal breakthrough in their investing when they understood this concept  If you missed it  I urge you to take a look  You can contrast this with the many  pundits who    The single most difficult thing for me to explain is that investors should often embrace opportunity just as traders are trying to do some fancy footwork  Investors should not be trying to guess the next market move  Instead  take what the market is giving you  You should not be a  buy and hold  investor  but instead engage in  active management  Think about risk control rather than market timing    To highlight the continuing discrepancy between headlines and the economic fundamentals  let us look to Dr  Ed  He compares various alternative investments to stocks  using the trailing earnings  This chart summarized a point that was widely observed in the past week  The earnings yield from stocks  when compared to corporate bond yields  is at a 50 year spread  This suggests extreme skepticism about corporate earnings  Another way to view this is that it is the greatest fear since the mid 70 s  If the two lines simply met  the S P 500 would have to rally by 27   This is conservative  since you can see that the bonds usually trade at a higher yield  If you used forward earnings or Treauries  the so called Fed model  you would get an even larger discrepancy The biggest mistake that individual investors make is bad timing by following headlines  Using data is a way to avoid that Long term investors who ignore this warning can follow  Plan B    You can imitate our enhanced yield program  Buy good dividend stocks and sell short term calls  I am targeting 8 9  returns on this approach  and achieving it over the course of a market cycle  You can  too  With the increase in volatility  there are many good opportunities Final Thoughts on LeadershipI have a very good record of predicting what will happen  especially on political events  Eventually this pays off  since earnings follow and stock prices eventually track earnings My concern is that sometimes perceptions create their own reality Suppose you are considering a major business expansion    a new product  new plant  or new employees  Economic uncertainty is the enemy of such plans  since you have less confidence in your forecasts Suppose your family is considering  a new job  a new home  or a new car  Uncertainty can create a delay This is why the effect of leadership is important  Even if all will eventually end well  people need to have some confidence  Otherwise  why not wait until after the Greek elections  after the Europeans solve the problems  after the fiscal cliff is addressed  after the US elections      This is why the extended US political process is so destructive  particularly when it incorrectly focuses on the personal competence of the candidates Here is a secret   The things most important to investors will be fine no matter who is elected  Both candidates are competent and will have great supporting teams The perceptions create an economic drag  but investors who wait for everything to be fixed will be buying at Dow 20K This is a challenging subject and I need more articles to explain  Meanwhile  I try each week to highlight the most important things I am following ,2012-06-10,Jeff

121813,343328,NYT,Sorkin s Column  My Response,opinion,On Sunday  we published a note after the news broke that Spain had negotiated a  100 billion capital infusion for its banks  We applauded the move because it showed that Spain and eurozone leaders realized a run on their banks and bank failures would sink their system  We discussed the importance of bank deposit safety in Europe in a recent commentary on our website       On Tuesday morning  Andrew Ross Sorkin s column in the New York Times identified me and quoted my Sunday missive  Sorkin characterized  analysts  who  applauded  the European move as being  wrong    Sorkin s piece can be found here       Sorkin s column described the necessity of protecting bank deposits  as I did in my commentary  I agree with Sorkin when he states that TARP was not the only bailout approach that helped in the US  Sorkin cites the increase in FDIC insurance limits from  100 000 to  250 000 as the reason depositors in the US calmed down during our crisis  He notes this occurred after the pressure mounted on money market funds    But Sorkin s piece ignores the unlimited  non interest bearing deposit guarantee by the FDIC  That guarantee is what stopped the liquidity drain on our banking system  The increase in the FDIC insurance coverage from  100 000 to  250 000 certainly helped  however  the key item was the extension of the FDIC guarantee so that cash operating deposits of any amount were protected  Companies could meet their payrolls and not have to worry about the domicile of their deposits  they could pay their bills efficiently  instead of allocating cash to many institutions  The unlimited guarantee of cash deposits is what really saved the US banking system  and that guarantee is what is missing in the eurozone    I thank Andrew Ross Sorkin for mentioning my Sunday missive  I would be happy to personally discuss it with him at any time  I think his views about the need for a comprehensive deposit protection system in the eurozone are consistent with mine  As for who is right or wrong  readers can decide     More importantly  markets can decide  Here is where I point to my second disagreement with Sorkin s analysis     Sorkin cites the reaction in stock markets and bond markets as evidence that the Spain bailout deal is failing  Let s take this conclusion apart  Spain s stock market has already been clobbered  for a variety of reasons  including a contracting economy and the ongoing crisis  The same is true of stock markets in many countries in Europe  But the short term reaction of the stock market is not a reason to declare a policy initiative either successful or failed     Jump to the bond market  The Spain bailout deal adds to the sovereign debt burden of Spain  Bond vigilantes quickly figured out that the Spanish debt GDP ratio would jump by approximately ten percent in response to the bank bailout package  Here is a more important message than that from the stock market  Debt GDP ratios and the cost of rolling the debt are the critical factors in Europe  In Greece the cost is now impossible to cover  In Portugal it is nearly so  In Spain and Italy  the cost is reaching the level at which debt rollover by the sovereign is a losing proposition     Sorkin properly acknowledges the debt burden  but to attribute the reaction of the bond market to the bank bailout depositor protection plan is to misconstrue two items  They are related  however  the causality that is alleged by Sorkin is incorrect    Readers are invited to dissect the debt burdens with the Sorkin s approach and with mine  Compare debt GDP and GDP growth rates versus  shrink  rates  You will see that the reactions in the bond market are entirely consistent with the structure of the proposed Spain bailout plan BY David R  Kotok,2012-06-13,David Kotok,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/sorkin’s-column,-my-response-126336",126336
121814,343329,NYT,Trading Obama  Romney And Extraterrestrials,opinion,Investors vote on stocks every day by buying shares in favored positions and selling shares in those out of favor  But shouldn t voting on stocks be different from voting for politicians  Actually  no  Now  politicians can be traded just like traditional stocks or other liquid securities  If you don t believe me  then you should check out   Intrade is an online trading platform that is home to various prediction markets that forecast the probability of outcomes of various real world events  including who will win the 2012 U S  Presidential election  Just like investors can trade IBM on the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE  or Apple Inc   AAPL  on the NASDAQ exchange  so too can individuals trade election shares in Barack Obama  ticker  OBMA  and Mitt Romney  ticker  RMNY  on the Intrade platform  see chart below  Source  Intrade comBy definition  the trading mechanics of Intrade involve a resolution of a particular event structured as a binary  Yes  or  No  result  Similar to a sports bet  Intrade eventually declares a winning or losing outcome   but there are no ties  For example  by November 6  2012  we will know whether Obama s shares will be trading either at  10 per share  if he becomes re elected  or  0 per share if he loses to Romney  Just like a stock  traders can go long Obama shares  if they think he will win  or short Obama shares  if they think he will lose  Analogous to stocks  holding periods may vary too  Traders can either hold their position until the event expiration  and realize a gain or loss  or instead traders can lock in shorter term profits losses by closing a position before the official outcome ends Another great thing about Intrade s prediction markets is that each event share price can be quickly converted to an outcome probability  So as you can see from Obama s Intrade chart above  the current  5 28 share price signifies a 52 8  probability of Obama winning the 2012 Presidential election  No need to worry about distracting stock splits  share offerings  or stock buybacks that could distort the true underlying dynamics of the Intrade event fundamentals Bizarre Bets and Over the Top Trades Crazy Super Bowl  prop  bets have been around for ages  and the senseless nature of the bets did not disappoint this year  if you consider the following ridiculous     Will it take Kelly Clarkson longer or shorter than 1 minute 34 seconds to sing the National Anthem    Will Madonna s hair color be blonde when she begins the Super Bowl Halftime show    How many times will model Giselle Bundchen be shown on TV during the game    What Color will the Gatorade be that is dumped on the Head Coach of the Winning Super Bowl Team  I think you get the idea from these examples  and I believe Intrade figured out the quirky benefits as well  Betting on unusual or strange outcomes can be a lucrative endeavor  Here are just a few of the bizarre and remarkable events you can trade on Intrade                                         Rules of the GameYou may be asking yourself   All this betting trading sounds like fun  but isn t this Intrade thing illegal gambling   If your thought process went in this direction  you are not alone   I asked myself the same question  I m no attorney  but the apparent loophole for Intrade s business operation appears to be tied to its foreign incorporation in Ireland  Less apparent is how American law applies to Intrade as referenced in a recent  that states   It is unclear whether American law applies to Intrade  Although U S  residents may not be able to trade legally on Intrade  roaming the site may provide some quirky entertainment and provide profound answers to critical questions like   Do extraterrestrials exist   How much money will the new Batman movie make at the box office   And which President are we going to get stuck with for the next four years   Surfing around on Intrade can be a blast  but if it gets too boring  you can always go back to trading regular stocks ,2012-06-17,Wade Slome,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-obama,-romney-and-extraterrestrials-126737",126737
121815,343330,NYT,Weighing The Week Ahead  Can The Fed Meet Expectations ,opinion,In the absence of any action on fiscal policy  economic responsibility rests with monetary authorities  Investors rightly ask    What more can the Fed do   Will it be enough    In normal times  this would be the big story  This time the week ahead will start with the Greek election and the aftermath  which I covered in a special preview  This article focuses on what to watch after we digest the news from Greece    Christina Romer  back at the Berkeley econ department after serving as Chair for the Council of Economic Advisers for the Obama Administration offers  in the New York Times        W e need more effective fiscal and housing policies  But neither is likely to happen  at least not before the presidential election  As a result  the Fed is the only plausible source of immediate help for the American economy  It was set up as an independent body precisely so that somebody can do what s right when politicians can t or won t    I find a related argument even more frustrating  that the Fed shouldn t act because Congress wouldn t like it and might retaliate  This argument exposes the important truth that the Fed is only as independent as Congress lets it be    Cardiff Garcia at FT Alphaville has a  with odds  a good flowchart from Credit Suisse  and a number of helpful links  Conclusion   Something  probably more twisting    Everyone wants to politicize the Fed  making it much more difficult for investors  We should focus on how the actual decisions will affect the economy    I ll offer some more thoughts on this in the conclusion  but first let s do our regular review of the events and data from last week    Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead    There are many good

test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good   The US economic data last week was generally weak  There were many bright spots  but not on the most important factors  Home equity increase the highest in 60 years   via  and Bloomberg   Household balance sheets are improving Business inventories are improving  Excessive inventories are a negative  This does not get enough attention because the component parts come out in several different releases  Steven  of explaining how the different pieces fit and providing informative charts Inflation    both wholesale and consumer   remains benign  Steven Hansen   Doug Short  with the energy threat in the background OPEC is  at current levels   This helps with the continuing decline in gas prices   Doug Short has an  The off season earnings beat rate has been good  including the great chart we expect from     I have a sense of greater negative pre announcements  however  but I did not see a solid report on this Housing inventory    both  and  is lower  via Calculated Risk    Any improvement in housing would be very helpful The Bad   Most of the economic news reflected weaker than expected results   This continues the pattern of sluggish growth we have seen for several months    Chinese Economic Data are Suspect   How could we have known   It seems that  include some channel stuffing   Come to think of it  that might also happen in the US Biggest US asset is student loans   I am not sure this meets my criteria for  bad  but it does not feel right   Here is the chart from Doug Short Industrial production was slightly lower and capacity utilitzation was below expectations   Calculated Risk    Scott Grannis is a bit Jobless claims moved higher  further from the non recession comfort zone   This is a special concern for me Retail sales declined 0 2  which was pretty much in line  but the ex auto decline was disappointing   Given the recession concerns  there is special focus on consumer activity Michigan sentiment declined to 74 1 from 79 3 last month   This is especially bad with a background of falling gas prices   In the absence of gas prices and political factors  this is a fair read on employment   It is worrisome  as you The Ugly   Making fun of those recovering from handicaps    When you make a public mistake it is best to acknowledge it and move on  I have had some occasions on this blog  One of my hardest lessons was to quit trying for the academic  perfection in writing    I soon realized that I would never get anything done  Mistakes will happen    President Obama decided to admit his mistake last week where he said that the private economy is fine    The financial media expects this sort of behavior from politicians  but not from themselves  When a leading TV program and pundit has an embrassing and insensitive gaffe  an apology is in order  The person involved was so out of touch with the event that she did not actually name the stroke victim who was the object of her scorn  but it is clear from the context    The Indicator Snapshot   It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators  The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions    The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses    Tim Duy has a   including the SLFSI and some alternatives  He has expert analysis and helpful charts    The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found   I ll explain more about the C Score soon  We are working on a modification that will make this method even more sensitive  None of the recession methods are worrisome  Bob also has a group of coincident indicators  Like most of the top recession forecasters  he uses these to confirm the long term prediction  These indicators are also not close to a recession signal    For comprehensive recession forecasting we recommend the RecessionAlert team  They have reverse engineered the ECRI approach and improved on the recession forecasting power  Since they have not gotten the mainstream recognition they deserve  you can still enjoy the advantage from their methods  You should consider s covering various time frames and GDP forecasting  They have also initiated a new service    the   If you like the ECRI approach  you can get an advance read before their weekly announcement   Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  This week we switched to  neutral  and the ratings are actually marginally bullish  Last week we noted that the  bearish  call was marginal  Remember that these predictions  although made each week  are supposed to represent expectations over the upcoming month

write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer     The Week Ahead   I was correct last week in my prediction that we would be focused on leadership  or maybe the lack thereof   This week will start with the results of the Greek election and the implications both for Europe and for global economic growth    The focal point for this week will be the FOMC announcement and the Bernanke press conference on Wednesday  the culmination of a two day meeting  This will include an update of economic forecasts as well as any policy announcement    G20 leaders meet in Mexico on Monday and Tuesday  This is the wrong group for decisive action on Europe  but there could be some interesting news    This is a big week for housing data  I find the building permits quite helpful  Tuesday   especially given recent weakness  We ll also have housing starts at the same time  and existing home sales and FHFA home prices on Thursday    Thursday is the big day for data  including initial jobless claims  important   leading indicators and the Philly Fed index    Trading Time Frame   Our trading positions changed dramatically last week  The  cautious short  that I described was sold early and we are now 2 3 invested in long positions  Felix is not a range trader  but is excellent at getting on the right side for big moves    Every week I prepare by consulting Charles Kirk s   This week it is available a day early  as we all prepare to celebrate Father s day  It is interesting that Charles is waiting for more evidence of a breakout  not unlike Felix   Investors and traders alike would benefit from an inexpensive membership to The Kirk Report   Traders spend a lot of time trying to call tops and bottoms for  selling the rips and buying the dips    There are many ways to trade successfully    Investor Time Frame   The successful investment strategy differs markedly from trading  It is especially important to establish good  long term positions when prices are favorable  I tried to explain the most important concept for individual investors in this article about the Wall of Worry  I have had many emails from people who had a personal breakthrough in their investing when they understood this concept  If you missed it  I urge you to take a look  You can contrast this with the many  pundits who    The single most difficult thing for me to explain is that investors should often embrace opportunity just as traders are trying to do some fancy footwork  Investors should not be trying to guess the next market move  Instead  take what the market is giving you  You should not be a  buy and hold  investor  but instead engage in  active management  Think about risk control rather than market timing    Right now the market is giving you two things  Plenty of great stocks that are as cheap as they were at the market bottom in 2009  on a price to earnings basis  To pick one example  I buy Apple  AAPL  and Caterpillar  CAT  on day one for every new client  There are many other great examples Good dividend stocks where you can sell short term calls  I am doing this as a  bond substitute  providing the yield we need in a low rate environment  I am targeting 8 9  returns on this approach  and achieving it through an up and down market cycle  You can  too  but it takes some work Investors who play these themes will do well  regardless of the headlines    Final Thoughts on the Fed   Expectations for the Fed are unrealistic and wide ranging  This makes it easy to disappoint  Communications  If the Fed reduces growth estimates and acknowledges some economic weakening  many will criticize  saying that they are frightening the markets  If the Fed maintains that conditions are acceptable  the same people will say they are out of touch  There is no satisfying some Decision  Whatever the Fed decides to do some will say that it is inadequate    more was needed  Others will decry the move as inflationary stimulus  And of course we will see many repetitions of  pushing on a string  Expert Fed watcher Tim Duy plays  devil s advocate  in     Bottom Line   I think you can tell a story that the most recent data is not sufficient to move Fed forecasts  in which case it remains possible that the Fed does not implement any changes next week  I have to admit to being a little nervous that we get a Fed  leak  over the next few days in an effort to reset expectations ahead of the meeting  Still  given the increased downside risks to the forecast  it is hard for me to make this my baseline scenario  especially given the very dovish Yellen Williams Evan contingent  which is why I expect some action next week  But much still rests on Bernanke  who has surprised by positioning himself to the hawkish side of the center  After all  if he believed the Yellen Williams Evans stories  he would have eased already  He hasn t  suggesting that he has a pretty high bar to additional easing  and we just might not have crossed that bar    The entire article is worth a careful read    Here is the key point that the market pundits do not get   It is not all about you    The Fed is responding to economic needs  The tools all have marginal economic impact  They often use the market response like a poll  to gauge the instant sentiment  Who wouldn t   But that is not the major purpose  The  wealth effect  on the economy is modest  but the occasional Fed comments on this topic have created a sense that the Fed objective is to drive up stock prices    Anyone maintaining this position should be able to find evidence in the detailed transcripts of past meetings  Put up or shut up    My vote   I am expecting some sort of extension of Operation Twist  but the Fed is running out of short term assets to sell  This is a small  token move ,2012-06-18,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-can-the-fed-meet-expectations-126724,126724
121817,343332,NYT,Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Slave,opinion,Luigi Zingales recently wrote a New York Times op ed entitled  in which he suggests an innovative way to finance the exorbitant costs of higher education    The best way to fix this inefficiency is to address the root of the problem  most bright students do not have any collateral and cannot easily pledge their future income  Yet the venture capital industry has shown that the private sector can do a good job at financing new ventures with no collateral  So why can t they finance bright students   Investors could finance students  education with equity rather than debt  In exchange for their capital  the investors would receive a fraction of a student s future income   or  even better  a fraction of the increase in her income that derives from college attendance   This increase can be easily calculated as the difference between the actual income and the average income of high school graduates in the same area     This proposal is in the finest tradition of financial innovation on Wall Street  where product specialists try to securitize anything that s not nailed down in order to make a buck  Slavery by another name Think for a minute what Zingales is proposing  In times past  people who were faced with crushing debt sold themselves  or their children  into slavery  How is this any different  The Zingales proposal asks a student to sell their future earnings  or equity if you will  in exchange for cash to finance their education  OK  it s not full slavery in that someone owns all of you  but it is a partial form of slavery  Zingales qualfiied his proposal to state that it is not  indentured servitude     This is not a modern form of indentured servitude  but a voluntary form of taxation  one that would make only the beneficiaries of a college education   not all taxpayers   pay for the costs of it   What would you call the transaction where someone  rather than face a mountain of debt  sells all or part of himself to a holder of capital for a lump sum of cash     Taking personal responsibility There are other ways of addressing the problem of student debt  When you have   there is no denying that there is an enormous problem with student loans and the cost of higher education  A better solution is to get the student to take some personal responsibility and make an adult decision about the value proposition in his own higher education      True enough  higher education still pays  but at what cost   highlighted these issues in an article that showed the value of higher education  It s charts like the one below that prompt parents to push their kids into university at all costs The dirty little secret is that not all higher education is the same  The Atlantic article pointed to a  that showed the earnings and unemployment rates of different majors  The disparities are striking    So here s my message to students  Take personal responsibility for your own decisions about your life  If you want to specialize in Architecture  Journalism or the Liberal Arts because that s your passion  go for it  On the other hand  you need to manage your own expectations  If you graduate with a degree in Victorian literature or foreign affairs  don t complan when you get your dream job of working for an NGO that pays you 30K a years   because you made your own choice to go into the field of your own volition  There are tradeoffs in life and you made one  On the other hand  proposals like Zingales  to equitize people s earnings amount to slavery  It is so wrong at so many levels that I don t know where to even begin ,2012-06-20,Cam Hui,https://www.investing.com/analysis/portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-slave-127100,127100
121822,343337,NYT,16 Signs That This Economic Decline Is Affecting America,opinion,This economic decline has been really hard on everyone  but it has been particularly hard on American men  During the last recession male employment dropped like a rock and it has not recovered much at all since then  That is why many referred to the last recession as a  mancession   Industries where men are disproportionately represented such as construction and manufacturing have really been hit hard in recent years  In the old days  you could take a high school education down to the local factory and get a job that would enable you to live a middle class lifestyle and support a growing family on just that one income  Sadly  those days are long gone  Today  American men live in a world where their labor is not really needed  Wages are falling because almost any worker can be easily replaced by the vast pool of unemployed American workers that are currently searching for work  and a lot of big companies are shifting labor intensive jobs overseas where workers only make a small fraction of what they make in the United States  American workers  especially those without much education  are considered to be expensive liabilities in a world where labor has become a global commodity  So the percentage of working age American men that have jobs is likely to continue to decline and wages are likely to continue to stagnate as well For many men  a long term bout with unemployment can almost be worse than a major illness  It can be really hard to feel like a man when you don t have a job  Men often see themselves as filling the  provider  role  and when they aren t providing for their families self esteem can fall through the floor  It is easy to feel worthless when there is no money coming in and your wife and your kids are looking at you with worry every single day As you read this  there are millions upon millions of unemployed men sitting at home with a glazed look in their eyes  When you talk with these men  many of them seem as though the life has been sucked right out of them As I wrote about recently  when you cannot find a job month after month after month people start to look at you differently  Some start to look at you with pity in their eyes  and others start to look at you with disgust in their eyes Most Americans don t really understand how much the economy has fundamentally changed  and many of them still believe that it shouldn t be too difficult to find a job in  the greatest economy on earth  But things have changed  If you don t have a college education or some highly specialized skills then it is going to be exceedingly difficult to get a good paying job in this economy Unfortunately  finding a job is not going to be getting any easier  Times are hard now  but they are going to be getting a lot harder The following are 16 signs that this economic decline is sucking the life out of the American male     1 During the last recession  men lost  as women did   2 According to the Economic Policy Institute  the  real entry level hourly wage for men who recently graduated from high school  has declined    3 During the recent economic downturn millions of men saw their family finances get absolutely destroyed   According to the Federal Reserve  the median net worth of families in the United States declined      4 As you can see from the chart below  in the 1950s there were times when nearly 85 percent of all working age men had a job   Sadly  that number has stayed below 65 percent since the end of the last recession     5 More unemployed fathers than ever are staying at home with the kids  Over the past decade the number of  stay at home dads       6 Prior to the recession  women accounted for approximately 45 percent of the workforce  Now  they account for  of the workforce     7 According to one new survey   of all small business owners in America have gone for more than a year without pay  More than half of all small business owners are men     8 The decline in manufacturing jobs has had a disproportionate impact on men  Back in 1940   of all American workers had manufacturing jobs  Today  only  of all American workers have manufacturing jobs     9 More than half of all middle management jobs in America are now      10 More than half of all health care jobs in America are now      11 American men love to watch television  But because of harsh economic conditions more families than ever are eliminating cable television service  According to one survey  a whopping  cancelled cable service last year     12 According to the New York Times  approximately  of all Americans that are currently enrolled in college are women     13 According to one study  between 1969 and 2009 the median wages earned by American men between the ages of 30 and 50 dropped  after you account for inflation     14 According to    young  urban  childless women  make more money in America today than young  urban  childless men do     15 According to CNN  in the United States today men in the 25 to 34 age bracket  to live with their parents as women the same age are     The number of adult children who live with their parents  especially young males  has soared since the economy started heading south  Among males age 25 to 34  19  live with their parents today  a 5 percentage point increase from 2005  according to Census data released Thursday  Meanwhile  10  of women in that age group live at home  up from 8  six years ago  16 Our system often treats elderly American men like absolute trash   Just check out what happened to one elderly veteran     Warren C  Bodeker is an 89 year old World War II Army Airborne combat veteran and war hero  living in Montana  who is being thrown off of his own land and thrown out of his own house  by Montana Federal Bankruptcy Trustee  Christy Brandon  with the approval of the U S  Bankruptcy Court in Montana  And to make matters worse  Warren s wife Lorna just died of cancer this past year  and is buried there on their land  right next to the house  Warren had planned to live there till he died and then be buried right next to his wife  there on their property at 11 Freedom Lane  in the town of Plains  Montana  but now  not only is he being forced off his land  he is being forced to exhume his wife s body and take her with him    As the ability of men  and women  to take care of their families continues to decline  the middle class continues to     Most Americans continue to expect our economy to be able to bounce back to where it was before  but the truth is that  is in the midst of a long term decline    We are heading for an absolute   and we desperately need to come together as a nation and find some real solutions    Unfortunately  our nation is becoming more divided than ever  and most of our politicians are proposing that we continue to do the exact same things that got us into this mess    So what do all of you think about  the mancession  and what this economic decline is doing to the American male   Please feel free to post a comment with your thoughts below    ,2012-06-20,Michael T.

121837,343352,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,President Obama announced that he believes same sex couples should be granted the right to marry  reaching this historic conclusion after saying before his position had been evolving over many years  I ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married   Obama told ABC News Needless to say it is a dramatic move in an election year and it also seems a bit more choreographed than initially believed  as in Obama s announcement wasn t necessarily precipitated by Vice President Joe Biden s comment on the topic last Sunday on  Meet the Press    I know the story is Biden apologized later for jumping the gun  I just don t believe it  But regardless of whether it was choreographed or not  the fact is Obama s announcement will have an impact on key swing states such as North Carolina and Virginia  the former having voted overwhelmingly  61 39  for a state constitutional amendment the day before the president s statement to ban same sex unions I also got a kick out of Obama once again dragging his kids into the discussion  You know  Malia and Sasha  they have friends whose parents are same sex couples  There have been times where Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we re talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha  it wouldn t dawn on them that somehow their friends  parents would be treated differently  It doesn t make sense to them and  frankly  that s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective  Gay advocates now hope Obama more vocally opposes the Defense of Marriage Act  a 1996 law that bans recognition of same sex marriage at the federal level  The president has called the law discriminatory  but groups want him to play a more prominent role in fighting to repeal it The Washington Post s Karen Tumulty points out that  When the question has been put to the voters over the past decade   more than 30 times in state referendums since 1988   they have come down against gay marriage every time  But attitudes have indeed been changing and a Washington Post ABC News survey found that 52  said gay marriage should be legal  while 43  said it should not   Independents  incidentally  supported gay marriage by a 54 42 margin in this March survey  Editorial   Washington Post It was not entirely clear how far Mr  Obama s support extends  According to an ABC report  the president  stressed that this is a personal position  and that he still supports the concept of states deciding the issue on their own   This suggests that Mr  Obama may not be prepared to go so far as to support the view that the right of gay men and lesbians to marry  like that of interracial couples  is entitled to constitutional protection  He was not asked directly about his views on the constitutional status of same sex marriage  Nonetheless  this development is symbolically important and enormously cheering  The nation has moved swiftly  in historical terms  from cruel and almost unthinking bigotry against gay men and lesbians to recognition that such prejudice is unacceptable   That might not seem obvious the day after North Carolina became the 30th state to adopt a constitutional amendment prohibiting same sex marriage In total  38 states prohibit same sex marriage either by constitutional amendment  statute or both  But polls show a population evenly divided and steadily trending toward support for civil rights for gays  with younger people least conflicted of all  Editorial   Wall Street Journal Congratulations to President Obama for matching his public policy with what everyone already knew were his private beliefs  His statement Wednesday that he supports same sex marriage spared the public the ruse of waiting until after the election to state the inevitable   One school of political thought holds that gay rights issues typically hurt the person who raises them first  But perhaps the Obama campaign calculates that in a close election he will need a passionate base and that this will drive liberal and youth turnout in such important and evolving states as Virginia  Colorado  New Hampshire and New Mexico  On the other hand  Mr  Obama looks like he has just solved that problem Mitt Romney supposedly has with rousing cultural conservatives  The Obama endorsement also guarantees that the media will not allow Mr  Romney to go anywhere without being interrogated on this subject  The Republican could do worse than to say he supports the Defense of Marriage Act that President Bill Clinton signed less than two months before the 1996 Presidential election  adding that he believes the issue ought to be resolved democratically by the states  That has left New York and five other states plus the District of Columbia to sanction gay marriage  while North Carolina on Tuesday went in the opposite direction   American public opinion on unions between same sex couples   whether civil or matrimonial   is changing  with support growing  Barack Obama and Mitt Romney won t arrive at a marriage of the minds on this subject  but the issue shouldn t decide the election and we doubt it will  On Wednesday evening  the Republican controlled House of Representatives moved to reinforce the Defense of Marriage Act by a 245 171 margin The CIA and its counterparts in Saudi Arabia and Yemen disrupted a bomb plot  a new underwear device targeting U S  bound aircraft  helped in part by the use of a double agent  a Brit  as we ve just learned  Michael A  Walsh   New York Post Let s stipulate that the CIA s discovery a fortnight ago of yet another underwear bomber plot  this one originating with al Qaeda in Yemen and aimed at an American airliner  was a splendid feat of intel tradecraft  Stipulate  too  that it gets us one step closer to nailing Ibrihim al Asri  the terrorist behind the earlier Christmas Day underwear bomber plot in Detroit in 2009  as well as the bombs hidden inside laser printers stashed aboard cargo planes in 2010  And let s agree that foiling the operation by means of a double agent inside al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula s operational structure potentially saved many lives  But here s a rude question  Why do we even know about this  One of the unsung stories in the War on Terror is the active cooperation of Arab and other Muslim officers working in country  Saudi intelligence officers  Iraqi cops and local Afghani chiefs  The FBI in particular has done a splendid job of recruiting  training and partnering with locals on the ground  developing invaluable sources and operational assistance  Their identities   their very existences   are generally kept secret  not only for their own protection  but for the continuing effectiveness of counterterrorism ops  You generally don t let the bad guys know you ve penetrated their inner sanctums  Moles stay underground for a reason  Yet here was John Brennan  the White House counterterrorism adviser  showing up on national TV to take a very public victory lap   I think people getting on a plane today should feel confident that their intelligence services are working day in and day out to stop these types of IEDs from getting anywhere near a plane   he said  Thanks for sharing  Of course  if Brennan and the CIA had quietly broken up the plot  rolled up the network  two of the plotters in Yemen were killed in a drone attack on Sunday  the announcement of the plot was made the next day  and kept their mouths shut  the public wouldn t be worrying about those IEDs  because they wouldn t have realized the threat remained   With the economy in shambles  the president and his team have been floating a national security campaign  based largely around the Navy SEALs  killing of Osama bin Laden a year ago in Pakistan and the ongoing drone attacks on terrorist leaders  Last week  Obama flew all the way to Kabul to pat himself on the back for bin Laden s death   But the politicization of intelligence is no laughing matter  Obama did the right thing in moving Democratic functionary Leon Panetta over to Defense and replacing him at CIA with Gen  David Petraeus  who s both apolitical and the soul of discretion   you can bet Petraeus didn t authorize the leak  But even the man who led the turning of the tide in Iraq can only do so much to clean up the swamps of Washington and Langley   The old adage   Loose lips sink ships  still applies  and that goes double for airships  I could not agree more with Mr  Walsh s take  Going back to my comments from Paris when I first heard of the strike to take out bin Laden  and before that  Mission Accomplished   I have always been deeply troubled by triumphalism  in any form But Michael Walsh wrote his piece before we learned details of the double agent  who was recruited in Britain  Imagine  the United States gave up his identity  too As reported in the London Times late Friday night  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta condemned the disclosure  As a former Director of the CIA  I have to tell you that those kinds of leaks are very harmful to the efforts of the intelligence community   Said Shashank Joshi  a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute  a London based think tank  If you re MI5 and you re trying to recruit a young British Pakistani or British Arab in the future  how do you persuade them that their actions and their potential identity  aren t  going to be splashed across The New York Times the next week  Eric Edelman  an under secretary of defense during the George W  Bush years  said   Under Obama  intelligence has been systematically politicized for political gain  thus the  high fives  that you saw the other day at the anniversary of Osama bin Laden s death  The leaks are so appalling it s hard to fathom  but this is not the first time it has happened  Whitehall officials are furious with the U S  If I m Mitt Romney  I d have this at the top of my debate talking points next fall  I m getting ticked off just typing this I have expressed my admiration for Indiana Republican Sen  Richard Lugar on more than one occasion in this space  almost solely because he s been an adult on the topic of foreign affairs and presidents of both parties have wisely sought his guidance But I have not been privy to his relationship with the citizens of Indiana  some instances of which I honestly just became aware of in his losing primary campaign against Tea Partier Richard Mourdock And while I m sorry to see Lugar go at a time of immense pressure on the diplomatic front  I also have one other thing to say You re 80 freakin  years old  for crying out loud  Sen  Lugar  Geezuz  My past comments over the years weren t based on your hanging around until you re 86 Enjoy your retirement  and to Indiana Republicans  don t blow it in November An AP GfK poll of registered voters has Barack Obama with a 50 42 lead over Mitt Romney  Obama is favored on the issue of the economy by a 46 44 margin  Female voters favor Obama by 54 39  Black voters go the president s way 90 5 But a Politico Battleground poll found Romney with a 48 47 lead among likely voters  including 48 38 among independents  Obama led Romney by nine points last February in the same survey And a new USA TODAY Gallup Swing States Poll shows that in 12 battleground states  Obama holds a 47 45 edge  On the likability front  however  58  say the president is likeable  while just 31  describe Romney that way A new Quinnipiac University poll shows Obama and Romney in a virtual tie in critical Ohio and Florida  Obama leads in Pennsylvania 47 39 Michael Gerson   Washington Post   We re not going back We re going forward   President Obama said during his formal campaign kickoff in Ohio  This rallying cry was pedestrian  and appropriately so  Obama is no longer a leader on horseback  His campaign   on the evidence of its first day   will be a long  unimaginative  partisan march to the sea  Gone are the vast ambitions of national progress and healing  In Ohio on Saturday  Obama made a methodical appeal to various voting blocks   college educated women  gays  Hispanics  He waded into the culture war on abortion  something he rarely did four years ago  And he accused the GOP of trickle down hostility to the middle class  To every interest group  a sop  On every wedge issue  a swat  To every class enemy  a turn in the tumbrel  Obama has gone  forward  all the way to the strategy of Walter Mondale  The president may persuade voters with this message  but he apparently has given up trying to inspire them  And this is not a small thing  since the Obama brand once consisted mainly of inspiration  In a story for Newsweek by Peter J  Boyer and Peter Schweizer titled  Why Can t Obama Bring Wall Street To Justice   there is this nugget     There hasn t been any serious investigation of any of the largest financial entities by the Justice Department  which includes the FBI   says William Black  an associate professor of economics and law at the University of

121838,343353,NYT,Week in Review Part I  Europe  Washington And Wall Street,opinion,Crisis in EuropeInteresting week for President Obama to be hosting a G 8 summit at Camp David  and then a NATO confab in Chicago  what with the chaos in Europe and a new leader in France  President Francois Hollande  who is in conflict with German Chancellor Angela Merkel  Obama will be serving as referee and mediator as he tries to get Britain  Germany  France  Italy  Japan  Canada and Russia to agree on some broad principles  namely that with respects to Europe and Greece  the latter s potential exit from the eurozone is not good for anyone  nor  Obama will argue  is Chancellor Merkel s hard fast stance on austerity over economic stimulus  In the case of the NATO summit  it s about the U S  convincing its European allies that they must shoulder more of the defense burden  despite their budget difficulties  Of immediate concern  though  is Greece  There is simply no way that Greece could exit the eurozone in an orderly fashion  It would be chaos and immediately spread to Spain  Italy  Ireland and Portugal  within about 48 72 hours  max  As I wrote last week  the position held by the likes of economist Nouriel Roubini that Europe is witnessing a slow motion train wreck couldn t be more wrong  The crash is coming within days and weeks  And before it s all over  the United States will witness a market crash of its own  as I ve predicted would occur in 2012 since I started writing of this last fall On Monday alone  Greeks withdrew 700 million euro in savings from Greek banks  Granted  there was no panic  but panic could ensue shortly  Christine Lagarde  head of the IMF  was forced to concede that a Greek exit was likely to be  quite messy  with risks to growth  trade and financial markets   It is something that would be extremely expensive and would pose great risks but it is part of the options that we must technically consider  Greece s president  Karolos Papoulias  warned that its banks risk running out of money  posing a  threat to our national existence   The extension of political instability will lead to fatal consequences   Papoulias said   The absence of government is a serious risk to the financial security of the Greek people  But following the May 6 Greek parliamentary vote  three attempts to form a government between the various coalitions failed  and so a new election is to be held June 17  at which time 37 year old Alexis Tsipras  I ve also seen  38 year old  Tsipras   the leader of Syriza  could become the new prime minister Syriza is itself a coalition of 11 leftist groups  ranging from Greens to communists  Its manifesto calls for Greece to leave NATO  It is also vehemently against the terms of the 240 billion euro bailout that the EU  European Central Bank and IMF have fashioned in two stages over the past two years Syriza won 16 8  of the vote in finishing second May 6  but various polls show it winning anywhere from 22  to 27  on June 17  which would most likely make it first in a highly fragmented field and thus qualify for the stupid 50 seat bonus that goes to the winning party  If  for example  Syriza won 27   coupled with the bonus it would end up with 125 130 seats in the 300 seat Parliament and almost certainly form an anti bailout coalition government Gabriel Sakellaridis  Syriza s economic coordinator  told the London Times   We really believe that at this moment a possible exit of the Greek economy from the eurozone would have a very  very big cost for the eurozone as a whole  We believe that if we have a negotiation we will win some things  because it s very difficult for them to throw us out  Syriza wants a debt moratorium for three to five years so that it can spend bailout funds on promoting jobs and growth  Sakellaridis says   If they halt the bailout flow  we can stop  on our side  paying the interest  It will be a period of negotiations  We will try to find some way to pay wages and pensions  We do not promise people that wages and pensions will return to the levels of before the crisis  What we say is we need people to stand up with us  That increases our bargaining power  Oh brother  On Monday  Chancellor Merkel said she is under increasing pressure in Germany to force the Greeks out of the eurozone to avert several more years of uncertainty  I believe it s better for the Greeks to stay in the euro area  but that also requires that we set out a path on which Greece gets back on its feet step by step  The solidarity for the euro will end only if Greece just says   We re not keeping to the  austerity  agreement     But I don t expect that to happen  I do think they are making an effort  There are many  many people in Greece who actually want it  But as the week went on  Merkel increasingly called for the June 17 vote in Greece to be a referendum on staying in the eurozone  which in actuality is what it will be whether titled that way or not with Alexis Tsipras continuing to threaten not to pay Greece s debts unless the rest of the eurozone gives in to his demands should he become prime minister But what of the European Central Bank  On Thursday  ECB President Mario Draghi said while the bank s  strong preference  is that Greece stays in the bloc  he will continue to preserve  the integrity of the ECB s balance sheet  So the high stakes game of chicken increases in intensity with each passing day  British Prime Minister David Cameron didn t make any friends in the EU when he said in a speech   The eurozone is at a crossroads  It either has to make up or it is looking at a potential break up  Either Europe has a committed  stable  successful eurozone with an effective firewall  well capitalized and regulated banks  a system of fiscal burden sharing and supportive monetary policy across the eurozone or we are in uncharted territory which carries huge risks for everyone  But if Greece leaves  remember  as I ve long written  for years now   the firewall to prevent the contagion from taking out Spain and Italy is far from sufficient  700 billion euro  maybe as much as 950 billion in theory  The thing is  I saw all manner of articles this week mention how the firewall isn t enough to handle both countries  Ireland and Portugal are supposed to be covered by separate  existing pools but they would require further increased funding of their own   yet no one mentions one of my key points  Where s the money  It s supposed to be committed  but it s not actually sitting anywhere  As in  the people in various euro countries may revolt once they fully realize just how much of their national treasure is going to bailout anyone outside Greece And as Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal notes on a different aspect of the crisis should contagion engulf Italy and Spain  The ECB will also need to deploy its unlimited firepower to stabilize government bond markets  But simply reactivating the Securities Markets Program in its current format is no solution  The ECB s insistence on being ranked senior to other creditors in Greece means the more bonds the ECB buys  the more likely a country will be permanently shut out of markets  The only way around this problem is for member states to commit to fully indemnify the ECB against losses  putting taxpayers further on the hook  Fat chance of that happening  Bottomline  the firewall  in theory  could take care of Spain  but hardly Italy Spain  by the way  had 16 banks downgraded by Moody s  Italy had 26 suffer the same fate   while the Spanish government has had one miserable debt auction after another  Oh  sure  they raise the funds required to continue paying services  interest payments and funding pensions  but the costs are soaring  including a 4 year auction that went off with a yield of 5 10  vs  3 37  last time  Spain s critical 10 year had a yield over 6 40  this week before closing around 6 20   100 000 marched against austerity moves in Spain last weekend  incidentally  as the economy is officially in recession with first quarter GDP down 0 3    It was down 0 8  in Italy and 6 2  in Greece     For Spain  recession leads to deeper losses for its banks in mortgages  consumer finance  and corporate debt  One of Spain s sick banks  the recently nationalized Bankia SA  saw depositors pull 1 billion euro the past week Meanwhile  in France  Francois Hollande was sworn in as president  hopped on a plane to go see Angela Merkel  and his aircraft was promptly struck by lightning  forcing him to return and get a new plane  When the two finally got together later that evening  their first meeting was so so at best  Merkel wanting Greece to stay committed to austerity  Hollande wanting growth measures first for Zorba and Co Lastly  in Italy  following a slew of attacks on tax collectors and the shooting of an energy company official last week  the government was forced to increase security for thousands of potential targets  Oh yeah  Italy is ready for labor reform Andy Xie   South China Morning Post Globalization has magnified the consequences of national strengths and weaknesses  European strength in consumer brands is a golden asset  But many  if not most  European businesses have no distinct advantages and must engage in price competition  Obviously  Europe has a high cost structure and cannot win through price competition  It must shift resources from weak to strong industries  That requires regulatory and labor flexibility that many European countries  especially the ones in trouble  don t have  Globalization has also raised the cost of inputs like energy and decreased the value of manufactured goods in general  Europe should recognize that  if it fails to boost its competitiveness  it must accept lower living standards   in other words  it must work more or spend less  But  supported by a global credit bubble  most European countries did not make that choice and defended their lifestyle by running up national debt  Europe must see that the crisis is about the future  not just the past  For example  Germany is in good shape because it made the adjustment years ago  dumping uncompetitive industries and shifting resources to businesses like automobiles and precision equipment  It also cut labor costs and social overheads  If countries like France or Italy switch from austerity to fiscal stimulus  the bond market will panic  funding unsustainable growth just digs a deeper hole for bond investors   A stimulus is credible if European countries carry out reform to increase growth potential  If a credible growth plan is in place  financial markets would be willing to fund the short term deficit increase  But a growth strategy based on demand stimulus alone won t win over the market  To restore growth  it s necessary to improve labor market flexibility  The European labor market is trapped in a vicious cycle  Businesses are unwilling to hire because it is too costly to let anyone go  The resulting high unemployment rate increases worker insecurity  which drives workers to support laws that enhance job security but make employers less willing to hire  Turning to Washington and Wall Street the economic news was mixed  with decent reports on housing starts and industrial production for April offsetting a desultory figure on April retail sales and a poor number on leading economic indicators Economist Stephen Roach continued to pound the table that consumer demand is not growing in the U S  and that the Federal Reserve s injecting money into the consumer demand equation hasn t been working because it s not being spent And in its own minutes from its April meeting  the Fed s Open Market Committee noted   The possibility of a sharp fiscal tightening in the United States  is  considered a sizable risk   referring to the  fiscal cliff  everyone is becoming increasingly aware of  If agreement is not reached on a plan for the federal budget   the Fed s minutes continued   a sharp fiscal tightening could occur at the start of 2013  Uncertainty about the trajectory of future fiscal policy could lead businesses to defer hiring and investment  It already is There is zero sign Republicans and Democrats will come together until after the election to address the expiring Bush tax cuts  the expiring payroll tax cut  mandated budget cuts from the 2011 debt ceiling agreement and a new debt ceiling deal  I m still convinced  despite what Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said this week  that the debt ceiling will be a huge issue come September  not after the election or early 2013 as the secretary proclaimed So if nothing is done beforehand  it s just assumed that the Nov  6   Jan  3 lame duck session of Congress will solve everything  or  should Mitt Romney win the election  then a new Romney administration  with a new Congress  will address the issues after Jan  20 and just make many of the changes retro to Jan  1  This is ludicrous  The markets won t just jerk around until then  They ll crash Meanwhile  not for nothing but California s budget deficit  once thought to be  9 2 billion for this fiscal year  is suddenly  16 billion  as announced by Gov  Jerry Brown  And then on Friday  the Legislative Analyst s Office said the deficit could be more like  16 6 billion David Brooks   New York Times The people who pioneered democracy in Europe and the United States had a low but pretty accurate view of human nature  They knew that if we get the chance  most of us will try to get something for nothing  They knew that people generally prize short term goodies over long term prosperity  So  in centuries past  the democratic pioneers built a series of checks to make sure their nations wouldn t be ruined by their own frailties   Though the forms were different  the democracies in Europe and the United States were based on a similar carefully balanced view of human nature  People are naturally selfish and need watching  But democratic self government is possible because we re smart enough to design structures to police that selfishness  James Madison put it well   As there is a degree of depravity in mankind  which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust  So there are other qualities in human nature  which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence   But  over the years  this balanced wisdom was lost  Leaders today do not believe their job is to restrain popular will  Their job is to flatter and satisfy it  A gigantic polling apparatus has developed to help leaders anticipate and respond to popular whims  Democratic politicians adopt the mind set of marketing executives  Give the customer what he wants  The customer is always right  Having lost a sense of their own frailty  many voters have come to regard their desires as entitlements  They become incensed when their leaders are not responsive to their needs  Like any normal set of human beings  they command their politicians to give them benefits without asking them to pay  The consequences of this shift are now obvious  In Europe and America  governments have made promises they can t afford to fulfill  At the same time  the decision making machinery is breaking down  American and European capitals still have the structures inherited from the past  but without the self restraining ethos that made them function   This is one of the reasons why Europe and the United States are facing debt crises and political dysfunction at the same time  People used to believe that human depravity was self evident and democratic self government was fragile  Now they think depravity is nonexistent and they take self government for granted  Neither the United States nor the European model will work again until we rediscover and acknowledge our own natural weaknesses and learn to police rather than lionize our impulses  Finally  I m sick of the apologists for JPMorgan Chase and the  2 billion  and growing  loss it suffered from risky trades and its complicated hedging strategy   Why this is nothing considering how big their balance sheet is   say some   JPMorgan will earn  20 billion this year  What s  2 billion   say others Bull  It s about a bank that did not have the controls in place  and when some inside the operation warned executives  including Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon  they failed to listen  or were scared to ring the alarm  as may have been the case with deposed Chief Investment Officer  Ina Drew  she of the  14 to  15 million pay package last year  and another  30 million in parting gifts  For his part  Dimon  whom I have not lionized as others have over the years  survived a shareholder meeting and retained the chairman slot  which is absurd  This should never have happened   Dimon told them   I can t justify it  Unfortunately the mistakes were self inflicted  But as Peter Skillern  an executive director of an advocacy group said in voting his group s shares in favor of stripping Dimon of the chairmanship   There s a conflict of interest  There s a lack of independent supervision  You can t be your own boss  Consider that JPMorgan s initial  2 3 billion in losses were accumulated over just 15 days in late April and early May  and Ina Drew managed a portfolio worth about  375 billion According to reports some executives in JPM s investment banking arm privately told management  including Dimon  that the bank s Chief Investment Office was an  accident waiting to happen   Bill Winters  former co CEO of JPMorgan s investment banking division  evidently told staff that the CIO unit didn t fully understand the risks it was taking  Who can when you are managing  375 billion in derivative crapola   They are indeed weapons of mass destruction  as Warren Buffett once famously said And guess what  According to the Financial Times  contained in the above mentioned CIO portfolio of  375 billion is more than  100 billion in highly complex asset backed securities and structured products that were the kinds of investments at the center of the financial crisis in 2008  The actual amount of  non vanilla  items in the portfolio could be over  150 billion  Now that the investment world is focused on JPM and their WMD  how do you unwind it without suffering further massive losses Joe Nocera   New York Times Even at a bank as ostensibly well run as JPMorgan  the incentives still exist for giant  risky bets to be made that can go very wrong  JPMorgan can withstand a  2 billion hit  but not every bank can   and who s to say that the next derivatives debacle won t be  5 billion or  10 billion  Jamie Dimon is undoubtedly a very good bank chieftain  but he s only one man in a large institution  he can t oversee every trade  The only way to change incentives industrywide   and get bank risk taking under better control   is through a combination of tougher rules and more transparency  And as Jamie Dimon has admitted  regardless of whether in the grand scheme of things you think JPM s  3 billion loss  which it really is at this point heading to  5 billion  is important  the timing of the disclosure could not have been worse  The Volcker rule continues to be hashed out but it s really irrelevant today whether JPMorgan s trading fell under it or not  because we simply don t know what the rules are going to be when it takes effect in July  What s a trade and what s a  hedge  is what has yet to be defined  among other issues But for now  yes  some of our financial institutions are too big too big to fail  They must be broken up  And on the campaign front  if you re a Republican candidate for national office  you might as well join the Occupy Wall Street crowd in picketing Dimon s home and office this summer because he just made it harder for you to win ,2012-05-21,Brian Trumbore,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review-part-i:-europe,-washington-and-wall-street-123783",123783
121841,343356,NYT,Week in Review Part II  Street Bytes,opinion,It was the worst week of the year on Wall Street as the Dow Jones lost 3 5  to close at 12369  its worst performance since November of last year and with 12 losing sessions in 13  the worst such stretch since Oct  1974  The S P 500 lost 4 3  and Nasdaq plummeted 5 3   the worst for that index since last September The market s performance on Friday wasn t helped any by Facebook  which sold 421 2 million shares at  38 each to raise  16 billion  thus valuing the company at  104 2 billion  or 107 times trailing 12 month earnings  more than all but two S P 500 companies  But then the stock  after opening at  42 05 and climbing to  45 in short order  sucked wind the rest of the day on record volume for a stock debut of in excess of 570 million shares to finish right back at  38   38 23 to be exact The debut was also marred by the fact that not only did the shares open 30 minutes later than expected  but some traders didn t receive confirms on their orders  An investigation is already underway So now the pressure is on 28 year old founder Mark Zuckerberg to deliver and monetize the site s over 900 million users Meanwhile  early in the week  General Motors announced it was pulling back from advertising on Facebook   We currently do not plan to continue with advertising but we remain committed to an aggressive content strategy   a person at GM familiar with the situation told the Financial Times  after it was first reported in the Wall Street Journal  GM said it would continue to expand its use of Facebook pages for its brands  but that s free  I ve said for about ten years now that online advertising is worthless  And in a poll by the AP and CNBC  57  said they never click on advertising or sponsored links on Facebook  Separately  about 50  believe Facebook is simply a passing fad As for the issue of Facebook billionaire Eduardo Saverin  at first when I heard he was renouncing his U S  citizenship to move to Singapore and save  hundreds of millions in taxes  I thought  smart move But I didn t realize his background that at age 13 he was on a list of potential kidnapping targets in his native Brazil  so he fled with his family to Miami for his safety  after which he attended the best prep school  became a citizen in 1998  and went to Harvard where he met Mark Zuckerberg and the other Facebook founders As fellow tech billionaire Mark Cuban said   This pisses me off  In Singapore  sources told the New York Post his  lifestyle is so over the top  the billionaire   famed for canceling

up 2 3   including on core Japan s economy grew at a solid 1  in the first quarter  an annualized rate of 4 1    owing in no small part to government spending following last year s earthquake and tsunami  The 4 1  was better than the 2 2  annualized rate posted by the United States for the same period The news out of China was not so good as the economy continued to decelerate   Foreign direct investment for April fell 0 7  vs  a year earlier  while Citigroup  Goldman Sachs and others have been lowering their growth forecasts  generally to 7 5  for the second quarter vs  previous estimates of 8 0  or more To put things in perspective  China s worst growth rate in recent years was 6 2  in the first quarter of 2009  the depths of the financial crisis  I have to admit  however  that when I see stories of rapidly increasing car inventories at dealer lots  as well as home prices continuing to fall  though longer term this is a good thing  I get concerned because of my two holdings there  one of which is transparent  the other not so much  The one economist I respect as much as any other  Stephen Roach  isn t quite as sanguine as he has been but he still speaks of China having  plenty of scope for easing  to boost growth with an interest rate cut likely to happen  sooner rather than later  And I keep thinking that the government desperately needs a smooth political transition this fall and next winter  it s a phased process  and must have an economy that is back on track or there could be major turmoil The deceleration in China s economy is being felt at Southern California ports  In the first three months of this year  container traffic through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach was up just 0 6  compared with the first quarter of 2011  largely because of slowing shipments from China China is California s third largest export market  behind Mexico and Canada  but California exports to China were up only 0 4  in the first quarter from the first three months of 2011 China  Japan and South Korea have agreed to begin talks this year on a free trade agreement  China is the biggest trading partner of both Japan and South Korea  The establishment of a free trade

2011  up from only  130 billion in 1999  according to a Chinese government report Chinese gold demand hit a record in the first quarter of 2012  according to the World Gold Council   But overall  global demand fell 5   which the WGC blamed on a sharp rise in gold prices  The average price of gold was  1690 per ounce in the quarter  22  higher than the first quarter of 2011 Germany s 10 year

Angeles Times Of the estimated 37 million Americans with outstanding student loans  nearly 5 5 million are 40 to 49 years old  and more than 6 3 million are 50 or older  according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York    But  the financial benefits of college still outweigh the costs  according to studies  One found that lifetime earnings of college graduates average  650 000 more than that of their counterparts who completed only high school  Another concluded that the average annual take home pay of college graduates is nearly twice that of high school only graduates    38 950 versus  21 500  Pioz  a town of 3 800 residents in the Guadalajara province of Castilla La Mancha in Spain  racked up such huge debts during the boom years as developers stampeded to put up housing projects that the town owes 16 million euro in outstanding bills to suppliers  So  seeing as the best estimate is it could put aside 2 000 euro a year to pay outstanding debts after meeting the bare minimum of operating costs  it s estimated it could pay off its entire debt in 7 058 years  As Fiona Govan of the Daily Telegraph writes  Some three miles from the historic town center  a gleaming 11 million euro water purification plant squats between fields of wheat  lying abandoned because the council has no money left to operate the electric pumps to supply the plant or to pay the employees  As a result  the water supply to the town frequently cuts out  A recycling center next door  funded in part by a grant from the EU  likewise stands gleaming and vacant   We couldn t finish the road to allow the trucks to reach the site with the rubbish  The whole project is useless   said a local  So too is the swimming pool  which was opened in 2008 and came with a price tag of 2 3 million euro  Hewlett Packard is looking to cut anywhere from 25 000 to 30 000 jobs in one of the biggest mass layoffs in recent memory  Many of those impacted will be offered early retirement packages as CEO Meg Whitman deals with the company s tumbling fortunes The U S  Postal Service has decided it can no longer wait for Congress to act and will begin closing nearly 250 mail processing centers as originally planned  including 48 this summer  but will stretch out the remainder over a longer time frame  with 90 shutting next January and February so as not to impact both the election and holiday season too much  The Senate last month passed a bill that would halt many of the closings  while the House is jerking off But the USPS still needs some sort of action by lawmakers to address the issues of Saturday delivery and reducing health and labor costs  For example  if the House doesn t get its act together  postal officials say they face a cash crunch in August and September because the agency owes the Treasury more than  11 billion for future retiree health benefits According to a study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute  nearly 50  of U S  workers do not have health care coverage

Street employment for April  however  was flat   Crain s New York Business So I m reading a local obituary on a man I was aware of but didn t know personally and because of what he did  I thought New York New Jersey area readers may be interested His name was Edward  Ted  Olcott and he lived in Summit  age 86  He was a councilman here  which is how I knew of him  But  Ted s first  and last  employer was the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  He began as the supervisor of the bolt tightening crew for the George Washington Bridge  and concluded his career in 1984 as the Port Authority s Director of Planning and Development  During that long career he ran the PATH system for a time  influenced the location and later development of the World Trade Center  helped with the design and implementation of the lower deck of the George Washington Bridge  lobbied for waste burning energy generation  the creation of one way tolls  and the establishment of dedicated commuter bus lanes through the Lincoln Tunnel  among many other projects  He had a pragmatic but also visionary sense of how the New York metropolitan area could work and dedicated his life to making that vision a reality  I know from here on as I travel through the area I ll remember him from time to time  That s a life of accomplishment There is a bit of an uproar in the U K  over a plan by Whitehall  British

121844,343359,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,Poll Data USA TODAY Gallup Poll71  rate economic conditions as poor  but 58  predict they will be good a year from now By a 56 36 margin  those surveyed predict Obama will defeat Romney  even though the latest Gallup tracking poll had it 46 45 Obama  the reason seemingly being that Americans recognize the powers of the incumbent But Romney s favorable unfavorable rating has jumped to 50  41   his best ever  And 55  say the economy would get better over the next four years if Romney was elected  compared with 46  who say it would improve if Obama was re elected  This is huge  in the mind of your editor For the first time during this campaign cycle  the GOP also has an advantage in congressional elections  By 50  44   those surveyed say they re likely to vote for the Republican congressional candidate New York Times CBS News pollIn the first poll conducted since President Obama came out in favor of gay marriage  46  of registered voters now say they would vote for Romney  while 43  prefer Obama  Three months ago  Obama had a 48 42 lead 67  thought the president made the gay marriage announcement  mostly for political reasons  And while more than half of voters said Obama s views on same sex marriage would not affect their voting  25  said they were less likely to vote for him because of it  while only 16  were more likely to back him Overall on the topic  38  of Americans support same sex marriage  24  favor civil unions short of formal marriage  and 33  oppose any form of legal recognition Washington Post ABC News survey46  of Americans say they had a favorable impression of the president s announcement on legalizing same sex marriages  while 47  say they had an unfavorable response In what is bound to be a main theme for the campaign  Mitt Romney went after the president on the issue of the debt  A prairie fire of debt is sweeping across Iowa  he said in Des Moines  and our nation and every day we fail to act we feed that fire with our own lack of resolve   As president  I will approach debt and spending differently  My time spent building businesses and leading state government taught me that we need to hold every department and agency to a simple test  If something can be done better and more efficiently outside the federal government  then that s where it belongs  Editorial   Wall Street Journal One of President Obama s campaign themes is that government spending   he calls it  investment    is the source of most American economic progress  So eager is he to make this point that  well  let s just say he sometimes wanders beyond his area of expertise  as he did last Thursday in Seattle    When I hear people talk about the free enterprise system and entrepreneurship  I try to remind them  you know  all of us made that investment in Darpa  the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  that helped to get the Internet started   said Mr  Obama   So there s no Facebook  there s no Microsoft  there s no Google if we hadn t made this common investment in our future   Microsoft   a product of the Internet  That may surprise Bill Gates and Paul Allen  who founded the software company in 1975  The company didn t introduce its first Internet browser for another 20 years  and in the meantime it became the dominant computer software company long before the Internet became economically important  The irony of Mr  Obama s error is that for much of Microsoft s history the Internet was seen as a threat to its desktop dominance   The problem here is less Mr  Obama s historical errors than his emphasis  He really does believe that prosperity flows from government  which is why all of his policies promote more government  Who would your editor like to see Mitt Romney select to be his running mate  Gotta tell ya  the little I ve seen of New Hampshire Sen  Kelly Ayotte  I really like her  But realistically  I hope Romney goes with Ohio Sen  Rob Portman  If Romney was way behind  then you d want him rolling the dice with Chris Christie   I d also rather see Paul Ryan stay in Congress for the budget battles to come  Since I m doing a running history of our times  I guess I have to note that Ron Paul said he would stop spending money in the states with upcoming primaries  but he wasn t ending his campaign  Huh  Guess he s hitchhiking as he continues trawling for delegates  Let s face it  He did far worse than most expected  not winning one primary or state caucus But he also didn t hurt his son  Sen  Rand Paul  who has major potential in my mind  having seen him earlier in the year in New Hampshire  And the group led by former New Jersey Gov  Christie Whitman  Americans Elect  said it would not file a candidate for president because its candidates failed to meet the threshold to enter its online convention in June  I saw her speak on this a few months ago and was unimpressed  writing on 2 11 12 in this space that I  didn t see how they ll attract a top shelf ticket   The group had intended to get on the ballot of all 50 states but it made it to only 29 before calling it quits For about a week in these parts  there has been this story circulating that  amazingly  New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly had not been informed of the details of the foiled Yemeni underwear bomb plot  I mean this was stunning  The FBI was blowing him off  So I was going to comment on this  though assumed that by week s end the FBI had gotten together with Kelly  only on Wednesday  FBI chief Robert Mueller  in the words of the Daily News  showed an incredible lack of intelligence  when he blithely told a Senate panel that he still hasn t bothered calling NYPD s top cop about the latest terror threat  Never mind that New York lost thousands of people on 9 11 and the city remains the nation s No  1 terror threat  Mueller then proceeds to say that if Kelly wanted more details he could have picked up the phone and called Excuse my French  but what a d   It turns out the FBI did brief NYPD brass  but Mueller made zero effort to contact Kelly himself New York Sen  Chuck Schumer then had this exchange with Mueller at a Senate hearing Schumer   Just a suggestion for the continued good operation  give him a call on this  He didn t ask me to ask you to  I am  Do that  Thanks  Mueller said he d be happy to take Kelly s call Schumer   I know  Let s not get into who calls whom  I am asking you to call  As the Daily News put it   Finally  a light bulb went on   I m happy to do it   Mueller replied  Good god  Someone tell Robert Mueller to pack his bags and get the hell out New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg on the issue of truancy  We have a lot of kids who unfortunately don t have parents at home when they leave in the morning or get home in the afternoon and it s harder to supervise kids  And then maybe  you know  some people don t care  Some people don t understand the value of education  So some parents  leaders got all bent out of shape  calling the mayor insensitive Of course Bloomberg is right in thinking many parents are less than caring when it comes to ensuring their kids actually go to school Separately in the Big Apple  in the first quarter  police officers stopped folks on the city s streets more than 200 000 times  putting the Bloomberg administration on a course that would shatter last year s record for street stops  The 203 500 stops compare with 183 000 in the same quarter in 2011 So guess what  Homicides are way down  again  In fact they are on track for the lowest tally since the record in 2009 of just 471 since records started being kept in the early 1960s   Stop  Question  Frisk  removes both criminals and guns But you ve got your a holes from the New York Civil Liberties Union and the likes of Al Sharpton arguing that too many innocents suffer from the policy  as in 41 6 percent of stops in 2011 were young blacks and Hispanics  age 14 24  that made up just 4 7 percent of the population Overall  54 percent of the people stopped were black  33 percent were Hispanic  9 percent were white and 3 percent were Asian  96 percent of all shooting victims in the city were black or Hispanic last year Police Commissioner Kelly said critics of the policy  never have an answer  about how to tackle the disproportionate levels of crime in certain city neighborhoods   I would submit that our strategies are saving lives   he said   Al Baker   New York Times On Thursday  however  Kelly backed off a little and said his force would undergo new training  promising a  more civilized experience  In a classic case of my  wait 24 hours  rule  newly released photographs of George Zimmerman show that he was clearly injured in his altercation with Trayvon Martin  while a toxicology report revealed there were traces of marijuana in Martin s system  A new witness account revealed that he saw  a black male  wearing a dark colored hoodie   on top of a white or Hispanic male who was yelling for help  Zimmerman will get off  eventually For the first time in our nation s history  the number of babies born to white parents has dropped below 50  of the total  with African American  Hispanic  Asian and mixed race births accounting for 50 4  of all American babies in the year ending July 2011  according to the latest census figures  In Hawaii  California  New Mexico  Texas and Washington  D C   non whites are already in the majority  The Census Bureau projects that the Hispanic population will overtake the white population in 2045  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s official summer weather forecast was released and three fourths of the country   from the Southwest to the Mid Atlantic   faces above average

121847,343362,NYT,Politicized Market Is Last Bastion Of  Economic Strength ,opinion,The VIX is in a second stage pullback from Mid Cycle resistance at 24 35 back to its Head   Shoulders neckline today  It overshot the neckline on the first pullback and the second one is not as deep  but we would not like to see it go beneath short term support at 20 85  which is just above the neckline  There is a minor pivot this weekend  so it is possible that TPTB will not like to see the VIX make a new high before the weekend  This market is extremely politicized and appears to be the last bastion of perceived strength for  the economy    However  here is what the  is saying   If we keep following the pattern of the triple Orthodox Broadening Top  SPY may linger near the overhead resistance of the trendline for yet another day  but be assured that the trend is still down  Short term resistance is almost precisely at the neckline at 133 39  so we may use that as a partial stop loss for our short positions  if needed  I say only partial  since the Cyclical measure of the downtrend is Mid Cycle resistance at 134 75  There is a new Head   Shoulders neckline at 129 55 that  if broken  assure that the downtrend will continue  Wall Street and its minions will make every attempt not to cross the neckline before the weekend  IMO  Meanwhile   are fleeing the market  UUP appears to have made a Primary Cycle double pivot with a high on May 16 and a low on May 21  exactly 4 3 days apart  It appears to have started a minor wave iii  which suggests that it may break above its neckline at 22 95  Fibonacci targeting agrees with the Head   Shoulders target  It has also launched above Cycle Top resistance at 22 70  which may now be support for the duration of this rally  There may be a retest of support before UUP moves higher  I have inserted a weekly chart of FXE to show that it has indeed closed beneath its new Head   Shoulders neckline at 125 75  The probability of a waterfall decline is extraordinarily high  The bounce that started last Thursday was a complete failure  ending in a  double pivot  Trading Cycle within a span of 4 3 days  The next major pivot low may arrive by June 15  The Orthodox Broadening Top agrees with the target for the massive Head   Shoulders at 125 75  which portends a decline to parity        In understanding just how bad things are for European banks  it is important to focus on  how much loss absorbing capital there is beneath you in the bank s liability stack  as this is the capital that will take losses before senior creditors in the event of a bail in  which means looking at deposits as well as secured encumbrance  What is very apparent from the pictorial representations of banks  liability structures is that rather than encumbrance from covered bonds LTRO etc  the bigger issue for encumbrance of senior unsecured investors is the potential threat from depositor  runs    TLT made yet another breakout  then retested its Cycle Top support at 122 47  It appears that this powerful thrust is taking no prisoners as it marches parabolically higher  We may have seen the top of wave iii  which exceeded the target for the Head   Shoulders pattern  If this is correct  we may see TLT drop to its trendline and short term support at 120 74 before moving higher  If the pattern is correct  I expect the wave v thrust of this pattern may terminate on or near June 12 with a probable target of 130 24  Keep in mind that this may be the final high  and it may be all downhill from there  GLD bounced again from a major Head   Shoulders neckline yesterday and made a partial retracement that appears to be a truncated wave c  It is difficult to judge just yet  but the correction may be over  What seems to be happening now is that GLD may be setting up for a massive wave iii of  iii  once it falls through the neckline  This gives GLD about three weeks to decline into a Primary Cycle low expecting a bottom in mid June   writes    as of minutes ago  the CME for Crude  CL  and Gold  GC  by 13  and 10  respectively  At this point we doubt it will do much if anything    On the contrary  it may stop the rally in its tracks  USO crossed beneath the neckline of the larger Head   Shoulders pattern with a new target at 26 50 and appears to have tested it already  This suggests a swift drop to its target in the next three weeks  What appears to be taking place  is that USO is about to enter wave  iii  of 3  which may be stronger than the Head   Shoulders pattern indicates  Fibonacci relationships suggest a decline to 22 00 in wave  iii        Over the past 2 months two things have happened  chatter of  imminent  war with Iran has died down to barely a whisper  and WTI is now trading 20  lower than 2012 highs  Which means there is far more capacity for a run higher  So putting all that together  does it mean that the prospect of war with Iran is now gone  FXI has broken the lower Head   Shoulders neckline with a new  lower target  The initial Head   Shoulders pattern fell short of its target as roughly 33  of these patterns do  However  that statistic may not be a detriment in using the pattern  especially with other models  The Cycles Model suggests that we may see the decline continue through the second week of June  when a Master Cycle low is due  It has some subdividing yet to do between now and its target low date  but the consolidations will likely be compressed into shorter periods INDY met the minimum target of its minor Head   Shoulders pattern yesterday  It is now in a wave ii bounce  preparing to break the massive Head   Shoulders neckline below 19 31  It is due for a Master Cycle low in mid June  This pattern has become complex  but Head   Shoulders patterns launch wave threes  This pattern may be an interesting one to watch unfold XLF may add a little more to its bounce before piercing its Head   Shoulders neckline at 130 70  The Broadening Wedge no longer has the deeper target  but it is good to have a  second opinion  on the extent of the decline  The current decline should take XLF to its November low or possibly to the massive  probable  neckline at the bottom of the chart  It appears now that XLF shares a virtually identical cycle with FXE  Both are expected to reach their respective Master Cycle lows in mid June       A good read JPMorgan s flacks and apologists have  unintentionally  exposed the fact that their cover story   hedging gone bad   is false  JPMorgan runs the world s largest gambling operation in financial derivatives  The New York Times reported the key facts  but not the analytics  in an article entitled  The analytics suggest that the latest JPMorgan cover story   it was JPMorgan s  Achilles the heel   based in the UK  who caused the loss   is misleading    The volume of searches for the phrase  has just hit an all time high   higher now than even during the peak of the Lehman Brothers  moment  ,2012-05-28,Anthony M.

121848,343363,NYT,Europe s Ineffective Solution And The Failures Of Governments ,opinion,Today there are two stories that describe the coming financial train wreck ahead   here and in Europe  Bloomberg quoted Mikel Echavarren  who heads a Madrid based finance company as saying   Spain has engaged in a policy of delay and pray  The problem has not been quantified by anyone because there is huge pressure not to tell the truth  Wow  I like delay and pray much better than kick the can to describe Europe s solution to its mess  But what really attracted my attention was his statement that the problem has not yet been quantified  That means nobody really yet knows how big and how bad the problems really are  My takeaway from all this  Spain  Italy and all the other PIIGS ultimately have to go bust because if the total problem is not known now  that means to me the final number will be in the trillions and too big even for Germany to fix  Therefore where Europe ultimately is headed is a breakup of the Euro and government style bankruptcy filings  And probably sooner than most expect rather than later That is Europe  Here in the US we are headed in the same direction  In the next few years  soaring pensions and healthcare costs have to bankrupt all state and local governments unless the benefit levels are slashed  The US Government will be solvent longer than local governments  Why  The US government can print money to pay its bills  but not forever The Sunday New York Times had a story that NYC pension funds are not earning the expected 8  return  The story said that if expected returns were dropped to 7   that would cost New York City and extra  2 billion and the unions do not want the taxpayer to know  The question the story does not even attempt to answer is how much it will cost New York City if the expected return drops to 3  Using the numbers in the story  I will tell how much it will cost  At a 3  return  New York City would have to put  14 billion into the pension this year  double the  7 billion currently budgeted  That is 20  of the total budget   14 billion out of  70 billion  and compare  14 billion to the  1 billion pension payment 10 years ago That is why unions will not let the city reduce expected returns 1  let alone a 5  drop to 3   The union members do not want anyone to know how much they are stealing from the future  So what is the local government solution to the pension problem  How about delay and pray The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported that in 2011  the average pension paid to Sonoma County safety workers was  94 000 a year  up from  34 000 ten years ago  Pension payments as a percentage of the budget would also be over 20  if real numbers were used  What is even more amazing to me is that all current hires are being promised the same pension benefits My definition of criminal fraud is lying to obtain personal financial gain at the expense of others  Union members and government officials who refuse to disclose the real pension numbers and the financial disaster local governments are facing in my opinion are committing criminal fraud Below You May Find The Video ,2012-05-30,Charles Biderman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/europe’s-ineffective-solution-and-the-failures-of-governments-124786,124786
121853,343368,NYT,What Facebook Can Learn From Vale About Overdiversification,opinion,By now there is no doubt that Facebook  NASDAQ  FB  is focusing most of its efforts on expanding its presence and profitability in the mobile sector  So far  the only sources of significant revenue generated by Facebook on its mobile platform are from advertisements placed directly inside the newsfeed of its mobile Facebook apps  With its struggle to fully capitalize on the potential of its mobile platform  Facebook  to include a cautionary note on how user access through the mobile platform was leading to  daily active users  DAUs  increasing more rapidly than the increase in the number of ads delivered   Recently  Facebook has taken its mobile strategy one step further in hopes of finding new ways to establish itself and generate revenue in the mobile sector  According to   Facebook  hopes to release its own smartphone by next year   In fact  Facebook has already solicited the expertise of more than half a dozen former Apple software and hardware engineers to help it develop the Facebook Phone    So what exactly can Facebook learn from Vale S A   NYSE  VALE   At first glance  the companies couldn t be any more different  After all  Vale is a 70 year old Brazilian company that engages in the exploration  production  and sale of basic metals  Facebook is a social media giant that just completed its IPO  Yet  in developing its own phone  Facebook should be mindful of the recent developments surrounding Vale and  more importantly  the lessons they teach in the importance of focusing on core businesses    Vale has recently slimmed down its operations to optimize its asset portfolio and focus on core businesses after being burned by its overdiversification  in the last three quarters  Vale experienced an average EPS decline of 34   Vale discovered that it started to lose its competitive advantage and experienced diminishing profitability as it expanded its operations  many of which started to become burdensome  For example  Vale recently announced on Monday that it had sold all of its Colombian thermal coal assets to Goldman Sach s Colombian Natural Resources for  407M  This was due to the fact that its thermal coal assets were     relatively small and costly in comparison to the large operations of its rivals in the region   Moreover  Vale has already sold its aluminum assets to Norsk Hydro and  according to Barclays   will likely divest its oil gas business some months ahead        In creating the Facebook Phone  Facebook faces the same risk of over stretching itself as it attempts to enter markets in which it does not have sufficient knowledge  Facebook is first and foremost a software company with a core competency centered around social media  Although smartphones are natural facilitators of social media  the hardware production  distribution  and sale associated with smartphone creation are completely tangential to Facebook s focus of connecting the world  Adding a hardware component to Facebook  whether through acquisition or green field operations  would be a huge burden to the company and would diminish Facebook s profitability  Few companies have managed to successfully integrate the software components of their business with hardware production to create winning  profitable phones  for every iPhone example out there  there are at least ten Microsoft  MSFT  Kins  As IDC mobile analyst Kevin Restivo  Mobile phone production is a business Facebook has zero experience in  It s also a business with considerable cost and risk attached  and  no amount of homework done by Mark Zuckerberg is likely to help bridge the operational knowledge and gap needed to compete against the market leaders Moreover  just like Vale s Colombian thermal coal assets  Facebook will face significant competition in the mobile market and cannot match the economies of scale of market leaders such as Apple  AAPL  and Samsung  SSNLF PK  in producing its own phone     Despite the tremendous obstacles associated with creating its own Facebook phone  Facebook s overall strategy of focusing on expanding its mobile presence is the correct mindset  However  this strategy can be better executed through first expanding its current smartphone partnership with HTC  HTCKF PK   much like Googe  GOOG  has done with its Android system and various carriers such as Motorola  MMI   which Google recently acquired for its patents   HTC has an established presence in the mobile market and has established hardware operations that Facebook could utilize through a strategic alliance  without the hassle of starting from scratch or the integration problems of an acquisition  Facebook already has created an entire operating system  it recently acquired Instagram  and it is currently in talks to acquire Opera Software and its browser capabilities  these assets would greatly complement any phone and would further help establish Facebook as more than just a mobile app  Facebook needs to understand that it has the capacity to combine these assets to make a phone great  It just doesn t have the capacity to make a great phone

121860,343375,NYT,Red Ink Nightmare,opinion,It wasn t all that long ago that the bulls were talking about a strengthening U S  economy  decoupling  from weakening economies elsewhere  allowing companies based here to continue to thrive    Well  like so much of the nonsense that Wall Street spews forth on a regular basis  this particular notion has proved  once again  to be wide of the mark  as the New York Times reveals in     Just a few months ago  market watchers were optimistic that the American economy had decoupled from Europe s problems  able to grow even as the Continent faltered    While most of the focus has been on oppressive debt and debilitated banks in the euro zone  concerns are shifting to the drag that recession in Europe is exerting on the global economy  Over the weekend  President Obama reflected the growing anxiety by saying that Europe s economy is  starting to cast a shadow on our own as well  and that it was partly to blame for the recent slowdown in job creation in the United States    The economy of the European Union  which holds the 17 nations that use the euro currency and 10 others  is a larger economic unit than the United States or China    Corporate profits have been one of the brightest spots in the American economy  but the decline in European revenues is part of the reason that analysts have recently ratcheted down their expectations for profit growth in the second quarter  In the case of technology companies  analysts say they believe that about a third of all revenue comes from Europe    Through the first few months of this year  when technology stocks were leading markets up  the networking giant Cisco was sharing in the good times  ready to leave behind recent difficulties tied to bad acquisitions    Last month  though  Cisco s chief executive acknowledged that the company s economic outlook in Europe had  gotten worse   helping to push the company s shares down 11 percent in one day  A  M  Sacconaghi  a technology analyst at Sanford C  Bernstein   Company  said   As push has come to shove  we have started to see a real shift in outlook     Given that one widely followed gauge of economic activity is wallowing in contraction territory in major economic regions around the world  as shown below  it probably won t be long before another Wall Street fantasy becomes a red ink nightmare ,2012-06-06,Michael Panzner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/red-ink-nightmare-125629,125629
121876,343391,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,France  Sunday is the first round of balloting in the presidential vote and as no candidate is going to capture 50   the runoff among the first two vote getters is May 6  which means that barring a cataclysmic upset  which has happened before in France   Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande will be squaring off against President Nicolas Sarkozy The last polls had Hollande with a 29 5 27 5 lead in the first round  BVA poll 29 24  Hollande  in a CSA survey   with Hollande then winning the second round 56 44  BVA  and 58 42  CSA  National Front candidate Marine Le Pen was in third in both polls at 17  Regardless of who ends up the victor on May 6  the loser is the French people as both Hollande and Sarkozy have failed to address the very real economic dangers the country faces  and or are promoting policies that will only make things far worse  such as Hollande s proposal for a 75  tax rate on those earning more than 1 million euro   1 3 million   which would spark a wealth exodus of immense proportions Then again  when Hollande proclaims   Why continue what has failed   he has a point  Sarkozy has virtually zero successes he can point to outside cooperation with Germany on European Union issues At the same time  Hollande s proposal to renegotiate the EU fiscal compact that is designed to limit government overspending would be a disaster of a different kind at this point  Hollande  aside from his income redistribution platform  seeks to add 60 000 civil servants and teachers  as well as reverse Sarkozy s minimal increase in the pension age from 60 to 62 Meanwhile  Sarkozy is pandering to every voting bloc possible and is threatening his people with the example of Spain   See  this is where we ll be if you elect Hollande  Look at Spain s seven year Socialist experiment  Iran  What a joke  The P5 1  once again the United States  Britain  France  Russia  China and Germany  met with the Iranians last weekend in Istanbul and Catherine Ashton  the inept foreign policy chief for the European Union  described the talks as constructive   We want to now move to a sustained process of dialogue   The parties agreed to meet in five weeks in Baghdad  May 23  Not in two weeks  but five A U S  official said   While the atmosphere today was positive and good enough to warrant a second round  we continue to stress that there is urgency for concrete progress and that the window for diplomatic resolution is closing   But why five weeks The chief Iranian negotiator said Iran had no intention of accepting any demand to halt plans to enrich uranium to 20   which is far beyond the quality needed to generate electricity   The next talks should be based on confidence building measures which would build the confidence of Iranians  You re telling us what to do   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said his nation was prepared to resolve the nuclear dispute in Baghdad  hinting that the chief negotiator was wrong that Iran might be willing to change its enrichment policy But don t you see  This is all part of Iran s stall game  Months and months of negotiations as to just how Iran might change its policy  and where the current 20  enriched uranium would go  and how  and on and on If the Washington Post s David Ignatius is right  we have a lot to fear  Mr  Ignatius believing that a deal is imminent  The Iranians seem to be preparing their public for a deal that limits enrichment while preserving the right to enrich  In an interview Monday with the Iranian student news agency  Foreign Minister  Salehi  explained that  making 20  fuel is our right   but that  if they guarantee that they will provide us with the different levels of enriched fuel that we need  then that would be another issue   Salehi seemed to be reviving a 2009 Turkish plan to export Iran s low enriched uranium abroad  and receive back 20  fuel for its Tehran research reactor  supposedly to make the isotopes  That earlier deal collapsed because of opposition from  Ayatollah  Khamenei  who apparently is now ready to bargain   Translation  The Iranians expect to be paid  in  step by step  increments  as they move toward a deal  At a minimum  they will want a delay of the U S  and European sanctions that take full effect June 28 and July 1  respectively  That timetable gives the West leverage  too   to keep the threatened sanctions in place until the Iranians have made the required concessions  It s a well prepared negotiation  in other words  and it seems likely to succeed if each side keeps to the script and doesn t muff its lines  This is unadulterated bulls     Ayatollah Khamenei  peacemaker  Not one word in Ignatius  widely read column  syndicated around the world  on Iran s chief export  terror  and the hundreds of American lives that have been lost to Iran and its acolytes I m sorry the regime must be taken out  preferably through the toughest sanctions imaginable  as the U S  Congress proposes  not the president  But at the end of the day  the sands of the hourglass are dwindling to a precious few and the P5 1 is looking more and more like it wants to be party to Iran s lies and deceit  as Ehud Barak knows all too well see below  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said of the Istanbul  and soon Baghdad  talks   My initial impression is that Iran has been given a freebie   Iran now has  five weeks to continue enrichment without any limitation  any inhibition  I think Iran should take immediate steps to stop all enrichment  take out all enrichment material and dismantle the nuclear facility at Qom  President Obama replied the U S  hasn t  given away anything  to Iran Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak also said Iran bought five weeks  I am realistic enough to not be so optimistic about talks with Iran  The Iranians have a history of deceiving the world  something through steps like this  So we are a little bit skeptical  Barak mentioned a Muslim notion called Takia  which he said grants Muslims the right to lie in order to deceive non Muslims  for the sake of the religion  It is clear that the Iranians are focused on reaching nuclear capability  and they are ready to defy and deceive the whole world   he said Barak added he did not think Ayatollah Khamenei had yet given the order to start actually building a bomb  but only because he feared a military strike Barak also reiterated that  all options are on the table   meaning it was still possible Israel could strike before the Baghdad talks   Yoni Dayan   Jerusalem Post Israel s ambassador to the United States  Michael Oren  told the Jerusalem Post  We have to prevent a second Holocaust from happening  When Iran says it wants to destroy the state of Israel  which just happens to have six million Jews  we have to take it seriously  Oren stressed that  we can never compare the Holocaust to anything  It s in a league by itself  It s uniquely horrific  But he added   We also have to look for similarities  Egypt  I told you last time the presidential election here  slated for May 23 24  was highly confusing  Now  after the five judge High Election Commission eliminated 10 candidates  including the three most prominent  it becomes even more so  I told you before that ultraconservative Salafist Hazem Abu Ismail faced elimination because his mother was an American citizen and the judges so ruled after a lower court approved his bid  and that Muslim Brotherhood candidate Khairat el Shater faced problems due to a past criminal conviction for which he hadn t been formally pardoned  and so the judges ruled against him as well The case of former Mubarak intelligence chief and vice president Omar Suleiman was different  Suleiman was ruled ineligible because he fell 31 signatures short of the 30 000 needed to get on the ballot  At least that is one explanation I saw  Understand that the judges were all picked by Mubarak so for them to deny the favored candidate of the old establishment shows an encouraging amount of independence But  the final list of candidates is to be revealed April 26 and while all three appealed  and were then turned down again  some say Suleiman may yet be on the approved list After Friday prayers  large demonstrations took place in Tahrir Square to dispute the judges  ruling  though in the case of Abu Ismail  his supporters have absolutely no leg to stand on What you re now left with is Amr Moussa  a former diplomat and secretary general of the Arab League who is preferred by the ruling Supreme Council and is known for his hardline stance on Israel  and Mohammed Mursi  the Muslim Brotherhood s backup candidate  At least as of today  those would be the main frontrunners But then you still have confusion over the new constitution and who is to write it  this after a court disbanded the first panel  which the Brotherhood was also deeply unhappy about  Shater has accused the Supreme  military  Council of attempting to fix the election and the constitution It s really all pretty fascinating  if it wasn t so dangerous Syria  The cease fire has been an unmitigated disaster  Sure  the level of killing is down some  but Syria hasn t complied in terms of moving its military out of the cities as was part of the agreement and UN General Secretary Ban Ki Moon wants 300 observers in the country  though this would require Syrian government support and security To give you a sense of President Bashar Assad s campaign of terror  some Syrian Army defectors talked to the London Times  Martin Fletcher  telling him the Syrian military wanted for nothing when it came to weapons  equipment and food   We had everything in the army The Russians keep delivering supplies   the sergeant said Another said   The leadership told us everything we loot is ours  They told us we were free to take anything and nobody will punish you   Omar  said he defected after being ordered to fire on civilians  He knew five colleagues who had been killed by military security forces  including a friend who was shot in the back for refusing to fire on protesters  If you hesitate to shoot  they shoot you right away  You have only seconds   said another young defector North Korea  Kim Jong Un gave his first public address  which is highly significant  Consider that his father  Kim Jong Il  gave just one his entire tenure  That s kind of startling  They also say the kid seemed relaxed and comfortable in his 20 minute speech before a crowd celebrating Kim Il Sung s 100th birthday  and the new leader s address was carried live on television In the speech  Kim vowed to keep the military as the top priority  with the North earlier declaring that following its failed rocket launch  it was ready  to take retaliatory measures  after the UN Security Council condemned the test as a  serious violation  of UN sanctions  while demanding Pyongyang suspend all further activities related to the ballistic missile program  let alone all work on its nuclear program But it was not even a full resolution  which carries more force  and instead a presidential declaration  not that the UN s resolutions are worth the paper they re written on  China wouldn t agree to a fuller condemnation Bottom line  the February deal between the U S  and North Korea  exchanging food for a suspension of all activity at Yongbyon and the allowance of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors back into the country is off Separately  at the military parade on Sunday  the North unveiled a large new missile that was conveyed on a road mobile launch platform  which observers said shares many similarities to a transporter erector launcher developed by China  so the United Nations is probing whether China exported the technology to North Korea in contravention of multiple UN Security Council resolutions  Nothing  of course  will happen to China even if they did break the rules   U S  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told House lawmakers China was indeed supplying ballistic missile support  China  The death of British businessman Neil Heywood last November  now tied to disgraced politician Bo Xilai s wife  Gu Kailai  is getting murkier and murkier  with a senior Chinese journalist telling the BBC that Heywood s death  initially declared to be the result of alcohol poisoning  was covered up immediately  after police realized the case could be tied to Bo and Gu It was at this point that Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun told his boss  Bo  that he believed Gu may have been involved in the murder  Gu  it seems  was not having an affair with Heywood as first reported  but rather she was upset he spurned her plan to launder massive amounts of funds through Heywood and she became afraid Heywood was about to tell authorities Wang  upon being sacked  sought refuge in the American consulate in Chengdu  where he reportedly told U S  authorities about the murder and attempted to defect But as the New York Times reports  the Obama administration wanted nothing to do with the case  Wang was eventually turned over to Beijing police  instead of the Chongqing authorities who wanted his head  but no one knows what has happened to Wang in Beijing  so the U S  has its prints all over this case as much as British authorities do  they being blamed for not following up on Heywood s death right away  Wang could be put to death for giving secrets to the United States This  friends  is a freakin  mess and also right out of the movies  But it s the biggest political scandal to hit China in years and it comes smack in the midst of a leadership change Bret Stephens   Wall Street Journal In the case of Mr  Bo and his wife  the regime will probably manage it  Show trials are  after all  a Communist specialty  Other party chieftains will probably also get the message to keep a low profile for themselves and their families  at least for the time being  But patterns of authoritarian behavior   particularly nepotism  corruption and rent seeking   are hard to put down in the absence of the accountability mechanisms China so notably lacks  a vigorous free media  periodic elections  economic competition  a bias toward transparency  the rule of law  Instead  the only mechanism the regime has is the purge  It may work in the short term for eliminating enemies or satisfying bloodlusts  It won t work in the long term for shoring up the regime s waning legitimacy  Meantime  China s economy is slowing as income inequality grows   historically an explosive combination  Foreigners in China report that trying to do business is often futile when it isn t outright dangerous  Wealthy Chinese are leaving the country in growing numbers  a de facto vote of no confidence in an economy whose prospects are supposedly limitless  This is not a country on its way to global supremacy  The Bo scandal may pass soon enough  but what it has revealed will prove increasingly difficult to ignore  Afghanistan  The Taliban s sophisticated attack last weekend on Kabul and other provinces was impressive in its scope  with the assault starting precisely at 1 45 p m  But  equally impressive  was the performance of Afghan security forces  a good sign  In the end  it appears 39 militants were killed  five civilians  and 11 Afghan troops But  as NATO reached agreement with the Afghan government on both a timetable for withdrawal and needed ongoing support to maintain the security forces  an estimated  4 billion a year  for which the U S  will probably commit  2 2 billion of it  the Afghans picking up  500 million and the rest of NATO the remaining  1 3 billion   the issue is  what happens when NATO pulls out  Heck  for starters  the Aussies are pulling out their 1 500 troops by year end  a full year early Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there should be no timetable  that NATO forces shouldn t withdraw until Afghan government forces are fully ready India  New Delhi successfully tested an advanced long range missile that extends the range of India s nuclear deterrent to 5 000 km  3 100 miles   meaning it could reach Beijing and Shanghai for the first time not that the Agni V is operationally capable of sending a nuclear warhead as yet  China s state run Global Times warned India not to be  arrogant during disputes with China  India should be clear that China s nuclear power is stronger and more reliable  For the foreseeable future  India would stand no chance in an overall arms race with China   Notice how  otherwise  no one in the world complained about India s test  compared to North Korea s failed one Mexico   The Americas  Forget the largely failed Summit of the Americas in Cartagena  did you see Mexican customs inspectors seized 268 000 rounds of assault rifle ammunition found in a truck at a border crossing in Ciudad Juarez   The guy from Dallas was trying to drive across from El Paso and after the fellow said he had no goods to declare  a gamma ray inspection of the truck s cargo compartment revealed metal canisters holding the ammo  the largest such seizure in memory As for the Summit  forget the Secret Service distraction  albeit a major one  President Obama did reach an accord over labor rights with Colombian President Santos  clearing the way for the free trade agreement that was previously concluded between our two nations to take effect May 15  But he angered American union leaders in the process  while at the same time refusing to sign a statement that would have called for the next summit meeting to include Cuba  so he avoided antagonizing his Cuban American base in Florida think November Even Mexico and Brazil said Cuba should attend the next summit in 2015  Of course it should ,2012-04-25,Brian Trumbore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review-part-iii:-foreign-affairs-121274,121274
121877,343392,NYT,Stocks to Watch When the Market Selloff Ends,opinion,And so the Game ContinuesHeading into every quarter  analysts tend to ease their earnings forecasts  allowing many companies to exceed the newly lowered estimates at least modestly  During the past few years  this has enabled roughly 55  to 60  of companies to consistently beat their quarterly consensus estimates  The early read on the first quarter of 2012  a hefty 80  of companies have topped profit forecasts  according to S P Capital IQ   Should that hold up  it will be the best showing in six years  or 24 reporting periods     Why such a solid start to this earnings season  Analyst conservatism gets some of the credit  but it s pretty clear that the U S  economy is holding its own while many key trading partners wrestle with distress    Indeed  70  of companies that have reported results thus far have topped sales forecasts  Bare in mind  though  that profit margin gains are likely to prove elusive  so solid sales results will be necessary to fuel bottom line gains    Still  macro concerns    mostly tied to Europe and China    have pulled the market south even as U S  corporate profits gather steam  In fact  companies that are beating forecasts have seen only modest initial trading gain  According to Bespoke Investment Group  the average estimate topping performance yielded an average 0 8  gain  Any company that missed its forecast subsequently fell by 4  the next trading day    NOW is the Time to Start Building your Watch List With the market in selloff mode  even recent gains are losing ground  This process could take a while to play out  so it may be time to compile a list of stocks that you are prepared to buy  even if  for the moment  you choose to stay on the sidelines    Which brings us back to the companies topping sales and profit forecasts right now  When the market stabilizes  investors are likely to circle right back to them and start loading up    Here s a list of companies that have topped profit forecasts  and the resulting gains or losses since results were released  Each company has a minnimum market value of  500 million  beating profit forecasts by at least 25   Most of these stocks have risen a bit higher  but as you dig into the actual earnings reports  you ll see that many would have seen much more substantial post earnings gains if the broader market hadn t been so weak    To be sure  some of these companies need to deliver more than just a solid quarter to boost investor interest  The New York Times Co   NYSE  NYT   for example  has yet to deliver top line growth  Its sales are expected to fall another 11  this year to around  2 07 billion  Yahoo s  Nasdaq  YHOO  cost cutting may have helped its bottom line  but this is still a company wandering in the wilderness  And Peabody Energy s  NYSE  BTU  quarterly results have been overshadowed by woes throughout the broader coal industry  though the company s outlook may be brighter than many suspect    A Little noticed Turnaround One stock stands out from this group  It remains unloved  ceding ground after a recent solid quarter  yet is showing signs of a turnaround  I m talking about AMD  NYSE  AMD   which has been slowly showing growth after new management settled in last fall  I first suggested investors check out this chip maker last summer  right before the market plunged  Since then  shares have staged a nice rebound  but still look quite undervalued   Toiling in Intel s  Nasdaq  INTC  shadow  AMD will always have to win customers by offering a better price  which has often lead to relatively weak gross margins  And that s no easy feat as AMD can t muster Intel s manufacturing scale to hammer down unit costs  So  non GAAP gross margins of 46 0   160 basis points above consensus forecasts and a similar improvement from a year ago  are notable  and management says that  thanks to recent renegotiations at a key foundry  its margins will keep rising throughout the year   To be sure  PC sales remain weak  and AMD is only expected to boost sales at a 4  5  clip in 2012  to around  6 8 billion  What does that mean for the bottom line  Analysts are all over the map  The low end of the consensus sees earnings of  0 50 per share  while the more optimistic forecast  0 90 per share    Analysts at Citigroup digested AMD s first quarter results and came up with a profit forecast of  0 80 a share  They noted that the company is finally taking market share  albeit from a low base  in both the server and PC markets  They figure   AMD is now righting the ship and noticeable low hanging fruit exists just as the cycle is turning   They see shares rising from a current  7 50  with a price target of  12  a 60  gain     Risks to Consider  Whenever looking at companies that have topped estimates  you must look at the broader picture to see whether it is part of a broader trend and not the result of short term benefits    Action to Take     As I said earlier  AMD was the name that stood out to me from this list  But that doesn t mean the other stocks on this list aren t worthy investments  either  The fact that most of these stocks are up modestly despite posting solid quarters tells you that they may be the first to rebound when the market stabilizes  We may not be there yet  but this is a great time to do further research  BY David

121883,343398,NYT,Yes  They Do  Low Interest Rates Do Make Stocks Cheap ,opinion,Introduction  Pessimism Is For Losers   I m inspired to write this article because I am so frustrated by the plethora of all the so called expert market prognosticators that continuously bombard the public with negative forecasts  I consider this to be both erroneous and irrational  When the markets are doing well  we are immediately inundated with articles talking about how the market has surely topped and a big drop is imminent   When markets are doing poorly  we are flooded with numerous forecasts of just how bad it s going to be  The real truth of the matter is that nobody really knows  Not the Federal Reserve  nor any of the so called experts who are more than willing to provide us with their forecasts of doom and gloom  Pessimism is pervasive  but optimism is  in fact  more accurate and rational in my opinion    The best investing minds that I ve come across  which are also the ones with the best long term track records  universally agree that timing markets  or forecasting the economy or interest rates  etc   are exercises in futility  The great investor Bernard Baruch put it quite succinctly when he said     Don t try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top  It can t be done except by liars   Bernard Baruch   Or you could look to the sage advice from Peter Lynch that he offered in Chapter 2 of Beating The Street his best selling book  which I highly recommend to anyone with money invested  Chapter 2 is titled  The Weekend Worrier  In this chapter Peter talks about the same issues that I m complaining about in this article  The Weekend Worrier  as Peter calls them  always have many draconian reasons why they believe it s not a good time to invest in stocks or why the economy is bad and getting worse  But Peter makes a very strong point with the first two sentences of Chapter 2     The key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them  This cannot be over emphasized     And later in the book Peter provides us with Peter Principle number 19 where he says     unless you are a short seller or a poet looking for a wealthy spouse  it never pays to be pessimistic     And finally  I would like to share two of his 25 Golden Rules of Investing  he actually gives us 26   numbers 18 and 19     Golden rule number 18  there is always something to worry about  Avoid weekend thinking and ignore the latest dire predictions of the newscasters  Sell a stock because the company s fundamentals deteriorate  not because the sky is falling      Golden rule number 19 nobody can predict interest rates  the future direction of the economy  or the stock market  Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what s actually happening to the companies in which you ve invested     My goal with this introduction was to establish a foundation that supports optimism over pessimism  Secondarily  my objective was to point out that forecasting the economy  markets  interest rates or any other macro event is both impossible and an exercise in futility  However  it never ceases to amaze me how so many people continue to incessantly promogulate headline after headline and article after article positing their negative forecasts about the economy  the stock market  interest rates  etc  No matter how often they are proven wrong  and they usually are  they remain a persistent and shameless group    Recently there has been a spate of articles debating whether or not stocks are cheap relative to things like interest rates or forward PE ratios  These articles really get my blood boiling because they tend to be full of forecasts about the very things which I have suggested cannot be forecast  Therefore  I find that their cases are full of opinion  but usually very light on facts  But perhaps most of all  they state their cases with an arrogance and conviction that I find too incredulous to tolerate  Therefore  my goal is to counter these articles based more on fact than opinion and most importantly of all  on real numbers rather than statistical inferences    Stocks Are Cheap Relative to Earnings  Past Present and Future    Before I go on  I want to be clear  and consistent with what I ve already written  by stating that I do not believe in predicting economies or stock markets in general  Instead  I believe in analyzing and investing in specific  individual  well run companies at sensible or attractive valuations  However  if I feel compelled to talk about the markets in general  it is usually because I was incited by the types of articles I ve been referring to throughout this piece  Moreover  I try to focus on the actual facts as they currently exist  Consequently  if there is any forecasting involved  it needs to be based on a short time period and upon a reasonable range of probabilities given what we do already know    The following  reviews the S P 500 Index since the beginning of calendar year 1994  The orange line on this graph plots earnings per share at a PE ratio  earnings multiple  of 15  To be clear  as you look at this graph recognize that if the stock price  black line  is above the orange line  then the PE ratio is over 15  if the stock price is below the orange line  then the PE is less than 15  and of course if the price is touching the orange line  then the PE ratio of the S P 500 is precisely 15  The same can be said about the historically normal price earnings ratio  blue line   however  this line is a calculated PE ratio of 19 3    With the exception of the last earnings plot  the orange line is based on actual reported earnings  what we do already know    and therefore  is a factual portrayal of how   Mr  Market  has been valuing the S P 500 Index since 1994  To repeat  when the price is above the orange line the S P 500 is overvalued  when the price is touching the orange line the S P 500 is fairly valued  and when the price  black line  is below the orange line  as it is now  the S P 500 is undervalued  Statistically speaking  which is a language I hate to speak in  a PE ratio of 15 is the long term historical average PE ratio for the S P 500  Once again  statistically speaking  a PE ratio of 20 is the historical norm over the past 20 years  note that the blue line on the graph is drawn using a calculated PE of 19 3 over the past 19 years  which is obviously very close to the 20 year average of 20     However  even though these ratios are statistically  mathematically  portrayed  a closer scrutiny of the graph can show how statistics can be misleading  Instead of relying on a mere numerical statistical calculation  the reviewer can clearly see how the market has actually valued the S P 500 since 1994  More importantly  by carefully studying the graph we can see a vivid and clear picture of when the S P 500 was overvalued  fairly valued or undervalued  Therefore  based on actual 2011 earnings and Standard   Poor s Corp  s own forecast for 2012 earnings  we see a clear depiction of the S P 500 s current valuation  Since the price is below the orange line  it is clear that current PE ratio of 13 9 on the S P 500 indicates modest undervaluation at this time  I believe this is fact not fantasy  certainly the historical part is With this next graph  I plot the yield of the 10 year Treasury note  the burgundy shaded area  with the actual S P 500 PE ratios since 1994  dark blue line   There are two very interesting phenomenon that this graphic reveals  one I would consider normal  and the other aberrant  The normal phenomenon runs from approximately 1994 to 2002  Here we find an expected correlation between interest rates and stock values  As interest rates are falling  the yellow arrow  we see a logical increase in the PE ratio of the S P 500  blue line   This is logical  because as interest rates on Treasury Notes move lower  they simultaneously become less competitive with stock returns  and therefore  stock valuations increase as demand for stocks logically increases However  from 2002 to current time we see a conflicting relationship between interest rates and stock prices  In this case  as interest rates continued to decline  stock valuations  PE s  followed suit and declined as well  In theory  this should not happen  Because with interest rates so low  as a practical matter bonds become less competitive to stocks  but even worse  today bonds don t even offer any real return  This is especially true when you compare blue chip dividend yields available from stalwarts such as PepsiCo  PEP   Proctor   Gamble  PG   and Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   etc   to interest rates  For the first time since I can remember  these companies are offering higher dividend yields than not only the 10 year Treasury but the 30 year as well Therefore  interest rates are clearly very low  which is another way of saying bond prices are excessively high  Conversely  dividend yields are significantly higher than normal  which is a straightforward and simple indicator that blue chip dividend paying stocks at least  are currently inexpensive  Typically  bonds are attractive because and when they provide a significantly higher yield  but no growth  as compared to a stock  Therefore  when you can buy stocks with higher yields than bonds  it should be clear to anyone with any common sense that stocks are cheap and bonds are expensive  Many authors of financial articles  and other pundits are very fond of reporting all types of statistical  what I like to call innuendo  that doesn t hold up under real world scrutiny  So maybe it s not true that statistics don t lie  and thus maybe both statistics and statisticians are darn liars  Perhaps unintentionally  but when examined against the truth  their hypotheses are more often than not proven false  Nevertheless  thre is a large cadre of people that are willing to bet their portfolios  and consequently their financial futures on what these authors present and promote The following graphic shows the actual historical record of 10 year Treasury Bond yields since 1890  Therefore  I let the reader decide for themselves whether or not interest rates are currently at aberrantly low levels or not Specifically  Some Stocks are Cheap and Some Are Very ExpensiveAs I ve stated more than once for this article  I believe in dealing with specifics rather than generalities  Therefore  I offer two specific examples of well known companies where one is cheap  while the other is expensive  The following are two examples of individual companies that are being priced by the exact same stock market  I ask that the reader please recognize that I am not writing about either of these specific examples  Instead  I am simply using them to illustrate that general statements about stocks can be very misleading Oracle Corp   ORCL The orange line on the following historical earnings and price correlated graph of Oracle Corp   ORCL  shows that this consistent and fast growing technology company is clearly trading below its intrinsic value  the orange line   Even though this company has grown earnings almost 3 times faster than the S P 500  it can currently be purchased at a PE ratio of 12 2 which is less than you can buy the average company for  In other words  whether or not the stock market in general is cheap  I for one will certainly argue that Oracle definitely is Brown   Forman  BF B In contrast to Oracle Corp   we discover that Brown Forman with a significantly lower earnings growth rate is currently trading at one of its highest valuations ever  When you consider that this company trades at a PE ratio of 23 3 versus the S P 500 at a PE ratio of 13 7 or against Oracle with a PE ratio of only 12 1  we can see a wide variation in stock valuations of individual stocks as compared to the S P 500 index   The major point that I am attempting to make with the above portion of this article is that I believe focusing on generalities like the S P 500 s valuation is less relevant   and even misleading  than looking at individual companies instead  In other words  unless you are investing in the index  I believe it always makes more sense to focus on what you actually own and their relative valuations    Optimism The More Rational Perspective   Based on extensive research that I have conducted  and research that I am continuing to carry out  I believe the case for optimism regarding the future of the economies of our country  and even the world  is more persuasive than a negative view  Nevertheless  there continues to be a pervasive and prolific amount of negative press and articles suggesting that our economy is going to hell in a hand basket  And even worse  is the arrogant and even sanctimonious conviction where many writers present their opinion as fact  In other words  I can tolerate someone expressing their opinion  but I cannot tolerate expressing something you cannot possibly know as fact    For example  I will paraphrase a comment that I recently read that illustrates my point  An author wrote an article expressing his view that economic growth in the future will be below trend and he followed this statement with the following words in parenthesis  which it almost certainly will be  followed by words to the effect that earnings growth will almost certainly be below trend  An underlying theme of this article is that neither he  nor I  nor anyone else can say with certainty what our future economic growth will be  The best that we can expect to do is to assess the facts and assign the most reasonable range of probabilities we can logically estimate  When I do this  I see a preponderance of evidence suggesting that our future sits on the threshold of the greatest growth ever witnessed in the history of humanity    Most importantly  I base my optimistic view on looking to the future  By doing this  the evidence becomes very clear  technological advancements are improving our lives and economic opportunities at a mind numbing and accelerating rate  However  far too many of us remain traumatized  and therefore  negative  Although the vast majority of us have a mountain of positive aspects in our lives and economic well being to focus on  and perhaps only a thimble full of negative aspects  we tend to obsess with the negative while ignoring the positive  This may be the greatest risk of all that we face    In the current New York Times best selling book   Abundance the Future is Better Than You Think the authors Peter H  Diamandis and Steven Kotler put it in these words as they close Chapter 2 of their book     but first it s helpful to understand a little more about the roots of this cynicism  and why it s this reaction    the inability of people to see the positive trends through the sea of bad news    that may be the biggest stumbling block on the road toward abundance     In other words  the above authors  like me  believe that perhaps the biggest risk we face is our attitude about the future  However  even our attitudes cannot stop the unbelievable potential in front of us  Unfortunately  most economic theory is based on what many call the scarcity principle  Under this theory  people constantly worry about dividing our economic pie into enough slices for everyone  However  what we are ignoring is that for the first time in history we will very soon no longer need to figure out how to divide our current pie  but instead we are learning how to bake an almost infinite number of more pies  Once we accomplish this  then abundance for all is certainly within our grasp    Summary and Conclusion   I fully acknowledge that there are numerous economic challenges and problems facing us  And furthermore  I acknowledge that some of these problems are significant enough to frighten or even overwhelm us  However  I also believe that we should never underestimate the indomitable human spirit and its enthusiasm  willingness and capability of solving even our most serious problems    In the book Abundance referenced above  the authors discuss current and future advancements that portend to solve most of the challenges facing the world  These would include energy  education  healthcare  water scarcity and much more  The solutions they are writing about are available today or will be available within the next decade or two  In other words  most of what they are talking about already is available or will be in the very near future    As I come to the end of this article I would like to share two of my all time favorite quotes  one by American anthropologist Margaret Mead and the other from the 1997 Apple  Computer advertising campaign Think Different   that were also included in the book Abundance     Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful  committed citizens can change the world  Indeed  it is the only thing that ever has  Margaret Mead   And from Apple s Think Different advertising campaign     Think Different here s to the crazy ones  the misfits  the rebels  the troublemakers  the round pegs in square holes  the ones who see things differently    they re not fond of rules  you can quote them  disagree with them  glorify or vilify them  but the only thing you can t do is ignore them because they change things  they push the human race forward  and while some may see them as the crazy ones  we see genius  because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones who do       With my final remarks on my belief in the validity of optimism  I would like to reference another book that I believe is a must read written by Matt Ridley appropriately titled The Rational Optimist as follows     it will be hard to snuff out the flame of innovation  because it is such an evolutionary  bottom up phenomenon in such a networked world  So long as human exchange and specialization are allowed to thrive somewhere  then culture evolves whether leaders help it or hinder it  and the result is that prosperity spreads  technology progresses  poverty declines  disease retreats  fecundity falls  happiness increases  violence atrophies  freedom grows  knowledge flourishes  the environment improves  and wilderness expands     The bottom line point of this article is that the only way that it could be argued that stocks are not historically cheap today is to believe the pessimists who say that our future economy and corporate earnings are going to be weak  However  if you take an optimistic approach  as I do  then the only rational conclusion that can be made is that stocks are cheap today    Disclosure   Long PEP  PG  JNJ and ORCL at the time of writing    Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are for

should not give much comfort we will see a big number  or at least one much above estimates   The U S  Treasury Department said two weeks ago that the Troubled Asset Relief Program  TARP  would turn a profit  but a report to Congress out of the Office of the Special Inspector General for TARP read   After 3   years  the TARP continues to be an active and significant part of the Government s response to the financial crisis  It is a widely held misconception that TARP will make a profit  The most recent cost estimate for TARP is a loss of  60 billion  Taxpayers are still owed  118 5 billion  Unreal  The administration is feeding us another pack of lies You see  it s all about the smaller banks that were rescued that are still struggling to repay the bailout money The report goes on to say that the rescue  is not without profound long term consequences  A significant legacy of TARP is increased moral hazard and potentially disastrous consequences associated with institutions deemed too big to fail    Trustees for the Medicare and Social Security trust funds said both are on  unsustainable paths   nothing new here  and will be exhausted by 2024 and 2033  respectively   Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner  though  said the 2010 healthcare law would lower costs on Medicare and other administration officials said the same  as in Obamacare will save Medicare  200 billion through 2016  For the other side Jennifer Rubin   Washington Post Douglas Holtz Eakin and Michael Ramlet from the American Action Forum provide some useful detail  on Medicare   They write   In 2011  Medicare spent  549 1 billion on medical services for America s seniors but only collected  260 8 billion in payroll taxes and monthly premiums  Trustees have now issued a funding warning for

push those through  but he s already done more than Obama has in over three years in the White House  Steven Rattner   Financial Times As for the Medicare health insurance plan for the elderly  while its outlook didn t deteriorate last year  it remains in an even more dismal state than Social Security  Over the next 75 years  using realistic assumptions  Medicare costs are projected to increase from less than 4 percent gross domestic product to more than 10 percent of GDP  Still more depressing than these grisly statistics is the utter lack of progress in addressing so obvious and so cataclysmic a problem  Every day that goes by either brings America s elderly closer to a huge cut in their benefits or threatens every younger generation with an equally huge bill to pay    Mexico s attorney general will investigate allegations that federal officials received bribes from Wal Mart in order to speed up permits of new stores in that country   As first reported by the New York Times in an incredibly detailed piece that may be destined for a Pulitzer  hundreds of suspected illegal payments totaling more than  24 million are alleged to have been made  which would be a major violation of the United States  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  which forbids bribing officials to secure business abroad But the issue isn t so much the fine that the U S  government could levy on Wal Mart  rather it s the management changes that could result from the probe as current CEO Mike Duke was reportedly apprised of the Mexico bribes shortly after being named head of Wal Mart s international division in 2005  overseeing Mexico operations  Duke took the helm of the company overall in 2009 The Times reports that Wal Mart didn t pass on the allegations at the time to U S  or Mexican authorities  let alone conduct an internal probe of any substance   Moody s Investors Service said China s growth will slow to anywhere between 7 5 and 8 5 percent this year  vs  the 8 1 to 8 6 estimate generally out there   In other words  further ammo for the soft landing camp  HSBC issued its PMI for April  almost always more conservative than the government figure  and for April it was 49 1  which was an improvement over March s 48 3  But you can t dismiss comments such as that out of Otis Elevator  which saw new orders from China slide 21 percent in the first quarter as a result of heavy exposure to high end residential housing markets And Caterpillar said it had overestimated Chinese demand on construction equipment  stating its inventories were so high it was exporting machinery to other countries where demand was tight  CAT said demand would decline in China this year  down from a prior forecast of 5 10 percent growth  But  CAT still reported a very solid quarter because China makes up just 3 percent of its overall sales  10 percent of its business in Asia   It would seem  however  that CAT s expansion plans in China  where it just opened its 16th manufacturing facility with nine more under construction  are rather suspect   Hal Weitzman   Financial Times   So as alluded to above  Apple kicked butt as sales in China more than doubled and

121889,343404,NYT,A New Old Explanation For Recessions And Financial Crises ,opinion,Edward Conard  a retired executive of Bain Capital and a major donor to Mitt Romney s presidential campaign  tells us that the precipitating cause of the 2008 financial crisis was a surge in demand for liquidity  He s right  of course  The appetite for safety went into overdrive in the final months of that fateful year  This may be a controversial explanation in some circles  but it shouldn t be  Divisive or not  Conard s accounting of how the economy nearly melted down is an excuse to consider how far we ve come  or not  in dissecting the business cycle when it goes negative in the extreme  It s also an opportunity for a refresher course on considering the practical policy responses  A lot of people don t realize that what happened in 2008 was nearly identical to what happened in 1929   Conard tells The New York Times Magazine   Depositors ran to the bank to withdraw their money only to discover  like the citizens of Bedford Falls  in the movie It s a Wonderful Life  that there was no money in the vault  All that money had been lent  Conard s views would be of minimal interest if he was just another voice in the black hole of economic opinion these days  But as a wealthy individual who s  at least  1 million to help Romney reach the White House  his thoughts on the dismal science are destined to attract more than casual scrutiny  In fact  Conard welcomes the attention  considering that he s the author of a new book slated for publication next month  a book that s sure to inflame debate about the nature and role of wealth in America    As for Conard s views on 2008 s meltdown  his argument that the economy was blindsided by a bank run  albeit a 21st century version with lots of moving parts  is largely correct  Granted  the definition of  bank  has expanded dramatically since the days of FDR  but the underlying concept still holds  The details on why everyone suddenly demanded safe assets in late 2008 is a frenzy of debate  however  The explanations via the book trade in this niche  for instance  run the gamut  from Richard Posner s  to Robert Hetzel s explanation of  monetary disorder  in  to Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera s narrative that financial securitization via Wall Street unleashed the recession  as they report in   to name but a few of the titles The truth is that no one s really sure what sets off recessions  i e   why liquidity demand surges  The smoking gun for thinking so is the reality that the recessions keep coming  But the presumption for thinking that it s all clear is a constant  Take the argument that it was the housing bubble that crashed and killed the boom  Sounds plausible  and for some it s the last word on what went wrong  To some extent  it s a reasonable assessment  But as you dig into the details  it becomes clear that the bull market in housing had started deflating several years before the financial system went into freefall in the fall of 2008  What changed to make 2008 the straw that broke the economy s back  There are a host of theories on this point alone  Indeed  the recession officially began in January 2008  according to NBER  but the calamity didn t arrive until September  Unsurprisingly  there s precious little consensus here either  Was letting Lehman Brothers go under the crucial event  The answer varies  depending on who s at the podium  Even if we could definitively figure out cause and effect  it s not likely that the details will hold lessons for preventing responding to the next recession  Recessions  like murder and fingerprints  are unique  There are common traits  but it s not obvious that provides us with clear solutions  But if there s rarely agreement on what triggers slumps  economists are still debating what s behind the Great Depression of the 1930s   there s at least a fair amount of harmony on how to keep the whole system from collapsing when disaster strikes  In a recent  presented at the Russell Sage Foundation s  conference  professor Brad DeLong reminds that Walter Bagehot 1873 book  still offers advice on how to respond to financial crises that s  remarkably close to the best we can do  even today   The  will remain the state of the art response as long as the crises keep coming  It s tempting to think that  in macro  but it never is  at least not when it comes to the fundamentals  The reason why Bagehot s advice remains practical is because the recessions keep coming and no one s sure how to stop this ebb and flow  or even tame it   That doesn t stop anyone from trying  or arguing that the business cycle has finally been deciphered  Perhaps  but I ll keep a copy of Lombard Street handy just in case ,2012-05-03,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-new-old-explanation-for-recessions-and-financial-crises-122085,122085
121895,343410,NYT,Week in Review Part I  Europe  Washington And Wall Street,opinion,Note  I was out of touch  Friday  and will catch up on a few things next time Europe  Washington and Wall StreetThe official PMI data on manufacturing in the eurozone was an awful 45 9 for April  down from 47 7 in March  50 being the dividing line between growth and contraction   Euro area unemployment is up to 10 9   the worst since the start of the euro in 1999  with Spain at 24  and Greece nearly 22   Even stalwart Germany has to be concerned that 40  of its exports are to the eurozone  and 60  to the EU overall  But this Sunday we have critical elections in France and Greece  as well as a sleeper vote in Serbia   and the outcome is not going to be market friendly in either  As discussed further below  Socialist Francois Hollande seems a lock to prevail  after which German Chancellor Angela Merkel will scramble to find a meeting of the minds with a man who has vowed to trash Merkel s beloved fiscal compact that enforces budget discipline  While in Greece  well  you know how I feel about this one  It s going to be chaos and likely deadly You know how much I ve been writing about the far right in Greece  On Sunday  the Times of London had the headline   Fears of anarchy as neo Nazis recruit Greeks with food   The New York Times had a similar piece  highlighting the black clad Golden Dawn party that calls for sealing the borders  Golden Dawn s logo resembles a swastika  It s conceivable they could poll 3  to 5  of the parliamentary vote as they take over the rapidly growing ghettos of Athens Meanwhile  in Spain  everyone was giddy when on Thursday the government sold the amount of debt it was looking to  Whoopty damn do  The interest rate on the three year garbage was 4 03  vs  2 61  in March  S P also downgraded 16 Spanish banks and Spain  like other European countries  had rather extensive May Day protests  though thankfully violence was limited  That will come later  as the central government still must extract further severe cuts from the regional and local governments that Madrid has been funding  Spain s PMI for April  by the way  was 43 5  That s not very good  sports fans Back to Germany  finance minister Wolfgang Schauble reiterated his country s limited appetite for growth oriented policies  The first precondition in order to have sustainable growth everywhere in Europe is fiscal consolidation  If now we talk about growth  it shouldn t be understood as a change of direction  That would be a mistake  Schauble s Spanish counterpart  Luis de Guindos  said   There s no contradiction between budget cuts and economic growth  Budget cuts are essential to create the conditions to finance growth  Or as economist Martin Feldstein wrote in the Financial Times  the Spanish government depends  on foreign and domestic investors who are now reluctant to lend to a government that may be insolvent  The challenge is to rebuild their confidence  But  alas  11 of 27 European Union nations are in recession and a bunch more are threatening to officially join them as the people are more than restless European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said  we have to

Hollande will not only be quickly introduced to his fellow leaders  He may also be quickly  and brusquely  introduced to the bond markets  Which is what I see  a rude introduction Turning to the U S  economy  the data was decidedly mixed  Global markets got all excited over the ISM reading on manufacturing for April  54 8  but then at week s end  the service sector came in at 53 5  way below expectations and March s 56 0 number Additionally  March factory orders  down 1 5   were the worst since March 2009  but jobless claims came in at 365 000  better than the recent pace of 385 000  Of course all of this  including a poor ADP jobs number  was leading up to Friday s employment report for April  which  in a word  sucked  Just 115 000 jobs added  though the unemployment rate ticked down to 8 1   the lowest in three years  but that was only because 342 000 left the labor force I can t say I ve followed economist Nouriel Roubini much lately  but I don t disagree with his view that the U S  economy will stagnate  at least through 2013  citing some of the following from a presentation at the Milken Institute s 2012 Global Conference  As reported by Andrew Tangel of the Los Angeles Times  Among major issues Roubini cited  The possibility of military confrontation between Iran and Israel and the United States  Long term political conflicts in the Middle East  which he called a  total mess   The Arab Spring  he predicted   will become an Arab winter   Energy  There s no U S  energy strategy or policy in place   Where is the leadership   he said   The European debt

There are many sophisticated theories today about why politics have become so polarized and immobilized  Ideologues have captured both parties  it s said  primary challenges by right  and left wing zealots doom centrists  cable television and the Internet favor simplistic  highly partisan rhetoric and argument  Political divisions are accentuated  consensus becomes harder  There s something to these theories  but they also subtly misrepresent and excuse our present paralysis  More promises were made than can be kept without raising taxes  which   for the most part   were also subject to bipartisan promises against increases  Almost everyone agrees that massive budget deficits pose a long term economic threat  though no one can be precise about how or when the threat might emerge  A central question about our political system is whether  after decades of making more promises to more groups  it can withdraw some promises to minimize the threat  So far  the answer is  no   Political leaders don t lead  They take the path of least resistance  which has been to do little except to find scapegoats    the rich    special interests    liberals    conservatives    that arouse

 Eric Weinstein  National Bureau of Economic Research  14 December 2001     the problem may not be that there are too few STEM qualified college graduates  but rather that STEM firms are unable to attract them  Highly qualified students may be choosing a non STEM job because it pays better  offers a more stable professional career  and  are  perceived as less exposed to competition from low

shortage of qualified native born scientists and engineers in the US The glut of science and engineering  S E  degree holders in the US has caused many S E graduates to seek work in other fields  Less than one third of S E degree holders are working in a field closely related to their degree  while 65  are either employed in or training for a career in another field within 2 years of graduating Wages in science  technology  engineering and mathematics  STEM  occupations have not kept pace with those of other college graduates  and in some occupations have actually decreased The Government

Excerpt     I do not find any credible evidence of anything approaching a shortage in manufacturing workers anywhere in the country   said Andrew Sum  a professor of economics at Northeastern University who specializes in education and the labor market    The Bureau of Labor Statistics also calculates job openings in manufacturing   and its numbers are less than half those cited by the Post  which attributed its figures to the Manufacturing Institute  an industry trade group  According to the government data  last year the average number of vacancies was less than 230 000  There are seven to eight times that many unemployed manufacturing workers  Sum said  The Post reported that the shortage of skilled workers has also pushed up wages  But here  too  Sum said  the evidence does not match up    Since the beginning of the century  manufacturing wages for production workers have barely increased  Sum said  And in the last two years  as employers have said they ve been having difficulty filling spots  wages have declined slightly   If there was a big shortage of workers  than we should find wages rising  But this just isn t the case   Sum said   That doesn t mean that specific companies won t ever have trouble finding a machinist  but when you add it all up  it doesn t amount to very much       The point of the argument is to then say   We don t need to ramp up demand or infrastructure investment  We need to fix people    said Paul Osterman  a professor of human resources and management at the M I T  Sloan School of Management  This rhetoric  Osterman added  fits well with another priority for business owners   Firms are always interested in shifting the costs of training to the public sector   he said    Over the past 30 years  experts say  most in house training programs at manufacturers have disappeared  The programs have never been entirely replaced  even as private and public training programs have been created  with a wide range of success in employment placement  Recently  more companies have looked to states to train their workforces    North Carolina  for example  spent  1 million to develop a custom curriculum at a community college for workers at a Caterpillar plant  The primary beneficiary  The New York Times reported  was Caterpillar itself   c       David Neumark and Rob Valletta  Federal Reserve of San Francisco  30 April 2012   Abstract    Some observers have argued that the nation s high unemployment rate during the current recovery stems partly from widespread mismatches between the skills of jobseekers and the needs of employers  A recent San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank conference on workforce skills considered evidence that employers have had difficulties finding workers with appropriate skills in recent years  However  these mismatches do not appear to be much more severe than in the past  Overall  the conference proceedings suggested the U S  economy can still produce good jobs for workers at a variety of skill levels   d       Paul Krugman  New York Times  8 May 2012   Excerpt  Now consider the argument that our problems are mainly structural  The way this story is usually told is that we had too many workers in the wrong industries  that we have to expect a depressed level of overall employment as workers are moved out of these  bloated  sectors    OK  so what should be the signature of that story  Surely it is that job losses should be concentrated in the bloated sectors  that employment should if anything be rising elsewhere   and wages should be rising in the unbloated sectors more rapidly than in the bloated ones    So  let s take a quick look at BLS data on  and   Here s what we get on a first pass     7   What about employers paying fair wages  but unable to find skilled workers    A common reply to evidence about  scarce jobs but flat wage  is that the wages offered are  fair   so they should attract workers    Do these people believe in capitalism and free markets   Perhaps they would prefer that wages   or all prices   be set by a board of wise and well informed technocrats  who plan an efficient and prosperous economy    It s economics 101  supply and demand are met by changes in price  If workers are scarce  then wages rise   which will increase supply  If an employer refuses to raise wages  wages are a small fraction of costs in most manufacturing industries   then the employer is just whining about the lack of cheap workers   8   For more information Other articles     David Wessel  Wall Street Journal  19 September 2011    Yves Smith  Naked

121911,343426,NYT,Prices Should Fall This Tax Season ,opinion,US taxpayers in April 2011 sent  140 billion to the US Treasury  While I have no idea how much taxes will be paid this April  I am pretty sure that billions of dollars in stocks still will be sold to pay taxes That should keep pressure on stock prices the rest of this week  everything else being equal The biggest story today is that the financial markets were shocked  shocked that Friday s jobs number was disappointing  After all  the Bureau of Labor Statistic had been guessing that an average of 250 000 new jobs were created each month  after seasonal adjustments  from December to February  Over that same time frame there appeared to be an improving trend in weekly new unemployment claims What I am most shocked about is that almost everyone on Wall Street seems to believe that the Bureau of Labor Statistics initial estimate of new jobs and unemployment claims are as accurate as if they were generated by a ticket taker counting admissions  The Wall Street Journal  the New York Times  the talking heads on CNBC  other than Rick Santuli  all did not voice any reservations what so ever about the quality of the BLS number  Not one report stated that the initial BLS job number often gets revised dramatically up and down before getting finalized years later when the income tax returns are totaled up Everyone was shocked about last Friday s number except us  We  at TrimTabs track real time withheld income and employment taxes sent to the US Treasury every day by all employers and from that estimate job growth and changes in wages and salaries The Bureau of Labor Statistics does a monthly survey of 140 000 employers that is 75  or so complete by the Friday when they guess as to how many jobs were created the prior month  That monthly survey is tempered by historic jobs data supplied by the states that is five to seven months old  What few also appear to realize is that the weekly unemployment claims number is also just a guess and surprise  the number of new unemployment claims have been revised up big time In other words  the initial BLS employment is a preliminary guess  Last year we were reporting that more jobs were being created than what the BLS was saying  It wasn t until a month ago that the BLS revised last year s first quarter jobs to roughly what we had reported This year  we are saying that about 140 000 jobs were created on average each of the past four months  The BLS is saying about 250 000 jobs were created monthly between December and February To repeat for the umpteenth time the BLS ignores the real time data embedded in the daily withheld income and employment tax payments as to how many people are working  what industries and where and how much they make before and after tax  Wouldn t that be useful real time information for a real time financial market to know  But no  the BLS uses survey methodology initially developed in the 1950 s and 60 s I keep asking why does it seem as if I am all alone in asking that the US government use real time data for jobs and incomes instead of snail mail technology  Does no one else care  If you do care and want to help  please ask the other bloggers you visit to pick up the baton and also ask why does the US government ignore real time data on jobs and incomes Below You May Find The Video ,2012-04-10,Charles Biderman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/prices-should-fall-this-tax-season-119608,119608
121912,343427,NYT,How Institutional Investors Can Make Money In Private Equity ,opinion,The recently printed a scathing article on the performance of the alternative investments sought by some public sector pension plans to diversify away from bonds paying nest to nothing and stocks that have become increasingly volatile It looks like the pension funds are worse off than if they had stuck to vanilla bonds and stocks  not least because of the management fees they pay to alternative investment managers Yet  there may be a way to reap the alternative investment premium  which for most large pension plans is not a skill premium but instead an illiquidity premium  Perhaps there are lessons to be learned from large Canadian public sector pensions plans They are relatively new to the alternative scene  having been formed only in the 1990s  But many have embraced alternatives wholeheartedly  while acknowledging a margin of error  We ll never get the price point right   says Jim Fasano  vice president head of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board s principal investment group  CPPIB controls  152 billion in assets  making it one of the larger investment pools in the world  Unlike U S  Social Security  its assets are not held in non marketable bonds  instead  in its short history the CPPIB approved its first  mostly passive investments in 1998  it has not only made a mark in private equity  but also profited  It has roughly a 37  exposure to private equity  which provided returns of 16 6  in 2011  Of course  there was a loss of 7 9  in 2010 Still  with a 15 to 25 year horizon  it doesn t matter  CPPIB wants to own quality businesses  preferably those down on their credit luck  rather than looking for a quick flip whose returns are dependent on how much leverage is applied to the buyout But there are long term opportunities  and there are opportunities  Fasano admits that the scale of CPPIB s private investment group   with  35 billion divided among private equity funds  principal investing  infrastructure buys and private debt   precludes investing in otherwise tempting deals because they won t push the needle  they re just too small At the same time  with cash inflows of  5 billion a year  CPPIB can afford to wait out illiquidity  and sometimes deals turn around in a surprisingly short time  We like private equity where we believe we get paid for the illiquidity   Fasano says   On the flip side of that  however  there s a challenge that comes with our scale and our rate of growth and quite simply there are a number of smaller opportunities and a probably a lot of really attractivesmaller opportunities thatwe just frankly can t pursue  Our main strength is our resources and the size of the assets we have  so obviously if we have a choice between a very attractive small investment or an attractive larger investment  in order to most move the needle    that is naturally going to focus us on high end as a consequence  But CPPIB only came to this after years in the trenches  which mark its private market efforts still  As with many pension plans  it got into private equity through funds of funds  The funds segment is still the biggest portion of the portfolio  and lately it has expanded to include purchases of secondary interests   from other institutional investors facing liquidity constraints  which now account for  2 billion But it is developing a direct investing platform   and opening offices outside Canada  But these are not so much to compete with its former funds of funds partners  Instead it s to be able to co invest  Fasano sees that as advantageous for CPPIB   which needs the partners to get access to the deal flow   and also to the partners  who can raise cash from a trusted counterparty  We ve always had a very strict program policy that  outside of Canada  we are only going to invest alongside GPs with whom our fund group has an established relationship   Fasano explains  He cites a number of reasons  First  he didn t want to create a brand new competitor to the funds CPPIB had already invested in  Avoiding  channel conflict   was a second reason   we believe that gives us the opportunity to access more attractive deal flow and thirdly  and quite importantly  it makes our direct investing program much more efficient in particular in being able to leverage our partners  global networks in order to be able to source attractive opportunitiesaround the world which just quite frankly we would not be able to do  Yet  CPPIB has had to build up the teams to be able to do this All that has made for a set of concentrated investments  On the one hand  there was CPPIB s participation that saw Skype being vended by E Bay  Skype had growth potential but a niggling problem  it s founders were suing over the technology  To make that transaction work  CPPIB had to adopt a two track process that essentially involved timing whether the development of an alternative technology for Skype could happen before the patent case was settled  In the end  CPPIB gained 3 2 times its original investment  in just over two years With other investments  always with partners  there have been even shorter time lines for profit But that s frequently from partnering up   One of the hypotheses we had when we started this program was that our model of operating with a small group of sponsors would be more appealing to them when it was their more attractive proprietary deals that they needed a partner for  whereas they would be much more hesitant to phone one of their competitors and quite frankly this has played out a lot more strongly than we expected  Given how few deals these days tend to be truly proprietary   we ve gotten a massively disproportionate amount of opportunities on a propriety basis through these partners  There s another feature that s interesting about CPPIB s approach  When it comes to sectoral diversification   even though the private sector portfolio is quite concentrated   the diversification is achieved by selling an equivalent amount of a sector in the publicly traded portfolio Thus  when CPPIB teamed up with Apax Parnters and PSP Investments to take medical device maker KCI private last October  in a  6 3 billion deal  CPPIB sold off an equivalent amount of U S  publicly traded health stocks Are there takeaways for alpha watchers  More than a few  one would think  There are deep pools of capital out there  but accessing them means reciprocity and trust  The biggest pools of capital could compete with private equity managers  but they d rather not  They d rather co invest  In fact  with co syndication with other pension plans  they could have even deeper pockets  That is  if GPs reach out to the LPs

121915,343430,NYT,Concerning Gray Swans  Europe  China  Profit Margins And The Fed ,opinion,Tuesday  April 10th  was a remarkably red day  Bullish uptrends snapping like dry twigs underfoot  Downside range expansions everywhere you look  on heavy volume with closes at the lows So many sectors got crushed  it s hard to distinguish between those showing internal weakness and those simply decimated by the broader market action Homebuilders are an easy example  Take a look at XHB  LEN  TOL  PHM  Nothing special there   just a microcosm of what s happening all over the place  A good old fashioned  risk off  bloodbath  with the tiny but notable exception of gold The major indices were crushed too  Small caps were already weak  and the Nasdaq is hopped up on Apple juice  But as for yon Dow and S P  Uptrends no more We have now entered an Eliot like waste land   a no man s land Now there is nothing magical or sacrosanct about a trend line  or a 50 day exponential moving average for that matter   Both are handily compact forms of regression analysis and little more Nonetheless  when you get a break that hard  and that fast   on surging volume no less   it tends to mean something  This will not be shrugged off  Even if the bulls claw their way back  they will do so badly shaken  and with a pronounced limp A Flock of Gray SwansTo those invested in the long case  Tuesday s selloff was especially disconcerting given the lack of a major catalyst Europe is threatening to blow up in everyone s faces again  yes  But hasn t that been the on and off case for years now The following New York Times commentary is notable mainly because it is dateless   it could have come at any point in the past two years or so  emphasis mine  Spain s borrowing costs rose Tuesday to levels not seen since early January  raising concerns that the financial crisis in Europe was heating up again after a lull  Stock markets closed sharply lower across the region The latest market anxieties come on the heels of a Spanish bond auction on April 4 that barely met the minimum amount sought  a sign that some investors worry that Spain might eventually follow Greece  Ireland and Portugal in seeking a bailout Spain is entering its second recession in three years  and the government expects the economy to contract about 1 7 percent in 2012  With unemployment of around 23 percent  there is fear that austerity measures  deemed critical for winning back market confidence  could have the perverse effect of further depressing growth and creating a vicious cycle in which more budget cuts are needed to balance the public books New York Times  Perhaps it is not so much one thing  but a distressing confluence of things What investors face now is a flock of  gray swans    a series of unpredictable crisis events that  in actuality  were pretty predictable after all  with only the timing left in doubt  Gray Swan  1  Austerity Fallout in EuropeThe risk emanating from Europe may not be what it seems  Rather than a fear of Europe imploding  the real trouble may be if it doesn t The European Central Bank  ECB  will print if it absolutely has to  We saw that with implementation of the  LTRO   Europe s version of QE3 The real danger in Europe  then  may not be a full blown crisis but a German incrementalist approach in which the periphery countries simply bleed out by way of austerity Instead of Lehman Brothers redux  picture Spain  Portugal et al as an old country version of Detroit  If the periphery countries are allowed to sink into recession bordering on depression  with crisis measures implemented grudgingly at just enough rate to keep them bleeding along  that is bad for everyone in global economic terms This reality is coming back to the fore as crisis persists  The trouble may not be a full blown ripping apart of Europe  but the cold water in the face realization that Germany s attitude towards fiscal stimulus could keep Europe in borderline recession conditions for the duration Gray Swan  2  Shadow Collapse in ChinaThings are bad in China right now  This should be a surprise to no one  If anything the surprise is how long the top down economic management strategy lasted Nowhere in history  or even in the annals of feasible economic thought  does it make sense to imagine a country can grow at double digit percentage rates for decades on end  with major decisions being made by a centralized governing body  while yet avoiding any sort of hard landing It s taken a bit of time  but now we are starting to see China s internal fabric come apart at the seams  both economically and politically  in shades of the underlying rot that plagued the old USSR   Anyone still remember what those letters stand for  Consider the following dispatches from the China front Shadow Banks on Trial as China s Rich Sister Faces Death   Food Prices Push Rate of Inflation Up in China   The Revenge of Wen Jiabao   Signs of a new Tiananmen in China   The Dragon has more back stabbing drama right now than an HBO mini series  Multiple pressures in respect to the Chinese economic miracle are coming to a head China s  shadow banking  network  which funds businesses to the tune of  1 3 trillion in unregulated funds  is coming under severe pressure  What happens when an informal funding system that big collapses  If the government let the shadow banking network get that big in the first place  how much control do they really have The threat of civil unrest  as tied to high and rising food costs  has never been greater  There is no  safety net  in China   no social security  no welfare  no widespread network of soup kitchens  The people spend a large percentage of their income on food  When food prices rise high enough and fast enough  you get riots The internal structure of the Communist party is imploding  Winston Churchill once compared Kremlin politics to bulldogs fighting under a carpet  Outsiders have no idea what s happening  but every so often a corpse is thrown out  The same thing is happening at one of the most critical inflection points in the ruling party s history The odds of avoiding  hard landing  were marginal to begin with  A white hot real estate bubble  speculative copper hoarding  grossly inefficient state enterprises  manufactured growth through huge infrastructure spending  how does this story end any way but badly  at least in the medium term Bottom up investors are getting more and more excited about bullish domestic spending patterns in China  They should watch out for massive top down risks like falling boulders from above Gray Swan  3  Contracting Profit MarginsThe Economist had an excellent recent article that asks   Corporate profit margins are extremely high  Can they be sustained  Theory would suggest that profit margins will revert to the mean over time  If profits are very low then companies will go out of business  improving the competitive position  and thus the margins  of those businesses that survive  Similarly  if profits are high then more capital will be attracted into the industry  and existing businesses will be tempted to expand  and the resulting competition will cause margins to fall However  the current high level of profits is not leading to a surge in investment  As a proportion of GDP  American business investment is close to 30 year lows  This shortfall has been blamed on many things  from over regulation in America to uncertainty about the outlook for demand when real incomes are being squeezed by higher fuel prices and the lack of wage growth Peter Oppenheimer of Goldman Sachs points out that the high profit share of GDP is simply a corollary of the low share taken by labour   With high unemployment and further substitution of technology for labour  it is unlikely that this will change dramatically any time soon   he says So the cash is going on other things  Robert Buckland of Citigroup says both American and European companies are choosing to spend their cash on mergers and share buy backs rather than capital expenditure  As a consequence  while profits remain sensitive to the economic cycle  those waiting for the structural mean reversion in margins will continue to be disappointed   he says The Economist  True as far as it goes But how long can such a devil s bargain last  without inducing civil unrest and destructive policies in the United States  and or inflationary stimulus  to counteract unemployment  that ultimately destroys margins through inflation We are coming back round to the bullish argument for gold here  But remember  we never said we were long term gold bears Andrew Smithers of Smithers   Co  a consultancy  believes that executives are given incentives to boost margins in the short term at the expense of long term value for shareholders  Pushing up prices boosts profits quickly  for example  but at the risk of losing market share over time  Similarly  executives might not begin a programme of investment that is vital for a company s long term health because of the effect on earnings per share  Woe betide any company that misses its quarterly earnings target If Mr Smithers is right  investors may be overpaying for current profits  The earnings forecasts of American equity analysts imply an increase in margins from current elevated levels  since they show earnings growing much faster than nominal GDP  Of course  to the extent that companies sell goods to the emerging markets  the profits of quoted companies can grow faster than domestic GDP  But that requires investment to keep the corporate sector competitive  and capital expenditure has not been happening on a sufficient scale This leads to another problem   one visible in the outperformance of multinational companies relying on overseas profits Namely  if Europe sinks into the austerity muck as China faces a hard landing  the  commodity supercycle  gets put on hold  stalling out resource oriented markets too  And if emerging markets on the whole go through a period of economic retrenchment  another source of corporate profit outperformance vanishes Governments would like companies to start spending their cash piles  But as James Montier of GMO  a fund management group  points out  that depends on their own behaviour  In terms of national accounts  massive government deficits are a counterpart to the surge in corporate profits  The surpluses and deficits of the various sectors of the economy  government  households  foreign and corporate  must balance  so a huge surplus in one sector must be balanced by deficits elsewhere  Governments spend money on goods and services  that are bought from the corporate sector  or borrow money to finance social benefits  which are then also spent on goods and services from the corporate sector This is not to suggest that chief executives should wish for permanent government deficits  But it does suggest that  as those deficits fall  profits might come under pressure  There is a  good  way that this could happen  as companies recruit more staff and pay higher wages  boosting tax revenues  But there is also a  bad  way for it to happen  if austerity programmes cause a slump in demand  Pray for the first outcome There s another way that profit margins could contract   through the upping of  austerity measures  not just in Europe  but in the United States and possibly China too If Republicans win the next presidential election  there will undoubtedly be a new fiscal austerity wave  Even if they don t  more rounds of  belt tightening  and Mellon style liquidation may be called for   Remember the debt ceiling fun we had last August  Meanwhile  China may find its stimulus powers constrained by domestic inflation at home  too much risk of food riots etc  Here come the earnings As a side note  earnings season starts this week   and that could be a mitigating or accelerating factor  depending on how good  or bad  the numbers are  The early look ain t so hot   via Dow Jones Analysts expect the first quarter to be the worst period since mid 2009 for profit growth at U S  corporations  even as stocks sit near multiyear highs   On the aggregate  companies in the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index are expected to report little or no increase in earnings for the first quarter  That represents a marked slowdown from two years of robust expansion fueled by cost  cutting in the wake of the financial crisis and could presage further debate about the prospect for equities   You can only squeeze your expenses so much  At some point you

121921,343436,NYT,Not Much Better Than At The Peak Of The Housing Bubble,opinion,In  I highlighted a Philly Post article detailing how incomplete  inconsistent  or irrelevant statistical comparisons serve to paint a distorted picture of where things stand in today s economy  As it happens  an article in Thursday s New York Times   makes what I believe is a similarly misleading claim about Americans  financial health  The bursting of the real estate bubble and the ensuing credit crisis forced American consumers to do something that they had little experience in trying  reduce their debt It has been a painful process both for borrowers  who have faced foreclosures and bankruptcies  and for lenders  whose have had to take losses vastly in excess of what they thought possible But the process is working far faster in the United States than in countries like Britain and Spain  which also faced plunging real estate prices  And now it appears to be contributing to an economic recovery that has gained a little momentum  despite facing headwinds from the European debt crisis  This week s report that retail sales grew faster than expected in March was the latest sign that consumers   or at least a substantial number of them   are growing more optimistic One measure of the financial health of householders is the level of financial obligations  like required mortgage and credit card payments  to disposable income  By the fall of 2007  those obligations took up 14 percent of disposable income  more than at any time since the Federal Reserve began calculating the statistic in 1980 But now the situation has turned around  The latest figures  for the final quarter of 2011  show that required debt service payments now make up just 10 9 percent of disposable income  the lowest proportion since 1994  A broader measure   which adds in such obligations as property tax and insurance premiums for homeowners  and rent for those who do not own their homes   has fallen to the lowest level since 1984 While it s all well and good to say that monthly outlays are less than they were  this development likely reflects the fact that  thanks to the Fed s machinations  interest rates are at historic lows  while maturities for certain kinds of financing  including auto loans  have generally increased as lenders try to keep payments at manageable levels The reality is  if you compare the financial obligations ratio cited in the Times article to the ratio of average household debt to median household income  as I ve done below  it s apparent that the financial position of U S  consumers is not much better than it was at the credit bubble s peak In the end  it s not just the amount that people shell out each month that matters  the amount they owe also has a strong  if not stronger  impact on their willingness to spend  Under the circumstances  I wouldn t hold out much hope that a consumer recovery is on the way ,2012-04-20,Michael Panzner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/not-much-better-than-at-the-peak-of-the-housing-bubble-120747,120747
121922,343437,NYT,Outsized Outsourcing Opportunity in the Philippines ,opinion,It s no surprise the NBC show   Outsourced  was set in India in 2011  revenues for the country s outsourcing and information technology industries reached  100 billion  according to The New York Times  However  if the now cancelled show gets remade in the future  it may take place in the up and coming location of the Philippines  Historically about 10 percent of the country s GDP growth has been from workers living overseas  sending money back to their families living in the country  i e  overseas remittances  In the U S  alone  the Filipino population grew by nearly 40 percent over the past decade  according to the 2010 census  More than 2 5 million Filipinos live in the U S   with the largest concentration in California  Getting workers to stay on their native soil has been the challenge for a country with the 15th largest labor force in the world  Among a population of 104 million  nearly 40 million are in the workforce  The Philippines has been meeting this challenge in recent days with the rapidly expanding business process outsourcing sector  BPO   The same services that made India s outsourcing industry successful call centers  IT outsourcing and engineering services have been booming in the Philippines in recent years  Right now  about 638 000 people work in the BPO industry  and this should continue to grow  based on projected revenues  according to data from CLSA  Whereas revenues coming from overseas remittances are much higher than the revenues generated from BPO today  BPO revenues are growing three times faster  according to CLSA  Each is projected to provide  25 billion in revenue by 2016   CLSA finds that the Philippines is  increasingly being established as the favored service center  along with India  for outsourcing  Multinational companies are choosing to be in both locations  Three hundred multinational companies are currently involved in the outsourcing business in the Philippines  says CLSA  Attracting these multinational companies will become easier for the outsourcing companies  as the cost of capital has recently been significantly reduced  In the past  the Philippines had  one of Asia s highest cost of capital   In late 2011  the real lending rate was 1 5 percent compared with the 10 year average of 4 2 percent  According to CLSA  bank lending increased 19 percent year over year in July 2011   the fastest growth since March 2009    The booming outsourcing industry is only one area that is driving solid GDP growth in the country  While 2011 saw tepid GDP growth of 3 7 percent  CLSA says investors should expect a higher rate out of the Southeast Asian country in 2012  In a recent report  the research firm increased its GDP growth forecast to 4 7 percent  up from its previous forecast of 4 2 percent  Its rising optimism is based on the fact that  large domestic development and construction firms have high expectations for a faster roll out  of numerous private public partnership projects in 2012  These projects  totaling  4 1 billion  include an airport terminal  expressways  water supply source project and other health and education projects  The limited progress made last year was due to only a partial disbursement of the budgeted public capital expenditure  says CLSA  Only two thirds was distributed because the government was concerned about transparency and cost effectiveness of the spending  Looking at what the impact of government spending would be on GDP growth  the chart below shows the disbursement rate of budgeted expenditure compared with the real GDP growth  According to the World Bank  if 80 percent of the planned expenditure is disbursed  GDP growth should rise to 3 6 percent  If 100 percent is disbursed  GDP growth could be as high as 6 percent   There s extra incentive for the leaders to go through with these projects in 2012  In a recent poll  residents continue to approve of President Benigno  Noynoy  Aquino  but protest groups have labeled a catchphrase for the president   noynoying   Protestors have been photographed in  noynoying  positions  i e   lying around and staring into space  claiming Aquino isn t productive as a leader  says The Wall Street Journal  That s powerful incentive for this year to be a  make or break  year for President Aquino  According to CLSA  his  popularity will be gradually eroded if he is slow to deliver   He wants to be seen as a president who gets things done  Also  in 2013  the 230 member House of Representatives will be up for election The Philippines  GDP growth also stands to benefit from the  that I ve mentioned frequently  CLSA says that  countries such as the Philippines with historically high cost of capital have benefited most  from the easing of monetary policy by reducing the risk spread across emerging markets  Our investment team has reported in the weekly  about a number of positive trends coming out of the Philippines lately  including a narrowing of the budget deficit  easing inflation and rising export numbers  In addition  CLSA reported last fall that   the Philippines increasingly looks like it could be where Indonesia was five years ago in terms of the potential for a multi year credit and investment cycle to kick in after years of post Asian Crisis de leveraging   The country was the best performer last year among the  and one of the few that ended the year in positive territory  increasing nearly 8 percent in 2012  For the   we believe there continues to be room for growth  The country remains a potential source of opportunity to add outperformance against the benchmark Please consider carefully a fund s investment objectives  risks  charges and expenses  For this and other

121968,343483,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Afghanistan  I wrote in this space on 4 3 10   As Country Joe first sang over 40 years ago   One  two  three  what are we fighting for    Back then  President Hamid Karzai was accusing the West and the United States of wanting a  puppet government  and of orchestrating a fraud in the previous year s presidential election  though it was the other way around in the case of the latter Now  as the Financial Times  Philip Stephens puts it  it s a race to the end   In Washington this week a president and a prime minister declared victory even as they admitted defeat  The U S  and Britain are getting out of Afghanistan  The rush for the exit is becoming a race   We ve been there for 10 years and people get weary   Barack Obama said   People want an end game   Britain s David Cameron chipped in  What happens next in that benighted country is  well  a problem for the Afghans   If there are differences  between the two leaders   they are about precise timing and choreography  Mr  Cameron was caught unawares when the Pentagon advanced its departure schedule  The British did not want to be a single step behind the U S  The Americans do not want Britain to run ahead   The alliance s combat troops are to leave by the end of 2014  The U S  administration  however  intends to front load the process  handing the lead combat role to the Afghan national army by mid 2013  This would allow an accelerated drawdown of the 90 000 strong American force  Britain does not want its 9 500 troops left exposed to the inevitable Taliban resurgence in southern Afghanistan  The deal in Washington seems to be that they will both come out faster  The exit strategy  as Henry Kissinger has observed  has become all exit and no strategy   Unsurprisingly  voters on both sides of the Atlantic have turned against the conflict   just as with Iraq  A U S  election looms  Never say die conservatives such as Rick Santorum are questioning whether anything resembling victory is any longer possible  A violent Afghan reaction to the burning of copies of the Koran by U S  troops  and a murderous attack on Afghan civilians by a serving U S  soldier have crystallized doubts  The law of diminishing returns has set in  the presence of NATO troops has become the problem  It was another terrible week for the United States with the word a U S  soldier had gone rogue  snapped  and killed 16 Afghan civilians  including children  A tragedy of immense proportions  A single act that impacts strategy Retired Gen  Barry McCaffrey said on NBC   This is bad news immense pain to everyone   Then McCaffrey said  to compound matters   President Karzai throws kerosene on the flames  Little did McCaffrey know that when he made the statement about Karzai  a few days later the hopelessly corrupt Afghan leader would demand U S  troops return to their major bases and speed up transfer of security responsibilities to Afghan forces nationwide  though Karzai did not set a timetable of his own  A rapid withdrawal from the rural areas  however  would be devastating to the war effort and the end to any winning hearts and minds campaigns  So who knows how serious the mercurial Karzai is For their part  the Taliban took advantage of the awful situation involving the U S  soldier to say they were suspending talks with the Americans As for the American people  in a Washington Post ABC News poll  55  believe that most Afghans are opposed to what the United States is trying to accomplish in that country  54  want to see the U S  withdraw even before it can train the Afghan army to be self sufficient  For the first time  Republicans are now split on whether the war is worth fighting  Overall  60  of Americans believe the war has not been worth the loss in life and expense  Speaking of the financial cost  we are spending  2 billion a week over there  Staggering  Imagine what Bill Gates could do with  2 billion in one of his humanitarian efforts But  again  it s amazing how the acts of one rogue soldier can impact policy in such drastic fashion  The mistrust between the United States and Afghanistan is irreversible  This messy ending is also on Obama  not Bush Editorial   Washington Post As they watch  Obama s past helter skelter moves in the Afghan theater   Afghans  the Taliban and neighbors such as Pakistan can reasonably conclude that the United States  rather than trying to win the war  is racing to implement an exit strategy in which the interests of Afghans and their government are slighted  Americans  meanwhile  rarely hear Mr  Obama explain the mission or the stakes  In this context  it s not surprising that Afghans show little tolerance for U S  failures   whether it is this week s shooting or the accidental burning of Korans  And it s little wonder that most Americans favor withdrawing troops as quickly as possible  If it s evident that the president won t defend the war  and is focused on  winding down  rather than winning  why should anyone else support it  Iran  Both President Obama and British Prime Minister Cameron are on record now as urging Israel to hold off on any attack on Iran  Tactically  the bottom line is that it is now commonly accepted Israel  acting alone  can set back Iran s nuclear program 1 2 years  The United States  however  could set it back up to ten years But appearing on 60 Minutes  former head of Mossad  Meir Dagan  said talk of attacking Iran was  the stupidest thing I have ever heard  Dagan argues an attack would make Israel the target of up to 50 000 missiles fired by Hizbullah and Hamas  It will be a devastating impact on our ability to continue with our daily life  I think that Israel will be in a very serious situation for quite a time  And wars  you know how they start  You never know how you are ending it  Dagan  who left Mossad last year  has been an outspoken opponent of a strike for some time now  though says if it s necessary he would prefer the U S  carry it out The problem is Israeli defense officials increasingly believe Iran is capable of producing highly enriched weapons grade uranium in six months  after which it is assumed it would take another year or so to develop a delivery vehicle But if this is the case  Israel must act much sooner or  in the words of Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak  Iran will have moved enough of its nuclear facilities underground and out of reach of conventional airpower  thus creating a  zone of immunity  Israel has been planning an attack for years 100 of its 300 planes would take part in the mission  Defense News reports that talks have been underway between the U S  and Israel for the latest bunker buster bombs  GBU 28s  but as an Israeli security official told the paper  best summing things up   The Americans want to wait until they have evidence of Iran s decision to assemble a bomb  But we say that s part of Iran s strategy  We say Iran will continue to enrich uranium  harden its facilities and add redundancies that will allow it to break out or sneak out with nuclear weaponization  At that time  for us at least  it will be too late  The other day I said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was the smartest man in the world  What I didn t add is that he also has a reputation for being indecisive  Netanyahu said on Wednesday  Israel has never left its fate in the hands of others  not even in the hands of our best friends  And to those who say if he could only reach agreement with the Palestinians  then the Iranian problem would go away  Netanyahu said  As if an agreement with Abu Mazen  PA President Mahmoud Abbas  would stop the  Iranian  centrifuges  Anyone who wants to believe that may do so  but he is burying his head in the sand  Netanyahu added   Gaza is Iran s forward position   We left Lebanon  Iran came in  We left Gaza  Iran came in  There are those suggesting we do the same thing in Judea and Samaria  Iran would go in there as well  I don t believe there is anyone who doesn t understand that it is forbidden to repeat the same mistake a third time   Sooner or later   Netanyahu declared   the Iranian terrorist base in Gaza will be uprooted  On Wednesday  appearing with Prime Minister Cameron  President Obama  as much as he doesn t want to see an Israeli preemptive strike  did say  Because the international community has applied so many sanctions  because we have employed so many of the options that are available to us to persuade Iran to take a different course  the window for solving this issue diplomatically is shrinking  Separately  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent a message to Iran through her Russian counterpart  Sergei Lavrov  that negotiations were Iran s  last chance  A Reuters Ipsos poll found that 56  of Americans would support U S  military action against Iran if there were evidence of a nuclear weapons program  while 39  were opposed For its part  the Washington Post reports that Iranian officials and analysts essentially say there is no way Iran ceases enriching uranium as part of any deal with the Group of Six  the U S   Russia  China  France  Britain and Germany  Plus  the talks aren t even scheduled yet  The clock is ticking  Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said recently in a televised address  Pressures  sanctions and assassinations will bear no fruit  No obstacles can stop Iran s nuclear work  But starting Saturday  Iran does face a sanction of a different sort  The inability of Iran to transfer money internationally as SWIFT  Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication   which facilitates most international money transfers  is cutting off Iranian banks  access to its system  a move the U S  and Israel have been lobbying for  This should be significant Lastly  I get a kick out of those who still talk about Iranian President Ahmadinejad as if he is calling the shots  I told you long ago that wasn t the case  that if we had a choice  Ahmadinejad was a  moderate  compared to Khamenei But Ahmadinejad is officially irrelevant  I m not going to waste your time discussing the unprecedented interrogation he faced this week in the Iranian parliament  because it doesn t matter  Ahmadinejad is not about to be removed before his term expires in June 2013  Khamenei calls the shots and he ll let his one time ally just sit there You see  Khamenei wants a parliamentary system with a prime minister only  thus eliminating the position of president  and that is what will happen next year  So ignore discussions concerning the president and any threats he is making to Israel  It s Khamenei you need to focus on and the bottom line with him is Iran is not giving up its nuclear weapons program for anything  Period Lastly  IAEA Director General Amano said of the Iranian military installation at Parchin   We have information that some activity is ongoing there  The IAEA suspects the site is being used to test nuclear triggers  In two trips to Iran this year  the IAEA was denied access   We have to go there   said Amano  But Iran has signaled again it is unwilling to grant a request by the IAEA  even as Iran denies it is  cleansing  the site Syria  I said it was rather pitiful that the UN sent former Secretary General Kofi Annan to negotiate with Syrian President Bashar al Assad  Annan being more appropriate for house watching duty and taking care of your plants than hard diplomacy  So Annan left after two sessions with Assad  tail between his legs  Far more effective would have been to have a real figure  like Colin Powell  go to Assad and do this  Mr  President  I want to show you a little video of what a cruise missile could do to your face  Now here is what it would do to your family  I suggest you leave forthwith  And then just walk out of the room Benny Avni   New York Post  Assad s  troops killed more than 160 Syrians this weekend while  peace envoy  Kofi Annan sipped tea at the presidential palace in Damascus  As the death toll in the rebellion against the Damascus tyrant inched closer to 10 000  the ever optimistic Annan failed to convince anyone to end the fighting  Annan sought a compromise  but is that possible when Assad hopes to secure his hold on power while the rebels hope to end it  Annan was sent to Syria by current UN chief Ban Ki moon and the Arab League  but he s also the only game in town for the West  In rejecting Sen  John McCain s call for military intervention in Syria  Obama administration officials made it clear that Washington won t use air power  let alone ground troops  and that it won t arm the rebels  Neither do we have any other plan  Cue the diplomacy mongers  No one s better at that game than Annan  who in 1998  averted  a second Gulf War during President Bill Clinton s term  Annan declared on his return from a Baghdad meeting with Saddam that  I can do business with that man   Annan has a history of turning a blind eye to genocidal massacres  As chief of United Nations peacekeeping  he ordered UN troops to avoid intervention in horrific bloodbaths in Rwanda in 1994 and Srebrenica  Bosnia  in 1995  Annan is calling for a cease fire  then negotiations  Assad will just keep fighting until he wins  as was the case with Annan s departure Amnesty International released a report on Tuesday that said the scale of torture in Syria is the worst the country has experienced in 30 years  with the human rights group documenting 276 deaths as a result of it But this was before 23 victims of  extreme torture  were found near the city of Idlib  The bodies were discovered blindfolded  handcuffed and shot dead  according to British based Syrian Human Rights Watch Assad turned out tens of thousands of  supporters  in Damascus on Thursday  His forces are laying hundreds of landmines along the Turkish border to prevent people from escaping and to stop supplies from coming in to the rebels  30 000 have fled to Turkey  Lebanon and Jordan  Another 200 000 are displaced in Syria Meanwhile  analysts are increasingly concerned over the fate of Syria s chemicals weapons stockpile  An analysis from Foreign Policy notes   The country is a chemical powder keg ready to explode   according to their experts Most of the stockpile is comprised of sarin and mustard blister agent that can be dispersed via artillery rounds  air dropped bombs  rockets and missiles  There are supposedly 50 chemical arsenals and manufacturing facilities throughout the country Lebanon  I couldn t help but make note of the following   The U S  Embassy in Lebanon sent an emergency message to Americans in Lebanon  Tuesday  warning them not to travel to the Baalbek area because of clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal groups  The embassy message  sent in the afternoon  warned citizens to avoid the area while clashes continue and also noted recent clashes in the Bekaa and border regions   The embassy advises U S  citizens to monitor the security situation  avoid areas where clashes have occurred  and maintain low profiles in public     The Daily Star  Been there  done that  Lebanon remains a powderkeg of a different sort Yemen  Last week I wrote   I wouldn t be in the least bit surprised to learn of an American airstrike or two on al Qaeda bases in the not too distant future   Word came about two hours after I posted that  Airstrikes carried out by U S  warplanes killed at least 33 suspected al Qaeda terrorists   Yemeni officials said   AFP A report in the London Times notes that al Qaeda has launched a PR campaign in the south of the country where they are strongest  offering food aid  As a UK development minister said   We don t want al Qaeda to become the Hamas of southern Yemen  Israel  Speaking of Hamas  really Islamic Jihad this time   which has been firing rockets and receiving Israeli retaliation  Israel s Iron Dome rocket shield is acing its first big test  Iron Dome uses cameras and radar to pick off those incoming deemed a threat to people and property  while ignoring rockets that would fall in open areas  Israel said of 143 rockets fired between Friday and Monday  3 9 3 12   Iron Dome tried to intercept 63 and succeeded in all but nine of those attempts  as reported by the AP  No Israelis have been killed in the current fighting This obviously bodes well when looking at the threat posed by Hizbullah in Lebanon  Iron Dome is produced by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems  but it is a private company  I knew this but wrote Rafael anyway  asking if there was any public angle whatsoever and told them who I was  No reply  But I m sure I gained a reader  Hopefully a long term one  It s like when I finally get to Israel one of these days and in the security check they ask me   Why have you been to Lebanon twice and Jordan    Because I can    Smart ass  Iraq  So from time to time you hear of a big jewelry heist in New York s diamond district  or some high end joint around the country  It s usually smash and grab  In Iraq  the heists are a little different  just a bit more violent  Iraqi police and health officials say robbers have killed nine people and wounded 14 others in a jewelry heist in eastern Baghdad  A police officer says two carloads of robbers stormed four jewelry stores Monday in a small market in the Shiite neighborhood of Ur before noon  Just in case you were thinking of strolling the shopping areas of this fine city China  By week s end there was one story  the purging of Maoist Bo Xilai  a high flying member of the Communist party politburo and the  princeling  son of a revolutionary hero  Bo had been embroiled in a scandal for about six weeks involving his handpicked police chief who attempted to defect to the U S   claiming Bo was trying to kill him Bo was chief of Chongqing  a southwestern metropolis  but it was announced on Thursday he was being replaced and while no further details were released  it is assumed he is under house arrest  which is standard operating procedure in these cases Bo was known for his Maoist tendencies and  cultural revolution style  policies in Chongqing  including a crackdown on businessmen and their gangs  Bo  however  was a direct threat to the reformers in China Editorial   South China Morning Post Reformers on the mainland have waited a long time for a positive signal from the Chinese Communist Party leadership  It came yesterday with the news that ambitious Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai had been removed from office  This followed  by less than 24 hours  Premier Wen Jiabao s rebuke of the municipal leadership over the scandal in which the former city police chief sought refuge in a U S  consulate  Wen s remarks were the first comment on the incident by a state leader  He did not mention Bo by name  but with hindsight the fate of the aspirant to the top echelon of party leadership was sealed  More significantly  at Wen s annual televised press conference  Ed  which lasted three hours   he also invoked the fear of another Cultural Revolution to argue for political reform  His remarks appeared aimed at Bo s attempts to revive Maoist values with revolutionary campaigns and the singing of  red  songs  Memories of that period still play on the emotions of everyone in China  including state leaders  who suffered hardship and tragedy during those troubled times  Perhaps the most important aspect of the decision to remove Bo is that a struggle between reformists and leftists over China s future direction  hitherto waged behind closed doors  has burst into the open  With hindsight again  Wen flagged it long ago with repeated remarks  at home and abroad  that political reform was needed to safeguard China s national economic achievements for the benefit of the people   Leftists believe reforms have gone too far and blame them for a widening income gap and growing social unrest  Reformists are concerned that despite China s rise  the country faces an uncertain future unless it undertakes another round of economic and  more importantly  political reforms  Bo had emerged as the flag carrier for the leftists  His fall came only two days after he had defiantly vowed to continue with it  So does the sudden move endanger the planned leadership change for year end  Probably not  but it makes China s efforts to prevent a hard landing all the more critical Incoming president in waiting  Xi Jinping  said in a speech published after Bo s removal that the party s authority had been weakened by a  lack of principles  among some members  To maintain the party s ideological purity is to guarantee the unity of the party   said Xi   Today some people join the party not because they believe in Marxism and want to devote themselves to Socialism with Chinese characteristics but because becoming a member brings them personal benefits  If the thoughts of members and cadres of the party are not pure  their ideas cannot be firm  and their political positions can easily change  Bo s supporters will not go quietly  and the history of China is full of figures such as him who have made extraordinary comebacks  think Deng Xiaoping The fear is you ll see a replay of 1989  and Tiananmen Square  only in reverse  Maoists protesting against reformers viewed as elitists in the battle over inequality Back to Premier Wen  during his press conference he responded to a question  saying the desire for democracy in the Middle East must be  respected and truly responded to   I believe this trend towards democracy cannot be held back by any force   he said  adding it was an  urgent task  to press ahead with reforms or risk losing the enormous gains made over the past three decades Items such as the wealth gap  endemic corruption and a public distrust of the government could only be addressed through reforms  While Wen has achieved no major political reforms himself in his ten years  his comments this week were viewed favorably in the blogosphere  Wen took the blame for all of China s problems during his decade in leadership   Ultimately  history will have the final say   he said One other topic  President Hu Jintao  who is also Communist Party general secretary  Xi becomes general secretary first in the fall  then president early 2012   called on the People s Liberation Army to safeguard social stability and the loyalty of the army ahead of the fall s crucial party congress  The PLA and the armed police must prioritize ideological and political development and unswervingly uphold the Communist Party of China s absolute leadership over the armed forces  It s a little disconcerting Hu felt compelled to issue the statement and makes one wonder just what kind of dissent is in the military these days  Reformers vs  Maoists vs  the Army  Or just the first two  with the military being pulled from both directions  Lastly  China announced it was increasing its military spending to above  100 billion   106 billion to be exact  though many believe it to be much higher North Korea  Uh oh Pyongyang declared it will launch a long range rocket carrying a  working  satellite to mark the centenary of founder Kim Il sung s birth next month  which would be in total violation of a 2009 Security Council resolution banning ballistic missile launches  The North had just told the U S  it would suspend long range missile testing as part of its recent talks  The Commies said the launch would not impact neighboring countries  but of course it is an important test of its capabilities and how quickly it can hit the U S  accurately  Which is why I maintain you have to sleep with one eye open  just as we do here The launch will take place April 12 16  according to the official news agency  so mark your calendars  Kim Il sung s birthday is April 15 Then again  it s a ploy for further food aid  And with this single statement by the North  announcing an illegal missile launch  the United States should scrap the deal that would have traded cessation of uranium enrichment at Yongbyon for stale Drake s cakes It should also be noted that just this week  IAEA Director General Amano said he believes the threat posed by Iran s atomic activities pales next to those of North Korea  The problem  with North Korea  is serious and its impact on the world is larger than Iran   Amano said  The IAEA has not worked out a deal with the North for the return of inspectors  which is part of the Washington Pyongyang deal  Amano admitted his agency doesn t have a clue what is really going on there Separately  the Korea Herald reported that the South is not prepared for a smallpox attack by the North  the threat being part of Pyongyang s biological weapons capabilities  A 2001 U S  modeling study indicated that 3 million people could contract smallpox in no more than two months after the beginning of a pandemic  30  would then die based on past history Russia  Fears of a crackdown on the protest movement emerged as a few of the leaders were given fines  but the husband of one of the organizers was sentenced to five years on unrelated fraud charges  The thing is the case is more than four years old and as the New York Times reports   comes in spite of a ruling by the Russian Supreme Court last September that overturned  Aleksei  Kozlov s earlier conviction in the matter  Russia has no statute against double jeopardy  Last weekend s protests drew a far smaller crowd than expected and  for now  the movement is over  or so it seems  But it will be back  It s just the reality Vladimir Putin would have received 50  and avoided a run off even with the fraud in the presidential vote that has hit them in the face  The protesters need to be better organized but they are split on their objectives Meanwhile  there are stories Putin is increasingly distrustful of his inner circle  as he should be  while there was quite a tussle on the corporate front that attracted attention Billionaire Viktor Vekselberg resigned as chairman of the world s biggest aluminum producer  RusAl  saying the company is overloaded with debt and facing a  deep crisis  due to the improper actions of its management  RusAl then accused Vekselberg of failing to  perform his functions as board chairman of a public company  over the last year  Vekselberg is aligned with fellow billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov  he of the Nets and the failed presidential bid France  Opinion polls are now mixed concerning the April 22 presidential race  One has Socialist Francois Hollande at 29   with President Nicolas Sarkozy at 27  and National Front candidate Marine Le Pen at 18  with Hollande then prevailing in round two by 10 points But a separate survey on Tuesday gave Sarkozy 28 5  to Hollande s 27   though Hollande still won a hypothetical run off by 9  54 5 45 5   Le Pen slipped to 16  in this one Le Pen  by the way  did finally get the required 500 signatures  beating the Friday deadline  but Sarkozy is successfully picking off her far right supporters and there now seems little chance Le Pen can pull off an upset and finish ahead of the president in round one But there was this funny tidbit this week Sarkozy was forced to apologize to a policewoman after his 15 year old son  by ex wife Cecelia  threw a tomato at her  He was with friends in the presidential

121969,343484,NYT,Part Two  The Truth About Earnings And How Forecasting Earnings Is The Key To Success,opinion,In part one of this  on the importance of earnings I focused on the historical relationship between earnings and market price utilizing cyclical companies to illustrate the validity of my thesis   In this part two  I am going to focus on how since we learned from the past how important and highly correlated the earnings and price relationship is  that it only logically follows that future results will also be a function of future earnings achievements  Therefore  I confidently state that forecasting future earnings is the key to long term investing success Furthermore  I want to acknowledge that I believe that investors cannot escape the obligation to forecast  our results depend upon it However  we should not just guess  nor should we merely play hunches  Forecasting should be approached as analytically and even as scientifically as possible Our goal is to calculate reasonable probabilities based on all factual information that we can assemble We should then apply analytical methods that are employed based upon our underlying earnings driven rationale The endgame is providing us reasons to believe that the relationships producing earnings growth in the past will persist in the future  Maybe not at the precise historical rate  but at least at a rate that should compensate us for the risk we are assuming I believe the best way to accomplish a forecast that is reasonable within an acceptable range of probabilities is by applying both a macro and micro analysis However  by macro I am not implying attempting to forecast the economy or political events Instead  I believe that investors should focus on the major macroeconomic trends that identify the possibilities of major future investment opportunities There are two that quickly come to mind  analyzing and monitoring demographics  and focusing on the potential of technological advancement The Macro ApproachRegarding demographics  perhaps the most important factor to recognize is what I like to call our population s current bimodal distribution  namely  the graying of America and the baby boomer generation Both of these powerful demographic forces are currently merging to create a powerful demographic associated with the aging of our population By understanding the consumption tendencies of these and other demographic segments will allow us to make informed forecasts on the future health of several industries that will serve these large and growing markets  Of course  two obvious industries would be healthcare and financial services associated with retirement planning Regarding technological enhancements  there are just too many to single out I believe the best way to learn more about this is to buy the New York Times best selling book  Abundance  The Future is Better Than You Think  by Peter H  Diamandis and Steven Kotler The book is just out  and the following are just a sampling of the many excellent reviews pouring in  A manifesto for the future that is grounded in practical solutions addressing the world s most pressing concerns  overpopulation  food  water  energy  education  health care and freedom    The Wall Street Journal  a godsend for those who suffer from Armageddon fatigue    The Economist Magazine This is a vital book  Diamandis and Kotler give us a blinding glimpse of the innovations that are coming our way and that they are helping to create    Matt Ridley  Author of The Rational OptimistI would like to add that there are unbelievably exciting opportunities described in this  what I believe  is a groundbreaking book However  I would also add that there are some very frightening possibilities that the book also points out Nevertheless  the book is about the exponential growth potential from new ideas that are capable of changing our entire economic paradigm  But most importantly  many of these game changing technology advancements are already available  In my opinion  the ideas in the book are mostly for the better  but there are also issues that will need to be dealt with To my way of thinking  anyone that has investment capital at risk should get a copy of this book The Micro ApproachFrom the macro  the individual investor needs to move to the micro because ultimately  it is the individual security  or stock selection that produces long term returns As I ve previously discussed in part one  long term returns are a function of earnings past  present and future  And  I believe there s no better way to come up with a reasonable forecast of future earnings than by conducting a thorough and comprehensive fundamental analysis on every company under consideration However  the focus should be on attempting to determine whether said company possesses the future earnings power to provide you the returns required that are commensurate to the amount of risk you are taking to achieve them As serendipity would have it  I received a communiqu  from MorningStar promoting a new growth stock product they are offering  Keep in mind that they are specifically speaking about growth stocks  however  I believe the underlying principles apply to all stock investing  There are two excerpts from their promotion that I thought succinctly spoke to what I m discussing in this article  the first is as follows  The central question for successful growth investing  as we see it  is this  how long can above average growth continue  Answer this question correctly  and you can make a lot of money  no matter how much you pay for a company s stock  Compounding growth is a powerful force   The second excerpt talks about companies sustaining and building their moats  How can investors spot growth that s unlikely to fizzle out Our answer  focus on the economic moat trend  A company s ability to shield its business franchise not only protects its current profits  but also its growth prospects  Rather than simply focusing on companies already benefiting from strong competitive advantages  or focusing on companies that already have wide economic moats  we look at companies still building and growing their economic moats  We believe this brand of growth investing leads to high quality companies that can consistently compound their intrinsic values year after year In other words  we buy not only growing companies  but also sustainably growing companies  To my way of thinking  MorningStar s above advice is extremely important when trying to determine the future growth potential of any company you are analyzing  On the other hand  it s often easier said than done  Recognizing and correctly evaluating a company s strategic advantage is a difficult task indeed  Furthermore  this is a process and not a one time act In other words  it s imperative that the investor owner continues to monitor  check and recheck a company s strategic advantage on a continuous basis Due diligence must be ongoing Perhaps the good news is the company s prospects usually don t change overnight or in the blink of an eye  Therefore  the diligent investor would have ample time to reevaluate each company s prospects A Quick Review of History Learning from the Past In part one of this two part series we used four examples of cyclical companies that illustrated the undeniable earnings and price relationship and correlation  Although this  part two  is essentially focused on the future  there is much that can be learned from the past  So before we move on to a closer examination of the future  let s review the past by including one of our example cyclical companies from part one  and compare it to a company with a stronger history of earnings growth  For perspective  we re going to add a plotting of free cash flow to our  research tool Our first example once again looks at Caterpillar Inc   CAT  from the earnings and price correlated relationship with a free cash flow overlay  orange shaded area marked with a capital F  added  Clearly we see that Caterpillar  CAT  does generate free cash flow which is a sign of a strong and healthy business However  we also see that price tracks earnings in a much more correlated fashion than it relates to free cash flow  In other words  from the graph below it becomes clear that when evaluating the intrinsic value  fair value  of Caterpillar  earnings are the key  But most importantly  focus on the cyclical nature of Caterpillar s earnings  When we move on to forecasting future earnings  the cyclical nature of the earnings history of this company will become a very important consideration With our second example we look at Ross Stores  ROST   a company with a much stronger and more consistent record of historical earnings growth  Once again we see a company that generates healthy levels of free cash flow  orange shaded area marked with a capital F   but note how price followed earnings higher even though free cash flow was falling during calendar years 2010 and 2011  However  as we suggested above with our cyclical choice  notice how the historical earnings growth of this company has been both strong and consistent When evaluating the future prospects of this company  its historical record will once again become a very important consideration Starting with Consensus Analyst EstimatesThere tends to be a lot of controversy when talking about the consensus estimates from leading analysts following a given company  Most of the controversy deals with people s opinions about the accuracy  or lack thereof  of analysts  published expectations In my opinion  these criticisms fail to recognize that estimating a company s future earnings is not  and cannot  be an exact science Since estimates are forecasts  much of the facts that they are dealing with or are attempting to calculate are mostly unknowns Although  as I stated earlier  estimates should not be mere guesses  instead  they should be reasonable projections based on all the factual data the analyst can assemble  coupled with reasonable projections of the future Consequently  when I am utilizing analyst estimates to evaluate a business  I always think in terms of ranges and probabilities rather than precise numbers  In other words  if the consensus of leading analysts says they expect the company to grow earnings at a rate of 15  over the next five years  I translate that to mean something  for example  like a range of 12  to 17   Moreover  when running my numbers to their logical conclusions  I will always run a best case  worst case and my most reasonable case These  what if  scenarios allow me to assess risk more clearly Therefore  I believe that I can make sound decisions that are neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic  Furthermore  by having a range of probabilities  I am more likely to have actual numbers fall somewhere within my range  than I am if I had tried to hang my hat on an absolute number Although I still may be mildly disappointed at 12  versus 15  growth  I m at least not overly surprised because I considered the possibility There are other points to consider when reviewing analysts  forecasts  First of all  the leading analysts are trained to do their job  and therefore  in theory at least  they should be more qualified than the untrained layman Again  that doesn t mean that they will give me perfect information  but I m at least hopeful that they have conducted a thorough examination of the company s fundamentals before offering me their forecasts  Also  investors should recognize that most of these analysts all attend the same investor conferences and conventions Therefore  they are all viewing and hearing the same investor presentations put on by various companies  management teams In theory at least  prudent management teams  operating officers  of a publicly traded company are best served to provide guidance that is lower than their actual expectations in order to be able to beat guidance when earnings are finally reported  As a general rule  Mr  Market tends to punish companies that miss analysts  estimates by lowering its stock price  and reward companies that beat analysts  estimates by raising its stock price This at least applies over the shorter run To summarize my points regarding investors using consensus analyst estimates as a starting point before conducting their own due diligence  I believe it s a very rational approach  If used properly  analyst estimates represent an efficient screening tool or process that can prevent the investor from wasting a lot of time conducting an unnecessary due diligence effort  If analyst estimates do not support a company s current valuation  there s no need to dig deeper until price comes into alignment with forecasts  thereby offering an acceptable rate of return  earnings yield  that compensates the investor for the risk they are assuming  However  I will also add that the investor might want to spend some time divining whether or not the current estimates are reasonable or not  before either abandoning a more comprehensive research effort or moving forward Compounding Is Discounting Future Revenues in ReverseMost prudent investors consider the art of discounting future revenues back to the present value as an effective method of estimating fair value  or what I like to call True Worth   The formula for calculating discounted present value  DPV  is a very complex looking mathematical formula However  I promised not to use complex formulas in this series of articles  Therefore  I will instead focus on the essence of the principle Discounting future values is based upon the principle of the time use of money In theory  a dollar in your hand today is worth more than a dollar you might have to wait several years to get This is simply the old a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush axiom  Therefore  when looking at future revenues  cash flows or earnings  the rational investor puts more value on a dollar today by discounting the value of potential future dollars  Therefore  the higher the discount rate used  the more the future value of any revenues are reduced  In other words  the bigger the discount rate  the greater you are shrinking the value of future dollars by However  you can also look at the same time use of money principle in reverse Compounding today s dollars into future dollars is exactly the same concept of discounting future dollars to the present value  only working in reverse  Furthermore  you can look at the future growth rate  the compounding rate  as the inverse of the discount rate Since we are now working in reverse  the higher the growth rate that you use in your compounding equation  the larger the future stream of revenues  dollars  will be I have always preferred compounding to discounting  because I find it easier to think about  With compounding  I can estimate a future value based on the expected growth rate I estimate and run those numbers to their logical conclusion Therefore  I can easily calculate the fair value or price I should pay today for those future dollars based on rates of return that I would be willing to accept The F A S T  Graphs  Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator allow me to easily make these calculations and also  with its override function  run various  what if  scenarios Therefore  I can calculate best case  worst case and my most reasonable case scenarios  In my opinion  the discipline of calculating various future values of a dollar s worth of earnings that I intend on buying today  over a reasonable range of possibilities is the best way I have found of demystifying the concept of estimating fair current value  Admittedly  this may not be an exact science  but it s a whole lot better than just pure guessing So let us now run different scenarios on our two sample companies Caterpillar Inc   CAT  and Ross Stores  ROST  Running Rational What if ScenariosFrom reviewing the historical earnings and price correlated graph on Caterpillar  above  we are reminded that the company s historical record of earnings growth is very cyclical Therefore  when making forecasts of the future earnings of a cyclical company  it seems only logical to focus our attention on a shorter future time than a longer one Caterpillar Inc    Forecasting Future EarningsThe following estimated earnings and return calculator shows that the consensus of 17 analysts reporting to Capital IQ estimates five year earnings growth of 20   I would like to point out that this is double Caterpillar s historical norm of approximately 10  per annum I believe this higher than average forecast is in large part due to the fact that the company is experiencing earnings growth coming off of a trough level  When conducting a more rigorous fundamental analysis on Caterpillar Inc   CAT   the focus should be on the fact that emerging markets are requiring new machines to develop their infrastructure  and developed markets are in dire need of replacing older equipment  All of this has led to a surge in demand coming out of the great recession of 2008 The seminal question is how long will this last Personally  I believe the analysts  estimates are reasonably accurate over the next couple of years  but the further out I look  the more I questioned the sustainability of a 20  growth rate Nevertheless  if Caterpillar can deliver 20  growth  then investors purchasing the company today could stand to earn substantial returns over the next five years However  due to the cyclical nature of Caterpillar  I would not be comfortable forecasting out that far If Caterpillar could grow by 20  per annum over the next two years  the company could be worth  200 to  250 a share by year end 2013 This is assuming that earnings do  in fact  grow to  11 05 a share over that time frame  see bottom of graph highlighted yellow   and further assumes a price earnings ratio expansion back to its normal 15 to 16 PE up from its current PE of 13 3  However  let me again caution you about the cyclical nature of this company In addition to the estimated earnings and return calculator that defaults to the consensus of leading analysts  I offer three additional what if scenarios on Caterpillar that forecast earnings at different growth rates  At the bottom of each graph I ve highlighted the estimated earnings growth for each scenario  This second forecasting graph is based on a cross check of 19 leading analysts reporting to Zacks Here we see the consensus five year forecast growth rate is much lower at 15 3  Note the impact this has on their earnings growth out the calendar year 2017 Our next graph goes back to looking at Caterpillar Inc  s historical earnings growth over the past five plus years  five calendar years plus the current quarter   Here we see cyclicality based on the great recession of 2008 contributing to an average earnings growth rate of 9 6  This scenario is based on using Caterpillar Inc  s last five year earnings growth rate as a proxy for their next five years earnings growth  Using the past five years earnings growth rate is a common practice for many investors who are trying to come up with a reasonable future forecast With this final what if scenario forecasting graph  I have arbitrarily plugged in a couple years of earnings drops in order to contemplate what might happen if Caterpillar Corp  s historical cyclicality returns I also assumed a historical cyclical growth rate of 10 2  Although the numbers I plugged in are hypothetical and arbitrary  they at least allow me to contemplate the effects of cyclicality Ross Stores Inc   ROST  Forecasting Future EarningsJust like I did with Caterpillar Corp   I will run various  what if  scenarios calculating various estimated earnings growth rates on Ross Stores Inc   ROST   The first graph is the one that defaults to the consensus of 23 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ  Here we find an estimated earnings growth rate of 12 5   which I want to point out  and as I will next elaborate  is significantly lower than Ross Stores  historical earnings growth rate As I did previously  I have highlighted each year s estimated earnings based on the respective growth rate utilized out to calendar year 2017  The primary point that I m attempting to focus on is how much more future earnings the investor would have with which the market could use to capitalize future values And I might add  upon which future dividends could be paid from Simply and logically  the more future earnings the company can generate  the more future value it simultaneously creates for shareholders This what if scenario calculates Ross Stores  future growth rate at the same rate it has achieved over the past 15 years I consider this a strong case  but not necessarily the best case scenario Perhaps this last what if scenario is the most intriguing because it calculates future earnings growth based on what Ross Stores  ROST  has achieved over the past 5  years  Keep in mind that this time frame included the great recession of 2008 and 2009 In other words  this growth was achieved during one of the weakest economies our country had seen in decades Summary   ConclusionsThe primary purpose of this part two of my series on the importance of earnings is offered to illustrate the conceptual validity of forecasting earnings as the key to long term investor success  Although I did introduce a few rudimentary methods of forecasting earnings  my primary objective was to highlight the important role that forecasting future earnings plays in the investment process As a general statement  the more detailed job of forecasting is about conducting a comprehensive fundamental analysis of the company under consideration One of the most efficient ways I have found to accomplish this task is by going to the company s website and then into the company s investor relations area  In most cases you can find investor presentations where the company details its past accomplishments and provides guidance regarding their future expectations These are the same presentations given to the analysts that are making forecasts  Of course the company is always putting their best spin on the information  nevertheless  a lot of facts can be gleaned from this process Just as we have seen in part one that the company s stock price will track its earnings in the long run  therefore  it can only logically follow that future earnings will drive future stock prices  Consequently  I will end this article by paraphrasing the sage advice offered from none other than Ben Graham s Mr  Market metaphor  Ben taught us that investors should not focus on the whims of Mr  Market Instead  he suggests that the investors are better off concentrating on the operating performance of his companies and receiving dividends In other words  earnings

Mitt Romney would have dearly loved to have won either Alabama or Mississippi  It would have shut down talk of his  failure to close   And it would have increased the pressure on Rick Santorum and or Newt Gingrich to get out of the race  The night was Santorum s with a win in Alabama and a narrow victory in Mississippi  although he may have inadvertently moved the bar higher than he can clear   Santorum  though failing to gain significant ground in the delegate race  will claim underdog wins  as he did in Minnesota and Colorado  and enjoy renewed optimism that he can battle on  The wins may give him a boost going into Saturday s contest in Missouri  In his victory remarks  an obviously elated Santorum spoke emotionally about  defying the odds   like America itself  But his speech lacked a clear message  as he rambled on about his travels in Mississippi  the Constitution  gas prices  oil drilling  being outspent  and his coal miner grandparents  In there  too  was a line about free markets and the  centrality of faith in our lives   He apparently feels compelled to wing these things and thereby fails to maximize his moments  He then uttered a line he may come to regret  He declared that he  will win the nomination before the convention   In light of the delegate gap  that strained credulity  and moreover  cast him in the role of the party wrecker and chaos maker  Expect the Romney team to drive home the message that Santorum isn t gaining in the delegate race  Steve Peoples   AP  Santorum s success and Romney s failure exposed deep divisions within a party torn between a conservative base that s looking for a candidate who is pure on GOP orthodoxy and the rest of the party  which is looking for a nominee able to beat President Barack Obama  Tuesday s outcomes also virtually ensure the increasingly nasty slog toward the Republican presidential nomination will consume even more of Romney s time  energy and money when he d rather be focused solely on the general election  and Obama   Despite his losing streak  Gingrich vowed to fight on until his party s nomination in August   and crowed about Romney s weaknesses    The fact is  in both states  the conservative candidates got nearly 70 percent of the vote  And if you re the frontrunner   if you re the frontrunner and you keep coming in third  you re not much of a frontrunner   Gingrich said  But in the Washington Post ABC News poll this week  among likely Republican voters  74 percent think Romney will capture the nomination As for President Obama and his reelection bid  the Wall Street

road tour version of the 2012 presidential election as it hits theaters in the likes of Mississippi  Alabama  Hawaii and Illinois  The best show in town still plays daily at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  If maestro Barack Obama wins reelection this fall  we will have watched one of the greatest magic acts in American history  The new Obama magic show debuted in the State of the Union speech  Standing before Congress  Mr  Obama brought forth  An Economy Built to Last   Not the real one we have now  but the one he s going to conjure after he s reelected  The way this works is the president breaks economic history into two parts  In his right hand are the awful policy mistakes someone else made before January 2009  In his left hand is the economy he ll bring to life after November  In between is nothing  You think you re looking at the Obama years from 2009 to 2012   8  unemployment  low growth  low investment   when whoa  it s gone  Never happened  The best was yet to come  The president of the United States is making the world itself and all its troubles vanish  Iraq  Afghanistan  Iran  Syria  Pakistan  North Korea   one by one  Mr  Obama and his lovely assistants have methodically taken them all off the table  If he can make the world s problems seem to go away until he gets reelected  it will constitute his presidency s greatest illusion  Henninger goes on to dissect them all  as I do every week  It s an amazing feat  At home and overseas  Barack Obama has just erased three years of rough spots from the hard disc of politics  It will be more remarkable still if the Republicans  amid a war weary public  go along with the illusion  The world  alas  may not  For America s onlooking competitors and adversaries in Tehran  Beijing  Moscow  Pyongyang and Waziristan  a U S  president s magic act is for them a very real opportunity  Kyle Smith   New York Post In his latest State of the Union  Obama said of our armed forces   They re not consumed with personal ambition  They don t obsess over their differences They work together  Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example   Except if we followed their example  we d all have to salute and say   Yes  sir  to everything  That s not democracy  Generals who say the mission failed because the troops didn t follow orders shouldn t be surprised when the troops start to mock them  Blame deflection isn t leadership  And that s why both  Jimmy  Carter and Obama came to seem so tired  dull  repetitive  scolding  inept and irrelevant  Carter s poll numbers went up immediately after the malaise speech but retreated after a few days  His words gave him an anti halo   the shadow of a whiner    You can t castigate the American people   his vice president  Walter Mondale  told Carter   or they will turn you off once and for all   In his State of the Union  President Obama expressed wonderment that everything doesn t work like the Navy SEAL raid that got bin Laden   No one thought about politics  No one thought about themselves This nation is great because we worked as a team  This nation is great because we get each other s backs   Obama sounded as if he was pleading with us to get his back    Carter  Clinton and I all have sort of the disease of being policy wonks   Obama told Ron Suskind in the book  Confidence Men   He sounded as if he was pleading that he was too smart for the American people    For all of us to succeed  we have to have an investment in each other s success   he said last month in Bellevue  Wash  It sounded as if he was pleading for us to accept the bill for his failures  Mondale was right  If Americans think their president is blaming them  they ll turn him off once and for all  Kathleen Parker   Washington Post Introducing her husband on Super Tuesday night  Ann Romney said that women this election season are interested in jobs  the economy and the debt  Translation  So could we shut up already about contraception  Republicans might wish nothing more than to stuff birth control pills back into the bottle  but Democrats aren t about to let them  The narrative already has a title   The Republican War on Women   Cue theme from  Psycho   One can hardly blame Democrats for taking advantage of a perfect storm of stupefying proportions  The only thing Republicans failed to do was put a bow on this mess   War has been declared  and there s hardly any way to change the impression among a growing percentage of women that the GOP is the party of knuckle dragging Neanderthals  It s a smart move for Democrats to keep replaying the message  but is it fair   and is it true       Republicans  are waging war on women only if you believe that the morality of abortion should never be questioned or if you believe the federal government can order people to pay for something that violates their conscience  These issues are not so simple  nor are Republicans simpletons for trying to protect the unborn or challenging what they view as government overreach  Unfortunately  the conservative governing principles that traditionally attracted level heads to the right side of the aisle have been incrementally subsumed by social issues   a bull s eye for Democrats and a black eye for Republicans  Inasmuch as women are the ones who most urgently require access to family planning  any opposition can be conflated to be anti woman  Hence  Ann Romney s well placed remarks  She is right  of course  but the problem she was implicitly trying to address is not short term  The GOP long ago made its bed with social conservatives  a large percentage of them Southern evangelicals  and now must sleep with them  After marriage  of course  In Laurens County  S C   where the local GOP recently tried to create a purity tribunal to screen and monitor aspiring Republican candidates  this is more than a punch line  Although the state party ruled the county initiative inconsistent with state laws  the Laurens mind set burbles just beneath the surface of the once Grand Old Party  And that is a problem only Democrats could love  Nice space program  According to NASA chief Charles Bolden   Given current funding levels  we anticipate the need to purchase  Russian  crew transportation and rescue capabilities into 2017   Seems our hoped for space taxis won t be in service by early 2016 as planned

complaints variously describing a white male  running around the street in his underwear    naked and  leaving this part out  and screaming  and  banging his hands on the ground and screaming incoherently     Wall Street Journal OK none of this should be a surprise but there was further confirmation on the food front concerning what is good or bad for you  To wit According to the journal  Archives of Internal Medicine   data from 121 342 men and women taking part in two large U S  health and lifestyle investigations revealed that red meat can be lethal at least regularly eating it  especially the processed variety  As reported by John von Radowitz of the Irish Independent  Each additional daily serving of processed red meat  equivalent to one hot dog or two rashers of bacon  raised the chances of dying by a fifth  Conversely  replacing red meat with fish  poultry  or plant based protein foods contributed to a longer life  Out of the data base  monitored for more than 20 years   scientists documented 23 926 deaths including 5 910 from heart disease and 9 364 from cancer   A striking association was seen between consumption of red meat and premature death   Each daily serving of unprocessed red meat  equivalent to a helping of beef  lamb or pork about the size of a deck of cards  raised the risk of death by 13   while processed meat increased it by 20   Eating red meat increased the chances of heart disease by 16  and cancer by 10   Processed red meat raised the risk of heart disease and cancer by 21  and 16   respectively  Replacing one serving of red meat with an equivalent serving of fish reduced mortality risk by 7   For poultry an even bigger risk reduction of 14  was seen  Legumes and low fat dairy products lowered the risk by 10   whole grains by 14  and nuts by 19   So join me for Salmon Sunday   with nuts and beer for happy hour Meanwhile  the National Cattlemen s Beef Association  the American Meat Institute Foundation and the National Pork Board said that red meat is a healthy part of a well balanced diet  After all  cave men ate meat and they lived to be about 17  Oops  who s writing their copy Now I must defend the Pork Board  having

121971,343486,NYT,Week in Review Part I  Europe  Washington and Wall Street,opinion,This was not a good week on the Euro front  especially if you read between the lines a bit  You know how the combination of the approval of Greek Bailout II and the second Long Term Refinancing Operation  or LTRO  was to have finally provided needed stability among the Euro 17 Well not so fast  sheriff  err Mario as in European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi  who once again was strutting like a peacock looking for a mate  it being spring and all  as he proclaimed in an interview with a German paper   The worst is over  but there are still risks  The situation is stabilizing  Well  that was a little squishy  If one of the risks reemerges  the situation won t be stable No doubt  crisis was averted last fall but it s increasingly looking like we are heading right back into one  sooner than later  like within 4 to 8 weeks  I ll say For one thing  the economic data in the euro region has been putrid  A combination service and manufacturing sectors reading for March has come in worse than expected  48 7 vs  49 3 in February  50  remember  being the dividing line between growth and contraction   while a separate reading on manufacturing came in at 47 7 for the month  This isn t good We also learned that Ireland is back in recession as GDP fell 0 2  in the fourth quarter after a 1 1  decline in the third  And the more you read about Portugal the worse it is there  with humongous local debts that need to be serviced by the central government but probably won t  seeing as they have their own rather serious issues  The U K  saw retail sales sink in February  while Germany is exhibiting signs of a distinct slowdown So while you have the likes of Greek Fake Prime Minister Lucas Papademos  he s unelected  you see  declaring that  we are more than halfway along the path to economic recovery   which is a crock of yogurt  what is most apparent is that Spain is about to become the next crisis  Maybe not tomorrow  Maybe not April 5  But it s coming Worrisomely  the Spanish 10 year bond is back to 5 50  as huge downside remains on the real estate front  The Financial Times  Wolfgang Munchau writes   Spain s house price adjustment is still less than halfway complete   while official estimates say there will be only mild declines from here and a quick rebound in the economy But with a deficit of 8 5  of GDP last year  and the government s own admission that 2012 s is going to be closer to 6  than 5   Munchau concludes   The deleveraging of the public sector will be vicious   with unemployment at nearly 23  as it is  youth unemployment 50     The question is not whether the Spanish economy rebounds in 2012 or 2013  but whether it can rebound at all before the end of this decade  And here s the thing  How long have we been talking about the eurozone needing an expanded firewall beyond the planned 500 billion euro ESM  European Stability Mechanism   The EFSF  European Financial Stability Facility  has about 250 billion euro remaining  but that s earmarked for Greece  Portugal and Ireland  so the 500 billion ESM is really all that s left to backstop Italy and Spain  which we know is absurd It s the same old story  The IMF and European Commission want an increased firewall  but Germany remains obstinate in its belief there is enough there and that the system is now stabilized through the LTROs But sentiment can turn on a dime and the vultures are beginning to swirl over Spain  It needs growth in the worst way and none is forthcoming One last comment on Europe for now  I like Jim O Neill  who heads up asset management at Goldman Sachs and is a longtime strategist  He always has some interesting comments But the other day he s on CNBC and said   Who cares about Greece   Everyone should care about Greece and soon  Spain  I ve always said the story with Greece is not about the size of its puny economy  but whether the country explodes into a spasm of anarchy and violence that could rapidly spread to other nations in the region  It s the Balkans  after all  Thus far  the demonstrations and rioting we ve seen there have been manageable  At a moment s notice  however  the situation could change drastically  That s why one should keep their eyes on Greece Washington and Wall StreetLots of talk about energy and oil prices this week  some of it coming from the White House was quite comical But first  Saudi Arabia s oil minister Ali Naimi sought to reassure the world that  105  oil   125 on Brent crude  was  unjustified  and that the Saudis had lots of spare capacity to boost output if needed  the Saudis understanding that it does them no good if the world plunges back into recession Of course  15 to  20 of the price of oil is an Iran risk premium and until that situation resolves itself  oil will remain stubbornly high  Case closed  Yes  you have refinery issues as well  which doesn t help any  but it s Iran Iran Iran  friends  and nothing Barack Obama or Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich says can change matters   President Obama s actions regarding Iran are a different matter  But that s what s so comical  Our politicians really do treat us like a bunch of schmucks sometimes  while more than a few Americans don t bother to think themselves  or read a good newspaper  before spouting off at the mouth  It s a good time to avoid cocktail parties  actually  because you d hear a lot of idiotic drivel but I digress Anyway  there was our president this week in Cushing  Oklahoma  getting all folksy  as he is prone to do  He has different voices  A good  stern  articulate one for most Washington appearances and speeches  His ghetto voice when he s in front of a crowd of African Americans  and his folksy voice for the Okies  So there s Obama  Today I ve come to Cushing  an oil town  because producing more oil and gas here at home has been and will continue to be a critical part of an all of the above energy strategy   a strategy he stole directly from the Republicans  as you all know A new pipeline running south from Cushing is needed  he continued  because  there s a bottleneck right here because we can t get enough of the oil to our refineries fast enough   he added  taking credit  as the Los Angeles Times  Christi Parsons and Neela Banerjee reported   for an upturn in domestic oil production which has the industry pumping more than at any time in the last eight years  But then Obama had to play to his environmental base  so he told the Okies about why he couldn t approve the Keystone XL pipeline that would have gone from Canada to Cushing  and if you knew what was going on you just shook your head  as I did watching him on television  because it was so freakin  phony Plus  as the L A  Times  reporters noted  opponents of Keystone are still torqued off that Obama approved the southern portion because it still means oil from Canada s dirty tar sands could still find its way to Cushing and then Texas So the president is flailing about  trying on different voices like John Byner or Frank Gorshin  but when it comes to November and Americans pushing the lever for president  how educated are most voters really going to be on the critical issues of our time be it energy policy or Iran or China Sorry for the helter skelter commentary  but even I can t follow the president sometimes  And  believe me  I m not saying Republicans are any better on a lot of issues themselves these days Meanwhile  in terms of the gas price at the pump  the national average as I write is  3 86  California and New York being among the states with an average over  4 00   with 54  saying the president has influence on prices according to a CBS News New York Times survey  Oh brother I do just have to add two tidbits on this topic  A New York Times story noted that the nation imported a record high 60  of its oil in 2005 and in 2011 that figure was down to 45   so we re making progress on the energy independence front And the future does look bright  As Ed Morse  a commodities analyst and former State Department official wrote in a Wall Street Journal Op Ed  The United States has become the fastest growing oil and gas producer in the world  and it is likely to remain so for the rest of this decade and into the 2020s  Add to this output the steadily growing Canadian production and a likely reversal of Mexico s recent production decline  and theoretically total oil production from the three countries could rise by 11 2 million barrels per day by 2020  or to 26 6 million barrels per day from around 15 4 million per day at the end of 2011  And natural gas output should also continue to explode in both the U S  and Canada  all the more reason why President Obama s insulting Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper by shelving the Keystone pipeline  even if temporarily  was incredibly stupid Elsewhere on the economic front  the numbers on housing were mixed  at best  with February housing starts pretty solid  but a breakdown showed single family starts were down and multi family were up  continuing trends on both  Existing home sales for February were down over January  but the two month pace was the best since May 2010  Here  though  prices were unchanged from a year ago  so the bottoming process continues But then we had the figure on February new home sales and they were less than expected Barron s had a story on the real estate sector and a recovery  finally  in spring 2013  Sure  that s possible  But I certainly don t see a robust one in terms of prices unless we have rampant inflation Finally  the U S  Supreme Court has scheduled an unprecedented six hours of hearings on President Obama s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for March 26  27 and 28  the key provision being the requirement that virtually everyone in the country has to buy insurance or pay a penalty  Legal experts believe the four Democratic appointed justices will have no trouble ruling for ObamaCare in concluding Congress did not overstep its authority in adopting the individual mandate  So the issue then becomes  which of four Republican appointed justices will join Clarence Thomas  the most likely to vote against Charles Krauthammer   Washington Post ObamaCare was carefully constructed to manipulate the standard 10 year cost projection of the CBO  Congressional Budget Office   Because benefits would not fully kick in for four years  President Obama could trumpet 10 year gross costs of less than  1 trillion    938 billion to be exact  But now that the near costless years 2010 and 2011 have elapsed  the true 10 year price tag comes into focus  From 2013 through 2022  the CBO reports  the costs of ObamaCare come to  1 76 trillion   almost twice the phony original number  It gets worse  Annual costs after 2012 are more than a quarter of  1 trillion every year   until the end of time  That  for a new entitlement in a country already drowning in  16 trillion of debt   Ultimately  the question  before the Supreme Court  will hinge on whether the Commerce Clause has any limits  If the federal government can compel a private citizen  under threat of a federally imposed penalty  to engage in a private contract with a private entity  to buy health insurance   is there anything the federal government cannot compel the citizen to do      Rarely has one law so exemplified the worst of the Leviathan state   grotesque cost  questionable constitutionality and arbitrary bureaucratic coerciveness  Little wonder the president barely mentioned it in his latest State of the Union address  He wants to be reelected  He d rather talk about other things  But there s no escaping it now  Oral arguments begin Monday at 10 a m  And a word on China  It s really funny how there are two highly divided camps out there  One believes China is in the midst of a hard landing  the other believes that such talk is  vastly overblown   as economist and China expert Stephen Roach continues to state  In Roach s mind  the Chinese government  has done a fantastic job of controlling inflation   the chief worry there  and now has ample room to lower rates and or reserve requirements  unlike the West which has moved rates to zero and come the next crisis is screwed because it has few  if any  options left In fact while some talk of Armageddon in China  Nomura and Deutsche Bank raised their 2012 GDP forecasts to 8 2  and 8 6   respectively But the bear case was indeed bolstered by HSBC s March PMI reading of 48 1  the fifth consecutive fall and down from February s 49 6 reading  though the government s official numbers come out April 1 The bears keep bringing up China s real estate bubble  and on this I share the concern  as property prices fell a fifth consecutive month in February  but this is exactly what the government has been trying to engineer  a gradual decline  Premier Wen Jiabao said last week   Home prices are still far above a reasonable level  Therefore  we must not relax tightening  So the hard part is for the government to stay the course on the property front  while also stimulating growth elsewhere  According to some of the stories I ve read  Chinese consumer confidence is returning  with more and more believing the worst is over I focus on the comments of U S  corporations dealing there and almost to a man  executives admit China is going through a slow patch  but that the second half will be better And on the local government debt front  another major concern  Moody s this week said China was getting a handle on the problem a significant statement coming from them I have a few more tidbits below on China  but I m expecting to learn far more this coming week with the probable earnings release from my major holding there  I ll have some general personal portfolio comments at that time as well ,2012-03-26,Brian

121972,343487,NYT,The Rise Of Robo Rebalancing,opinion,Tara Siegel Bernard tells us that automatic rebalancing options are becoming common at 401 k  plans  but the service is still a rarity for online brokerages  TD Ameritrade and Fidelity are among the handful of exceptions  she  in The New York Times  In a perfect world  these options would be standard everywhere  Rebalancing  after all  is crucial for risk management and earning a decent risk premium through time  Making this essential task easier  by putting it on auto pilot  would be a huge plus for investors  You can  of course  rebalance on your own  The problem is that most of us don t  at least not on a timely basis  perhaps not at all  The price of inaction can be costly because the rebalancing bonus can be substantial  For example   that a simple regimen of rebalancing a portfolio comprised of the  improves performance considerably vs  an unrebalanced strategy over the past decade plus  Optimizing the process holds out the promise of doing even better  That s old news  of course  Numerous studies over the years find that rebalancing is the foundation for successful portfolio design and management  A few examples   by Yesim Tokat  Vanguard   by John Nersesian  IMCA   by Steven Weinstein  et al   CCH Inc    by Bill Montague  Consulting Group  Although the topic of rebalancing is no stranger to financial analysis  it s premature to say that the subject has been exhausted as a research topic  Identifying the ideal set of parameters that govern the rebalancing rules is certainly in no danger of full transparency  as a new paper from Research Affiliates reminds  It s well know and widely documented that the value factor earns a sizable risk premium over growth in the equity market  advises  by Denis Chaves and Robert Arnott   Less well known  however  is how this outperformance is achieved   they note Decomposing the total returns of these strategies  we find that  a  value portfolios enjoy higher dividend income and  b  the average growth stock enjoys faster dividend growth than the average value stock  but  surprisingly   c  value portfolios experience higher growth in dividends than growth portfolios  We argue that the first two findings are expected  but the third one is not completely understood by investors  This third result is a consequence of the nature of the rebalance rules for growth and value portfolios  Each rebalance replaces lower yielding value stocks with new higher yielding replacements  and replaces higher yielding growth stocks with new lower yielding replacements  It is  therefore  the act of rebalancing and reconstituting the growth and value portfolios that increases the growth rate for dividend income in value strategies  and rather sharply reduces it in the case of growth strategies  Another recent study labels the rebalancing effect as  That s a fair description of what s going on here  but to borrow a phrase from New York s lottery campaign  you ve got to be in it  to win it  There are no guarantees with rebalancing  of course  but the same caveat applies to every other investment strategy  Everything has risks  and so it s all about managing the risks intelligently  Rebalancing  combined with broad diversification across the major asset classes  offers the most bang for the average investor s portfolio buck  But as several studies have found  relatively few individuals  and perhaps quite a few institutional investors  are mining rebal s gold on a systematic basis  That s probably because the discipline required to rebalance when it s most productive i e   when markets soar and crash is usually in short supply  That also explains why the expected premium from rebalancing is substantial and persistent  That s another way of saying that if more investors embrace rebalancing  and do so on a timely basis  the expected return from this portfolio technique will decline  Given human nature  however  it s safe to assume that the ex ante rebalancing premium will remain healthy for the foreseeable future Nonetheless  it s getting easier to automate the process  Online tools like  for instance  herald a new age for optimizing the rebalancing process  It s anyone s guess how many investors will take advantage of these tools  Rebalancing  after all  has a hard time competing for the average investor s attention in the grand scheme of financial news and information  But maybe that s good news for the few who exploit the strategic opportunities that seem to elude so many of us  In short  the death of the expected rebalancing premium  and the associated benefits that arise from   are greatly exaggerated ,2012-03-27,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-rise-of-robo-rebalancing-118353,118353
121973,343488,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,France  The killing of the self described al Qaeda operative in Toulouse  Mohammed Merah  a man responsible for the deaths of four Jews  three of whom were children  and three Muslim soldiers  has roiled the French presidential election Far right candidate Marine Le Pen of the National Front  said  It is time to wage war on these fundamentalist political religious groups who are killing our children  The threat of Islamic fundamentalism has been underestimated  I have been talking about this for months and months  and the political class has rejected  me   Some are going to have difficulty explaining themselves but I have a clear conscience  Well  it s true  This has been Le Pen s platform  as I saw firsthand last May Day in Paris  She has regularly attacked immigration and the influence of Islam in French society But  just as Americans normally rally around a president in similar situations  it is President Nicolas Sarkozy who  in these first days after the successful manhunt  is benefiting at the polls  suddenly now leading Socialist candidate Francois Hollande by two points in one survey I saw It s the power of the office  Sarkozy had the television cameras trained on him as he met with Jewish and Muslim leaders and led the ceremony for the murdered soldiers The whole issue is complicated by the fact the soldiers were Muslim  with France having Europe s largest Muslim population You also have questions as to why French security forces felt the need to end the siege in the manner they did  not knowing Merah was lying in wake in a bathroom in a final attempt to ambush them  Authorities could have extracted more information from the guy One positive tone was set during the week in relation to Merah s claim he killed the Jewish children to avenge Palestinian children killed by Israel  Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad replied  It is time for these criminals to stop marketing their terrorist acts in the name of Palestine and to stop pretending to stand up for the rights of Palestinian children who only ask for a decent life  A heroic statement on Fayyad s part I also have to say that this incident in Toulouse was yet another reason for my adage  wait 24 hours   I didn t comment last time on the killing of the three French soldiers because I didn t have time to collect all the facts  as I would see them  with all manner of theories being put forth initially  think those first hours after Oklahoma City  There were news reports from France the killer had to be a neo Nazi Iran  The new round of discussions between the five permanent members of the U N  Security Council  Germany and Iran over Iran s atomic activities are slated for April 13 in Geneva and will not extend beyond July 1  which is when new EU restrictions on purchases of petroleum from Iran are to be implemented  But now we are hearing of all manner of exemptions on the sanctions front being granted various nations  Japan plus ten in the EU   exactly what wasn t supposed to happen  At least not what the U S  Congress wanted  it having pushed the Obama administration into the tougher sanctions regime program in the first place And Iran is saying the international community must accept its  civilian  program or incur  heavy losses   as stated by an Iranian lawmaker  Alaeddin Boroujerdi  who heads the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee in parliament  This a hole is advising the P5 1 to avoid a  policy of confrontation  with Iran  while calling on the United Nations Security Council to lift existing sanctions And it was last time  3 17 12  I wrote the following  I get a kick out of those who still talk about Iranian President Ahmadinejad as if he is calling the shots  I told you long ago that wasn t the case  that if we had a choice  Ahmadinejad was a  moderate  compared to  Supreme Leader Ayatollah  Khamenei  But Ahmadinejad is officially irrelevant  Khamenei calls the shots  So on Wednesday  former Iranian parliamentarian Seyed Mousavi  said that Khamenei had neutralized all but the most extreme voices in the government  as reported by the Jerusalem Post  Describing Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as having lost his role in foreign policymaking  and the reform faction as completely eliminated from the government structure  Mousavi told the Middle East Institute that Khamenei would face few checks on his perspective during fresh negotiations  So we know that Khamenei is not about to give up the nuclear program  and that talks are now going to drag out  potentially  through the spring  which is all part of Iran s four corners offense  but where does this leave Israel in terms of launching a preemptive strike Once again there were all manner of articles with disagreeing opinions on whether U S  and Israeli intelligence  and leaders  agreed on the status of Iran s program  Here s what is clear  While the West  including Germany this week  urges Israeli restraint  Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are certainly talking as if a strike is imminent  this spring Barak told Israel Radio that the state  cannot afford  to wait  though he said several months can be given to allow sanctions and negotiations to work  because during this period it would become clear  if the Iranians intend or don t intend to stop their nuclear weapons program  But in a meeting with his German counterpart  Barak said   To accept a nuclear Iran would be inconceivable and unacceptable to the whole world  Barak  in yet another forum said   The world  including the current U S  administration  understands and accepts that Israel necessarily views the threat differently than they do  and that ultimately  Israel is responsible for taking the decisions related to its future  its security and its destiny    Iran  is steadily approaching maturation and is verging on a  zone of immunity    a position from which the Iranian regime could complete its program without effective disruption  at its convenience  Netanyahu said Sunday   Iran  whose leader foments terrorism and violence around the globe and calls for our destruction this regime must never be allowed to have nuclear weapons  The Wall Street Journal s Brett Stephens  on the intelligence debate   The debate  is mostly an irrelevance  Iran s real nuclear weapons program is hiding in plain sight  The serious question policy makers must answer isn t whether Iran will go for a bomb once it is within a half step of getting one  It s whether Iran should be allowed to get within that half step  That is the essence of the debate the Obama administration is now having with Israel  The president has stated flatly that he won t allow Iran to have nuclear weapons  Good  But Israelis worry that Mr  Obama will allow them to come too close for comfort  or pre emption   Israel cannot be reassured by the administration s apparent decision to make its case through a series of media leaks  all calculated to head off a possible Israeli strike   It should come as no surprise that an intelligence community meant to provide decision makers with disinterested analysis has  in practice  policy goals and ideological axes of its own  But that doesn t mean it is any less dangerous  The real lesson of the Iraq WMD debacle wasn t that the intelligence was  overhyped   since the CIA is equally notorious for erring in the opposite direction  It was that intelligence products were treated as authoritative guides to decision making  Spooks  like English children  should be seen  not heard  The problem is that the spooks  like the children  want it the other way around  How  then  should people think about the Iran state of play  By avoiding the misdirections of  intelligence   For real intelligence  merely consider that a regime that can take a rock in its right hand to stone a woman to death should not have a nuclear bomb within reach of its left  Even a spook can grasp that  The Atlantic s Jeffrey Goldberg  who recently conducted a key interview with President Obama prior to his meeting with Netanyahu in Washington  stated in an op ed for Bloomberg  After interviewing many people with direct knowledge of internal government thinking I m highly confident that Netanyahu isn t bluffing   that he is in fact counting down to the day when he will authorize a strike against a half dozen or more Iranian nuclear sites  One reason I m now more convinced is that Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak are working hard to convince other members of the Israeli cabinet that a strike might soon be necessary  Syria  This is truly pathetic  The U N  Security Council endorsed former U N  Secretary General Kofi Anna s six point peace plan on Wednesday and U S  ambassador Susan Rice proclaimed   Annan s proposal is the best way to put an end to the violence  facilitate much needed humanitarian assistance and advance a Syrian led political transition  Susan Rice is one of the all time lightweights  She is not qualified for this job in any fashion at this particular dangerous time in world history And Kofi Annan is a house sitter  Nothing more  Or as the Washington Post editorialized   There  is virtually no possibility that the new initiative will accomplish any of  the goal s enunciated by Rice    as the Obama administration should know by now  Instead  it will likely provide time and cover for the regime of Bashar al Assad to continue using tanks and artillery to assault Syrian cities and indiscriminately kill civilians  That s exactly what the regime was doing Thursday   pounding the city of Hama  where at least 20 people have been reported killed in army attacks in the past two days  The Annan plan won t work because  like the Arab League plan before it  it calls for the Assad government to take steps that would lead to its swift collapse   and the regime has no intention of capitulating   For Russia and China  the Security Council statement offered a face saving way out of the embarrassing position of appearing to be unconditionally backing Mr  Assad  It gives Moscow hope of achieving the outcome it hopes for  a U N  brokered  peace  that leaves the regime in power  For the Obama administration  Mr  Annan s mission allows the illusion that its diplomatic strategy is producing results   and that more decisive measures  such as arming the opposition or creating a protected zone inside Syria  are unnecessary  What the Annan mission does not offer is  the best way to put an end to the violence   It is just the opposite  a guarantee that the bloodshed will continue  and probably worsen  The fighting in Syria will end only when Mr  Assad is forced to stop   or he succeeds in killing his way to victory  How many times have we heard President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton proclaim   Ultimately  this dictator will fall    Obama s exact words   15  25  The regime has retaken many of the cities once held by rebels and the rebels are low on ammunition  though the rebels are turning more to guerrilla tactics  including roadside bombs and ambushes Meanwhile  hundreds of Hizbullah fighters supposedly have been receiving training in the use of advanced anti aircraft weapons in Syria and Iran  in recent months  according to the Israeli paper Haaretz  Israeli officials are also increasingly concerned over the potential transfer of Syria s chemical weapons stockpile to Hizbullah  If Israel sees this happening  they will almost be forced to launch a preemptive strike on Lebanon One thing I ve railed about on the Lebanon front is Israel s constant violations of U N  Security Council Resolution 1701 in terms of violating Lebanon s airspace  This week  its foreign minister  Adnan Mansour  on a trip to Moscow  claimed there were over 9 000 such violations since 2006  Russian media recorded Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying  We consider violating this resolution unacceptable  especially as far as respect for Lebanon s sovereignty and airspace is concerned  I couldn t agree more  the first and probably only time I ll agree with Mr  Lavrov on anything  Update on a statement I made last week that I had written Israeli defense contractor Rafael and not received a reply  I did on Monday  Afghanistan  U S  soldier Robert Bales has been charged with 17 counts of murder  according to U S  officials  If convicted  he deserves the death penalty  though it s unlikely it would be carried out  which makes the sentence itself a joke DeWayne Wickham   USA TODAY Even before the identity of the Army staff sergeant believed to have massacred 16  Ed  later changed to 17  people in an Afghanistan village became known  excuses for his ghoulish acts of terror started popping up in the news media  diminishing the likelihood that justice will prevail    In other such cases  think William Calley who served just 3   years for My Lai   public opinion among war weary Americans opposed harsh punishment for these mass murderers  who were seen more as victims of unpopular wars   men who were driven over the brink by the bad decision making of their superiors or of Washington policymakers  Such shortsightedness damages more than the American concept of justice  It also does great injury to the democratic ideals we use to justify the continued presence of U S  troops in Afghanistan and Iraq  And when an American soldier who commits a crime gets off with little or no punishment  it devalues the lives of their foreign victims and creates tensions that put at risk the lives of other U S  service members who get targeted for retribution  Of course  war can take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on those who are sent into battle  But that s no excuse for the brutal slaughter Bales is suspected of committing   To imply that a U S  soldier who goes on a killing spree in a foreign land is less culpable because of the pressures of war slanders the incredibly good conduct of the millions of U S  men and women who have served honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan  The person who massacred the Afghan villagers deserves the contempt of this nation   and the unyielding judgment of its criminal justice system  Meanwhile  President Karzai lumped the Taliban and the United States together at a meeting with relatives of the massacre  saying  There are two demons in our country now  That s our boy  who undoubtedly has squirreled  billions in U S  aid money away in some Swiss bank account  or Abu Dhabi  A European diplomat recently told the New York Times  Never in history has any superpower spent so much money  sent so many troops to a country  and had so little influence over what its president says and does  Meanwhile  it s now been revealed that Afghan security forces have killed 13 members of the NATO led coalition since the start of the year  but General John Allen  the U S  soldier leading the operation  told Congress  the  campaign is on track   Bull  I m sick of our generals And I m sick of conservative columnists  such as Michael Gerson of the Washington Post  continually making excuses for the Afghan effort  as he does this week  In the two years since the Afghan surge was announced  U S  forces have systematically cleared out insurgent strongholds in the Taliban heartland  Afghan forces have grown in numbers and professionalism   showing admirable discipline and restraint after the recent Koran burning incident  About 90 percent of military operations are conducted jointly by Americans and Afghans  During the past 12 weeks  the number of enemy initiated attacks has been 25 percent lower than a year ago  Much of that just isn t true  from other accounts I ve read  some of which I ve posted in this space  On the other hand  of course the Taliban is just waiting us out  If I was a woman there  I d do everything in my power to get out now And note to President Obama  If you are going to stick to your 2014 timetable  as administration officials have been saying since the massacre  and in the face of deaths of Americans at the hands of Afghans  then give an address to the nation  You re not helping the cause by staying silent Pakistan  A parliamentary commission on Tuesday demanded an end to American drone attacks inside the country as a condition for restoring ties with the U S  It also demanded an apology for deadly airstrikes in November  including one that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers  which then led to the closure of supply lines through the country to Afghanistan The commission didn t say the closure of the U S  and NATO lines should be permanent  rather officials will now look to charge more money for the privilege Iraq  Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for a wave of bombings and shootings across the country on Tuesday that claimed the lives of at least 49  Among the attacks were two  double car bombings in Karbala and Kirkuk  claiming 13 lives each   First car bomb goes off  the crowd and emergency crews assemble  and then the second goes off an al Qaeda trademark  Egypt  The White House announced it was resuming funding for Egypt s military and will bypass Congress in doing so  Recall the aid has normally amounted to  1 5 billion and was suspended during the country s crackdown on pro democracy groups  Congress had passed a law in December  mandating the administration certify that Egypt is making progress on the democracy front  But Sec  of State Clinton is waiving this restriction  Most egregious is that the Washington Post is reporting the administration will hand over the full amount  rather than withholding a portion for leverage What the heck is going on here   Even Vermont Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said   I am disappointed by this decision  North Korea  U N  nuclear inspectors have been invited for the first time in three years  which was part of the deal with the U S  that would have the latter sending food aid to the Commies as long as the North agreed to suspend nuclear and long range missile tests But of course then Pyongyang said it would launch a rocket mounted satellite around April 15 to mark the 100th birthday of Great Leader Kim Il sung  So the United States would be nuts to send anything  even stale Drake s cakes  before observing what North Korea does in April  Then again  we ve seen what the White House is doing with regards to Egypt and military aid Editorial   Wall Street Journal Apologists for engaging North Korea are busy assuring everyone that the satellite test is no big deal and doesn t threaten anyone  That s what they always say  But North Korea has built nuclear bombs as a way to give it greater political leverage  and no one should doubt that it is trying to build a ballistic missile that would threaten Japan and the U S  as a way to gain even more international clout  A missile launch will assist that effort even if it doesn t complete it  The Obama administration had been doing well with its economic sanctions and diplomatic neglect toward the North  until it fell for one more round of offering alms for good behavior  The only message the North s dynastic junta will understand is if the West now cuts off the food aid  Even better if the U S    or preferably  Japan   blows the missile out of the sky  The administration is on record as saying if the North launches the missile  the food deal is off  Even China announced it was concerned over the rocket launch plans Meanwhile  there is a nuclear security summit meeting taking place this week in Seoul  so you can imagine it s Spy vs  Spy in that megalopolis  as I ve long written of the thousands of North Korean agents there  Pyongyang warned the summiteers not to insult the North  Any such criticism would be considered a  declaration of war  President Obama will don the official bomber jacket in going to the DMZ  I think on Monday  for a photo op that will then be part of all his campaign videos  If he wants a real sense of the place  he should explore the tunnels For its part  the South Korean government wants to be able to extend its ballistic missile range beyond the 300km allowed as part of a 2001 memorandum of understanding with Washington  The Americans are concerned that doing so  even though the North is testing a missile with a range estimated at 3 000km and appears to be targeting Australia  by last report  would lead to a further arms race on the continent Let Seoul do it  Geezuz  this is a no brainer  We re worried about China s reaction China  For eight days  since state media announced the dismissal of Bo Xilai from his job of party chief of one of China s biggest cities  Chongqing  he has not been seen or heard from  nor has the government issued any further statement  this as rumors swirl of a potential coup in Beijing  which would be rather unsettling for those with investments there  mused your editor  It s disturbing enough the Communist Party is tongue tied  There never was an explanation just what Bo did wrong  only rumors a family member was being investigated for corruption and Bo was trying to block it So we wait to see what happens  what is said  the next few weeks in particular  After all  Premier Wen has called for further reform in China  far from the Maoist agenda Bo and his many supporters espouse At stake are seven of nine seats in the Politburo Standing Committee  one of which Bo was in line for  with the other two seats going to incoming president Xi Jinpinq  now vice president  who will succeed Hu Jintao  and Vice Premier Li Keqiang  who will succeed Wen  Sunday  March 25  is election day for chief executive for Hong Kong  the special administrative region monitored by Beijing  It s not a pure democratic vote as 1 200 people  mostly businessmen and political leaders  make the call among three candidates  actually they then pick smaller groups who do  The system isn t supposed to lead to surprises  since most are known to be loyal to Beijing  But this time the two leading candidates don t have the cleanest backgrounds  Mali  A number of  experts  the past few months have been touting the tremendous opportunities that lie in Africa  I hope you ve noticed I haven t been one of them  We ve only heard the same story for decades this time it s different  blah blah blah  All I need to do is look at Nigeria  a total hell hole where al Qaeda lookalike Boko Haram is out to slaughter all Christians  to know Africa s future is shaky  at best  Oh sure  there are always individual opportunities  but look at one country that was supposed to be a role model of democracy  Mali Just weeks before he was to step down  President Amadou Toure was ousted in a coup by a bunch of drunken soldiers who looted the presidential palace  arrested ministers and declared they were in charge  Mali was preparing to hold free elections just a month from now as Toure  adhering to the constitution  was not seeking reelection But as the New York Times reports  with the downfall of Gaddafi in Libya  Mali was flooded with weapons  bolstering the rebel movement  which led to defeats of Malian forces  The soldiers  in turn  were fed up with a government they said wasn t arming them sufficiently to beat back the rebels  As I write  there is no word on Toure s fate  though coup leaders say he is safe Cuba  Pope Benedict XVI arrives on Monday for an historic visit  the first to the island since John Paul II s 1998 trip  I m hoping Benedict issues some very strong  pro democracy statements  though last I read  he is not scheduled to meet with the island s human rights advocates  despite many of them earning papal recognition The loyalties of Cuban Cardinal Jame Ortega are being called into question as he controls the pontiff s schedule  What will Benedict do  Just follow along with the game  or go his own way ,2012-03-28,Brian

121975,343490,NYT,Is The New York Times Trying to Socialize Wall Street ,opinion,The New York Times came out with an article yesterday that caused me to seriously question the publication s true allegiance  The piece  written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and titled   JOBS Act Jeopardizes Safety Net For Investors   uses Groupon s current woes as an excuse to denounce the overwhelmingly bipartisan jobs bill just days before Obama is expected to sign it into law His title alone makes me cringe  Since when does investing come with safety nets  Investing involves risk  In fact  the entire concept of investing is weighing risk versus reward  Mr  Sorkin  do you even comprehend the magnitude of what your article intimated  You are basically insinuating that it should be the Government s responsibility to assure investment returns  Somewhere  Ayn Rand is rolling over in her grave Let s get one thing straight  I am all for investor protections  But unlike you  Mr  Sorkin  I also support a capital markets system that provides fairness to ALL investors  not just to the 1   I further endorse a bill that allows for investor protections without sacrificing our nation s greatest innovators  For far too long our capital markets have been hijacked by PIPE funds  program traders and a handful of supersized investment banking and institutional firms at the expense of our small businesses  The JOBS Act democratizes our capital markets  brings equality to retail investors as well as emerging companies  and most importantly  it hands the capital markets back to the 99  The  Crowdfunding  component of the bill that you condemn actually levels the investment playing field by permitting smaller investors to invest prior to a company s greatest growth spurt as opposed to having to wait until its IPO when the majority of the appreciation had long passed  Why do you take issue with the 99  being afforded the same opportunities to grow their money as the 1  Since you obviously lack an understanding of crowdfunding  allow me to educate you  The Crowdfunding Marketplace could not be more distinct from the unbalanced conventional markets you outwardly shield from crucial regulatory reform Unlike most public market investors  crowdfund investors are long term  benevolent shareholders who invest in a company  not because they have a  get rich quick  mentality  but because they truly appreciate a company s business  its mission  its value to the community and its potential impact on society  In fact  crowdfunders value a company s business so much that they are currently funding projects without even receiving an equity stake  Imagine a PIPE investor forgoing his equity because his true motive is to see the company succeed  I can t even envision him not securing his return by demanding a steep discount plus a warrant kicker for  risking  his capital  Crowdfunding allows businesses to obtain shareholders whose interests are more aligned with their own  This alliance gives companies a greater chance to succeed  If crowdfunding achieves nothing else but altering investing behaviors and making it  chic  to be a long term shareholder again  it will go a long way towards improving our capital markets  our economic future and even advancing society as a whole Finally  Mr  Sorkin  please understand that if you regulate the risk out of our capital markets  you will be regulating our nation right out of innovation  growth  global competitiveness and yes  job creation  Not every company will succeed  In fact  many will not  But our capital markets were built on the back of many failures as well as successes  Had it not been for those failures  there might never have been an Apple  Intel  Microsoft  Google or a Facebook and you would have written your irresponsible propaganda cloaked as journalism with a fountain pen instead of on a keyboard The New York Times needs to stop decapitalizing the markets under the pretense of investor fairness when their actions will only lead to greater injustice If it truly wants this nation to prosper  it will put an end to encouraging mediocrity and dependency through careless rhetoric of unwarranted safety nets ,2012-04-05,Dara Albright,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-new-york-times-trying-to-socialize-wall-street-119279,119279
122010,343525,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Iran  Iranians went to the polls on Friday to vote between bad and worse  the latter representing the parliamentary slate favored by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and the former the candidates of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  3 400 were on the ballots for 290 seats in the Majlis  though at least another 1 000 were barred from running by the Guardian Council  which is comprised of the Sons of Satan  Rick Santorum knows their names   Of course the election is a joke  what with the two main opposition candidates  Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi  being under house arrest for more than a year When it comes to the Iranian nuclear crisis  though  it s all about the visit on Monday between President Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House  along with parsing the words each are making in speeches at the pro Israel lobby  American Israeli Public Affairs Committee  or AIPAC  over the coming days  Israeli leaders want President Obama to lay all his cards on the table all the  options   Israel is frustrated that it doesn t know what the White House considers to be the real  red lines   Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen  Martin Dempsey earlier called Iran a  rational actor   which many can t fathom  And U S  intelligence agencies are once again saying that Iran has not decided to take the next step and build a nuclear bomb  rather it is content to continue to enrich uranium to 20 percent  below weapons grade  while preserving its own options But late in the week  General Norton Schwartz  the U S  Air Force Chief of Staff  told reporters that plans had been drawn up outlining how Washington could join a potential Israeli air offensive should Israel pursue that path   What we can do  you wouldn t want to be in the area   Schwartz said of the options  Supposedly they include going after the Revolutionary Guard and its al Quds force  along with installations of the Ministry of Intelligence and Security  Schwartz also said the latest version of America s bunker busting bombs was  operational   This is significant  this being the weapon of choice against the likes of the Fordow nuclear processing plant built into a mountain outside the holy city of Qom  U S  military planners  according to the Washington Post s Joby Warrick  are increasingly confident they can severely disrupt Fordow  I believe we overstate the ability of Iran to construct an impregnable facility And then late Friday  in an interview with The Atlantic s Jeffrey Goldberg  President Obama tested out his talking points  I think that the Israeli government recognizes that  as president of the United States  I don t bluff  I also don t  as a matter of sound policy  go around advertising exactly what our intentions are  But I think both the Iranian and the Israeli governments recognize that when the United States says it is unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapons  we mean what we say  Obama reiterated to Goldberg that  all options are on the table   and that the final option is the  military component   Obama then noted that sanctions organized by his administration had put Iran in a  world of hurt  that might force Iran to rethink its efforts to pursue a nuclear weapon  Without in any way being under an illusion about Iranian intentions  without in any way being na ve about the nature of that regime  they are self interested   Obama said   It is possible for them to make a strategic calculation that  at minimum  pushes much further to the right whatever potential breakout capacity they may have  and that may turn out to be the best decision for Israel s security  This is clearly much of what Netanyahu wants to hear from the president directly  even as Obama is strongly encouraging Israel to still hold off at the same time  and we ll see if the Israeli prime minister can pressure Obama into making a further public declaration that America is prepared to support an Israeli strike  The two are not currently slated to hold a joint news conference following their meeting but both sides are to issue statements  Republican Senator John McCain  who met with Netanyahu in Israel last week  said he had never seen an Israeli leader  that unhappy    He was angry   McCain said   And  frankly  I ve never seen U S  Israel relations at this point     In Israel itself  in a recent survey  19  of Israelis support an attack against Iran without the backing of the United States  while 42  support a strike only if there is U S  support  32  oppose an attack regardless of the level of assistance from Washington Syria  In a major shift in policy  Russian Prime Minister  soon to be president again  Vladimir Putin said that Russia had no special relationship with Syrian President Bashar Assad and that it was up to Syrians to decide who should run the country  Putin said   We need to make sure they stop killing each other   Putin told the Times of London that he had been appalled by the brutal killing of Muammar Gaddafi and the atrocities committed in Libya  Putin called for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations between the parties Heretofore  both Russia and China  as two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  had supported Syria  but on Thursday  both countries voted in favor of a statement deploring the decision by the Syrian government not to admit Baroness Amos  the UN s human rights chief The White House said Thursday the situation in Homs was  horrific   Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman added   It s important that the tipping point for the regime be reached quickly  because the longer the regime assaults the Syrian people  the greater the chances of all out war in a failed state  The UN has raised its estimated death toll to 7 500  though it would seem it s now far higher as Homs is  cleaned   sic  within hours  according to one report  There is no telephone or internet service  Communication is impossible  yet tens of thousands of civilians remain  trapped  13 were killed in a botched attempt to smuggle out four reporters  at least three of whom later escaped   while the bodies of the two journalists killed on Feb  22 were finally taken to Damascus  at last word   Sec  of State Hillary Clinton called for a coup  while Qatar and Saudi Arabia want the rebels armed  the Saudis wanting to see the majority Sunnis in charge in Syria Meanwhile  the United States is very concerned over the fate of Syria s chemical weapons stockpiles and has warned neighboring states to be on the lookout for the spread of them  Sound familiar  We have the same issue with Libya and hundreds of missing shoulder fired missiles In the case of Syria  the concern is more than warranted  For starters  Syria is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention  so the international community lacks comprehensive knowledge of how much they have and where it is stored  There are also legitimate concerns Bashar Assad will use the weapons on his own people to save his skin Lastly  I just have to note for the record that Syria did hold its sham referendum on a new constitution  one that would enable Assad to stay in power until 2028 his current term ends in 2014 and the new constitution allows for two  7 year terms  so he d run under the rules of the new document Egypt  A court adjourned a trial of 16 Americans and 27 others from non governmental organizations and then two of the NGOs paid  4 million in bail on Thursday to fly out 11 employees  including six Americans  the others already being out of the country   capping weeks of diplomatic wrangling  The United States had threatened to end  1 5 billion in annual aid  most of which went to the Egyptian military  unless the case was resolved  but what resulted was  a growing backlash against the perceived American interference in the Egyptian justice system   as reported by the New York Times  David D  Kirkpatrick and Steven Lee Myers  who added   No Egyptian official stepped forward to accept responsibility for releasing the Americans  Instead  judges and prosecutors distanced themselves from the decision and traded accusations of political capitulation and conflict of interest  So you can see how difficult it is going to be to maintain any semblance of influence in Egypt  Saturday is supposed to be the day a 100 member panel is selected to draft a new constitution  and the ruling military council reiterated it wants to hold a presidential election by June  the electoral commission said the process will actually begin in May with a run off June 16 17   I remain highly skeptical this timetable will be met  First  for example  the new constitution must be approved Ironically  the very Muslim Brotherhood the United States fears played a positive role in getting the Americans released  the Brotherhood now the leading bloc in the new parliament  But don t read too much into this Afghanistan  Two more American soldiers were killed when an Afghan civilian opened fire after seizing a weapon from a guard tower at a joint NATO Afghan base in the southern part of the country  That makes six American service members killed by Afghans as a result of the violence that followed the accidental burning of Korans by American forces  two officers being shot in the back of the head right after I had posted last week s column   12 of the 60 U S  led coalition soldiers who have died thus far this year have been killed by their Afghan comrades  So with so much mistrust after ten years  is there any cause for optimism whatsoever  No You know what s never brought up in this whole debate  It goes back to the last Afghan presidential election  We re dealing with a corrupt  and treacherous  ruler in Hamid Karzai who shouldn t be president in the first place  It should have been Abdullah Abdullah  who won the vote  until it was stolen from him The problem now is that as the United States draws down its forces  American troops will be increasingly relying on Afghans to offer perimeter security  such as at combat posts and along key roads  That s a formula for further Taliban infiltration  We want to leave an Afghan army and police force capable of defending the country  but in reality  NATO and the Afghans don t totally control a single province today  When you hear otherwise  it s a bunch of lies I do have a  Hot Spots  post on the topic that offers a somewhat different opinion  Check it out  And an old story has reemerged in a potentially big way  This week  as part of a long running massive lawsuit against the Saudi government and its supposed complicity in 9 11  as filed by victims  families  former Senator Bob Graham details his suspicions in an affidavit  Graham having headed up the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time  Former Sen  Bob Kerrey  who served on the 9 11 Commission  also will be saying more on the topic  it seems  Russia  Sunday is election day and marks the return of Vladimir Putin to the presidency  He is expected to gain the 50  necessary to avoid a run off  though should he fall short it only delays the inevitable  Putin could rule until 2024  if he lasts for two  six year terms  but while the opposition wasn t able to coalesce this time around a viable candidate who could challenge Putin  opposition is nonetheless growing Speaking to campaign workers this week  Putin said   We have reason to believe that our opponents are preparing to use some kind of mechanisms that would confirm that the elections were falsified  They will stuff  ballot boxes  themselves and manipulate  the vote    he said   Then they will present  the evidence   We already see this   we already know this    Moscow Times Hilarious  And then there was the revelation this week that an assassination plot against Putin had been foiled  with the arrest of two men by Russian and Ukrainian special forces in Odessa  we were told  They were dispatched to kill Putin by Chechen rebel Doku Umarov  the leader of the separatist movement How conveeenient  many of us thought  the plot being disclosed days before the election  What I found interesting is that the  terrorists  supposedly planted explosives on one of Moscow s major thoroughfares often used by Putin s entourage to take him from his home to his office  I know the road  I just have a hard time believing they could plant explosives on it without being discovered Masha Lipman   Washington Post The main idea of Putin s campaign is that there is no alternative to his leadership and that  without him at the top  Russia will fall apart  While his own campaign rhetoric may be a bit more subtle  his loyalists commonly treat their anti Putin compatriots as enemies and traitors inspired or  worse  paid by evil  alien forces out to destroy Russia  Such aggressive rhetoric  exploitation of xenophobic fears  and the blatant abuse of government authority and resources are not new  They have been part and parcel of the Putin regime  This behavior has antagonized the new class of urban professionals and has eventually led them to protest Putin s rule  Since the government shows no interest in changing its practices  the rift between government and Russia s modernized constituencies is becoming irreparable  Putin will win Sunday s presidential election  but this growing alienation will steadily erode his power  Personally  I still don t believe he lasts the year  but not because of Chechen terrorists North Korea  The United States and North Korea reached an agreement on Pyongyang s nuclear weapons program whereby the North would voluntarily cease all atomic device detonations  long range missile tests and enrichment of uranium in return for over 240 000 metric tons of food aid  The deal would also allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to place its inspectors back into the Yongbyon nuclear complex to monitor compliance  though it is not known just how many plants North Korea has  The deal is supposed to have mechanisms in place to ensure the food doesn t go solely to the military and the elite  It s to be divvied up 20 000 tons each month There are no plans to restart six party talks  however  which were last held in December 2008  about five months before the North detonated its second nuclear test device  and many  to say the least  are highly skeptical given Pyongyang s abysmal track record of honoring past agreements  Both the Clinton and George W  Bush administrations were bamboozled by Kim Jong Il But now we have 28 year old     Kim Jong Un on the throne and who knows who is really pulling the strings  What we do know is the kid and his handlers are operating from the same playbook used by his father I do agree with the Obama administration  though  that it s worth learning more about the new regime  Give it two or three months to see how it goes  It s not like we were gaining anything the way things stood before the latest probable sham agreement For its part  Seoul was highly skeptical  while the Chinese Foreign Ministry welcomed the hoped for breakthrough  Said a South Korean foreign policy expert  Andrei Lankov   We are facing an endless soap opera  What does it mean  Pretty much nothing  the North Koreans will offer some symbolic concession to squeeze some aid and will behave themselves for a while    South China Morning Post Yemen  This hellhole has a new president  Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi  who won a rigged  single candidate election  backed by Gulf neighbors and the West  to replace Ali Saleh  who had ruled Yemen for 33 years  Hadi is to oversee a two year transition to parliamentary rule with a new constitution  His election was greeted by a car bomb in the southern part of the country that killed 21 France  National Front candidate Marine Le Pen is still trying to qualify for the April presidential election and if she does  some continue to maintain  such as moi  that she can cause more than a bit of mischief  Le Pen playing well among working class voters  Sarkozy had a bad week on the campaign trail and Hollande s lead over the president is back to 3 5 percent Britain  The leader of Britain s largest labor union is threatening mass civil disobedience timed for the London Olympics  Unite s Len McCluskey said   The attacks that are being launched on public sector workers at the moment are so deep and ideological that the idea the world should arrive in London and have these wonderful Olympic Games as though everything is nice and rosy in the garden is unthinkable  The unions  and the general community  have got every right to be out protesting    BBC News Opposition Labour leader Ed Milliband  though  wrote   Any threat to the Olympics is totally unacceptable and wrong  This is a celebration for the whole country and must not be disrupted  Hear Hear  God Save the Queen Germany  Chancellor Angela Merkel  facing re election next year  has seen her approval rating rise to a three year high  64   If President George W  Bush were still around  he d say  Good girl  and give Merkel a back rub Actually  the Chancellor deserves credit for the coolness in which she handled the dumping of four beers on her  That counts for something in my book  as much as I mourned the loss of those premium pilsners Australia  Prime Minister Julia Gillard fended off a leadership challenge from rival and former foreign minister  and prime minister   Kevin Rudd  Gillard prevailing 71 to 31  She then consolidated her power and reshuffled her cabinet But Gillard remains deeply unpopular across the country  with her latest approval rating at a putrid 26  Colombia  The rebel group  FARC  said it was abandoning its practice of kidnapping civilians for ransom  which could signal the group s willingness to enter into final peace negotiations  A sustained 10 year offensive by the Colombian military has cut FARC in half  though the group still holds at least 100 civilians hostage  FARC said it would release 10 members of the armed forces it was treating as  prisoners of war  Venezuela  There are reports President Hugo Chavez has less than one year to live  According to leaked e mails  Russian doctors treating him in Cuba say he s a miserable patient  for one  suspending treatment whenever he had to make public appearances  The Russians also feel like they are trying to clean up mistakes the Cuban team made  Chavez had more surgery this week  which we are told went well Mexico  From Rong

the jungle to the Mexican port city of Puerto Vallarta   Hooded gunmen intercepted the tourists  bus The gunmen took cameras  money  watches and other valuables before fleeing into the countryside

122011,343526,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,Mitt Romney defeated Rick Santorum in Michigan  41 38 percent  and in Arizona  47 27 Now it s on to Super Tuesday  March 6  with primaries or caucuses in Alaska  Georgia  Idaho  Massachusetts  North Dakota  Ohio  Oklahoma  Tennessee  Vermont  Virginia  and Wyoming Ohio is the big one between Romney and Santorum  while Newt Gingrich  by his own admission  is finished if he doesn t win his home state of Georgia  The last poll in Ohio before the Michigan and Arizona results had Santorum up 37 26 over Romney  but that undoubtedly has narrowed  For example a Gallup national tracking poll of registered Republicans as of Thursday had Romney ahead of Santorum  35 24  while a week earlier Santorum was ahead of Romney  34 27 Meanwhile  Barack Obama is leading both Romney and Santorum in a national Politico George Washington University Battleground Poll released Feb  27  53 43 and 53 42  respectively But according to Gallup  Obama trails Romney in Ohio  50 46  and narrowly edges Santorum  49 48  Ohio is one of the 12 battleground states for November the others being Colorado  Iowa  Florida  Michigan  Nevada  New Hampshire  New Mexico  North Carolina  Pennsylvania  Virginia and Wisconsin  420Michael Gerson   Washington Post Romney s wealth is not ill gotten  His problem is political  He talks about money as though engaged in a discussion with his stockbroker  So  374 000 from paid speeches is  not very much   He is  not concerned about the very poor   on the assumption that the safety net is enough for them  His wife  drives a couple of Cadillacs   While not a racing enthusiast himself  Romney has  some great friends that are NASCAR team owners   A single gaffe is a political flesh wound  A series of gaffes that confirm a damaging stereotype is potentially fatal  These blunders not only reinforce a traditional Republican weakness  they threaten to diminish a large Republican advantage   Barack Obama s dramatic disconnect with blue collar whites  The candidate who talked of small town Americans as clinging  to guns or religion  lost white working class voters by 18 points in 2008  In 2010  congressional Democrats lost the same group by 30 points  A similarly dismal performance by Obama in 2012 would open vast blue portions of the electoral map to Republican raids  Romney may be the only candidate capable of herding working class voters back toward the president   Voters need to know that Romney has at least witnessed the struggles he has not shared  When another wealthy politician  Robert F  Kennedy  toured Appalachia a week before his presidential announcement  Americans understood that he had met people and seen things that don t leave a man unchanged  Romney must give some evidence   visiting  say  a low income health clinic or a gang occupied school   that his hand has touched  that his retina has registered  the hurt and hardship of another America    For the fortunate among us   RFK said   there is the temptation to follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who enjoy the privilege of education  But that is not the road history has marked out for us The future does not belong to those who are content with today  apathetic toward common problems and their fellow man alike Rather it will belong to those who can blend vision  reason and courage in a personal commitment to the ideals and great enterprises of American society   If Romney can demonstrate this commitment   personally and authentically   he may yet become president of the United States  420Maureen Dowd   New York Times It s finally sinking in  Republicans are getting queasy at the gruesome sight of their party eating itself alive  savaging the brand in ways that will long resonate    Republicans being against sex is not good   the G O P  strategist Alex Castellanos told me mournfully   Sex is popular   He said his party is  coming to grips with a weaker field than we d all want  and going through the five stages of grief   We re at No  4   he said   Depression    We ve still got one to go    Acceptance   The contenders in the Hester Prynne primaries are tripping over one another trying to be the most radical  unreasonable and insane candidate they can be  They pounce on any traces of sanity in the other candidates   be it humanity toward women  compassion toward immigrants or the willingness to make the rich pay a nickel more in taxes   and try to destroy them with it   How can the warm  nurturing Catholic Church of my youth now be represented in the public arena by uncharitable nasties like Gingrich and Rick Santorum    It makes the party look like it isn t a modern party   Rudy Giuliani told CNN s Erin Burnett  fretting about the candidates  Cotton Mather attitude about women and gays   It doesn t understand the modern world that we live in   After a speech in Dallas on Thursday  Jeb Bush also recoiled   I used to be a conservative  and I watch these debates and I m wondering  I don t think I ve changed  but it s a little troubling sometimes when people are appealing to people s fears and emotion rather than trying to get them to look over the horizon for a broader perspective     Republicans have a growing panic at the thought of going down the drain with a loser  missing their chance at capturing the Senate and giving back all those House seats won in 2010  More and more  they openly yearn for a fresh candidate  including Jeb Bush  who does  after all  have experience at shoplifting presidential victories at the last minute   Romney s Richie Rich slips underscore what Ed Rollins  a Republican strategist  told the Ripon Forum   If we are only the party of Wall Street and country clubbers  we will quickly become irrelevant   Santorum  whose name aptly comes from the same Latin root as sanctimonious  went on Glenn Beck s Web based show with his family and offered this lunacy   I understand why Barack Obama wants to send every kid to college   because colleges are  indoctrination mills  that  harm  the country  He evidently wants home university schooling  which will cut down on keggers  420Kathleen Parker   Washington Post Let me be blunt  If Republicans nominate Rick Santorum to run for president  they will lose   It gives me no pleasure to rap Santorum  a man I know and respect even if I disagree with him on some issues  Not that he minds  He s a scrapper who loves a fight   and he forgives  Bottom line  Santorum is a good man  He s just a good man in the wrong century  This doesn t necessarily mean he s wrong about everything  but he s so far out of step with the majority of Americans that he can t hope to win the votes of moderates and independents so crucial to victory in November  The Republican Party s insistence on conservative purity  meanwhile  will result in the cold comfort of defeat with honor and  in the longer term  potential extinction  Increasingly  the party is growing grayer and whiter  Nine out of 10 Republicans are non Hispanic white  and more than half are highly religious  according to Gallup  This isn t news  but when this demographic is suddenly associated with renewed debate about whether women should have access to contraception   never mind abortion   suddenly they begin to look like the Republican Brotherhood   The math is clear  Sixty seven percent of women are either Democrats  41 percent  or independents  26 percent   more women than men vote  55 percent of women ages 18 22 voted in the 2008 presidential election   Republicans may sleep better if they nominate The Most Conservative Person In The World  but they won t be seeing the executive branch anytime soon  420John Podhoretz   New York Post following the Michigan primary  Santorum slaughtered Romney among those Michigan voters who said they wanted a  true conservative   by a margin of 57 17  But those voters made up only 12 percent of the electorate  Most of the commentary you read and hear about the GOP   especially from the Right itself   would lead you to think those highly ideological voters constitute a near majority  The truth is more complicated  Most Republican voters are out and out conservatives  indeed  42 percent of all Americans describe themselves as conservative    but they re not necessarily tribal conservatives who are searching for someone ideologically pure to follow  Romney was more than conservative enough  it would appear  for a near majority of Republicans in Michigan and Arizona  That said  Romney did worse than he should  and that happened not because Santorum is such a contender  but because Romney keeps shooting himself in the foot he has put in his own mouth   After his stunning victory in Florida  he said he  didn t care about the poor   After his commanding victory in last week s debate  he spoke about his wife s  couple of Cadillacs  and his friends  who own NASCAR teams    If he keeps getting in his own way  he will get to Tampa unnecessarily and pointlessly wounded  But if Romney can break the pattern  he will cruise to the nomination holding a hand far stronger than overconfident chortling Democrats   and the president himself   realize  420The Wall Street Journal s Daniel Henninger has written some outstanding columns lately on the mythology being spun by President Obama as he rewrites reality in describing today s economy  The economic and social world Barack Obama inhabits  and has always inhabited  is totally static  Your lot in life   income  status  mobility   is largely set  with little prospect of escaping upward  He spoke in  last week s  UAW speech of  sons and daughters  aspiring to assembly line jobs held by their grandparents  Even they don t believe life is that static  He promises to solve their economic problems by expropriating money from the wealthy  Boeing will be forced to make planes in Washington State   forever  Naturally this president s biggest believers live in Hollywood  Most Americans are not so credulous  But unless the GOP candidates start spending more time dismantling Obama s mythical America instead of each other  this grim fairy tale could win  420Hopes for Republicans winning the Senate were dealt a big blow when Maine Republican Sen  Olympia Snowe  a true moderate  opted not to run for re election  citing the chamber s growing  polarization   Snowe joins other Senate centrists in announcing her retirement  including Ben Nelson  D   Neb    Joseph Lieberman  I   Conn   and Jim Webb  D   Va   In the case of Nelson s seat  former Democratic Sen  Bob Kerrey reversed an earlier pledge not to run and said he would now go for his old seat  thus ticking off party stalwarts in Nebraska but giving that state s Democrats a better shot at retaining the seat by most accounts  Republicans need to pick up four to recapture the Senate Sen  Snowe wrote an op ed in the Washington Post explaining her decision  Simply put  the Senate is not living up to what the Founding Fathers envisioned  During the Federal Convention of 1787  James Madison wrote in his Notes of Debates that  the use of the Senate is to consist in its proceedings with more coolness  with more system  and with more wisdom  than the popular branch   Indeed  the Founding Fathers intended the Senate to serve as an institutional check that ensures all voices are heard and considered  because while our constitutional democracy is premised on majority rule  it is also grounded in a commitment to minority rights  Yet more than 200 years later  the greatest deliberative body in human history is not living up to its billing  The Senate of today routinely jettisons regular order  as evidenced by the body s failure to pass a budget for more than 1 000 days  serially legislates by political brinkmanship  as demonstrated by the debt ceiling debacle of August that should have been addressed the previous January  and habitually eschews full debate and an open amendment process in favor of competing  up or down  take it or leave it proposals   In a politically diverse nation  only by finding  common ground  can we achieve results for the common good  That is not happening today and  frankly  I do not see it happening in the near future  420Meanwhile  as reported by the Washington Post   In the months to come  political strategists expect to see the first family used as a political asset   As noted by The Weekly Standard  the Post then goes on to quote Democratic pollster Celinda Lake   The value of the family is enormous  The more you know this family and the more you think of Barack Obama in these terms  the harder it is to vilify him  To which The Weekly Standard s  Scrapbook  responds  Oh  really  You see  what surprises The Scrapbook is not the apparent fact that the Obamas are a nice  close knit family  or that Malia  13  and 10

122012,343527,NYT,Is Germany Actually Preparing To Leave The Euro ,opinion,For a long time  most analysts have believed that if someone was going to leave the euro  it would be a weak nation such as Greece or Portugal   But the truth is that financially troubled nations such as Greece and Portugal don t want to leave the euro   The leaders of those nations understand that if they leave the euro their economies will totally collapse and nobody will be there to bail them out   And at this point there really is not a formal mechanism which would enable other members of the eurozone to kick financially troubled nations such as Greece or Portugal out of the euro   But there is one possibility that is becoming increasingly likely that could actually cause the break up of the euro   Germany could leave the euro   Yes  it might actually happen   Germany is faced with a very difficult problem right now   It is looking at a future where it will be essentially forced to bail out most of the rest of the nations in the eurozone for many years to come  and those bailouts will be extremely expensive   Meanwhile  the mood in much of the rest of Europe is becoming decidedly anti German   In Greece  Angela Merkel and the German government are being openly portrayed as Nazis   Financially troubled nations such as Greece want German bailout money  but they are getting sick and tired of the requirements that Germany is imposing upon them in order to get that money   Increasingly  other nations in Europe are simply ignoring what Germany is asking them to do or are openly defying Germany   In the end  Germany will need to decide whether it is worth it to continue to pour billions upon billions of euros into countries that don t appreciate it and that are not doing what Germany has asked them to do  German Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democratic Union party recently  that would allow a country to leave the euro without leaving the European Union  Many thought that the resolution was aimed at countries like Greece or Portugal  but the truth is that this resolution may be setting the stage for a German exit from the euro  The following is an excerpt from that resolution     Should a member  of the euro zone  be unable or unwilling to permanently obey the rules connected to the common currency he will be able to voluntarily according to the rules of the Lisbon Treaty for leaving the European Union leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union  He would receive the same status as those member states that do not have the euro   So was that paragraph written for Greece  Or was it written for Germany  That is a very interesting question  What is clear is that the status quo cannot last much longer  Voters in Germany are definitely not in the mood to give any more bailout money to other nations in Europe  but if Germany is going to continue to stay in the eurozone many more bailouts will be required in the coming years  Meanwhile  Germany is rapidly losing control over the rest of the eurozone      Greece has implemented some of the austerity measures that have been required of it  but many others have not been implemented   In a few weeks there will be a national election  and parties that are opposed to the austerity measures are    It is likely that the new government will be much less friendly toward Germany   The Spanish government is already defying the budgetary requirements that the EU is trying to impose upon it   Spain is definitely going to miss the debt targets mandated by the EU  and the Spanish government has absolutely no plans of making more reductions to government spending   The upcoming election in France could be absolutely crucial   Nicolas Sarkozy is not doing well in the polls and the new French government could totally wreck the recent fiscal agreement that the members of the eurozone recently agreed to  The following is how Graham Summers recently summarized the current situation      We should also take Sch uble s statements in the context of Angela Merkel s recent backing of Nicolas Sarkozy s re election campaign in France against hardened socialist Fran ois Hollande  who wants to engage in a rampant socialist mission to lower France s retirement age  cut tax breaks to the wealthy  and break the recent new EU fiscal requirements Germany convinced 17 members of the EU to agree to  Obviously Germany has been trying very hard to keep the eurozone together   But the German government also believes that if it is going to be bailing everyone out that it should also be able to set the rules  So what happens if the rest of Europe tells Germany to stick their rules where the sun doesn t shine  Well  Germany would be forced to make a very difficult decision  and Germany appears to making plans for that eventuality  For example  Germany recently reinstated its Special Financial Market Stabilization Funds   This money would be used to bail out German banks in the event of a break up of the euro   The following is from a recent article      In short  Germany has given the SoFFIN   400 billion to be used as guarantees for German banks  80 billion to be used for the recapitalization of German banksLegislation that would permit German banks to dump their euro zone government bonds if needed That is correct  Any German bank  if it so chooses  will have the option to dump its EU sovereign bonds into the SoFFIN during a Crisis  In simple terms  Germany has put a  480 billion firewall around its banks  It can literally pull out of the Euro any time it wants to  If the rest of Europe continues to defy Germany  then at some point Germany may decide to simply pick up the ball and go home  Germany is the strongest economy in the eurozone by far  and if Germany were to pull out the euro would absolutely collapse   Whatever currency Germany decided to issue would be extremely valuable   Such an event would actually have some tremendous side benefits for Germany  Right now  the German national debt is denominated in euros  If Germany left the euro  the value of euros would plummet and would likely keep declining as the rest of the eurozone fell apart financially and Germany would be able to pay back its debt in rapidly appreciating  marks  or whatever other currency it decided to issue  All other debts in Germany would also be denominated in euros and would also be repaid with a much stronger currency  Are you starting to get the picture  Yes  Germany would likely have to bail out German banks if it left the euro  but leaving the euro could also prove to be a tremendous windfall for Germany  If Germany chooses to say in the euro  it is going to be faced with extremely expensive bailouts of other countries for as far as the eye can see  How expensive  The following is from a      Bernard Connolly  a persistent critic of Europe  estimates it would cost Germany  as the main surplus generating country in the euro area  about 7 percent of its annual gross domestic product over several years to transfer sufficient funds to bail out Europe s debt burdened countries  including France  That amount  he has argued  would far surpass the huge reparations bill foisted upon Germany by the victorious powers after World War I  the final payment of which Germany made in 2010  If Germany leaves the euro  that does not mean that the dream of a single currency is dead   Germany could just let the rest of the eurozone collapse and then invite them to join the new German currency eventually after all the carnage is over  At that point  Germany would have all the leverage and Germany would be able to dictate all the rules  What is clear is that the status quo in Europe is becoming extremely unacceptable in Germany   The Germans do not intend to give endless bailouts to other nations that do not appreciate them and that do not intend to follow the rules  At some point Germany may actually decide to walk  and there are lots of whispers that Germany has been steadily preparing for that day  For example  there are persistent rumors that Germany has ordered  for the printing of new German marks   Philippa Malmgren  a former economic adviser to President George W  Bush  says that she believes that this is       I think they have already got the printing machines going and are bringing out the old deutschmarks they have left over from when the euro was introduced   Increasingly  it really is looking as if Germany is actually preparing to leave the euro  If Germany did leave the euro  the consequences for the rest of Europe would be catastrophic  The euro would rapidly drop to all time lows  The global financial system would be thrown in chaos  Countries such as Greece would lose their major source of bailout money and would be forced to default  The recession in Europe would likely deepen into a devastating economic depression  So there would be a lot of downside  But Germany would fare much better than most of the rest of Europe  and in the end Germany would be left holding most of the cards  Keep a close eye on the upcoming European elections and the evolving political situation in Europe  If things don t go well for Germany  at some point Germany may just get fed up and walk away from the euro  Stranger things have happened ,2012-03-12,Michael T.

122013,343528,NYT,Jobs Recovery  A Different Light,opinion,In  the Associated Press details what I would consider to be the positive spin on a variety of economic and political developments  highlighted in red italic for clarity   In the interest of fairness and balance  I thought it only right to annotate each of their bullet points with statistics  reports  and arguments that show things in a different light     COMPANIES CAN T SQUEEZE MORE OUTPUT FROM WORKERS During and right after the Great Recession  companies shrank their work forces because demand plunged and fewer workers were needed  Once demand started growing again  companies were reluctant to hire immediately  They managed to produce more with the employees they had  But now many companies are finding they can t continue to do more with less  As demand grows  they re finding they have to hire  As I noted in   history suggests that s not quite correct  As the following chart shows  a relatively sharp deceleration in the rate of productivity growth    like we ve seen recently    has  except on two occasions over the past five decades  preceded or been associated with a slowdown in the pace of hiring CONSUMERS ARE STURDIERSince the recession  households have cut their debts and rebuilt savings  One key measure of household debt burdens   debt payments as a percentage of after tax income   is at its lowest point since 1994  according to the Federal Reserve  Consumer finances are fundamentally healthier than they were   says Stuart Hoffman  chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group As the labor market has healed  Americans have worried less about losing their jobs  As a result  they re less likely to curtail spending   even in the face of shocks such as a 29 cent jump in gasoline prices in the past month to an average  3 78 a gallon But are they really better off than they were  As the following chart shows  per capita consumer debt outstanding    that is  the amount per person    is only 3 4 percent below its 2008 peak  and nearly 50 percent above where it was at the start of the last decade TENSIONS EASE IN WASHINGTONThe debt limit showdown waged last summer between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans rattled confidence in America s leadership  It looked as if the United States might default on its debts for the first time in history because leaders couldn t reach a deal Since then  thanks in part to election year pressures  tensions have eased  Republicans dropped threats to let the payroll tax expire  And in an unusual show of cooperation  House lawmakers from both parties backed a bill last week to make it easier for small businesses to obtain financing they need to hire and expand All I can say is  Just wait until the summer rolls around  the Republicans have chosen their candidate  and each side begins doing its best to inflict maximum political damage on the other side  At that point  the economic uncertainty and concerns about the future that have already impacted corporate decision making will have an even more corrosive effect on overall activity  Anybody who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves   HOUSING IS INCHING BACKThe collapse of real estate lies at the heart of America s economic problems  House prices have plunged 30 percent since 2006  The drop has wiped out  7 trillion in homeowners  equity  Millions of construction workers have lost jobs Now  there are tentative signs of recovery  Apartment construction is growing  Construction jobs are slowly returning  Home builders are seeing more foot traffic and gaining confidence that sales will pick up in the spring buying season No one expects another boom  But real estate is no longer subtracting from U S  employment  And there s hope among economists that higher sales could stop prices from falling further by spring Once home prices stabilize  more people will likely decide it s time to buy  And consumers who worry less about a loss of home equity   the main source of wealth for most people   are more likely to keep spending Some experts take issue with the notion that a bottom is at hand  as Zero Hedge reports in  No Housing Recovery   Case Shiller Shows 8th Consecutive Month Of House Price Declines  Little that can be added here  The December Case Shiller came  saw  and shut up all those who keep calling for a home price recovery  The Index printed at 136 71 on expectations of 137 11  with the prior revised to 138 24  The top 20 City composite was down  0 5  on expectations of a 0 35  drop  18 out of 20 MSAs saw monthly declines in December over November  with just the worst of the worst   Miami and Phoenix   posting a dead cat bounce  rising 0 2  and 0 8  respectively  And granted the data is delayed  but the fact that we have now had 8 consecutive months of home price declines even with mortgage rates persistently at record lows  and the double dip in housing more than obvious  can we finally shut up about a housing bottom  Because as Case Shiller s David Blitzer says   If anything it looks like we might have reentered a period of decline as we begin 2012   QEDFrom the report  In terms of prices  the housing market ended 2011 on a very disappointing note   says David M  Blitzer  Chairman of the Index Committee at S P Indices   With this month s report we saw all three composite hit new record lows  While we thought we saw some signs of stabilization in the middle of 2011  it appears that neither the economy nor consumer confidence was strong enough to move the market in a positive direction as the year ended  After a prior three years of accelerated decline  the past two years has been a story of a housing market that is bottoming out but has not yet stabilized  Up until today s report we had believed the crisis lows for the composites were behind us  with the 10 City Composite originally hitting a low in April 2009 and the 20 City Composite in March 2011  Now it looks like neither was the case  as both hit new record lows in December 2011  The National Composite fell by 3 8  in the fourth quarter alone  and is down 33 8  from its 2nd quarter 2006 peak  It also recorded a new record low  In general  most of the regions also posted weak data in December  Eighteen of the cities saw average home prices fall in December over November  Seventeen of the cities have seen monthly declines for at least three consecutive months  In addition to both monthly composites  10 of the cities saw home prices fall by more than 1 0  during the month of December  The pick up in the economy has simply not been strong enough to keep home prices stabilized  If anything it looks like we might have reentered a period of decline as we begin 2012  STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT CUTS SLOWINGThe Great Recession and the housing collapse dried up tax revenue for state and local governments  Many were forced to lay off teachers and other public workers  Since December 2008  state and local governments have slashed 613 000 jobs  offsetting some of the hiring by private companies But the cuts appear to be easing  State governments have added 10 000 jobs so far this year  Local governments last month added 2 000   a modest total but only the third increase in two years  There s only so many teachers you can cut  so many police officers  so many firemen   says Mark Vitner  senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics Who says things can t get any worse  In  Meredith Whitney Was Right  Fortune s Term Sheet blog suggests problems in that area of the economy may actually be approaching a crisis point FORTUNE    To readers of the business press  the story is a familiar one  fifteen months ago  superstar analyst Meredith Whitney rocked the world of municipal finance with a December 2010 prediction on 60 Minutes that a wave of municipal debt defaults was headed our way  Her forecast was quite specific   You could see fifty to a hundred sizable defaults   she told her interviewer  correspondent Steve Kroft   This will amount to hundreds of billions of dollars  worth of defaults   The bottom fell out of the muni bond market as a result  Investors pulled some  14 billion from muni bond funds between December 22 and February 2  2011  and returns in the fourth quarter of 2010 were the lowest in 16 years  Long time players in the space  including analysts  fund managers  and muni brokers  reacted with indignation that an arriviste such as Whitney the woman who made her name calling out Citigroup  C  as an emperor with no clothes at the dawn of the mortgage crisis dared to try to expand her analytical purview into their cozy little corner of the capital markets  She was wrong  they said  She didn t know squat about how their market worked  The kind of defaults she called for were never going to happen  And they were right  in the most literal sense  Since then  there have only been  2 6 billion in defaults from the  3 7 trillion market  And the muni bond swoon didn t even last very long  in 2011  Barclay s muni bond index returned 10 7   more than five times the 2 1  return of the S P500  Nothing satisfies like a comedown of a prominent prognosticator  and Whitney has taken her lumps in both the business press and the more unbridled blogosphere ever since  She deserves at least some of it  but that s only for being overly specific  The more general point that she was trying to make that municipal finances in this country were a mess that was only going to get messier was dead on  Laugh at her all you want  but then try this  go find one person who says their local taxes are falling or their municipal services have improved in the past year or two  I wish you luck in your endeavor   States have pushed more and more expenses down to the local level   Whitney tells Fortune   And municipalities don t have the money to make up the difference  That is where you see the real strain  especially after the American Reinvestment Recovery Act expired in June 2011  Consider the email I received on March 7 from former New York State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky about Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano s recently formed Commission of Inquiry into what he refers to as that city s  Great Unraveling    Brodksy is serving on the commission    Yonkers has  a budget of about  1 billion and a budget gap in the upcoming year that looks like it can t be bridged  There are reasons aplenty  Like may urban centers the Yonkers manufacturing base disappeared  the middle class moved out and the people simply can t afford the property and sales tax burden that ensured  Anti tax fervor hit and elected officials refused to raise recurring revenues  Gimmicks  one shots  borrowing for operating expenses  assets sales  and assorted maneuvers  kicked the can down the road  for a couple of years The city has now run out of gimmicks  And then he sounds very Whitney like   It s as though we stand on the shore and watch a tsunami gather and shrug and hope we ll get through it That needs to change  and if the list of endangered cities gets larger this will force itself onto the national stage   For now  the great national battle about the size of government and the level of taxation will be played out in the streets of small cities across America  with school kids  garbage pick up  fire protection  and safe streets competing with each other for inadequate resources  It s an ugly way to solve a problem  And then there are reports like this  Deficits Push N Y  Cities and Counties to Desperation   New York Times ALBANY   It was not a good week for New York s cities and counties On Monday  Rockland County sent a delegation to Albany to ask for the authority to close its widening budget deficit by issuing bonds backed by a sales tax increase On Tuesday  Suffolk County  one of the largest counties outside New York City  projected a  530 million deficit over a three year period and declared a financial emergency  Its Long Island neighbor  Nassau County  is already so troubled that a state oversight board seized control of its finances last year And the city of Yonkers said its finances were in such dire straits that it had drafted Richard Ravitch  the former lieutenant governor  to help chart a way out Even as there are glimmers of a national economic recovery  cities and counties increasingly find themselves in the middle of a financial crisis  The problems are spreading as municipalities face a toxic mix of stresses that has been brewing for years  including soaring pension  Medicaid and retiree health care costs  And many have exhausted creative accounting maneuvers and one time spending cuts or revenue raisers to bail themselves out EUROPE S THREAT HAS SUBSIDEDInvestors panicked last year over the prospect that Greece and some other European countries would default on their debts  stick banks with huge losses and trigger a global credit crunch  Such fears sent stocks tumbling and helped diminish U S  consumer confidence in the second half of 2012 But confidence is rebounding  Greece has received a  172 billion bailout  pushing back the threat of a destructive default  And the European Central Bank has made more than  1 3 trillion in low rate three year loans to banks since December  making clear it won t let the European banking system fail Anybody who s been paying attention would know that the problem goes beyond Greece  Other countries in the region are similarly exposed  as Forbes notes in  After Greek Default  Spain And Portugal Pose Major Risk  With the Greek problem off the table for the very near term  markets will turn their eyes mainly to Portugal and Spain as the European sovereign debt crisis continues   Portuguese sovereign bonds  PGBs  are still trading at distressed levels  with the spread over German bunds at more than 1 200 basis points Europe s sovereign debt crisis is far from over   While Greece s managed default marks a break in the road  and markets appear calm in its aftermath  the remaining PIIGS are still under pressure   Schauble noted a third bailout for Greece can t be ruled off  while Barclays suggests PSI remains a possibility in Portugal   For now  though  the major risk of a disorderly default in Greece has passed   This could be the calm before the storm  though What s more  it s not just sovereign states in the region that are at risk  According to the New York Times  the banking system also remains on shaky ground  FRANKFURT   While the European Central Bank s emergency loan program late last year helped avoid a banking crisis  there is doubt over whether the action will promote economic growth by encouraging lending to businesses and consumers  according to a new report by the Bank for International Settlements  European banks remain highly leveraged and will not be able to substantially step up lending until they have further reduced risk  said Stephen Cecchetti  head of the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements  which acts as a clearinghouse for the world s central banks and released its quarterly report late Sunday  Emergency loans provided by the European Central Bank will help stabilize banks  but it will take a while for the money to reach bank customers   Do not expect banks to respond by increasing their lending   Mr  Cecchetti said during a conference call with reporters on Friday U S  BANKS LENDING MORE TO BUSINESSESAfter the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers shook the financial system  U S  banks cut loans to businesses in 2009 and 2010  The credit crunch fed the economy s misery by starving many companies of financing needed to grow and hire But banks are healthier now  So are the prospects for their business customers  Bank lending to businesses rose nearly 14 percent last year to  1 35 trillion  according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp  Loans to small businesses grew at the end of last year for the first time since the FDIC started tracking them nearly two years ago William Dunkelberg  chief economist of the National Federal of Independent Business  says the outlook for hiring by small businesses offers  a better picture than we have seen for years  Perhaps that s true  but it appears to be at odds with reports like these  Entrepreneurs Scramble as Banks Call in Loans   News   Observer Bud Matthews has been battling for months to avoid foreclosure on his small company s offices in Chatham County  a scenario that he says would put him out of business  He faces this predicament even though he s been diligently making the monthly payments on his loan Matthews rails that his lender  SunTrust Banks  hasn t been willing to renew his five year commercial real estate loan  which ran out in June  In the absence of a new loan  he owes SunTrust a balloon payment of more than  200 000   money he doesn t have  You just don t shoot the people that have been good to you   Matthews said  referring to his years of doing business with the Atlanta based bank   It just isn t right to take someone s business who has made all the payments and has played by all the rules    Bloomberg  Turns out customizing video game controllers for gaming addicts who want to shoot faster can be a decent business  Tim Erven says his five year old venture  Custom Gaming in Whippany  New Jersey  has been profitable since he started it  with revenue around  300 000 in 2011  and some 250 orders a week now  mostly through its Amazon storefront To keep up with demand  the 22 year old has been trying to get banks to lend him as little as  10 000 to improve his website and rent a warehouse near his home  The six banks he s approached have rejected his applications because of his age and because he hadn t gotten a business loan before  even though his tax returns show profits and his parents were willing to put up their home as collateral   From what the banks told me  asking for 10 percent of my annual revenue was reasonable  and what tends to be conventional  but even by decreasing the amount I was seeking I was still unable to obtain approval   says Erven  who juggles balances on six credit cards to manage cash flow Erven s situation isn t unusual for small business owners navigating post crisis banking  A recent National Federation of Independent Business study shows that even while demand for credit is on an upward trajectory  the number of small employers able to land a bank loan has not moved in parallel  Bank credit for small firms  defined as businesses with annual sales of less than  50 million  has been ticking up  slightly  since the third quarter of last year  according to the Federal Reserve s quarterly surveys of senior loan officers and other government data   But it should be much stronger at this point in the economic recovery   says Paul Merski  chief economist at the Independent Community Bankers of America in Washington One reason  not surprisingly  is that many U S  based lenders aren t on a particularly solid footing  as Bloomberg reveals in   Right now  taxpayers are in the black on the program that bailed out banks  But weaker banks that haven t repaid their loans may still leave us in the red  That s the problem the Government Accountability Office points to in a new report looking at the government s single largest bailout effort  the Capital Purchase Program  Treasury started CPP in October 2008 to provide liquidity and stability for banks  Ultimately Treasury propped up more than 700 banks with almost  205 billion  The banks make dividend and interest payments to Treasury  then  to exit the program  they repurchase warrants and preferred shares and repay loans  The GAO says those revenue sources have brought in  211 5 billion for taxpayers a  6 6 billion profit above the initial infusion into the institutions But the picture s not all rosy  First  the GAO says that almost half of the banks that have exited CPP did so by refinancing their debt into other Treasury run programs  in particular the Small Business Lending Facility and the Community Development Capital Initiative  Second  the GAO highlights 366 banks that haven t repaid CPP and still owe a combined  16 7 billion  Those banks  the GAO says  are less healthy than the banks that have already repaid CPP and other similar size

122014,343529,NYT,Greg Smith vs  Goldman Sachs,opinion,When I read Greg Smith s op ed in the New York Times my very strong impression was   Nothing new here  so what  not worth reading   That s certainly true as far as I was concerned  but when a friend not in finance told me the contents of the editorial was a surprise  I thought I had better weigh in   I even feel somewhat duty bound to do so  because I spent many years on the  sell side   that is  at firms like Goldman Sachs In fact I started my career at Salomon Brothers  the setting of Michael Lewis   Liar s Poker    Lewis was three years ahead of me  and spoke to my training class  as mentioned in his book  around the time of the great crash of  87   Anyone who thought Smith s litany of complaints about Goldman Sachs were new or surprising has either not read Lewis  book  or has forgotten the contents  which is fair enough  since the book was published more than twenty years ago For those of us who were working at Salomon Brothers when Liar s Poker was published in 1989  the contents of the book came as no surprise   In fact  we all thought he nailed it   Salomon in the day was a rough and tumble place where foul language  sports analogies  and ruthless internal competition ruled every day   This was not a place for brainy professors to come to share their knowledge and help client CFOs benefit society  This was a place to out sell the guy sitting next to you so you would get a bigger piece of the bonus pool at the end of the each year  How you did that was your problem   The idea at Salomon then and at Goldman now is that you as a salesman have to make as many sales as you possibly can  That means you have to get your customer to like you so that he will want to trade with you   But for most of the products that Salomon sold  and Goldman Sachs sells   the products were OTC  over the counter  There is no commission per se  there is just the bid and offer price   So it s not only a volume game  it s also a price mark up game   If you think your customer will pay 101 rather than 100 for bonds  you can offer them at 101 and see if he bites This is all in Michael Lewis  book   Here s an excerpt from page 35 In any market  as in any poker game  there is a fool   The astute investor Warren Buffett is fond of saying that any player unaware of the fool in the market probably is the fool in the market   Salomon bond traders knew about the fools because that was their job   Knowing about markets is knowing about other people s weaknesses   And a fool  they would say  was a person who was willing to sell a bond for less or buy a bond for more than it was worth Or let s hear from Larry Fink  now the head of Blackrock  as quoted in Liar s Poker  talking about the savings and loan customers who traded with the big investment banks like Salomon October 1981 was the most irresponsible period in the history of the capital markets   The thrifts that did the best did nothing   The ones that did the big trades got raped So now  23 years later  for Greg Smith to raise eyebrows by  exposing  some of the less palatable aspects of Goldman s business practices seems a bit much   For one thing  Liar s Poker was a  1 bestseller   Everyone has read it   For another  anyone who pays the least bit of attention to the news knows that Goldman got into some very hot water three years ago for helping a hedge fund manager  short  subprime mortgage securities to a Goldman client   But if you re truly worried about Goldman now  you certainly should have been concerned in 2000  when Roger Lowenstein published his book on the collapse of mega hedge fund Long Term Capital Management  LTCM    When Genius Failed  In that book  Lowenstein describes the scene when employees of Goldman Sachs were at LTCM s office in Greenwich  Connecticut  as LTCM tried to avert collapse from a concentration of too many trading positions all going bad at once   Goldman was there to do  due diligence   that is  to conduct an inspection of LTCM s books so that they could represent LTCM s condition to investors to help LTCM secure financing   It s like a large scale credit check   As Lowenstein portrays it A key member of the Goldman team was Jacob Goldfield  a lanky and brilliant but abrasive trader   According to witnesses  the headstrong Goldfield appeared to be downloading Long Term s positions  which the fund had so zealously guarded  from Long Term s own computers directly into an oversized laptop  a detail that Goldman later denied    Meanwhile  Goldman s traders in New York sold some of the very same positions   At the end of one day  when the fund s positions were worth a good deal less  some Goldman traders at Long Term s offices sauntered up to the trading desk and offered to buy them  Brazenly playing both sides of the street  Goldman represented mercenary banking at its ugliest  To JM  head of LTCM  and his partners  Goldman was raping Long Term in front of their very eyes In other words  Goldman was exploiting its priviledged position of trust and confidentiality to identify exactly what LTCM would need to dump in a massive fire sale  and beat them to the punch  profiting from the deluge of liquidation that surely would follow  Lowenstein s book is in its sixth printing as of 2008  and was a Business Week  Best Book of the Year  in the year it was published   This is not  new news  It s not that Goldman s comportment is unusually bad   Nor  obviously  is it particularly good   But scolding Goldman because some salespeople referred to clients as  muppets   to paraphrase Martin Sheen in  Apocalypse Now   is like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500  It s the nature of the beast  As a fresh college graduate years before working for Salomon Brothers  I spent a year treading water in the town of my university before embarking on a short stint as a teacher  Job pickings were slim  so I decided to try my hand at being a waiter at the best restaurant in town  It was no lay up   To be merely considered for a waiter slot  I first had to be a busboy  To be a busboy  I had to work for free  for some undetermined period of time  in a sort of busboy audition  After one day I threw in the towel I didn t make any money  but I got a good glimpse behind the scenes   In the confines of the tables  all was well  and elegant   In the kitchen  it was a swearfest   Where is the f cking side of potatoes   and  That SOB at Table 14 is gonna be wearing his soup  is all you could hear  all night long  on the other side of the metal doors leading to the kitchen Greg Smith was a waiter at the restaurant that is Goldman Sachs  He was a salesman  and worse than that  he peddled equity derivatives  To say the least  equity derivatives are not the flavor of the month   Volumes have dried up  and the money that banks are making is coming from fixed income  not equities   Smith was a Vice President among thousands of vice presidents at Goldman Sachs   The interesting question is not who is right in the  he said  she said  duel between Smith and Goldman Sachs  but rather  why did the New York Times give Smith prime time status If you re in the market for a home  you seek out the services of a real estate agent  You develop a relationship with that person  You talk about your kids  you talk about where you went for vacation   Do you expect that the realtor  knowing all too well the seller is paying the realtor s fee  is going to work tirelessly to reduce the sale price for you   Do you think the realtor is going to tell you  hang tight  I think they will come down by 5 percent   Of course you don t Greg Smith seems to have mistaken his employer for the Red Cross  even though he managed to sell quite a few Goldman products over the years  His efforts will be seen for what they are  Sour grapes  and small  petty ones at that   It s a shame  because the world of finance is sorely in need of a higher ethical standard   But for now it s business as usual  and anyone who thinks otherwise is a muppet  not an muppeteer ,2012-03-18,Macro and

122015,343530,NYT,Goldman s God Problem on Executive Pay,opinion,In addition to suffering a  in market value on March 12 bestowed upon by the   Goldman also has to deal with God problem regarding executive compensation packages as well According to   in the past two years  a group of religious institutions that hold Goldman shares  including the Sisters of St  Francis of Philadelphia  has been successful in getting its proposal requiring Goldman to conduct an independent examination of whether Goldman s executive pay levels were appropriate taken into regular shareholders  meetings   However  this year  for the first time  the U S  SEC  Securities and Exchange Commission  sided with Goldman  which argued it had already complied with the request  The SEC s letter of rejection came out just one day after Gregg Smith s Goldman Letter appeared on the Times From   The SEC sided with Goldman this year because it felt the company had  substantially implemented  the proposal  an SEC spokesman said   If the company s actions effectively moot the proposal  then we permit exclusion   In its January 11 letter to the SEC  Goldman described a number of processes that the firm has in place that it says address the religious group s concerns For example  the company has an independent committee that reviews executive compensation packages  and it discloses the compensation principles in proxy reports to shareholders  according to the letter While it is true that many Wall Street big banks  including Goldman  had to endure pay cuts after the financial crisis partly in response to backlashes stemming form lavish paydays on its executives   Nonetheless  since the paycut has lofty starting point to begin with  the current average pay is still much higher above the national norm For example  The average Goldman employee took home roughly    Although that s already down 15  from  430 000 in 2010  it is still 539  of  67 690    as of May 2010  the most recent data from Bureau of Labor Statistics   That s hard to justify even after taking into account of the variables such as an Ivy League degree  Quant wizard  etc   In terms of executive compensation  Lloyd C  Blankfein  the chief executive of Goldman    19 million in 2010   roughly  5 4 million in cash  restricted stock valued at  12 6 million and other compensation   Before the near collapse of Wall Street in 2008  Blankfein made  68 5 million in 2007 This year  Blankfein was granted  7 million in restricted stock  according to a regulatory filing last month  other forms of compensation like cash bonus have not been disclosed yet   The same  7 million award is also extended to Gary D  Cohn  the president  and David A  Viniar  the chief financial officer  The value is based on the company s stock price as of Feb  1   Gregg Smith  who was merely one of 12 000 company vice presidents  a low ranking employee  according to Goldman  was supposedly earning  no more than  750 000   While it is refreshing to see SEC taking a contrarian view after   it looks like the government s regulatory sensors may have been blunted partly by  in 2010 on fraud charges related to Subprime Mortgage CDO  and possibly by  between Goldman alumni and the U S  Government  Nevertheless  as Reuters quoted Charles Elson  director of the Weinberg Center for corporate governance at the University of Delaware  It s a  Goldman s  victory in a sense that it s kept off the proxy this year  but it doesn t make the issue go away   Wall Street pay has garnered a lot of attention since the financial crisis  and the pressure for more transparency and review is unlikely to relent  SEC s opinion notwithstanding ,2012-03-19,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goldman's-god-problem-on-executive-pay-117363,117363
122016,343531,NYT,Week in Review Part I  Europe  Washington and Wall Street,opinion,Europe  Washington and Wall Street and ChinaGreece officially gets its second  130 billion euro bailout  174 billion when combined with part of the first bailout package that remains  as the International Monetary Fund approved 18 billion of the 130bn  or 28bn of the 174bn  I m telling you this is kind of confusing  but let s stick with the second package of 130 billion This means 18 billion coughed up by the IMF  112 billion by the European Union  Now recall you first had the European Financial Stability Facility  EFSF  as the original firewall for Greece  Ireland and Portugal  and then the European Stability Mechanism  ESM  consists of 500 billion euro ostensibly to backstop Italy and Spain Portugal  at an estimated 100 billion  and Ireland  80 billion  are funded out of the 250 billion remaining in the EFSF  along with the 112 billion for Greece  Yes  it doesn t exactly add up but it s hoped Portugal and Ireland won t have to use all of theirs Or they might need more Greece as well And even though we ve seen the credit market situation improve markedly for Italy and Spain  they can still have all manner of issues if their economies don t improve  and soon  and in that case you all know by now  500 billion euro isn t enough for these two Which is why the IMF is adamant Germany  in particular  back a further increase in the ESM  or at least combine the EFSF with the ESM  but Germany doesn t want to because it believes the five nations just mentioned wouldn t then have the incentive to implement their austerity programs As for the IMF  one of its directors  Paulo Nogueira Batista  who represents Brazil and eight of the governments  abstained   the traditional way of showing dissent at the board  saying   I remain deeply uneasy about the Greece program  For the past two years  Europe has taken a Panglossian view of Greece s likely growth while the economy has continued to contract  Batista told the Financial Times that the restructuring of Greek sovereign bonds held by private sector creditors was  too little  too late  They have gained some breathing space but I don t think that the medium term prospects for the country have fundamentally been altered for the better  With Greece getting the bailout package  though  it now has to accept four European Commission officials permanently stationed in Athens  along with representatives of the IMF and European Central Bank  who will be constantly looking over the shoulders of Greece s monetary officials Meanwhile  in Spain  with an unemployment rate of 22 8   50  for young people  house prices fell 11 2  last year  with prices in Madrid down 15 7  in the fourth quarter  year over year Eurozone finance ministers  still reeling from Spain s announcement that its deficit would be 5 8  rather than the previously agreed upon 4 4   cut Spain some slack to 5 3  as a target for 2012  but this requires even more draconian cuts  Ollie Rehn  the EU s most senior economic official  said the EU couldn t do more given the fact Spain s deficit for 2011 came in at 8 5   2 5 percentage points higher than it was supposed to Now do you see why an increased firewall for the ESM is necessary  Oh  sure  Spain and Italy have 10 year bond yields that have come down to roughly 5  for each vs  7 50  for Italy at its recent peak and 6 67  for Spain  That is good  But to beat a dead horse  or slaughter a bull in the case of Spain  they need growth  Both are in recession Mohamed El Erian   Financial Times Many investors wish to wave a final goodbye to the disruption the Greek debt crisis has had on market valuations  Meanwhile  European policymakers are already trying to move away from the dramas on the periphery and focus on restoring growth in Europe  Both impulses are understandable  Unfortunately  they are premature   What last week s debt reduction deal really delivers is a bit more time for others to reposition for the next  more disruptive  act in this unfolding Greek drama  For European policymakers  this means even more urgent building of firewalls to protect countries such as Italy and Spain  continuing to strengthen the core through better fiscal and political integration  and forcing banks to raise capital  For investors  it is about reducing their exposure not only to another default by Greece  but also the risk of the country s exit from the euro  If this were to happen  the latest agreement would end up being characterized in history books as more than just a costly failure  And on the ECB s recent longer term refinancing operations  LTROs  that stabilized the debt markets in the eurozone by injecting massive amounts of liquidity into the banking system  economist Paul De Grauwe  in an op ed for the Financial Times   It  can now be said  the LTROs  were ill designed  making it probable that the ECB will have to discontinue them    The  ECB chose not to intervene at the source of the problem   the sovereign bond markets  It delegated the power to buy government bonds to the banks  trusting they would obey  But the banks themselves were and still are in a state of fear  The decision to delegate to panicky bankers has had three unfortunate consequences that will become clear now the central bank has completed its second liquidity injection  First  because banks channeled only a fraction of the liquidity they obtained from the ECB into the government bond markets  the ECB had to pour much more liquidity into the system than if it had decided to intervene itself  Second  new waves of panic may grip the banks again  leading them to sell off government bonds  The risk that this may happen undermines the credibility of the whole operation  and can quickly lead to a new crisis in the bond markets  Will the ECB then again increase its lending to these banks in the hope that frightened bankers will resume their bond purchases  Third  and most importantly  the liquidity injections in the banking system create moral hazard problems that are more dangerous than those resulting from direct intervention in the sovereign bond markets  Banks have been given unlimited sources of funding to make easy profits  This reduces their incentives to restructure their balance sheets  which would make them more resilient in the future   The LTRO program has relieved the pressure in the sovereign debt markets of the eurozone  But this is only temporary  The peripheral eurozone countries are now pushed into a deep recession that will exacerbate their fiscal problems and will create renewed distrust in financial markets  As a result the sovereign debt crisis will explode again  forcing the ECB to make hard choices  Either it will stick to its indirect LTRO approach  giving cheap money to trembling banks with all the problems this entails  Or the ECB will become pragmatic and intervene directly with a steady hand in the government bond markets  Of course as Paul De Grauwe concludes  on this last point Germany will never accept direct interventions Bottom line  sports fans it ain t over  til it s over One last item  Appearing before a rally of some 100 000 in Budapest  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban blasted the European Union for suspending funding for Hungary over its high budget deficit  with Orban saying  We will not be a colony  As a European nation  we demand equal treatment  We will not be second class European citizens  That s why they call it ghoulash Washington and Wall StreetThe Federal Reserve s Open Market Committee met to discuss the latest on interest rates and the economy and emerged with no change on the former  as expected  but a bit more enthusiasm for the pace of growth  even as it reiterated it would keep rates at zero into 2014 due to the fact housing remains depressed  Europe is still a concern  and high oil prices normally aren t a good thing  The Fed also released the results of its latest stress tests  15 of the 19 largest financial institutions passed  with the four failures being MetLife  SunTrust Bank  Ally Financial  and Citigroup  Citi was ticked  saying it would have passed were it not for its request to increase its dividend  The Federal Reserve advised Citi that it has no objection to our continuing the existing dividend levels on our preferred stock and our common stock  and we plan to do so   the bank said in a statement The stress tests assumed an equity market plunge of 50   further home price declines of 21  and unemployment levels of 13   up from the current 8 3   It also threw into the equation an asteroid striking Earth and unemployed dinosaurs from the recently canceled Fox program   Terra Nova   wreaking havoc But no doubt  the Fed deserves a lot of credit for stabilizing the banking system at the height of the financial crisis  not that it didn t hit up taxpayers at the same time  and America s banks are in far better shape than Europe s  and it s not even close  So Chairman Ben Bernanke gets a gold star for his notebook  But he gets two black marks for holding rates at zero way longer than appropriate and thus killing savers  and all pension funds for that matter And  in case you missed it this week  the Federal budget deficit for February came in at a cool  230 billion  One month   231 7 billion  to be exact  Nice job  Mr  President  Or as Church Lady would say   Now isn t that spe cial  The Wall Street Journal editorialized  If only someone would now test where the next  stress  is most likely to occur   in the government   The Treasury is still rolling out  1 3 trillion deficits  three years into a recovery  and the Federal Reserve is still holding interest rates at near zero and has tripled its own balance sheet  Neither institution   much less the White House or Congress   seems to have an exit strategy worth the name  The White House says a big tax increase next year will solve any fiscal woes  and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke says  well  trust him  Earlier this week we described the Treasury s financial pickle if interest rates rise even 200 300 basis points  What we don t know  but would like to  is what would happen to the Fed s balance sheet if interest rates rose rapidly  say  to their historic modern norm of about 5   What really needs a stress test is the government  Meanwhile  a funny thing happened to President Obama s approval ratings  They have distinctly plateaued  and  in the case of one poll in particular  plummeted  Surveys from Reuters Ipsos and Pew Research Center show the president with a 50  rating  which is where all of them have settled the last six weeks or so  owing to the improving economy and falling unemployment rate  but then the Washington Post ABC News poll had him at 46   57  disapproval among key independents   and the shocker of them all  a 41  approval rating from the New York Times CBS News survey  which just one month earlier had Obama at 50  What happened  I suspect it s an aberration  but there is no doubt that high prices for gasoline at the pump are hurting Obama Here s the deal  When the history of this year is written  in terms of the economy  weather will have played a huge role  at least for January thru March  and judging from the long range forecast for the second quarter  April thru June as well You cannot discount the impact of great weather on retail sales  auto sales  and construction activity At the same time  while gasoline prices have soared to a national average of  3 82 as I write  1 3rd of drivers in America are paying over  4 00 Yes  I know  Americans have saved huge sums on heating costs  especially assuming you have natural gas   and cars are far more fuel efficient  so you aren t filling up as much if you have a relatively new vehicle  but  4 00 irks you  And if we have to use our A C a lot sooner than normal  and begin to burn up these humongous natural gas inventories and get back to pricing normality  the hit to the wallet from  4 00 gas will be substantial And to those who think we are going to catch a break on gasoline  NFW  no functional way   until the Iranian situation resolves itself So the president is going to get the blame on this one  whether he deserves it or not  and that s all part of the approval rating Lastly  the GDP figure for the first quarter is going to be in the 2  range  if consensus is correct  though Morgan Stanley lowered it to 1  this week  and that s a come down from Q4 s 3   so that trend isn t going to help the president  it would seem But I said in predicting what would happen this year that foreign policy would overwhelm the White House and I believe that more than ever  Suffice it to say  those who think the president has done a good job on this front are mentally challenged  Let me help you  History will show him to be a disaster And a word on China  I discuss the political machinations of the nation down below  On the economy  in his last major appearance as premier before the National People s Congress and the press conference after  Wen Jiabao said there would be no short term easing of measures on the property sector  this as foreign direct investment fell in February for a fourth consecutive month  A ministry spokesman said the outlook was  grim   owing to  slack  external demand JPMorgan Chase economist Adrian Mowat  who is said to have a good track record  though I haven t followed the lad  proclaimed that China s economy is in the midst of a  hard landing   If you look at the Chinese data  Ed  I reported on a slew of it last week  if you want to check the archives to refresh your memory   you should stop debating about a hard landing  China is in a hard landing  Car sales are down  cement production is down  steel production is down  construction stocks are down  It s not a debate anymore  it s a fact  Well  my main man  economist Stephen Roach  said the week before that talk of China having a hard landing is nothing but a bunch of  exaggerations   The banking system will not collapse  nor will there be a true property bubble burst Mowat doesn t see a pickup in property demand sopping up the inventory But lower growth  assuming there s no hard landing  keeps inflation under control and in terms of keeping the masses quiet  this is what s most important Jim O Neill   Goldman Sachs in an op ed for the Financial Times  Much of China s slowing is neither unexpected nor undesired  Premier Wen s forecast was not news to those who follow developments in the country closely  In the 12th five year plan released about a year ago  the leadership had already said that it expected real GDP growth of 7 5 percent  It was seen at the time as confirmation that Beijing was no longer pursuing as fast a rate of GDP growth as possible  While actual GDP growth has consistently exceeded expected growth for many years  this didn t stop Beijing from lowering their stated and assumed target   But let s get things in perspective  A real growth rate of 7 5   if it occurs  along with 4  inflation will still see China s GDP  in U S  dollar terms  close to doubling in five years so long as the currency doesn t nosedive  By early next decade China s economy would near  15 trillion and be on track to surpass the U S  For the rest of the world  7 5  growth in China is effectively the same as U S  growth of around 4   As I have become fond of saying  China today creates the equivalent of another Greek economy every eleven and a half weeks  and one tenth of another eurozone economy every year   2012  but this requires even more draconian cuts  Ollie Rehn  the EU s most senior economic official  said the EU couldn t do more given the fact

122050,343565,NYT,Greece Bailout Plan Details Disdained in Brussels  at Home,opinion,Hours after Greece s ruling coalition announced Thursday that it had concluded an 11th hour agreement on new austerity measures in an effort to satisfy foreign lenders  it seemed that everyone   from creditors abroad to political allies back home   was turning on the Greek leadership After wee hour drama that included early morning phone calls between the Greek prime minister and the leader of an allied coalition party  Greece s political leadership showed up in Brussels Thursday morning with more or less what it had been asked to bring  a bailout plan that would allow it to accept further budget cuts and tax increases in exchange for a desperate needed  130 billion But at the meeting of the eurozone finance ministers discussing the Greek bailout  the mood was skeptical of the accomplishment   It s up to the Greek government to provide concrete actions through legislation and other actions to convince its European partners that a second program can be made to work   EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said  suggesting the proposed framework was not enough  and adding he would  thoroughly scruti nize  the specifics of the deal Thursday night German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble went even further  criticizing the Greek leadership for not having fully implemented the requirements imposed during the first bailout   Greece has to implement what it has not implemented from the first program before we can decide on a second   he said  later telling reporters who were eagerly waiting for any official pronouncements   You don t need to wait around  because there will be no decision  Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker echoed that sentiment  saying   I do not have reasons to believe that there will be a definitive deal this evening  And indeed  as of 10 p m  Brussels time  there was no deal  in spite of pleas from Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos  who noted  we need now the political endorsement of the Eurogroup for the final steps  Trouble at homeThe cool  passive aggressive reception the Greeks received in Brussels added to the bind that country s leadership is facing for agreeing to further austerity measures  The first set of austerity reforms are widely seen in Greece as contributing to a worsening of the recession there Greece s unemployment rate was an astonishing 20 9 percent in November  according to data released Thursday  as roughly one in 11 employed Greeks lost their job during that month  The economic picture is believed to have worsened further since then  The unemployment rate for people 15 to 24 hovers near 50 percent  a fact that some believe could lead to civil unrest  And 91 percent of Greeks interviewed in a recent poll for an Athens newspaper believe their country is  going in the wrong direction   The main reasons behind this deterioration   which is expected to continue until the first quarter of the year at least   are the increased uncertainty over Greek economy s prospects  the prospect of additional austerity and a possible increase in the grey economy   Nikos Magginas  of local National Bank  told Reuters Thursday  as the country s main labor unions prepared for a 48 hour strike set to begin Friday morning  a deputy labor minister  Yannis Koutsoukos  resigned  stating the new austerity package would be  painful for working people  Muted market responseSurprisingly  while market analysts have noted that several stock market slumps over the past month have been directly attributable to uncertainty in Greece  the firming up of a bailout deal did not have the opposite effect on U S  equities  There s nothing really to be gained for the U S  stock market as a result of the agreement   Andrew Wilkinson  chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak  in New York told CNBC   It just removes further impediments and reduces the overall risk emanating from the eurozone  The market responses that did come were mainly from Ireland and Italy  where politicians are using the impending Greek deal to leverage better terms on their own stances vis   vis any future international assistance packages  Enda Kenny  the Irish prime minister  is fighting for more favorable terms in a restructuring of Irish banks  debt that must happen before March  In comments Wednesday and Thursday  Kenny seemed to be remind ing the international community that Ireland  which arguably took more painful financial measures than Greece by pledging to pay all its current obligations  should be rewarded for sticking to the plan  We take one problem off the table for the moment   Carl B  Weinberg  chief economist at High Frequency Economic  told The New York Times   The Pandora s box has been opened for Ireland and Portugal  We don t know where this goes  Friends in WashingtonThe one word of encouragement to the embattled Greek leadership came from Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti  in Washington for an econom ics conference  who said that even with  a minimum of compliance   Greece should be awarded the much needed bailout  This is the moment to consider if there if is a minimum of compliance on the requirements       to turn the page   Monti said at a Peterson Institute for International Economics event  according to Reuters   The strict adherence to a model might prevent a pragmatic solution of the problem  ,2012-02-12,International Business

122051,343566,NYT,A Warning Sign For The World,opinion,Any financial system that is based on debt is doomed to fail   Today  we are living in the greatest debt bubble that the world has ever seen  and if all of a sudden people could not use credit to buy things our economy would immediately ground to a halt   Unfortunately  no debt bubble can last forever   When this current debt bubble finally bursts  faith in the financial system is going to disappear  credit is going to freeze up and there is going to be a massive wave of bank failures   Right now  Greece is a warning sign for the world   Nobody wants to lend money to Greece  the Greek banking system is dying  one out of every four businesses has already shut down  unemployment is soaring and the Greek economy has now been in recession for five years in a row   Sadly  the economic implosion in Greece is rapidly accelerating   The Greek economy shrunk at a  annual rate during the 4th quarter of 2011   That wasn t supposed to happen   Things were supposed to be getting better in Greece by now   But instead the Greek depression is getting even worse  and very soon the rest of the world is going to be going through what Greece is currently experiencing  Unfortunately  most in the mainstream media are treating what is happening in Greece as an  isolated incident  rather than as a very serious warning sign for the world  Thankfully  there are at least a few reporters out there that are realizing the gravity of the situation   The following is how one reporter from  recently described what life is like in Greece now     By many indicators  Greece is devolving into something unprecedented in modern Western experience  A quarter of all Greek companies have gone out of business since 2009  and half of all small businesses in the country say they are unable to meet payroll  The suicide rate increased by 40 percent in the first half of 2011  A barter economy has sprung up  as people try to work around a broken financial system  Nearly half the population under 25 is unemployed  Last September  organizers of a government sponsored seminar on emigrating to Australia  an event that drew 42 people a year earlier  were overwhelmed when 12 000 people signed up  Greek bankers told me that people had taken about one third of their money out of their accounts  many  it seems  were keeping what savings they had under their beds or buried in their backyards  One banker  part of whose job these days is persuading people to keep their money in the bank  said to me   Who would trust a Greek bank   Can you imagine  Greece is experiencing a full blown economic collapse and nobody can see a light at the end of the tunnel at this point  As I have written about   the overall rate of unemployment in Greece has now risen above 20 percent and the youth unemployment rate in Greece has soared to an astounding 48 percent  Deleveraging can be an extremely painful process   Greece has been forced to try to reduce the size of its budget deficit  but every time it cuts government spending that causes economic activity  and thus government revenues  to slow down as well  Now the EU and the IMF are demanding that even more very painful austerity measures be implemented in Greece even though Greece is already experiencing a full blown depression  The EU and the IMF are demanding that Greece fire 15 000 more government workers immediately and a total of 150 000 government workers by 2015  The EU and the IMF are demanding that wages for government workers be cut by another 20 percent  The EU and the IMF are demanding that the minimum wage be slashed by more than 20 percent  The EU and the IMF are also demanding significant reductions in unemployment benefits and pension benefits  Of course all of those cuts are going to make the short term economic conditions in Greece even worse  The rioting  looting and burning of buildings that we are witnessing right now in Greece is likely to continue for quite some time as exasperated citizens attempt to express their frustrations to politicians that simply do not seem to care  According to the National Confederation of Greek Commerce  recent rioting resulted in damage to  businesses in Athens   45 of those businesses were totally destroyed  You can view some stunning footage of the current rioting in Greece   Despite all of the austerity measures that have already been implemented  the truth is that Greece is very likely to default soon anyway  There is a very good chance that the new austerity agreement that the Greek parliament just approved will never be implemented   There are new elections scheduled for April and the current party in power is polling in the single digits  The new Greek government is likely to look much different from the current one  and nobody knows for sure if the new government will follow through on any of the promises being made by the current government  In addition  the German parliament must approve this new deal with Greece  and the German parliament is not scheduled to vote on it until February 27th   Considering the mood in Germany right now  approval is not guaranteed  So there are all kinds of things that could go wrong with the  deals  that are currently being discussed   The truth is that a Greek default in the coming months seems to become more likely by the day  Some in the financial world almost seem eager for a Greek default   The following is what Jon Moulton  the chairman of Better Capital  recently       If I was Greek  I wouldn t be going for these measures  I d be going for default and getting it over with  Would you like two to three years of pain or 20   But a disorderly Greek default would not be a pleasant thing for the global economy at all   A recent article  detailed what some of the consequences of a Greek default and exit from the eurozone might be     But default and  re drachmatisation  would be a costly and chaotic process  In the long term the euro might be strengthened if some of its weaker members headed for the door  But in the short term banks across the eurozone might have to be closed to prevent a run on the single currency as investors speculated about which country might be next  A new wave of bank nationalisations would be likely to follow as lenders counted their losses on now worthless Greek debt  Capital controls would have to be imposed and borders shut to stop money flooding out of Greece  Portugal  Italy and Spain would come under intense pressure from investors wary about the risk of another victim  Banks everywhere  already reluctant to lend  would cut back hard  nervous about their exposure to the bonds of all Europe s crisis hit states  And the financial crisis in Europe is going to continue to spread well beyond Greece   Moody s Investors Service just downgraded the credit ratings of six European nations   The following is how  described the downgrades     Spain was downgraded to A3 from A1 with a negative outlook  Italy was downgraded to A3 from A2 with a negative outlook and Portugal was downgraded to Ba3 from Ba2 with a negative outlook  Moody s said  It also reduced the ratings of Slovakia  Slovenia and Malta  Countries such as Italy  Spain  Portugal  Ireland and Hungary are heading down the exact same road that Greece has gone   Greece was the first one to experience a full blown depression  but soon Greece will have a lot of company  Greece is most definitely a warning sign for the world   If you keep recklessly piling up debt  eventually a day of reckoning comes   It is inevitable  But Barack Obama does not seem to understand this   He continues to pile another  on to our  every single hour   He knows that cutting spending significantly right now would hurt the economy and that would significantly hurt his chances for another term  Needless to say  Barack Obama is not likely to do anything that is going to significantly hurt his chances for another four years in the White House  So we continue to roll on toward disaster  The U S  financial system is like a car with no brakes that is heading straight toward a 5 000 foot drop at 100 miles an hour  It is all going to seem like fun and games to some people until we hit the canyon floor ,2012-02-15,Michael T.

122052,343567,NYT,Oracle Is Too Cheap To Ignore Any Longer ,opinion,Within the world of investing exists a dichotomy that has often befuddled and confused us  On the one hand  we have investors that are interested in becoming owners of some of the most profitable and rapidly growing businesses on the planet  And  on the other hand  we have the trader mentality where the sole focus is on the erratic nature of short term stock price movement  But what is most confusing of all is how even though the interests of these two groups are the polar opposites of each other  the irony of all ironies is that they need each other  The businesses need the traders to provide the liquidity and capital they need to function  While the traders need the businesses in order to have something with which to trade upon But the main point proposed from the above diatribe is how these polar opposites functioning together can create anomalies that can be exploited  We believe that one such anomaly that currently exists is how the market is currently undervaluing the technology sector  This sector contains some of our fastest growing and most powerful companies with records of profitable growth that is unequaled in the annals of business history  But even more importantly  the odds are extremely high that the technology sector sits at the forefront of the next leg of what might be the greatest transformation in the history of business  Yet somehow  Mr  Market  the short term trader is currently seeing fit to price our best technology companies at some of the lowest valuations ever If you examine most of our greatest technology names  you discover that as a sector they are trading at below market valuations  Yet  as a sector  they have produced the strongest historical growth and are expected to produce some of the strongest future growth as well  Today we find Microsoft  MSFT  trading at a PE ratio of 11  Oracle  ORCL  at a PE ratio of 12 9  and Hewlett Packard  HPQ   can be bought at a PE of only 7  Even the mighty Apple  AAPL  computer only trades at a PE ratio of 15  These appear to be extremely low valuations when you consider both the importance and the promise of the technology sector s contribution to our future The Possibility of Abundance  Abundance   The Future Is Better Than You Think  There is a new book soon to be published that we had the privilege to be on the advance list of purchasers  With all the pessimism and fear of the future so prevalent today  we highly encourage every investor to get a copy of this important work  We believe you will find that it is not Pollyanna but full of facts and logical hypotheses supporting the case for optimism  The book is titled Abundance   The Future Is Better Than You Think  The book is written by Peter H  Diamandis and Steven Kotler  who are both renowned visionaries   Dr  Peter H  Diamandis  is Singularity University Cofounder and X PRIZE Foundation Chairman  The X PRIZE Foundation  leads the world in designing and launching large incentive prizes to drive radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity  Best known for the  10 million Ansari X PRIZE for private spaceflight and the  10 million Progressive Automotive X PRIZE for 100 mile per gallon equivalent cars  the Foundation is now launching prizes in Exploration  Life Sciences  Energy  and Education  Steven Kotler  is a science journalist  His articles have appeared in over 60 publications  including  New York Times Magazine  Wired  Discover  Popular Science  Outside  GQ  and National Geographic  He writes  The Playing Field   a blog about the science of sport and culture for PsychologyToday com E  Steven Kotler is also the co founder and director of research at the Flow Genome Project  an international organization devoted to putting flow state research on a hard science footing   What follows are a few excerpts from part one of their book   Perspective   technology is a resource  liberating mechanism  It can make the once scarce the now abundant    Of course  the make more pies approach is nothing new  but there are a few key differences this time around  These differences will comprise the bulk of this book  but the short version is that for the first time in history  our capabilities have begun to catch up to our ambitions  Humanity is now entering a period of radical transformation in which technology has the potential to significantly raise the basic standards of living for every man  woman  and child on the planet  Within a generation  we will be able to provide goods and services  once reserved for the wealthy few  to any and all who need them  Or desire them  Abundance for all is actually within our grasp    In this modern age of cynicism  many of us bridle in the face of such proclamation  but elements of this transformation are already underway  Over the past 20 years  wireless technologies and the Internet have become ubiquitous  affordable  and available to almost everyone  Africa has skipped the technological generation  by passing the land lines that stripe our Western skies for the wireless way  Mobile phone penetration is growing exponentially  from 2  in 2000  to 28  in 2009  to an expected 70  in 2013  Already folks with no education and little to eat have gained access to cellular connectivity unheard of just 30 years ago  Right now a Masai warrior with a cell phone has better mobile phone capabilities than the present United States did 25 years ago  And if he s on a smart phone with access to Google  then he has better access to information the president did just 15 years ago  By the end of 2013  the vast majority of humanity will be caught in the same World Wide Web of instantaneous  low cost communications and information  In other words  we are now living in a world of information and communication abundance  Oracle  A Paragon of Consistent Above average Growth Oracle  ORCL  is a world leader in the database software industry  and after acquiring Sun in 2010  is now the world leader in complete  open  integrated hardware and software systems  According to their website   With more than 380 000 customers including 100 of the Fortune 100 and with deployments across a wide variety of industries in more than 145 countries around the globe  Oracle offers an optimized and fully integrated stack of business hardware and software systems that helps organizations overcome complexity and unleash innovation   The following graph plots Oracle s earnings per share growth since 1998  which averaged 20 8  per annum  Notice that the company initiated its first dividend in calendar year 2008 as depicted by the light blue shaded area on the graph  Although Oracle  ORCL  is a leader in software innovation with a strong commitment to R D  the company has primarily achieved its growth through acquisitions  Since calendar year 2005  the company has spent approximately  36 billion acquiring and integrating over 80 acquisitions  At Oracle s current price of approximately  28 per share  it is a  140 billion market cap technology titan  We would estimate fair value at approximately  49 per share  see earnings and price correlating graph below   which would give Oracle a market cap of over  246 billion  Consequently  we believe that Oracle  at its current valuation  represents an opportunity to build a position at a price that is almost 50  below its intrinsic value  The orange line with white triangles represents a PEG ratio fair valuation of 20 8  Therefore  the reader should note that any time the stock price is touching the orange line  it is trading at a PE ratio of 20 8 But more importantly notice how the stock price has tracked the orange earnings line over time  With the exception of the irrationally exuberant period spanning 1999 to 2001  it is clear that the market has generally capitalized Oracle shares in line with its earnings growth  And  perhaps even more importantly  it is clear that every time the stock price falls below the orange earnings line  as it now does  it quickly comes back to value  Consequently  we believe the below graph paints a clear picture that based on historically normal valuation  Oracle is currently undervalued When we calculate performance associated with the above graph  we discover that Oracle has significantly outperformed the S P 500 even considering the 50  undervalued case we made above  Moreover  the 15 3  capital appreciation  closing annualized ROR  correlates to earnings growth adjusted by low valuation With our next graph we overlay free cash flow  the orange shaded area marked with an F  in addition to price and earnings  Here we re provided a clear picture of Oracle s solid financial condition which supports their ability to continue making future acquisitions to support future growth On February 9  2012 Oracle announced it is acquiring Taleo for  1 9 billion or  46 a share  The Taleo acquisition follows their recent acquisition of RightNow Technologies   a leading provider of cloud based customer service  RightNow s Customer Service Cloud helps organizations deliver exceptional customer experiences across call centers  the web and social networks  We believe that both of these acquisitions indicate that Oracle is not willing to rest on its laurels and past successes  and continues to assess the future of technology Our next earnings and price correlated graph calculates Oracle s earnings growth since 2003  This is offered to illustrate remarkable consistency of Oracle s growth  Our first graph covered the 15 year period  14 years plus the year were currently in  which averaged earnings growth of 20 8   When calculating the shorter time frame since calendar year 2003  we discover that Oracle s earnings growth of 20 2  is virtually identical to the longer time period In order to continue with our analysis of Oracle s growth  we shorten our time frame even further from 2008  the year of the great recession  to current  Here we continue to discover the remarkable consistency of Oracle s operating results  Once again we find that since 2008 Oracle has continued to grow earnings in excess of 20  per annum  Therefore  with each example we provided continuing evidence that Oracle is currently undervalued  Each time it has been undervalued in the past we see the stock price rather quickly moves back to the orange earnings justified valuation line Oracle s FutureA careful examination of the above historical graphs will reveal that they do include forecasts for this fiscal year ending May 31  2012 and a forecast for fiscal year ending May 31  2013  Perhaps  the forecast of only 10  growth in fiscal 2013 might partially explain Oracle s current historically low valuation  Furthermore  the consensus of 24 analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Oracle s 5 year average earnings growth rate to be 13  per annum  However  this is less than the 14 4  estimated growth by 19 analysts reporting to Zacks  Consequently  we are comfortable estimating a range of future growth of 12  to 17  Additionally  the reader should consider that there is at least a possibility of pessimism built into analysts  current thinking  Although Oracle s last quarterly earnings report was solid  it nevertheless disappointed analysts by missing by approximately 3 cents a share  However  if you study the annual rates of change of earnings growth at the bottom of the above historical earnings and price correlated graphs  orange shaded area   you ll see that this is not the first time that Oracle had a soft quarter  The reaction in their stock price acted like Oracle was going out of business  and not that they still produced a very profitable quarter Thesis for Oracle s Continued GrowthThere are several reasons why we believe that Oracle is capable of continuing to grow its business at above average rates far into the foreseeable future  We believe that corporate spending on software and services will continue to be in demand  Furthermore  we believe that Oracle is poised to offer many innovative products that are not currently factored into anybody s expectations Also  the company s financial condition remains excellent with a solid cash position and the continuing ability to generate free cash flow  Since we cannot know what acquisitions might be on the horizon  we have to rely on their track record as a guide  And as we have illustrated in this article  their track record is superb  More importantly  so is the track record of their management team  Management does not let any grass grow underneath them  and continues to innovate  We for one don t feel it s wise to bet against them The future for technology is certainly an unknown  However  one thing that prospective investors should realize is that technology does not grow in a linear fashion  Instead  both the history and we believe the future of technology experiences exponential growth  No other industry understands or participates in the power of compounding more than technology has  and we believe will continue to do  However  based on what we already know about technology  it is clear that the developing world will be  and already is  participating in the technology revolution For example  according to the book Abundance   The Future Is Better Than You Think  referenced above  the information communication revolution that is now underway is rapidly spreading across the planet  Over the next eight years  3 billion new individuals will be coming online  joining the global conversation  and contributing to the global economy  Their ideas  ideas we ve never had access to will result in new discoveries products and inventions that will benefit us all  Although it s hard to imagine what those ideas will mean  and how much growth they will provide  we believe it s a safe bet that Oracle Corp  will be an active participant Summary and ConclusionsWe believe that Oracle Corp   as we mentioned in our opening remarks  is just one of many technology titans that we believe the market is mispricing  Furthermore  we believe part of that stems from the general level of pessimism that has created the so called flight to safety out of equities  Pessimism thrives on uncertainty  and one of the main attributes of technology is uncertainty  Any time a long term investor takes a position in a technology company  business   they must do it with the realization that it s more likely than not  that any future profits they are expecting will come from products and or services that don t even exist today Investing in technology is never without risk  However  the above average growth and above average returns that technology stocks have traditionally generated support the taking of the extra risk  During more normal and benign market environments  technology stocks usually command above average price earnings ratios  which add even more to the risk of investing in them  However  as we previously indicated  many of our best technology stocks are trading at historically low valuations today  Not only are today s valuations lower than the norm for technology stocks  in many cases they are below the valuations of the average company as measured by the S P 500  Therefore  we believe that investors seeking maximum capital appreciation at reasonable levels of risk might do well to take a hard look at not only Oracle  but the technology sector in general ,2012-02-16,Chuck

122053,343568,NYT,Gas Prices  Beyond The Barrel,opinion,The price of gas at the pump is once again triggering many angry blame throwers  I just heard Bill  O Reilly of The O  Reilly Factor on my TV last night heatedly attacking the oil companies saying that our current  70 fill up is the fault of a warm winter and some greed inspired exporting of our resultant oil surplus to China  Every time the oil price alarms us  you hear blame aimed at the evil oil companies  the evil speculators  El Nino  or whatever diverts our attention away from the real problem  We are seeing a lot of buzz about blaming whoever is president for a shocking run up in gas prices  But this blame game is mostly a myth as an  in the New York Times online by Nate Silver shows  It s silly to blame short term moves in price on a president  Why not just blame El Nino  It s the long term  multi year  price behavior that should be blamed on our government s energy policy   and on that point I feel the past several presidents should be put on trial and shot for crimes against humanity  O Reilly s fit reminds me of the explanations of the out of control price of oil when it first went over  60 a barrel  It was speculators and  even though there was no real demand  Steve Forbes boldly explained that a new supply would be forthcoming because of basic supply and demand  and he issued his now infamous prediction of the return of stable  35 oil Well  oil went through a brief speculation enhanced gyration in 2008  but as it moved slowly back up through  80 in 2010  oil was the under performing dog of a nice market and it was hardly the object of the hot money  And Forbes  supply fix for  35 is now laughable  As for  O Reilly s blame on a weird winter  where was this explanation about this time last year  when Brent was even higher at  125   Iran s shenanigans were relatively quiet then too Why can t we understand we have a bigger problem than all this  About 2 years ago  CNBC began airing it s special  Beyond The Barrel   The Race To Fuel The Future   It prompted me to write an article about just this problem   the real reason we must spend  70 to fill up and why it s going to get much worse  If you believe  as our president does  that high oil will just accelerate a dive into non fossil energy and that will save us  then read on  I called the article  Beyond The Barrel And Over the Cliff  and I repeat it here  because it bears repeating Tonight  CNBC premiers  Beyond the Barrel   the Race to Fuel the Future   This is a look at the alternatives to the crude oil bursting forth from the ground that has spoiled us for decades with cheap  abundant energy  One thing that will probably be missing in the discussion is the major issue EROEI  What is EROEI  How do you pronounce it  Well  I don t concern myself with pronouncing it  but I do get vexed by how much attention is being paid to it EROEI is simply Energy Returned On Energy Invested  It was not even a word back when Jed Clampett could start a bubblin  crude when he was out shootin  for some food  But as we started drilling deeper to recover oil  people like Cleveland and Hall began tabulating estimates on how much of our energy supply was being used to find  drill  and use our new energy finds  They come up with about a 100 figure for oil of the 1930s  1 barrel of oil burned to get 100 new barrels online   This had dropped to around 30 by the 1970s as so much of the easy to find oil in the world s elephant fields in naturally pressurized reservoirs has already been exploited  EROEI for oil and natural gas now is running around 8   11 depending on locale That is a huge drop from the 100 EROEI of the 1930s  but as it turns out in the math of net energy  it s not that big a deal  What is a big deal is what happens as this EROEI number goes from around 8 to below 4   click on chart to view charts This chart  constructed by Dr  Euan Mearns  an editor at   plots net energy as a percent from 100 down to zero over EROEI s range from very high down to one  where it is taking a barrel of recovered energy to obtain a barrel of new energy  no net energy to use   As you can see  we re in fine shape as long as EROEI keeps north of 8  but we fall and we can t get up as we go over the cliff as EROEI goes to 4 and below  This is an exponentially increasing problem as we try to replace peaking crude production with things like corn ethanol  which is a worthless solution  Consider the following oil replacement scale showing the math of replacing the net usable energy content of an 8 EROEI fuel  like oil  with alternatives of less than 8 Corn ethanol  at an estimated EROEI of 1 3  must be produced at a rate of over 20 barrels for each barrel of oil it replaces  Yet this is our Congressman s high dollar solution to peak oil  Many biodiesel  solar  and electric EROEI estimates aren t much better You see a lot of barrel count estimates of future oil production as we deal with peak oil  but as we go over the top of the conventional oil production peak  the evidence suggests we already have  the flood of  alternative  liquids such as tar sand oil  deepwater  etc  are severely challenged to come close to matching crude s EROEI  This makes a big difference in how much net energy is actually being delivered to society despite the raw barrel count  This makes a good EROEI estimate of any new alternative fuel critically important   its most important feature  It should be the first thing discussed in all the news coverage and political speeches on alternative energy  But nobody is paying any attention as we approach the net energy cliff ,2012-02-21,Bruce Pile,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gas-prices:-beyond-the-barrel-114606,114606
122054,343569,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,What an election  eh  According to a CNN ORC poll  six in ten Republicans continue to wish they had more choices  count me in that group   as the candidates still in it keep swapping places So following are some national surveys of Republican voters this past  InternationalRick Santorum 34 percentMitt Romney 32Ron Paul 16Newt Gingrich 15New York Times CBS NewsSantorum 30Romney 27Paul 12Gingrich 10Public Policy  week ago Santorum 38Romney 23Gingrich 17Paul 13Pew Research CenterSantorum 30Romney 28GallupRomney 32Santorum 30Romney won the Conservative Political Action Committee straw poll by a 38 31 margin over Santorum  Gingrich 15  Paul 12   In his speech to the group  Romney called himself  severely conservative   What the heck is that supposed to mean      Prepared remarks circulated by his campaign had him saying he was simply  a conservative governor  Romney barely defeated Ron Paul in Maine s nonbinding caucuses 39 36  with Santorum at 18  though on Friday word came the vote may have been flawed  perhaps  severely  so  Only 6 000 votes were cast  or about 2 percent of registered Republicans  so the state s elephants were just thrilled by the process not And  again  as I noted would be the case a few weeks ago  President Obama is now hitting 50  in his approval ratings but it s amazing the last four I ve seen are exactly 50    including CNN ORC and New York Times CBS Just as importantly  in the CNN poll  Obama now has a 50  approval rating among independents  The NY Times survey has independents favoring Obama over Romney 49 38  Just a little while ago  it was the reverse   Overall  Obama defeats Romney 51 46 and both Santorum and Ron Paul 52 45  A Rasmussen survey  released last weekend  had President Obama defeating Santorum by only a 46 42 margin  The same survey had Obama crushing Romney 50 40 Peggy Noonan   Wall Street Journal The Romney campaign is better at dismantling than mantling  They re better at taking opponents apart than building a compelling candidate of their own  They do not seem capable of deepening his meaning  making his stands and statements more textured and interesting  He comes across like a businessman who studied the data and came up with the formula that will make the deal  A particular problem is that he betrays little indignation at any of our problems and their causes  He s always sunny  pleasant  untouched by anger  This leaves people thinking   Excuse me  but we are in crisis  Financially and culturally we fear our country is going down the drain  This guy doesn t seem to be feeling it  So why s he running  Maybe he thinks it s his personal destiny to be president  But if the animating passion of his candidacy is about him  not us  who needs him   Fred Barnes   The Weekly Standard A week ago  Republican capture of the Senate in the 2012 election was regarded as close to a sure thing  The political direction of the country had shifted in favor of Republicans  Democrats faced the unenviable task of defending 23 seats  Republicans only 10  And 8 of the GOP seats were safely in Republican hands  Now Republican prospects are not as rosy  The odds on a Republican Senate are no worse than 50 50  maybe better  But the effort to oust Democrats who currently control the Senate 53 47  looks more difficult than it did  What has changed  Most significant may be President Obama s improved chances of reelection  He has enormous liabilities  but he has managed to alter the political environment enough to make Republicans and the rich a live issue in the campaign  Before  his record in the White House  especially on the economy  was the lone issue  So it s pretty simple  If Obama is reelected  Democrats hold the Senate and your editor moves to Yap One of the key Senate races in the country this fall is in Virginia  Democratic former Gov  Tim Kaine and Republican former Sen  George Allen  As noted by U S  News Weekly  not only is the race in a dead heat  since last May  12 different polls have shown the contest to be effectively tied Mike Collins   Baltimore Sun  Star Ledger  Every Republican presidential candidate claims to be the heir to Ronald Reagan s legacy  For years  Republican partisans have carried Reagan s memory before them as the ancient Israelites carried the Ark of the Covenant  Just invoking his name proved your ideological purity  and would smite the dreaded RINO   Republican in name only  Problem is  those who most fervently claim to adhere to Ronald Reagan s principles don t seem to understand Reagan s greatest principle  decency   As a man  Reagan had a sunny optimism and faith in the goodness of his fellow Americans  While his political opponents disagreed with him over policy  he did not consider them his enemies  He viewed them as his fellow citizens  and right or wrong  he valued them  He was a true gentleman  If Republicans want to honor his legacy  we should remember the man he really was   not the myth we ve created to advance our personal interests  If we can emulate the decency  civility  good will and patriotism that was Ronald Reagan   and live the 11th Commandment   we can truly honor him in the second century after his birth and make America the gleaming city on the hill he dreamed of  In a Rasmussen poll  59  of Catholics disapprove of the president s job performance after he imposed a new birth control mandate on employers  including Catholic agencies  A CNN ORC International poll reveals  Half of all Americans say they oppose the Obama administration s new policy concerning employer provided health insurance plans and their coverage of contraceptive services for female employees including those at religiously affiliated institutions  PBS is premiering a four hour  American Experience  documentary on Bill Clinton on Monday and Tuesday  one that chronicles his  unruly libido  as an Irish newspaper put it  Former adviser Dick Morris relates the moment Clinton rang him just before evidence of his affair with Monica Lewinssky was about to be made public  Bill said to me   Ever since I got to the White House I have had to shut down my body  Clinton then asked Morris to conduct political polls on how he should handle the crisis Another adviser speaks of  sparks flying between  Clinton and Lewinsky  from the first moment when they saw each other  But otherwise  after reading a poor review in the Washington Post  I m passing on this one New Jersey Republican Gov  Chris Christie caught heat for his decision to have flags lowered to half staff on Saturday for Whitney Houston s funeral  saying he rejects criticism that she  forfeited the good things that she did  because of her struggles with substance abuse  What I would say to everybody is there but for the grace of God go I   he said Detractors say that the honor should be reserved for members of the military  for one example  and not to honor a drug addict Christie says Houston deserves the honor because of her cultural impact and as  a daughter of New Jersey   I am disturbed by people who

122055,343570,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Iran  There is no doubt that sanctions have been effective in applying increasing pressure on the Iranian economy  and on this the Obama administration  Congress  especially  and Western Europe are to be commended  I agree with commentator Michael Gerson who writes on Friday in the Washington Post  Sanctions have not caused Iran to back down  but the approach is not yet exhausted  It is worth another twist of the tourniquet to reduce significant exceptions and exemptions  And that s the thing  The White House has a June deadline for compliance with U S  sanctions in terms of Iran s customers and oil  but the United States can t wait forever  nor can Israel  and it was highly disturbing that Secretary of State Clinton said a letter Iran sent to the P5 1   the five permanent members of the UN Security Council  Britain  France  U S   Russia and China  plus Germany   was what she had been looking for as Iran expressed that it wants talks on the nuclear issue But this letter becomes an issue the same week the International Atomic Energy Agency s inspectors were blocked by Iran s leadership on their second visit from seeing the military site at Parchin  as well as interviewing selected key scientists  plus there are reports of expanded nuclear activity at the Fordow underground site  while Iran announced new military exercises  suspended oil sales to Britain and France  admittedly negligible last year France bought only 3  of its oil from Iran and the UK imported even less   and reiterated threats to close the Strait  as well as saying Iran itself could launch a preemptive strike As noted above  the IAEA then issued a revised report on Iran s activities  while earlier  both the U S  and Britain urged Israel not to attack U S  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Gen  Martin Dempsey  told CNN that while Israel has the ability to strike Iran  it would delay them  probably for a couple of years  But some of the targets are probably beyond their reach   Dempsey expressed concern an Israeli attack would spark reprisals against U S  targets in the Gulf or Afghanistan   That s the question with which we all wrestle  And the reason that we think that it s not prudent at this point to decide to attack Iran   Dempsey also described Iran as a  rational actor   British Foreign Minister William Hague said   I don t think a wise thing at this moment is for Israel to launch a military attack on Iran  I think Israel like everyone else in the world should be giving a real chance to the approach we have adopted on very serious economic sanctions and economic pressure and the readiness to negotiate with Iran  I find it highly distressing that top Obama administration and defense officials continue to voice their opinions on this topic in public rather than privately  At the same time  Israeli officials should keep their mouths shut as well The preferred type of dialogue was actually exhibited by Dan Shapiro  U S  Ambassador to Israel  on Thursday in Jerusalem  It is clear that Iran is under significant economic strain  but the sanctions have  not yet achieved the goal  which is to get that nuclear program stopped For both us and for Israel this is the preferred strategy  to achieve that all important objective  It s also true  as the president has said we are coordinating with our Israeli partners that other options  all other options  are on the table to achieve that goal  and  the necessary planning has been done to ensure that those options are actually available if at any time they become necessary   he stated There  That s more like it  A balanced statement that keeps Iran guessing  Editorial   Wall Street Journal In a single sound bite  General Dempsey managed to tell the Iranians they can breathe easier because Israel s main ally is opposed to an attack on Iran  such attack isn t likely to work in any case  and the U S  fears Iran s retaliation  It s as if General Dempsey wanted to ratify Iran s rhetoric that the regime is a fearsome global military threat  If the U S  really wanted its diplomacy to work in lieu of force  it would say and do whatever it can to increase Iran s fear of an attack  America s top military officer in particular should say that if Iran escalates in response to an Israeli attack  the U S  would have no choice but to intervene on behalf of its ally   The general is not a free lancer  so his message was almost certainly guided by the White House  His remarks only make strategic sense if President Obama s real priority is to contain Israel first   especially before the November election   Like most of Mr  Obama s Iran policy  General Dempsey s comments will have the effect of making war more likely  not less  They will increase Israel s anxiety about U S  support  especially if Mr  Obama is re elected and he has a freer political hand  This may drive Israel s leadership to strike sooner  Weakness invites war  and General Dempsey has helped the administration send a message of weakness to Israel and Iran  Ray Takeyh   Washington Post From Tehran s perspective  protracted diplomacy has the advantage of potentially dividing the international community  shielding Iran s facilities from military retribution and easing economic sanctions  Iran may have to be patient in its quest to get the bomb  it may have to offer confidence building measures and placate its allies in Beijing and Moscow  Any concessions it makes will probably be reversible and symbolic so as not to derail the overall trajectory of the nuclear program  Can Tehran be pressed into conceding to a viable arms control treaty  On the surface  it is hard to see how Iran s leaders could easily reconsider their national interest  The international community is confronting an Islamic republic in which moderate voices have been excised from power  However  it may still be possible to disarm Iran without using force  The key figure remains  Supreme Leader Ayatollah  Khamenei  who maintains the authority and stature to impose a decision on his reluctant disciples  A coercive strategy that exploits not just Khamenei s economic distress but his political vulnerabilities may cause him to reach beyond his narrow circle  broaden his coalition and inject a measure of pragmatism into his state s deliberations  As with most ideologies  Iran s supreme leader worries more about political dissent than economic privation  Such a strategy requires not additional sanctions but considerable imagination  Michael Gerson   Washington Post The president probably recognizes that the containment of an Iran with nuclear weapons is not a serious option  because advocates for this approach are confused about the meaning of containment  Obama could make clear that an Iranian nuclear attack on America would result in the death of every Iranian citizen  The promise of lopsided assured destruction would deter a direct attack on the American homeland  But it would not contain Iran  Behind a uranium shield  the Iranian regime would increase its support for terrorism and destabilize its neighbors  who would find a nuclear deterrent of their own highly desirable  And how would promises of future containment be minimally credible  If Western nations did nothing before Iran had nuclear weapons  why would they become more determined after Iran possesses them  Permitting a nuclear Iran would mean that everyone  including America and Israel  was bluffing   except Iran  Obama can t do nothing  But it is not advisable or practical to launch a multi week conventional air and naval campaign  So the national security adviser  the defense secretary and intelligence officials need to provide their boss something better than this dismal  binary choice   A limited strike  it is true  would only buy time  The message  however  would be clear enough  If you keep at it  we ll do it again  In the meantime  an oppressive and increasingly desperate regime may lose its grip on power   Obama wants to be known for winding down long wars  But he has shown no hesitance when it comes to shorter  Israel style operations  He is a special ops hawk  a drone militarist  Iran should take this fact seriously as it calculates its next move  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is meeting with President Obama on March 5  As the Washington Post s Jennifer Rubin notes   Netanyahu  will probably take the time to remind Obama that the president has staked his own credibility and that of the United States on preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons  The only way to ensure that that pledge is fulfilled  and for the United States to remain relevant in the region  is to make clear that the United States is prepared   with the cooperation of states in the Mideast  surely the Saudis must be as nervous as Netanyahu about Obama s fecklessness    to take military action if needed to thwart Iran s nuclear ambitions  Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman rebuffed both Washington and Moscow  the latter s Deputy Foreign Minister Gennyadi Gatilov having expressed an Israeli strike  would be a catastrophe not only for the region but for the whole system of international relations   The security of the citizens of Israel  the future of the state of Israel  this is the responsibility of the Israeli government   Lieberman said   We will make the best decision for the Israeli interest  Last fall I said President Obama would strike Iran in the spring  If Israel goes first  we will be there with them  I am not changing that stance  Those saying the president is just hoping to hold off until after the election simply don t get it  If Iran were to test a nuclear weapon in  say  September  Obama goes down in flames at the polls  He cannot risk that  Acting preemptively  even if it just sets back Iran s program a few years  gives him time to deal with the blowback As for Israel  I also continue to maintain that anyone thinking Benjamin Netanyahu will let Iran continue with their nuclear program just doesn t understand the man  He is the last Israeli that would let Iran get the bomb under his watch Of course all the preceding is moot should Iran make a stupid mistake first  like a suicide mission on one of the U S  naval vessels in the Gulf  As noted last week  maybe this is what Ayatollah Khamenei wants  thinking any conflict would be limited while he rallies his people and lets his proxies battle it out with Israel More next time as we continue to game it out  including my take on Saturday s New York Times story on how U S  intelligence agencies don t think Iran is working on a warhead  as if the CIA has any clue Syria  The situation here deteriorated further as the international community  led by the Red Cross  in actuality  sought a ceasefire in Homs where President Bashar Assad continued to butcher the people there  including two Western journalists this week  The Red Cross is seeking a two hour daily truce for the delivery of emergency medical and food supplies  this as Sec  of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that Syrian opposition forces will become  increasingly capable  of carrying out offensive operations  They will  from somewhere  somehow  find the means to defend themselves  as well as begin offensive measures   but she didn t endorse arming the opposition I admit arming the rebels is troublesome because we don t have a handle on who the leaders of the Syrian opposition are  Oh  we know who some of the spokesmen are  many of whom have been in exile for years  not just the past 11 months  but they don t get along with each other  plus you have the al Qaeda element But humanitarian assistance is one of America s hallmarks and we must do everything we can to aid the Red Cross  for crying out loud Meanwhile  the United Nations named former UN secretary general Kofi Annan as joint special envoy for the UN and the Arab League  Mr  Annan is hardly an imposing figure  I ve noted in the past he d make for a good neighbor  like take in your mail and water the flowers when you re away  As leader of the UN  though  he was an utter disaster  Ask the residents of Rwanda  when he was responsible for the UN Peacekeeping Force there in 1994 Philip Collins   London Times There is a lot that is species shaming but not much that is surprising about the actions of President Assad s thugs  Bizarre as it now seems  Assad was greeted in the summer of 2000 as a herald of reform in what was called  with optimism that is now gruesome  the Damascus Spring  In the autumn of 2001  he clamped the intellectuals in jail and  ever since  his regime has practiced the full arbitrary panoply of detention  torture and citizens who vanish off the face of the Earth  And yet  in Syria today the case for standing by and doing nothing is very close to being persuasive  The Syrian Army is eight times larger than the Libyan Army  A weak  split opposition controls no territory  There is no obvious dissident body to inherit power  Even if the end were imminent  Assad might well be prepared  like Samson  to bring the temple down with him  The Russians and the Chinese will not grant a UN mandate for action and there is a risk  in any case  of a full scale war in which Russia and Iran would stand with Syria and Hizbullah against the West in a horrible rerun of the power blocks of the Great War  Intervention  in other words  will mean chaos  But there is chaos already  We have to trade these risks against the following certainty  Six thousand are dead and the upshot of standing by is the gang rape of a young boy  The upshot of inaction is murder  The rhetorical naivety in this appeal is deliberate  When you see children slaughtered by state backed monsters  there is nothing wrong with being reduced to clich   This cannot be allowed to happen  Not in my name  Something must be done  The revulsion is too profound to be written off as adolescent or unrealistic  For those of us who are not religious  the suffering of other human beings is the deepest mark of common human heritage  So it is important to add weight to our moral impulse rather than to dismiss it as na ve and foolish  Where does revulsion meet practical reality  That is the central question   The practical arguments against military intervention in Syria are overwhelming  But there is a lot that can be done short of marching in  The success of our intervention in Libya and the absence of intervention in Syria is redeeming the argument that was lost in Iraq  The lesson is simple  If you take on a fascist you get chaos  If you don t take on a fascist you get chaos  It s the nature of the beast and sometimes we forget that it s the fascist that s the beast  not us  We re better than that and in our actions we will show it  Senator John McCain  To somehow sit by and watch this massacre continue without exploring and employing every option that we possibly can to stop it is a betrayal of everything the United States stands for and believes in  Michael Young   Daily Star  Beirut  The administration of President Barack Obama has often been ridiculed for what is described as  leading from behind   More often than not this has been an excuse for not leading at all  and nowhere has American vacillation been more on display than in Syria   Washington has been all over the place  In an interview with France 24 just over a week ago  the U S  ambassador to Syria  Robert Ford  said that the Obama administration was looking for a  peaceful political solution  in Syria   Even the Syrian people do not want a military solution to this crisis   he said  before adding   We believe  President  Assad should step down  but at the end of the day the Syrian people will make the decision  not the U S   A few days later  Victoria Nuland  the State Department spokeswoman  sounded less affirmative  While also defending a political solution  she observed   If we can t get Assad to yield to the pressure that we are all bringing to bear  we may have to consider additional measures   To many people this suggested that the U S  might possibly endorse arming Syria s opposition if that became necessary  Evidently  the Obama administration   amid the carnage in Homs and elsewhere in Syria   feared that it would fall behind the policy curve  There are no easy answers in Syria but Washington s trouble is that it has no strategy for the country  This is proving very damaging indeed  given that the Russians and Iranians do have one  and it can be summarized quite simply  Actively support the repression by the Syrian army and security services  bringing the opposition  or a portion of the opposition  to the negotiating table  Introduce reforms  albeit cosmetic reforms  to return the political initiative to Assad  Integrate willing opposition figures into a national unity government  thereby neutralizing the discontent on the ground  And give the regime the latitude to govern again  in order to snuff out pockets of dissent  The scheme is unlikely to work  but at least it is straightforward  Moscow and Tehran have dispatched military and intelligence units to Syria to impose their will  There are reports that the U S  has also sent people into Syria to organize the Syrian opposition  but apparently in numbers so infinitesimal as to be virtually useless   A Syrian civil war is a fearful prospect  but American indecision is not going to prevent one from taking place  If Washington and the Europeans dither  the Gulf states won t  and weapons will enter Syria anyway  as they already are  Better for the Obama administration to devise a political approach that embraces  while also controlling  a military dimension that would push Assad to reconsider his options   Washington needs to get a grip  Its policy toward Syria has been strangely disconnected from its other regional priority  namely containing Iran  It took many months for the administration to acknowledge the Syrian crisis as a major issue  By insisting  on the record and off  that there is nothing they can do in Syria  American officials have effectively ensured that they will do nothing  Their performance has been craven and one dimensional   in a word  pathetic  Lastly  journalist Marie Colvin  who was killed in Homs this week  worked for the Sunday Times of London  An editorial in that paper concluded  Mr  Assad has begun something that he cannot finish  started a war that he will not win  Marie Colvin gave her life to bear witness to his cruelty and barbarism  It is up to those she left behind to bring an end to it   Afghanistan  Violence exploded across the country as a result of an incredibly stupid act  the burning of Korans by U S  soldiers  I m sorry  You know my support for our military  but you also know of my disdain for some in the higher command and it is the responsibility of our generals  and the immediate levels below them  to ensure that our men and women are sensitive to the issues where they serve Editorial   London Times In a calm and tolerant country  where the pervasive national debate is mature  worldly and peaceable in tone  the inadvertent burning of a holy book could be expected to cause only minor offense  quickly forgotten  Afghanistan is not such a country  Yesterday  a crowd of thousands gathered outside Bagram airbase  after scores of Korans were burnt inside  This  reportedly  was the routine disposal of the former possessions of detainees held at the base  and no offense was intended  One must ask  nonetheless  how ignorant  na ve and stupid were those responsible  who had not considered that offense might be caused  This is a fight both predictable and not worth having  In April of last year  ten people were killed in protests unleashed by the decision of Terry Jones  an imbecilic pastor  to burn a Koran in Florida  He  at least  knew what he was doing   The West s war in Afghanistan has never been a war on Islam  Rather  it was a war against a network that preached a perversion of that faith and used it to inspire murder and mayhem in the free world  Fundamentalist Islam is a grim pursuit  antithetical to basic liberty  but the Taliban became the West s enemy only because they were al Qaeda s friends  On human rights  in particular  the rights of women  some clash of values was inevitable and indeed morally desirable  The burning of the Koran is a pointless provocation  creating friction and outrage for no reason at all  ISAF and NATO forces have been in that country for ten years and by now ought to know a little about it  Yes  Afghans should be able to better control themselves  But what manner of fools failed to anticipate that they might not  Two U S  soldiers were killed in rioting on Thursday  while further protests around the country claimed another seven lives  as of Friday   I see there has been further bloodshed as I go to post on Saturday   The top U S  commander in Afghanistan  Gen  John Allen  traveled to the base where an Afghan soldier opened fire on U S  troops  leading to the two deaths Allen told the troops   There will be moments like this when you re searching for the meaning of this loss  There will be moments like this when your emotions are governed by anger and a desire to strike back  Now is not the time for revenge  Now is not the time for vengeance  Now is the time to look deep inside your souls  remember your mission  remember your discipline  remember who you are   Iraq  It had been relatively quiet for a few weeks but then on Thursday there was a wave of attacks across Baghdad that killed 55 and wounded more than 200  The attacks unfolded over a 2   hour period  to heighten the sheer terror of it all  Last Sunday  a suicide car bomber took out 20 police recruits in Baghdad North South Korea  The United States and North Korea held their first formal talks since last year  even as South Korea began live fire military drills near its disputed border with the North  Pyongyang threatened retaliation but none was forthcoming  On the negotiation front  Washington is trying to steer the new regime of Kim Jong Un  or whoever is in charge  back to the negotiating table  but there were no breakthroughs  As noted before  all the North wants now is food aid  Like 300 000 tons of the stuff  The Obama administration is prepared to provide it if North Korea will suspend its uranium enrichment program  But of course any deal on this front must include UN monitors to verify any freeze China  Vice President Xi received favorable reviews back home for his trip to the United States  especially among ordinary people  as reported by the Washington Post s Keith B  Richburg from Beijing  Xi  struck a chord by using the simple everyday language of most Chinese and sprinkling his speeches with common cultural references  including a line from a pop song and an advertising jingle  It s not an image Chinese are used to after the decade long presidency of the stiff and formal looking Hu Jintao  who often comes across in photos as a typical Communist Party bureaucrat  And many here noticed the difference  Russia  You know who s a real pain in the butt these days  even more so than before  Vladimir Putin  With no real opposition  it now looks like he ll gain the 50  necessary to avoid a run off in the March 4 presidential vote as the latest poll from the reputable Levada Center has him suddenly at 66  of decided voters  compared with 15  for Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov   New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov  the billionaire  is only polling at 6   This week  in final campaign appearances  Putin vowed that if he s re elected to the office he once held for 8 years  he would pursue the largest arms buildup the country has experienced since the end of the Cold War  some  772 billion  including the acquisition of 400 shiny new ICBMs and eight strategic ballistic missile submarines  which is highly worrisome  seeing as the Russkies have an abysmal safety record when it comes to their nuclear subs  By the way  you know that one that had a fire recently  The Russians first denied there were nukes on board  Now the story is there were Putin explained why the big build up is necessary  We are forced to take decisive steps to bolster our national aerospace defense system to counter the U S  and NATO efforts in the deployment of missile defense  One cannot be  too patriotic  about this issue   Putin wrote in an article   Russia s military response to the global U S  missile shield will be effective and asymmetrical  a match for U S  missile defense policy    Christian Science Monitor Putin also said at a Thursday campaign rally  We ask everyone not to look abroad  not to run to the other side and not to deceive your motherland  but to join us  Then he warned the West   We won t allow anyone to meddle in our affairs or impose their will upon us  because we have a will of our own  Geezuz  Vlad  Just shut up Separately  we note that Latvian voters resoundingly rejected a proposal to give official status to Russian  the mother tongue of their former Soviet occupiers  The thing is  Russian is the first language of about a third of the country s 2 1 million people  But ethnic Latvians saw the referendum as a brazen attempt to infringe on their sovereignty  which was restored two decades ago following the collapse of the Soviet Union  Ethnic Russians say they have faced 20 years of discrimination  The schism between the two will only widen now France  President Nicolas Sarkozy has narrowed Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande s lead to just one or two points 27  for Sarko  28 29  for Hollande though voters still have Hollande then prevailing in a run off  56 44  National Front candidate Marine Le Pen remains in third at 17   However  Ms  Le Pen faces a big challenge in just getting on the ballot as she is falling short thus far and has until March 16 to meet the requirement of submitting 500 signatures of supporters among mayors and other local officials  with the signatures to be made public  And therein lies the sticking point For his part  Sarkozy is projecting himself as a man of the people  going back to the formula that first made him successful   When you love France  you tell the truth to the French   he told a crowd of 10 000 in Marseilles  Wife Carla Bruni is being featured prominently in the campaign and I ve seen tons of photos where she is careful to be seen giving him an adoring eye  or laying her head on his shoulder Actually  I don t dislike Sarko  I just wanted Le Pen to be in the thick of things to make it all more interesting and I really did believe she would upset the president and gain the run off against Hollande  whereupon she d get her clock cleaned But what is amazing about French politics is just how close the voters were to electing Dominique Strauss Kahn  the presumptive Socialist standard bearer before he was charged with rape in New York while leading the International Monetary Fund  This week he was held by police for questioning in a prostitution ring before being released  According to police  Strauss Kahn had some connection to sex parties at luxury hotels in the city of Lille  Messing around with prostitutes is legal in France  but supplying them to others isn t  He could be called back for further questioning in March Australia  Big story here  On Monday  Australia s ruling party is holding a Labor leadership vote on Monday with former prime minister  and just resigned foreign minister  Kevin Rudd  going up against current Prime Minister Julia Gillard  Rudd resigned under pressure from  faceless men  and senior ministers in the party  as he put it  saying he could only serve if he had the confidence of the prime minister  Gillard is confident she will win and remain in office until the next election  2013 It was Gillard and her supporters who ousted Rudd in a coup in 2010  I can t say I follow Aussie politics as closely as  say  Russia  but Rudd always struck me as being superior to Gillard  Both  however  have a solid record of achievement  I mean for crying out loud  Australia is far from a basket case  which is what makes the political drama all the more interesting Venezuela  President Hugo Chavez shook up the country again in announcing he needed further cancer surgery after doctors discovered a lesion during medical tests in Cuba  Last year he had two operations to remove a cancerous tumor from his pelvis  The lesion is in the same area  Chavez told the nation in a television address it was a small lesion that hadn t metastasized  So will Chavez even be in any shape to sustain a high energy campaign for re election  the vote taking place in October  You also have to wonder just how loyal those around him will be if they sense he could be defeated due to his medical condition  Do they oust him and put up another candidate to save their jobs  There s only one problem with that scenario  Chavez controls everything  Those behind him are hardly well known among the people Argentina  The nation is in mourning over a horrible commuter train crash that killed 49  The conductor appeared to be struggling with the brakes when the train  loaded with 1 200 passengers  slammed into a metal barrier as it hurtled uncontrollably until it met the end of the line  You can imagine the scene as the victims  packed into the first two cars to get ahead of the rush hour crowds on arrival  were squeezed into each other  461 were hospitalized  The conductor motorman  survived the crash  The train had just left the shop a day before and was said to be in good order Mexico  Just another week in this killing field  44 died in a prison riot that it turns out was cover for a massive jailbreak by members of the deadly gang  the Zetas  30 Zetas henchmen escaped from the maximum security prison during the fighting  Prison guards were clearly complicit  for starters  All of those killed were from the Zetas  rival  the Gulf cartel  The two are at war for control of part of the drug trade and other criminal enterprises And in the city of Monterrey  which you ll recall up until about a year ago was a relatively peaceful  thriving industrial city where Major League Baseball used to hold an annual game  five taxi drivers were gunned down with assault rifles as they waited for passengers in the mid morning  It turns out the Zetas and Gulf cartels are battling over Monterrey India  Talk about a disgrace  a safety panel in India said 15 000 people die annually while crossing railroad tracks

122056,343571,NYT,Why Gold and Silver Miners are Attractive Today,opinion,We ve never been big believers in owning gold and silver  Warren Buffett s comment  most recently in his 2011 letter released on Saturday  that all the gold in the world could be exchanged for  all U S  cropland  400 million acres with output of about  200 billion annually   plus 16 Exxon Mobils   with  1 trillion left over is one of the more eloquent ways to describe the value of gold  It is one of those commodities whose value is derived from the expectation that others will pay even more for it  most gold is expensively mined  moved and buried again in a vault somewhere  It seems a wasted effort But we take the world as we find it rather than as it should be  Developed country governments are providing more reasons to be suspicious of fiat money  and the notion that the solution to excessive debt is steady currency debasement is not easily dismissed  The New York Times noted on Monday that interest expense on the Federal debt is roughly where it was in 2006 even though the debt outstanding has doubled  the government is setting its own interest rates at levels too low to provide a real return to savers  and as such the budget s sensitivity to higher interest rates is more acute  If the Federal Reserve does ever raise rates their analysis will need to incorporate the increased fiscal drag of higher interest expense  perhaps resulting in negative real rates for longer than might otherwise be the case  And the latest LTRO operation by the ECB has created another 500BN Euros or so of liquidity  So it s not difficult to construct a dark   inflationary outlook That s not our central view  though it is a real possibility  But you don t need to be an extreme gold bull to find value in mining stocks  Coeur D Alene  CDE  is a name we ve owned  in small to modest size depending on valuation  for a couple of years  They are one of the few pure silver miners around  although gold is becoming an increasing percentage of their output  Silver is an interesting metal in that it has highly inelastic supply and demand  Most silver is produced from non silver mines  so silver supply is driven by the price of nickel  copper or whatever is the primary output of a given mine  Demand is similarly inelastic because silver is a vital but tiny input into many manufacturing processes from consumer electronics to medical products  So the price has to absorb changes in supply and demand  making it very volatile  Around 50  of silver demand is for commercial use Gold has less industrial demand and  investment   i e  speculation  has been growing  Figures from GFMS  used in some research published by JPMorgan  reveal that gold jewelry demand has still barely rebounded from its 2008 trough of 1 800 tons  2012 estimates are 2 120 tons compared with 2001 demand of 3 000 tons   The big swing factor remains speculation  around a third of 2011 demand   But mining stocks appear quite attractively priced relative to bullion and are an interesting investment even if you re not bullish on gold silver  Using CDE s proved reserves of 51 million silver ounces and 830K in gold ounces and assuming modest decreases in capex from 2012 guidance  3  annual increases in extraction costs and current prices values the company at  30  around its current price  We think of this as our Downside Case  In the Upside Case   if all their probable reserves were successfully mined the same analysis results in a  50 price  CDE is cheap to the NPV of its likely production assuming no new discoveries  They also represent a levered way to invest in gold and silver because if precious metal prices rise their operating leverage will result in more quickly increasing profits  They may even start returning cash to shareholders through a dividend at some point  and because CDE never hedges it makes valuing the stock and managing an investor s risk simpler CDE is not unique  Gold and silver miners have generally been lagging precious metals  and the last six months is a case in point  For similar reasons we also think GDX is an attractive investment  Even an investor who s not totally convinced that governments are about to inflate away our savings can find something to like in precious metal mining stocks ,2012-03-01,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-gold-and-silver-miners-are-attractive-today-115537,115537
122057,343572,NYT,Momentum   Friend or Foe ,opinion,I must admit to  analysis fatigue    the kind where if anybody mentions the LTRO  Greece or  money on the sidelines  as arguments for how nice the world is working out I will do something drastic    like switching to supporting Arsenal or even worse  Manchester United   For the record I support QPR   sad but true   The role of an economist and analysis team like ours at Saxo Bank is not to be right about our predictions  it is simply to question the status quo to make people think outside the box however uncomfortable it is in light of the current market paradigm  Right now  the consensus is that momentum is unstoppable  what with all of the free money and extending and pretending as far as the eye can see  But I join the wise old baseball coach Earl Weaver in stating that momentum is only as good as the next day s starting pitcher   in other words  it only exists if it can keep on going tomorrow  Let me point out a few obvious concerns about the validity of the current  momentum   Energy prices are high   higher than the high of the Arab Spring last winter in as measured by Brent crude  the benchmark for the majority of the world s oil supplies  Brent is at a record price in Euros and Sterling  in fact  And the average gasoline price in the US  which has a high weighting in the consumer sentiment index  has broken  4 00 per gallon in California while the front contract future as been below is again on a steep rise There are several ways the higher gasoline and energy prices impact the economy the quick and dirty version is through diminished spending power  higher inflation and sentiment  For a more elaborate take  the International Business Times have nice read  Soaring Gasoline Prices   The elevated energy prices have already led some of my colleagues to adjust down their full year US growth from in excess of 2 0  to 1 5  Right now  the Bloomberg consensus estimate among economists is for the US to grow  2 20  this year  and for Brent to average  118 and the main US benchmark  WTI   108 through 2012  We are already exceeding the average price before the driving and A C seasons start in earnest  raising concerns on the prospects for growth There is also some divergence from the much touted Citigroup Surprise Index  CESI  which most of the momentum people used to explain the  better than expected US economy  less than one month ago   Saxo Bank have called for a partly repeat of 2011 seasonal pattern in 2012 from the economic indicators   at least in terms of CESI we are on the right track CESI tends to mean revert around zero   the high was three weeks ago  and it s now reversing down  We expect this move to continue down but less than last year as our prefered leading indicator  Consumer Metrics is predicting a much slower reversal this year than last In other words  Yes  it will be a bit like last year  but the average will be better  though tomorrow s starting pitcher may prove that there is no such thing as momentum in this economy  particularly given the drag from energy prices Geopolitical risk on the rise  Plenty of tail risks to considerThe  in China starts this week end  Expect a lower GDP forecast  and focus on social  Harmony   The key date is Monday where the PM delivers his  state of the union  speech  It is still one of our key macro economic premises that where China goes  the world follows    if Putin fails to secure his Presidency in the first round it will be seen as an extreme sign of weakness  Also watch the demonstrations called for the same night as the election ends  This could be a game changer for Russia  On my recent trip to Moscow I got a feeling things are about to change towards openness  this time talk is not enough and Putin increasingly seems to acknowledge this  That could be the big catalyst for using a WTO entry and more open markets to fight the ultimate tax  corruption  Let s hope so Iran  The IAEA s report from its visit to Iran should be out soon  It was expected end of this week  There is increased strong talk and yesterday New York Times Op Ed from    was clearly a leaked piece to warn Iran and to make President Obama aware that Israel feels pressured and that it is running out of time  We also have a so called  election  in Iran this week end  in which the true opposition has been barred from running  It s funny to read we already today know the voting turnout is going to be 64   but the overall situation is grave  too grave for my liking as the world has less than 2  spare capacity in oil production Geopolitical risk is a  tail risk   low odds  but with very high impact  and not a base case prediction  But it concerns me greatly that the  conflict zones  are increasing week by week while the economy increasingly faces the down sizing of global public sectors combined with elevated energy prices  Let s hope tomorrow s starting pitcher shows up to pitch a heck of a game   but I m concerned that momentum is more about herding behaviour in this market rather than a reflection of robust prospects ,2012-03-02,Saxo

122098,343613,NYT,Week in Review Part I  Europe  Washington and Wall Street,opinion,Some European officials and leaders were patting themselves on the back this week  like European Central Bank President Mario Draghi  who told us all that the actions he took are loosening the credit markets and that there are  tentative signs  of stabilization in the region s economy  though he did have to admit  substantial downside risks remain  and he s frankly lying about the credit aspect  What we don t have  yet  are bank runs and that is good  German Chancellor Angela Merkel is all excited about her new fiscal union  saying after a meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy that the rules will be agreed to by end of January  or at the latest March  per the December Brussels agreement And Italy and Spain had decent debt auctions  though at the end of the week  Spain s 10 year bond had a yield of 5 23   up from yearend   while Italy s was at 6 73   Nonetheless  the yields on the shorter paper being offered were indeed better than December s picture OK  that s the sort of good news  And now the bad Standard   Poor s downgraded France and Austria  taking away their AAA ratings  leaving Germany as the euro area s only stable AAA grade  France and Austria were cut one level to AA   meaning all of the citizens have to change the sticker on the back bumper of their car  They no longer get a free tow  but they are admitted into AA meetings with a reserved parking spot Finland  the Netherlands and Luxembourg kept their AAA ratings  but were placed on negative watch  which means a hidden camera follows your every move and if you screw up  you go directly to AA and can t use someone else s name In an accompanying statement  S P said   In our view  the policy initiatives taken by European policy makers in recent weeks may be insufficient to fully address ongoing systemic stresses in the euro zone  Now to be fair  just as was the case with the U S  last August when our sovereign debt was downgraded  market reaction on Friday was muted  But it is in no way a good thing  either  and you never know when these moves will bite you in the butt  At least the ratings agencies are giving proper notice and the market is no longer shocked by such actions Elsewhere  you had this headline on Friday  Greek debt restructuring talks collapse    an unexpected breakdown that makes it more likely Athens will become the first government of a developed country in more than 60 years to suffer a full scale default on its debt  I get a kick out of those who have been pooh poohing a Greek default as the focus turned to Italy  It would be a disaster  and not just for the Greek people  Greece must get their act together in a matter of weeks in order to ensure they get the first tranche of a second bailout package that was supposed to total 110 billion euro  Billionaire George Soros said Europe s sovereign debt crisis is  more serious  than the financial crisis of 2008 and that the world faces the prospect of a  vicious circle  of deflation Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti  who saw his country downgraded two notches  warned that Italians would turn hostile if they do not see the austerity measures they have accepted lead to progress  both economically and fiscally   If the Italians do not see concrete rewards for their willingness to save and reform  there will be protests in Italy against Europe and also against Germany which is seen as ringleader of EU intolerance and against the European Central Bank  Spain  also downgraded two notches  and despite its successful debt auction  has massive problems  not the least being its 23  unemployment rate  Now new Prime Minster Mariano Rajoy has to backstop his regions  think Catalonia  Valencia  Andalusia  that have massive debts of their own  Four of them  the aforementioned three plus Madrid  have been shut out of the debt markets yet need to repay  11 5 billion to lenders this year  Spain s 17 regions have total debt of  175 billion Europe  just as in the U S   also has a massive pension issue  According to Bloomberg  state funded obligations in 19 of the European Union nations are over  39 trillion as of 2009  five times higher than their combined gross debt  Talk about unsustainable  particularly when any kind of return on the assets is so hard to come by in this era of zero interest rates  Europe s pension fund managers  just like in the U S   can only do one thing  take more risk  It s insane    You end up going from one bubble to the next All of the above problems are still front and center while Merkel and Sarkozy have done nothing about increasing the so called firewall for the likes of Italy and Spain  whether it s the European Financial Stability Fund or the coming European Stability Mechanism   Plus the latest downgrades hurt the EFSF  for starters   The only thing they seem to agree on is a financial transactions tax  but Britain is vehemently opposed to that unless the rest of the world is subject to it Back to Italy  consumer confidence hit a 16 year low in December as Fitch Ratings stated   Italy is the front line of this crisis   Fitch also raising the issue of insufficient firewalls Ireland is going to need another bailout unless it s given a break on the interest rates it has to pay on its bailout of Anglo Irish Bank  currently 8  The ECB  in cutting its growth forecast for the eurozone to 0 3  for 2012  offered the coming recession  won t be a deep one   to which I have two comments  If the ECB is correct  it won t do much good if the ensuing growth is tepid  And  the ECB and its ilk never take into consideration the reaction of the people to a recession during a time of severe austerity  It won t be good Germany  despite all the glowing talk about its economy  is projected to have contracted 0 25  in the fourth quarter   Germany also sold six month treasury bills at a negative yield for the first time  You think this is good  Think again Mohamed El Erian   Financial Times Another day and another previously unthinkable development becomes reality in Europe  Yet what on the surface appears to be good news for Germany   the record low yield at its latest government debt auction   is actually an indication of growing stress elsewhere in the region  German rejoicing for borrowing money at negative rates should thus be tempered by the reality of Europe experiencing an accelerating disengagement of the private sector from the region s economic integration project  This undermines growth and employment  shifts more of the load to taxpayers  and places even greater demands on creditor and debtor countries alike   all serving to aggravate an already strained process for agreeing on the appropriate policy response and related burden sharing  At a time of considerable domestic resistance  governments in surplus countries  essentially Germany  but also others such as Finland and the Netherlands   as well as the European Central Bank  will face even greater external pressure to substitute more of their solid balance sheets for the delevering private sector  Meanwhile  debtor countries will be expected to do even more on the austerity front  thereby aggravating internal tensions and sacrificing both actual and potential growth  Rather than welcome negative yields  Germany should interpret the outcome of Monday s auction as further indication of the gravity of the situation facing the eurozone as a whole  It is another alarm bell calling for more forceful steps to improve the region s policy mix  counter banking fragility  and strengthen the institutional underpinning of a  refounded  Europe  Editorial   Wall Street Journal European financial markets have gotten very strange  Greece s one year government bond yield hit 376  yesterday  while Germany  Switzerland and the U K  sold short term debt this week at yields below 0   That means investors are effectively paying the latter governments for the privilege of lending to them  Reuters also reported Monday that blue chip firms like Johnson   Johnson and Pfizer are lending to struggling European banks  turning the usual creditor debtor relationship on its head  At this point  flying saucers over the Eiffel Tower or the Colosseum in Rome wouldn t surprise anyone  There s a serious point here  The longer Europe s crisis lumbers on  the more distortions it creates in credit markets across Europe  not merely in the distressed South  The big uncertainties   will the eurozone break up  will the European Central Bank step in    are causing capital to flee troubled markets for safer shores  But in the financial world  a flight to safety is a clear warning sign for both the trouble spots and the safe havens   The more important implication is that investors are so risk averse that they d rather lose a little money keeping funds with a reasonably solvent national treasury than potentially lose much more in private markets   As for Europe s banks  the fact that they are taking loans from their clients is only one sign of their plight  Before Christmas  the ECB offered banks hundreds of billions in cheap three year loans  but evidence since then suggests that lenders are turning around and parking that cash right back at the central bank  Banks still aren t comfortable lending to each other  and the ECB can only pick up the slack for so long  That means it s still up to the politicians to heed the now almost Biblical warning signs   Plague of locusts  anyone   It is time for Europe s leaders to act more like leaders and less like politicians moving step by step and going nowhere  Lastly  Mahathir Mohamad  former long time prime minister of Malaysia  1981 2003  and frequent target of the likes of George Soros  had some telling thoughts in a Financial Times op ed  The Malays have a saying which inter alia means that when you lose your way  go back to the beginning and start again  I believe that everyone has lost their way in handling the current financial crisis  The West in particular needs to rethink some essentials  The world is still Eurocentric  how Europe handles the financial crisis is of universal importance  But I have serious doubts about Europeans  infallibility   I particularly dislike their double standards  Centuries of hegemony have convinced them they know best what is good for the world  their values are to be accepted as universal  Asian values are deemed irrelevant  This explains the simplistic solutions offered to East Asian countries when currency traders impoverished them  Malaysia was told to raise interest rates  have a surplus budget  allow distressed banks and businesses to go bankrupt  etc  This was the formula for all  Yet when America and Europe faced their financial crisis  they did everything they told Malaysia and East Asia not to do   For a long while Europe s manufactured products lined the shelves of the world s markets  They monopolized and dominated world trade and business  Their people enjoyed the highest standards of living  But after the Second World War Japan industrialized and produced cheaper yet quality goods  Then Taiwan  South Korea and China got in on the act  Rapidly the Europeans lost their markets  Unable to compete  the Europeans and particularly the Americans opted for the financial markets  Inventing new financial products such as short selling of shares and currencies  subprime lending  securitization  leveraged investments through hedge funds and a multitude of others  they apparently continued to grow and prosper  But the finance market spins off no real businesses  created hardly any jobs and gave rise to no trade  Getting greedy  they abused the system  manipulating the market for greater profits  In Hong Kong in 1997 I spoke at the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and I blamed the financial crisis in East Asia on currency trading  I told them currencies were not commodities and should not be traded  But the World Bank and IMF did not care  They even accorded currency traders such rights as not having to be transparent and not paying taxes  We concluded that their recommendation would bankrupt us and make us dependent on their loans  I was condemned for my criticism of currency trading  But the exploitation and abuses of the financial market could not last forever  In 2008 the bubble burst  Banks  insurance companies  investment funds and even countries went bankrupt  But for its position as the currency for trade settlements  the dollar would be worth almost nothing  Just as in the East Asian countries earlier  America and Europe became poor  The refusal to accept their impoverishment has resulted in their refusal to accept austerity measures  Their people demonstrate and go on strike against the measures  This simply aggravates matters  Asian countries behaved differently  When they became poor because of the devaluation of their currencies they lived within their means  Malaysia opted to fix its exchange rate   We were told our economy could collapse  that no one would lend us money  and we were warned of dire consequences  But nothing like that happened  Malaysia recovered faster than the rest   The only way for the European economies to recover is to admit that they are now poor and live within their means  Then they must go back to doing real business  i e   to produce goods and sell services  Many financial products should be strictly regulated if not banned  Mahathir wants a new global system with a trading currency based on gold  against which all others would be valued  Fluctuation would be minimal  Banks should be better regulated and new rules made to prevent excessive leveraging  limit loans and stop subprime lending  The financial system should be standardized and should support real business   There can be no return to the status quo ante  Europeans have to accept the days of Eurocentricism are practically over  Europe must look to the East as well for solutions  I don t disagree with any of the above  We did this all to ourselves  and without leadership will continue to do so  Washington and Wall StreetThis was a week in which the economic numbers and one key earnings report were not that great  December retail sales were up just 0 1   down ex autos   less than expected  jobless claims suddenly spiked up after weeks of good news on this front  and JPMorgan Chase s earnings  though generally in line  were hardly the stuff of building a rally around  Trading in the investment bank division was off big With the start of the fourth quarter s earnings season in earnest this coming week  it s important to note that one estimate has S P 500 earnings rising 7 2  over year ago levels  but then only 3 0  in the current quarter  The estimate for the fourth quarter back in October was 14 5   So they ve been coming down  That said  for all of 2012 earnings are expected to rise 10 7  to  106 67 for the S P  The index closed the week at 1289  That s a multiple of 12  or a market that s undervalued historically if you believe the economy is going to grow at a 2 0  to 2 5  pace  and that Europe remains fairly stable and war doesn t break out with Iran  etc I ve never felt in this current cycle the market was overvalued  I just continue to believe exogenous events will change sentiment for the worse  perhaps in a big way And a note on housing  which along with jobs is the key to any sustained recovery  RealtyTrac reports 3 5 million homeowners are seriously delinquent on their mortgages  though bulls point to 1 9 million hit with default or foreclosure in 2011 vs  2 9 million in 2010  But until we clear the 3 5 million or thereabouts  prices certainly aren t going to bottom  let alone rise As to the federal and budget deficits  the Treasury Dept  reported that the latter came in at  86 billion for December and stands at  322 billion for the first three months of the fiscal year  commencing Oct  1  That s  47 billion less than last year But before you buy the biggest goose in the window in celebration  understand the Congressional Budget Office estimates the deficit for fiscal 2012 will still come in at  973 billion  which would place it fourth worst in history behind the  1 trillion  of the first three years of the Obama administration  Further  if Congress extends the payroll tax holiday for the full year  as well as unemployment benefits  and doesn t pay for it all  we re back over  1 trillion  As for the federal deficit  the long term picture remains dreadful Monday morning  USA TODAY had this lead headline  U S  debt is now equal to economy  The soaring national debt has reached a symbolic tipping point  It s now as big as the entire U S  economy  The amount of money the federal government owes to its creditors  combined with IOUs to government retirement and other programs  now tops  15 23 trillion  That s roughly equal to the value of all goods and services the U S  economy produces in one year   15 17 trillion as of September  the latest estimate  Private projections show the economy likely grew to about  15 3 trillion by December   a level the debt is likely to surpass this month    The 100  mark means that your entire debt is as big as everything you re producing in your country   says Steve Bell of the Bipartisan Policy Center  which has proposed cutting nearly  6 trillion in red ink over 10 years   Clearly  that can t continue   Long term projections suggest the debt will continue to grow faster than the economy  which would have to expand by at least 6  a year to keep pace    Richard Wolf The other week  economist Paul Krugman wrote some of the following from his perch at the New York Times  In 2011  as in 2010  America was in a technical recovery but continued to suffer from disastrously high unemployment  And through most of 2011  as in 2010  almost all the conversation in Washington was about something else  the allegedly urgent issue of reducing the budget deficit  This misplaced focus said a lot about our political culture  in particular about how disconnected Congress is from the suffering of ordinary Americans  But it also revealed something else  when people in D C  talk about deficits and debt  by and large they have no idea what they re talking about   and the people who talk the most understand the least  Krugman points to how the experts have been wrong  such as in interest rates keep going down  which shouldn t happen if we have such a debt problem  My own point has never been about the immediate level of rates  but rather that the debt level is simply unsustainable and at some point market sentiment will turn on a dime given there is no evidence  a la the above  that we are about to enter an era of 4  5  and 6 percent growth for an extended period of time Experts such as economist Kenneth Rogoff have also carefully examined history and any time a nation s debt level has reached 90  of GDP  a prolonged period of stagnation  at best  followed Erskine Bowles  of Simpson Bowles debt commission fame  has said time and time again  I think we face the most predictable economic crisis in our history  Krugman s analysis is insane to believe debt levels don t matter  Even he concedes he  doesn t mean that the debt is harmless   So yes  debt matters   he writes   But right now  other things matter more  We need more  not less  government spending to get us out of our unemployment trap  And the wrongheaded  ill informed obsession with debt is standing in the way  You re wrong  Professor Krugman  The markets  sooner than later  will prove this to you and your ilk  They ve already been doing so in Europe  We need both austerity and a growth package  true tax reform  but the former must dwarf the latter to prove to investors around the globe that we are serious   Then you will see a boom like no other in recent times as capital floods into the United States It s just that there s been zero cause for optimism on this front because Congress is so helplessly dysfunctional and corrupt  The likes of Congressman Paul Ryan and Senator Tom Coburn are few and far between Lastly  to further depress all of you  the World Economic Forum  ahead of its annual affair in Davos  Switzerland at the end of the month  assembled a panel of experts to discuss the biggest risks facing the globe  The chief one is  severe income inequality   Another is  chronic government debt   Prof  Krugman  And the report worries about  the dark side of connectivity  with its threat of  devastating cyber attacks  As reported by Tim Weber of BBC News  Population growth and scarce resources  especially water  are identified by the report as being among the world s biggest problems    And  the report speaks of  seeds of dystopia  in a world where  for the first time in generations  many people no longer believe that their children will grow up to enjoy a higher standard of living than theirs   according to Lee Howell of the WEF  Nationalism  populism and protectionism could be the result  undoing what the forum describes as  the progress that globalization has brought   But as Weber reports   One of the most devastating threats is also one of the least predictable  The report notes that our  daily lives are almost entirely dependent on connected online systems   which had brought the world huge economic benefits and personal freedoms   However  the same technologies also had a  dark side   helping to organize the riots in London and providing the ability to  unleash devastating cyber attacks remotely and anonymously   The complexity of a world with six billion connected devices was  completely mind boggling   said  Steve  Wilson   chief risk officer for general insurance at Zurich   For governments  societies and businesses  it had become both  difficult to understand the complexity and how to manage its risks   Cyber attacks were not a risk  but a daily occurrence  he argued  while  systems that we thought mitigate risk are actually concentrating risk  and these are risks that we do not fully understand yet

122099,343614,NYT,Greek Default Looking Likely,opinion,I wish that I had an  aha moment  to share with you today  but instead all I have is an  ack moment  to share   As I was analyzing all of the info coming out of Europe in recent days  I came to the following realization   Ack  They are actually going to let Greece default    The only question is whether it is going to be an orderly default or a disorderly default   Of course the EU  led by Germany  could save Greece financially if it wanted to   But Germany has decided against that course of action   Many in the German government are sick and tired of pouring bailouts into Greece and then watching Greek politicians fail to fully implement the austerity measures that were agreed upon   At this point a lot of German politicians are talking as if a Greek default is a foregone conclusion    For example  Michael Fuchs  the deputy leader of Angela Merkel s political party  recently made the following statement   I don t think that Greece  in its current condition  can be saved    But that is not entirely accurate   Greece could be saved  but the Germans don t want to make the deep financial sacrifices necessary to save Greece   So instead they are going to let Greece default Many prominent voices in the financial world that have been watching all of this play out are now openly declaring the Greece is about to default   Moritz Kraemer  the head of S P s European sovereign ratings unit  made the following statement on Bloomberg Television on Monday   Greece will default very shortly  Whether there will be a solution at the end of the current rocky negotiations I cannot say  You might want to go back and read that again One of the top officials at one of the top credit rating agencies in the world publicly declared on television that  Greece will default very shortly  That should chill you to your bones If the EU allows Greece to default  that would be a signal to investors that the EU would allow Italy  Spain and Portugal to all default someday too Confidence in the bonds of those countries would disintegrate and bond yields would go through the roof Right now  confidence in government debt is one of the things holding up the fragile global financial system   Governments must be able to borrow gigantic piles of very cheap money for the system to keep going  and once confidence is gone it is going to be incredibly difficult to rebuild it That is why a Greek default  whether orderly or disorderly  is so dangerous   Investors all over the world would be wondering who is next At the end of last week  negotiations between the Greek government and private holders of Greek debt broke down   Negotiations are scheduled to resume Wednesday  and there is a lot riding on them The Greek government desperately needs private bondholders to agree to accept a  voluntary haircut  of 50  or more   Not that such a  haircut  will enable the Greek government to avoid a default   It would just enable them to kick the can down the road a little farther But if Greece is able to get a 50  haircut from private investors  then why shouldn t Italy  Spain  Portugal and Ireland all get one Once you start playing the haircut game  it is hard to stop it and it rapidly erodes confidence in the financial system This point was beautifully made in a recent article by John Mauldin         So our problem country goes to its lenders and says   We think you should share our pain  We are only going to pay you back 50  of what we owe you  and you must let us pay a 4  interest rate and pay you over a longer period  We think we can do that  Oh  and give us some more money in the meantime  And if you refuse  we won t pay you anything and you will all have a banking crisis  Thanks for everything      The difficult is that if our problem country A gets to cut its debt by 50   what about problem countries B  C  and D  Do they get the same deal  Why would voters in one country expect any less  if you agree to such terms for the first country  But if Greece is able to negotiate an  orderly default  with private bondholders  that would be a lot better than a  disorderly default    A disorderly default would cause mass panic throughout the entire global financial system One key moment is coming up in March   In March  14 billion euros of Greek debt is scheduled to come due   If Greece does not receive the next scheduled bailout payment  Greece would default at that time But the EU  the ECB and the IMF are not sure they want to give Greece any more money   There are a whole host of austerity measures that the Greek government agreed to that they have not implemented Since the Greeks have not fully honored their side of the deal  the  troika  is considering cutting off financial aid   The following comes from the New York Times         Officials from the so called troika of foreign lenders to Greece   the European Central Bank  European Union and International Monetary Fund   have come to believe that the country has neither the ability nor the will to carry out the broad economic reforms it has promised in exchange for aid  people familiar with the talks say  and they say they are even prepared to withhold the next installment of aid in March  But the austerity measures that Greece has implemented so far have pushed the Greek economy into a full blown depression   Greece is experiencing a complete and total economic collapse at this point   The following comes from the New York Times         Greece s dire economic condition can hardly be overstated  After two years of tax increases and wage cuts  Greek civil servants have seen their income shrink by 40 percent since 2010  and private sector workers have suffered as well  More than  75 billion has left the country as people move their savings abroad  Some 68 000 businesses closed in 2010  and another 53 000   out of 300 000 still active   are said to be close to bankruptcy  according to a report issued in the fall by the Greek Co Federation of Chambers of Commerce       It s an implosion   it s an endless sequence of implosions from bad to worse  to worse  to worse   said Yanis Varoufakis  an economics professor at the University of Athens and commentator on the Greek economy   There s nothing to stop the Greek economy losing 60 percent of its G D P   given the path it is at  But Greece is not the only one in Europe with major economic problems   The unemployment rate for those under the age of 25 in the EU is an astounding 22 7    And as I have written about previously  there are a whole host of signs that Europe is on the verge of a major recession Greece is just the canary in the coal mine   The truth is that the entire European financial system is in danger of collapsing Yesterday  it was announced that S P has downgraded the European Financial Stability Facility   It is pretty sad when even the European bailout fund is getting downgraded Of course most of you know what happened on Friday by now   Very shortly after U S  financial markets closed  S P downgraded the credit ratings of nine different European nations Only four eurozone nations  Germany  Luxembourg  Finland  and the Netherlands  still have a AAA credit rating from S P But even more importantly  the nightmarish decline of the euro is showing no signs of stopping As I write this  the EUR USD is down to 1 2650   It is hard to believe how fast the EUR USD has fallen  but if a major financial crisis erupts in Europe it is probably going to go down a whole lot more So what happens next Well  if there is a Greek default all hell will break loose in Europe But even if Greece does not default  the coming recession in Europe is going to put an incredible amount of strain on the eurozone Many have been speculating that Greece or Italy could be the first to leave the euro  but actually it may be the strongest members that exit first The number of prominent voices inside Germany that are calling for Germany to leave the euro continues to increase In addition  public opinion in Germany is rapidly turning against the euro   One recent poll found that only 47 percent of Germans were glad that Germany joined the euro  and only 36 percent of Germans want  a more federal Europe  As this crisis continues to unfold  there will probably be even more  ack moments    European leaders have mismanaged this crisis very badly from the start  and there is no reason to believe that they are suddenly going to become much wiser Once again  it is important to emphasize the role that confidence plays in our financial system   The entire global financial system runs on credit   Banks and investors lend out money because they have confidence that they will be paid back   When you take that confidence away  the system does not work Let us hope that the folks over in Europe understand this  because right now we are steamrolling toward a credit crunch that could potentially make 2008 look tame by comparison ,2012-01-17,Michael T.

122101,343616,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Iran  James Blitz   Financial Times   How close is the west getting to all out conflict with Iran  As 2012 gets underway  the question is right at the top of the international security agenda  Hardly a day goes by without some striking news from the region   be it Iran s decision to enrich uranium at a new underground site  or the unexplained killing of another Iranian nuclear scientist  or Iran s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz  The one issue fanning the flames these days is the imposition of sanctions banning oil imports from Iran  and to a lesser extent the new restrictions on Iran s financial institutions  The danger  especially with Iran s Revolutionary Guard conducting naval exercises over the coming weeks in the area of the Strait of Hormuz  is an accident  a miscalculation  even by a rogue element in the Guard  They love to show off their speed boats and pretend they are about to ram a U S  or allied naval vessel  only to turn off at the last minute  But now  with the new threat level  how can U S  naval commanders risk that these same boats aren t on a suicide mission And as I keep saying  going back months  nothing we heard this week on the nuclear weapons front should give the White House or Israel reason to believe Iran is still years away from having the bomb  therefore  my timetable of the administration taking direct action against Iran s suspected sites remains by May   Or Israel will act alone beforehand   Killing scientists  as was the case again this week for a fourth time  or sabotaging the program through computer worms such as Stuxnet  cannot do the job alone of taking down Iran s capabilities But to clean up the facts of the past seven days U S  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner went to Asia to convince China  Japan and South Korea to limit or outright ban Iranian oil imports  Only Japan agreed to pull back in terms of new purchases  though long term contracts will be honored   while South Korea said it will  eventually  once it figures out alternative ways to replace the Iranian crude  China  though  said  forget about it  And on this front  the European Union  which was expected to ban Iranian imports  is now looking to wait up to six months before doing so owing to the importance of the supply to the likes of Spain  Italy and Greece  They  like South Korea  first need to find alternatives  let alone the fact their economies can t afford an oil shock these days  Iran exports 2 3 million barrels per day  the world s third largest exporter  The EU receives somewhere between 400 000 and 450 000 bd  China takes in about 500 000 barrels  Japan 400 000  South Korea 300 000  India 500 000  The Saudis have vowed to make up any difference  and despite some reports you may have seen  have oil comparable to Iran s quality level  Meanwhile  Iran announced it has begun enriching uranium to 20  at a second site  the underground facility known as Fordo  near the holy city of Qom  thus further outraging the likes of the United States and France  as well as even Russia to a lesser extent Understand that getting to 20  is the hard part  Going to the bomb making level of 90  is then relatively easy  When you hear how the West is concerned about a  break out   if we are so lucky to know when this is occurring  it refers to Iran s suddenly going for 90   meaning it would be mere months before they could have the bomb capability   Delivery mechanisms are a separate issue   For all we know  Iran could have broken out on a small scale already  If the West and Israel were convinced Iran was indeed doing so  a strike on the plants is a certainty  and of course this would entail blowback on Western and Israeli interests around the world  This is why stories on Hizbullah and the Revolutionary Guard s presence in Latin America are so important because there are lots of soft targets in the region and would be easy missions to carry out quickly  one can only assume The International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran are to meet on Jan  28 but details on just what inspectors would be able to see are unclear Indeed  the Iranian regime is under siege  A further sign of this is the imposition of a death sentence on 28 year old Amir Hekmati  an Arizona born Iranian American and former U S  Marine that Iran has accused of spying for the CIA  The U S  government categorically denies this  He was arrested in Iran last August while visiting his grandmothers for the first time Iran continues to threaten to close the Strait of Hormuz  a transit point for 20  of the world s crude  The U S  considers this a  red line  and warns Iranian action would merit a response Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  speaking of the pressures  said on Monday   The Islamic establishment knows firmly what it is doing and has chosen its path and will stay the course  Meanwhile  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was gallivanting about in Latin America  spending time with his  dear brother  Hugo Chavez in Venezuela  vowing to work with Chavez to fight imperialism and poverty  Chavez pledged to work with Ahmadinejad to stop the  imperial insanity  of the United States  which he described as a  threat for the world    CNN Syria  President Bashar Assad showed up in public for the first time in six months  telling his supporters  We are going to win   Earlier he said in a speech to parliament that Syria would vanquish the  foreign conspirators with an iron fist  Assad s pronouncements were overwhelmingly condemned in the West and in much of the Arab World  A monitor for the Arab League said Syria didn t carry out any of its commitments previously made to the group and that he had seen  children murdered   extensive examples of torture  and  skinned bodies   It was utter carnage  And this week the first foreign reporter  a Frenchman  was killed  Over 400 have died since the Arab League mission of monitors went in Israel  Defense officials here stated the obvious  that Iran and Hizbullah were arming the Assad regime  while going back to Iran and the nuclear crisis  a London Sunday Times piece suggested that perhaps the best way to tell action against the mullahs is imminent would be if you knew Israel s nuclear reactor at Dimona had been shut down  The Israelis now know that Dimona is vulnerable to Iranian intermediate  and long range missiles  especially those fired from Lebanon or Syria   Deactivating the reactor in the southern Negev desert would minimize the dangers of nuclear fallout in the area  An official told the paper that the shutdown would begin before the launch of any Israeli or U S  assault on Iran s facilities  but that  It takes a long time  many weeks  to cool down a nuclear reactor and lower the level of radioactivity   as one of the founders of Israel s nuclear program put it I didn t realize that  separately  Dimona is the second oldest active reactor in the world and is deemed  dangerous  by many experts  One said it  should have been closed a long time ago   On a different topic  an Israeli group  Peace Now  which is opposed to settlement construction  said construction on more than 1 850 West Bank units was started in 2011  up 20  from 2010 s 1 550  Needless to say the Palestinians voiced outrage And in a late development  a Foreign Policy expose published at week s end claims Mossad officers have been posing as CIA officers to recruit operatives against Iran s nuclear program  This has infuriated the U S  The Mossad officers are equipped with U S  passports and dollars  and recruited  under the nose of U S  intelligence officers   including in London  In response  the U S  has scaled back joint U S  Israeli intelligence operations  The timing is poor   Jerusalem Post Pakistan  As one of my predictions for 2012  I said a coup here was a  layup   Heck  by the time you read this something could have happened  President Zardari flew to Dubai for a check up on his health issue  as some felt this was a sign a coup was in the works  The military does not seek a coup  They don t want to have to deal with the domestic issues that would come with power  at least at this moment  But in many respects it is being forced on them  Prime Minister Gilani sacked the defense secretary this week for  gross misconduct and illegal action  in an attempt to reassert authority  though at the same time  Gilani has said he would step down if that would diffuse tension  However  the leading opposition figure  Nawiz Sharif  is not favored by the military either  Thus far  General Kayani  the overall military chief who was once a friend to the United States  has held off on making a move but the military did warn of  grievous consequences  for Gilani s action to sack the defense chief Meanwhile  the Army has its hands full with the Taliban  with 25 members of the army or paramilitary police units being killed in separate attacks  The Taliban has killed 9 000 civilian or security personnel in Pakistan since 2009  Separately  a bomb blast at a bus terminal along the Afghan border killed 29 Lastly  former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has vowed to return between Jan  27 and 30 and run for office  even though the current government said he would be arrested in connection with the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  Musharraf s return will not be helpful Afghanistan  I have nothing to say on the actions of the four Marines who desecrated some Taliban bodies  other than that the four deserve to be punished according to the rules of the military  Kuwait  In case you were wondering  the United States now has 15 000 soldiers here  including two brigade combat teams and a combat aviation brigade  according to Defense News  so there is a fairly adequate presence in the region if needed  one larger than was normal since the first Gulf War  In the event of conflict with Iran  the first mission is to protect these troops from retaliatory strikes China Taiwan  By the time the vast majority of you read this  the presidential election results on Taiwan will be known  they are supposed to come out 4 5 hours after I post   Disturbingly  President Ma had only a slim lead over Tsai Ing wen  your editor having a big financial stake in stability and further economic progress between the mainland and Taiwan and a Ma loss would be disastrous  Tsai is attempting to become the island s first female president  but the fear is her party  the DPP  is historically independence minded and you know what that would mean to Beijing To give you an idea of how things have changed  180 000 Taiwanese businesspeople were expected to fly back home to cast their votes because the election is so close  Washington  by the way  agrees with Beijing on this one  They too want a Ma victory  Taiwanese investment in China rose to  12 2 billion in 2010 On two other topics  similar to the story above on Hong Kong  pollution levels in Beijing are as bad as they were prior to the Olympics  The smog has been so thick many days this winter that road travel  let alone the air variety  has been severely disrupted  In an unusual move  though  the Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection admitted that the U S  Embassy s pollution readings were more accurate than theirs and they have begun sharing data And in a story from the South China Morning Post we learn   Almost 80 percent of women interviewed said they would not consider a man who earned less than  600 a month   or as the reporter Stephen Chen put it   Women marry for money and houses  while men wed for passion and looks   according to a nationwide survey  Now discuss amongst yourselves North Korea  Kim Jong Un celebrated a birthday on Sunday  No doubt it isn t really his  but it fit the calendar and ongoing plan to burnish the kid s credentials  A documentary of the  military genius  aired the same day  one showing him driving a tank  where he looked like Michael Dukakis   sitting in the cockpit of a plane and interacting with soldiers  Reuters did report that Pyongyang was holding talks with Japan  though these were taking place in Beijing  this as nuclear negotiators from China and South Korea were meeting to discuss the impasse over the North s weapons program  A separate report said the North would be willing to halt its uranium enrichment operation if the United States would increase its food assistance  We could probably just ship them excess Hostess products that have aged appropriately Myanmar  China can t like what it sees going on here  The government  nominally under civilian control with the military calling the shots  released dozens of high profile political prisoners on Friday  including a former head of intelligence  journalists and monks  as the rulers seem committed to democratic reform  The release of the detainees is an important condition set forth by the European Union and the U S  in order for sanctions against the regime to be lifted   Secretary of State Hillary Clinton immediately responded in kind by announcing the two nations will exchange ambassadors  though it s a lengthy process and the U S  is not lifting sanctions without further confidence building measures  Washington hasn t had an ambassador in Burma since 1990  An April 1 election for 48 parliamentary seats is to take place with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on the ballot  This could be one of the surprise success stories of 2012 As for Beijing  the rulers obviously don t want their own people getting too many ideas Russia  With less than two months to go before the March 4 presidential election  it still seems likely Vladimir Putin  despite all the protests  will capture more than 50  of the vote and avoid a run off  Granted  the actual vote tally may be 35  but through the magic of the Sorcerer Many say this wouldn t be too smart  such outright manipulation after last December s fraudulent Duma vote Separately  the director of Russia s space agency suggested in an interview that the disabled Russian spacecraft that is headed back to Earth this weekend  wear a helmet  failed because it was struck by some kind of anti satellite weapon What was to have been a 2   year mission to explore a moon of Mars failed shortly after takeoff    Back then  as reported by the New York Times  Andrew E  Kramer   A retired commander of Russia s missile warning system had speculated that strong radar signals from installations in Alaska might have damaged the spacecraft   The space agency director  however  did appear to choose his words carefully and wasn t blaming the United States directly while conceding the spacecraft s equipment  may have broken down while the vehicle was stored on the ground   waiting for the right time for the Earth and Mars to line up before proceeding with the mission Nigeria  There were further killings of Christians  including an attack on a bar that killed at least 8  Remind me not to travel to Nigeria for a beer So the Christians  tired of being killed for holding their beliefs  stormed a mosque in southern Nigeria and killed five  Since Christmas Day  at least 85 deaths have been recorded in the sectarian violence Meanwhile  the nation ground to a halt due to a general strike over the elimination of a fuel subsidy  which led to a doubling in fuel prices  President Goodluck Jonathan said the subsidy was economically unsustainable  Protests were suspended a few days to allow for talks with officials  The strikes

122103,343618,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Iran  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  who has been largely silent lately when it comes to the latest nuclear standoff with the West  owing in part to his travels to Latin America  said on Thursday that he was ready to restart talks with the Group of Five plus one  the five permanent members of the U N  Security Council plus Germany   but this is all part of Iran s four corners offense  or stall game  Iran will never give up uranium enrichment so any talks  like the first two rounds  would go nowhere  Given Iran s increasingly desperate situation with its economy in collapse  however  Iran needs to lower the heat if at all possible  On Sunday  the International Atomic Energy Agency is to launch a mission to Tehran and the key here will be just how much the Iranians want to reveal and whether the IAEA will be able to announce conclusively that Iran is determined to build the bomb  Iran will speak volumes by its actions  or inaction  Will it grant the IAEA access to suspected sites  for example On the issue of the increased sanctions being levied by the United States and the European Union  they are indeed having a serious impact  There is a currency crisis in Iran with the citizenry rightfully concerned its wages and savings are becoming worthless  the rial having declined at least 50  in just a few weeks vs  the dollar  Many Iranians are converting what funds they have into gold  or even crossing the border into Iraq to obtain dollars  The U S  and the EU want to bring Iran s economy to its knees in the hopes of toppling the regime  while Iran is threatening to preempt the EU s oil embargo  the EU imports 450 000 barrels of Iranian oil a day  or 20  of Iran s total exports   slated for six months from now  by refusing to sell to the likes of Greece  Spain  Italy and Portugal any Iranian oil before these countries can find alternatives  the purpose of the six month EU delay  Iran has also said it still intends to retaliate for the recent assassination of one of its nuclear scientists  And they continue to threaten to close the Strait of Hormuz  through which 20  of the world s oil flows every day  this as the United States  France and Britain moved six warships thru the Strait in a rather impressive show of force  One U S  aircraft carrier has more striking power than the entire Iranian air force So I just listed a mouthful  But there s more  Washington extended sanctions to Iran s 3rd largest bank  while the EU froze assets of Iran s Central Bank  Russia  on the other hand  is against sanctions and wants talks  while China  which currently receives 557 000 barrels of oil a day from Iran  is also against sanctions but  significantly  is urging Iran not to build nukes It all boils down to this  Is Iran close to a  break out   where it becomes clear they are enriching uranium from the current 20  to the 90  needed for weapons grade material  a process that could take only weeks  would Iran take this risk today and hope over time the sanctions  impact on the economy is lessened  will Israel  and or the United States  run out of patience and decide to act because of intelligence they are receiving that Iran is too close for comfort  and does the U S  election cycle impact President Obama s decision making Of course regarding this last point  the November election is critical to any decision Obama makes  You have seen in the past few weeks all manner of reports that Washington is urging Israel to let sanctions play out in the hopes of toppling the regime without the U S  having to act in tandem with the Israelis    But how much longer can Israel stand pat  Israel s envoy to the United Nations on Tuesday called for further international action  Never has it been so clear Iran is seeking to build a nuclear weapon   Ambassador Ron Prosor said   Now is the time to act  Tomorrow is too late  The stakes are too high  The price of inaction is too great  David Sanger   New York Times  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu s government may calculate that if Israel is going to attempt a strike  doing so during the presidential campaign  when it would have the sympathy of many American voters  is the only way to avoid a major backlash from Mr  Obama  with whom Mr  Netanyahu has a tense relationship  Elliot Abrams  President George W  Bush s hawkish Middle East adviser  wrote recently that if Israel attacked   Mr  Obama would be forced to back it and help Israel cope with the consequences  It might even help the president get re elected if he ends up using force to keep the Strait of Hormuz open and Israel safe  And in the Sunday Times Magazine  Ronen Bergman  an Israeli analyst and author of  The Secret War With Iran   has an extensive piece titled  Will Israel Attack Iran  A few snippets  Netanyahu and  Defense Minister Ehud  Barak have both repeatedly stressed that a decision has not yet been made and that a deadline for making one has not been set  As we spoke  however  Barak laid out three categories of questions  which he characterized as  Israel s ability to act    international legitimacy  and  necessity   all of which require affirmative responses before a decision is made to attack  1  Does Israel have the ability to cause severe damage to Iran s nuclear sites and bring about a major delay in the Iranian nuclear project  And can the military and the Israeli people withstand the inevitable counterattack  2  Does Israel have overt or tacit support  particularly from America  for carrying out an attack  3  Have all other possibilities for the containment of Iran s nuclear threat been exhausted  bringing Israel to the point of last resort  If so  is this the last opportunity for an attack  For the first time since the Iranian nuclear threat emerged in the mid 1990s  at least some of Israel s most powerful leaders believe that the response to all of these questions is yes  At various points in our conversation  Barak underscored that if Israel or the rest of the world waits too long  the moment will arrive   sometime in the coming year  he says   beyond which it will no longer be possible to act   It will not be possible to use any surgical means to bring about a significant delay   he said   Not for us  not for Europe and not for the United States  After that  the question will remain very important  but it will become purely theoretical and pass out of our hands   the statesmen and decision makers   and into yours   the journalists and historians    For their part  the Israelis suspect that the Obama administration has abandoned any aggressive strategy that would ensure the prevention of a nuclear Iran and is merely playing a game of words to appease them  The Israelis find evidence of this in the shift in language used by the administration  from  threshold prevention    meaning American resolve to stop Iran from having a nuclear energy program that could allow for the ability to create weapons   to  weapons prevention   which means the conditions can exist  but there is an American commitment to stop Iran from assembling an actual bomb   Matthew Kroenig  of the Council on Foreign Relations and special adviser to the Pentagon  worked on  defense policy and strategy on Iran  When I spoke with Kroenig last week  he said   My understanding is that the United States has asked Israel not to attack Iran and to provide Washington with notice if it intends to strike  Israel responded negatively to both requests  It refused to guarantee that it will not attack or to provide prior notice if it does   Kroenig went on   My hunch is that Israel would choose to give warning of an hour or two  just enough to maintain good relations between the countries but not quite enough to allow Washington to prevent the attack   Kroenig said Israel was correct in its timeline of Iran s nuclear development and that the next year will be critical   The future can evolve in three ways   he said   Iran and the international community could agree to a negotiated settlement  Israel and the United States could acquiesce to a nuclear armed Iran  or Israel or the United States could attack  Nobody wants to go in the direction of a military strike   he added   but unfortunately this is the most likely scenario  The more interesting question is not whether it happens but how  The Untied States should treat this option more seriously and begin gathering international support and building the case for the use of force under international law   I may refer back to other aspects of the Ronen Bergman article in future weeks  but for now  Mr  Bergman concludes  After speaking with many senior Israeli leaders and chiefs of the military and the intelligence  I have come to believe that Israel will indeed strike Iran in 2012  Perhaps in the small and ever diminishing window that is left  the United States will choose to intervene after all  but here  from the Israeli perspective  there is not much hope for that  Instead there is that peculiar Israeli mixture of fear   rooted in the sense that Israel is dependent on the tacit support of other nations to survive   and tenacity  the fierce conviction  right or wrong  that only the Israelis can ultimately defend themselves  Since last fall  you ve known where I stood  The U S  will be part of an attack this spring  It s as much about the political timetable as anything else  For now  we ll learn a lot more with the IAEA delegation next week in Tehran Syria  The uprising has reached Damascus  suburbs as the Syrian government dismissed out of hand a demand by the Arab League for President Bashar Assad to step down in favor of a unity government  Foreign Minister Walid al Mouallem said Syria was  like a mountain that never shakes in the wind   But the Free Syrian Army is making advances  if haltingly  The death toll is increasing by 30 to 50 every day  a reported 74  for Thurs  and Friday This week the head of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent was gunned down as he was on his way to Damascus  riding in a vehicle clearly marked with the Red Crescent symbol  according to reports  State run media blamed  terrorists   Many of the Gulf states  led by Saudi Arabia  have pulled out of the Arab League s observer mission  asking the U N  Security Council to intervene  Actually  it s hard to tell if anyone is really participating in the mission these days As for the Security Council  a Western Arab draft resolution endorses the Arab League s call for Assad to relinquish power  but if it comes up for a vote this coming week  it would seem Russia will veto it  Russia  after all  just signed a contract to sell 36 combat jets to Syria  in open defiance of international condemnation of Assad s crackdown  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said no explanation was necessary and that Russia was acting in full respect of international law and wouldn t be guided by unilateral sanctions others impose  Yet another example of Obama s  reset  with Russia that he conveniently left out of the State of the Union when going through his foreign policy successes  which can be counted on one hand  To wit Egypt  Final results show that Islamists have captured close to 75  of the seats in the new parliament  though some say the Muslim Brotherhood  47  in the lower house  won t align itself with the ultraconservative Al Nour  Salafist  party  25    A Brotherhood leader told an Arab daily in London that his group will not have dialogue with Israel  Another representative said   We do not recognize Israel at all  It s an occupying criminal enemy  So to those who say the Brotherhood is moderate  you re nuts  Others say the Brotherhood will divvy up governmental responsibilities with the ruling military council  with the army getting the foreign policy portfolio  The council still maintains a presidential election will be held in June  I continue to be skeptical on this unless the co governance arrangement has already been worked out in secret  One thing is clear  The ruling council is peopled with flat out idiots  Six Americans working for U S  based democracy organizations have been prohibited from leaving the country  including a son of U S  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood  A State Department spokesman said   We are urging the government of Egypt to lift these restrictions immediately and allow these folks to come home as soon as possible  I mean we give the Egyptians  1 3 billion in annual aid their military badly needs and of course that was already being reviewed  I m biting my tongue on this one  Time to invoke my  24 hour rule  to see what transpires the next few days  Libya  The National Transitional Council now operates in name only  Amnesty International was among the groups this week that said detainees  such as Gaddafi s loyalists  are being tortured and killed in prison   Limbs are being crushed and victims scorched with cattle prods  As reported by the London Times   In Misrata  a commercial hub that withstood months of devastating siege by Colonel Gaddafi s forces  the systematic torture has become so bad that  Medicins Sans Frontieres  said it would no longer treat detainees  arguing that they were only patching up abused inmates so that they could be tortured again  More than 8 000 pro Gaddafi supporters are being held by militia groups  according to the U N This week  protesters stormed the Benghazi headquarters of the NTC  and this was the birthplace of the revolt  The people demand the ouster of what they claim are Gaddafi era officials  The NTC  you ll recall  is internationally recognized Separately  Gaddafi loyalists seized control of Bani Walid  Bani Walid was the home of Gaddafi s son  Seif  who was captured in November but is still being held by militia forces  even though the NTC is demanding Seif be turned over to them  So it s civil war all over again  and as much a hellhole as you ll find in the world these days Oh  and officials at Cairo s international airport found a bomb planted in a Libyan Airlines plane that arrived from Tripoli  Explosives experts defused it after a steward found the bomb in a bathroom cabinet You only need the cooperation of 2 or 3 others in this part of the world to take down a commercial airliner or two  One thing never far from my mind is just where are the hundreds and hundreds of shoulder fired missiles that disappeared into thin air following Gaddafi s fall Iraq  Many Iraqis are not happy with the U S  military judge s decision to accept Marine Staff Sgt  Frank Wuterich s guilty plea of negligent dereliction of duty in the killing of 24 unarmed Iraqi civilians in Haditha back in 2005  Charges were previously dropped against six others  a seventh Marine was acquitted amid the  fog of war   Official reaction in Iraq  however  has been muted Meanwhile  Iraqi security forces raided the homes of two prominent Sunni politicians in another sign that Shiite Prime Minister Maliki is targeting Sunnis Afghanistan  IED  improvised explosive device  attacks rose to a record 16 554 in 2011 from 15 225 the year before  In 2009  there were 9 304  The number of Afghan civilians killed rose by 10  last year  Mullah Omar supposedly ordered his Taliban forces to stop targeting civilians  which  if true  is then worrisome in that he is being ignored by an even more vicious element  if that s possible   But fret not  President Obama would have you believe Afghanistan is in his  success  column   See France below  Pakistan  No coup yet  maybe next week  But don t worry  Stage One will be bloodless Knock knock  Who s there   Gen  Kayani  Time for you and Prime Minister Gilani to go  President Zardari   OK Saudi Arabia   Yes you ll be happy there   No problemo  Ah  but then a little while later comes Stage Two  Gen  Kayani s office Knock  knock  Who s there  BOOM      That would be the Taliban  Yemen  President Ali Abdullah Saleh is due in the U S  for medical treatment this weekend  as far as I can ascertain after Saleh left Yemen during the week  The State Department approved Saleh s request  This has the makings of a  24  episode  You know  an  insider  that is part of Saleh s security detail at the hospital  a fellow aligned with al Qaeda  which has been making inroads in Yemen s south  At least the White House can now convince Saleh to give up power for good  he handed it over before leaving  but you never about this guy   while the State Department desperately tries to find another home for him Russia  According to the latest poll  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin gets 49  of the vote for the March 4 presidential election  He needs 50 to avoid a run off  Another survey has him at 44   The opposition is staging a big rally in Moscow on Feb  4  but a pro Kremlin counter rally has been scheduled for the same time    Probable temperatures below zero  however  may limit the crowds in both Liberal leader Grigory Yavlinsky is supposedly going to be kept off the March 4 presidential ballot because many of the signatures his people submitted were ruled inadmissible by the Central Elections Commission  How conveeenient  Yavlinsky posed no threat whatsoever to Putin  but it s seen as revenge for the role his Yabloko party played in exposing December s fraudulent Duma vote  The Election Commission did say  however  that billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov was on his way to qualifying for the election  Many view him as Putin s puppet Putin himself lashed out against what he called nationalists who threaten the nation s collapse  Nationalism  religious intolerance are becoming a base for radical groups and movements   he wrote in a newspaper article  though a recent poll found that 43  of Russians support the notion of  Russia for Russians  and that a xenophobic sentiment is on the rise  Opposition forces from both the right and left have blamed uncontrolled immigration  especially from the Northern Caucasus and Central Asia  Sound familiar  Putin counters that migrants wanting to work in the country should pass exams on Russian language and culture Yulia Latynina  a political talk show host in Moscow  had an opinion piece in the Moscow Times and I learned this  Under Putin s decade long rule  Russia earned 1 6 trillion petrodollars and yet failed to build a single modern highway while reportedly having 26 personal palaces built for Putin s use  Meanwhile  Putin refuses to debate other presidential candidates and believes that anyone who opposes him is a condom  a monkey and a Georgian    Putin s recent description of some of the protesters  including what their ribbons look like  He s a daffy guy  that Vlad the Great  In other matters An anonymous source told Interfax that  Russia intends to field short range missiles in territory that borders multiple NATO states in the latter half of 2012  The U S  Defense Department rejected claims that radar waves caused the malfunctioning of a Russian Mars probe that never made it into orbit and crashed back to Earth  Pentagon spokesman George Little dismissed Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin s claim that there was evidence to this effect  saying   I ve heard of full mooner theories and this is one of them  And for those of you wondering if you can risk flying on a Russian commercial airliner  the answer is an emphatic Nyet  From the Moscow Times  A Moscow bound Boeing 737 operated by the Donavia airline was forced to execute a terrifying emergency landing in Rostov on Don on Monday after the cabin lost pressure  causing some passengers to pass out and others to get bloody noses  Interfax reported  20 minutes into the flight there was a technical problem in the cabin so the crew did an about face and headed back  One passenger wrote on his Facebook page  On the falling airplane everyone was screaming  the oxygen masks fell but weren t working  blood was flowing from many people s ears and noses  some have already lost consciousness  The extent of any injuries wasn t known China  Mike McConnell  Michael Chertoff and William Lynn   Wall Street Journal Only three months ago  we would have violated U S  secrecy laws by sharing what we write here   even though  as a former director of national intelligence  secretary of homeland security  and deputy secretary of defense  we have long known it to be true  The Chinese government has a national policy of economic espionage in cyberspace  In fact  the Chinese are the world s most active and persistent practitioners of cyber espionage today  Evidence of China s economically devastating theft of proprietary technologies and other intellectual property from U S  companies is growing  Only in October 2011 were details declassified in a report to Congress by the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive  Each of us has been speaking publicly for years about the ability of cyber terrorists to cripple our critical infrastructure  including financial networks and the power grid  Now this report finally reveals what we couldn t say before  The threat of economic cyber espionage looms even more ominously  The report is a summation of the catastrophic impact cyber espionage could have on the U S  economy and global competitiveness over the next decade  Evidence indicates that China intends to help build its economy by intellectual property theft rather than by innovation and investment in research and development  two strong suits of the U S  economy    In this election year  our economy will take center stage  as will China and its role in issues such as monetary policy  If we are to protect ourselves against irreversible long term damage  the economic issues behind cyber espionage must share some of that spotlight  The above could easily be a topic of discussion when Vice President Xi Jinping visits the White House on Feb  14  Xi the president to be in 2013  He will meet with President Obama  and also visit California and Iowa Xi may have a few questions for Obama concerning security in the Pacific as the administration is negotiating with the Philippines over a renewed presence there to go along with our forces in Japan  South Korea and on Guam Nigeria  Further attacks by Islamist terror group Boko Haram killed at least 160 last weekend as the scale of their bombings continues to grow with sophistication  They were always viewed as an al Qaeda offshoot  Just call them al Qaeda at this point  The helpless Nigerian government asks one simple question of the group   What the heck do you want    The imposition of Sharia rule  of course   Imagine  a day after this latest wave  Nigerian police discovered another 10 bomb laden cars and hundreds of other unexploded devices in the northern city of Kano France  This is truly a fascinating time here as the people gear up for the April 22 presidential election  Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande continues to lead by sizable margins in the polls  but this is a guy who promises if elected to reverse President Sarkozy s policies by raising taxes on corporations  banks and the wealthy and bringing the retirement age back down from 62 to 60  He s also promising to create 150 000 subsidized jobs in some of the distressed urban areas  Among his package of 60 measures released this week  Hollande would raise the income tax on those earning about  200 000 a year to 45  from 40   while maintaining Sarkozy s plan for a financial transaction tax For his part  Sarkozy is slated to do a  60 Minutes  style interview  Sunday night  He has yet to formally announce his candidacy and is being criticized within his own party for his increasingly somber and dour tone  what some say is a suicidal approach to the election  assuming he does run as everyone expects him to France also has problems with Turkey after the French parliament voted to approve a bill making it illegal to deny the genocide that took place with the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks  with Ankara saying they will take some steps against the French in retaliation  The Holocaust is the only other mass killing recognized as genocide in France and to deny either one would be punishable by up to a year in prison On the issue of French troops in Afghanistan following the death of four French soldiers and the wounding of 15 at the hands of an Afghan that was being trained by the French  Sarkozy just announced he has opted to withdraw all French forces one year early  by the end of 2013 instead of end of 2014  1 000 of 4 000 will leave this year  Far more on this next time Hungary  Prime Minister Viktor Orban has acquiesced to pressure by the European Union and IMF and has committed to change laws and adjust policies the two bodies find objectionable  namely restrictions on the independence of the National Bank of Hungary  The IMF issued a review of Hungary s economy and fiscal situation and said the government s budget deficit projections were  broadly appropriate  Australia  Prime Minister Julia Gillard had a scary moment during an Australia Day function when opposition leader Tony Abbott questioned an Aboriginal tent city  or  embassy   as they call it  which has been in place since 1972 in a call for recognition of Aboriginal land rights Abbott said   I think the Indigenous people of Australia can be very proud of the respect in which they are held with every Australian  Yes  I think a lot has changed and I think it s probably time to move on from that  Uh oh  A co founder of the makeshift embassy said Mr  Abbott s remarks were  madness  and  amounts to inciting racial riots  So the 100 to 200 protesters on the scene  listening to the comments on radio next door  rushed the restaurant where the two leaders were speaking and riot police had to be called in to whisk Gillard and Abbott away  Many have made fun of Gillard for her scared look as she was dragged by security into her vehicle  but that s unfair  As for Abbott  he is already in line for  Idiot of the Year  ,2012-02-01,Brian

122137,343652,NYT,Debt Free United States Notes Were Once Issued Under JFK and the U S  Government Still Has The Power to Issue Debt Free Money,opinion,Most Americans have no idea that the U S  government once issued debt free money directly into circulation   America once thrived under a debt free monetary system  and we can do it again   The truth is that the United States is a sovereign nation and it does not need to borrow money from anyone   Back in the days of JFK  Federal Reserve Notes were not the only currency in circulation   Under JFK  at at various other times   a limited number of debt free United States Notes were issued by the U S  Treasury and spent by the U S  government without any new debt being created   In fact  each bill said  United States Note  right at the top   Unfortunately  United States Notes are not being issued today   If you stop right now and pull a dollar out of your wallet  what does it say right at the top   It says  Federal Reserve Note    Normally  the way our current system works is that whenever more Federal Reserve Notes are created more debt is also created   This debt based monetary system is systematically destroying the wealth of this nation   But it does not have to be this way   The truth is that the U S  government still has the power under the U S  Constitution to issue debt free money  and we need to educate the American people about this Posted below are pictures of the front and the back of a United States Note printed in 1963 while JFK was president    Notice that there is a red seal instead of a green seal on the front  and it says  United States Note  rather than  Federal Reserve Note  According to Wikipedia  United States Notes were issued directly into circulation by the U S  Treasury and they were first used during the Civil War         They were originally issued directly into circulation by the U S  Treasury to pay expenses incurred by the Union during the American Civil War  Over the next century  the legislation governing these notes was modified many times and numerous versions have been issued by the Treasury  So why are we using debt based Federal Reserve Notes today instead of debt free United States Notes It seems rather stupid  doesn t it Well  that is what Thomas Edison thought too Thomas Edison was once quoted in the New York Times as saying the following         That is to say  under the old way any time we wish to add to the national wealth we are compelled to add to the national debt     Now  that is what Henry Ford wants to prevent  He thinks it is stupid  and so do I  that for the loan of  30 000 000 of their own money the people of the United States should be compelled to pay  66 000 000   that is what it amounts to  with interest  People who will not turn a shovelful of dirt nor contribute a pound of material will collect more money from the United States than will the people who supply the material and do the work  That is the terrible thing about interest  In all our great bond issues the interest is always greater than the principal  All of the great public works cost more than twice the actual cost  on that account  Under the present system of doing business we simply add 120 to 150 per cent  to the stated cost     But here is the point  If our nation can issue a dollar bond  it can issue a dollar bill  The element that makes the bond good makes the bill good  Our current debt based monetary system was devised by greedy bankers that wanted to make huge profits by creating money out of thin air and lending it to the U S  government at interest Sadly  the vast majority of the American people have no idea how money is actually created in this nation In a previous article about money and debt  I explained how more government debt is created whenever the U S  government puts more money into circulation         When the government wants more money  the U S  government swaps U S  Treasury bonds for  Federal Reserve notes   thus creating more government debt   Usually the money isn t even printed up   most of the time it is just electronically credited to the government   The Federal Reserve creates these  Federal Reserve notes  out of thin air   These Federal Reserve notes are backed by nothing and have no intrinsic value of their own  When each new Federal Reserve Note is created  the interest owed by the federal government on that new Federal Reserve Note is not also created at the same time So the amount of government debt that is created actually exceeds the amount of money that is created Isn t that a stupid system The U S  Constitution says that the federal government is the one that should actually be issuing our money In particular  according to Article I  Section 8 of the U S  Constitution  it is the U S  Congress that has been given the responsibility to  coin Money  regulate the Value thereof  and of foreign Coin  and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures  So why is a private central banking cartel issuing our money As is the case with so many other issues  we desperately need to get back to the way the U S  Constitution says that we should be doing things The debt based Federal Reserve system is literally stealing the future from our children and our grandchildren Back in 1910  a couple years prior to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act  the national debt was only about  2 6 billion A little over 100 years later  our national debt is now more than 5000 times larger So why don t we just admit that this system simply does not work Our current debt based monetary system also requires very high personal income taxes to pay for it In fact  it is no accident that the personal income tax was introduced at about the same time that the Federal Reserve system originally came into existence Our children  our grandchildren and many generations after that are facing a lifetime of debt slavery because of us As I have written about previously  if the federal government began right at this moment to repay the U S  national debt at a rate of one dollar per second  it would take over 440 000 years to pay off the national debt Neither the Republicans or the Democrats are proposing any solutions to this problem   Rather  both parties are only trying to slow down the rate at which we are going into even more debt But the truth is that the federal government does not have to go into a single penny of additional debt How could this be It is not too complicated If Congress took back the power over our currency and started issuing debt free money a lot of our problems could be fixed A basic plan would look something like this     1  The U S  Congress votes to take back all of the functions that it has delegated to the Federal Reserve and begins to issue debt free United States Notes   These United States Notes would have the exact same value as existing Federal Reserve Notes  and over time all existing Federal Reserve Notes would be taken out of circulation  2  The U S  Congress nationalizes all debt held by the Federal Reserve   That would instantly reduce the national debt by 1 6 trillion dollars   In fact  there are a few members of Congress that have already proposed this  3  A Constitutional amendment is passed limiting future U S  government deficits to a reasonable percentage of GDP   Any future deficits would not be funded by borrowing   Rather  future deficits would be funded by newly created Federal Reserve Notes   Therefore  the federal government would never again accumulate another penny of debt And it would be important to inject new money into the economy from time to time   When existing money is destroyed or when the population grows it is important to inject a certain amount of new money into the system in order to avoid deflation  4  The existing national debt would be very slowly paid off with newly created United States Notes   The U S  government spent over 454 billion dollars on interest on the national debt during fiscal year 2011  and over time this expense would go to zero If the national debt is paid off slowly enough  it would not create too much inflation   I believe that it could be paid off gradually over 50 years without shocking the economy too much There are some that would object to any measure that would ever cause a small amount of inflation  but my contention is that we have created a  15 trillion dollar debt mess for future generations  and it would be absolutely criminal to pass that legacy on to them We created this mess  and it is our responsibility to clean it up While there is certainly a danger that we would have a limited amount of inflation under a debt free monetary system such as the one described above  the reality is that we are absolutely guaranteed inflation under the Federal Reserve system Most Americans believe that inflation is a fact of life  but the sad truth is that the United States has only had a major  ongoing problem with inflation since the Federal Reserve was created back in 1913 If you do not believe this  just check out this chart Sadly  the U S  dollar has lost well over 95 percent of its value since the Federal Reserve was created So  yes  there would be a need for strict monetary discipline under a debt free monetary system  but it would be hard to do worse than the Federal Reserve has already been doing And Congress could always slow down inflation using other methods   For example  raising the reserve requirements for banks  which should be done anyway  would help keep inflation in check If the above proposals were adopted  the end result would be something that we could all live with   The Federal Reserve system would be abolished  the national debt burden on future generations would be wiped out  the economy would not have to go through a devastating economic collapse that could last a decade or longer  and we could eventually make a fairly smooth transition to  hard money  if we wanted to after the national debt is gone Is there any other proposal out there that does all of those things There are many out there that would dispute some of the points above  and debate is good   By engaging in debate  we can hopefully help educate the American people about the nature of money The key is to get rid of our current debt based Federal Reserve Notes and replace them with debt free United States Notes The American people need to understand that it is a lie that the U S  government  must  borrow money from somebody else When the U S  government borrows money  it slowly transfers wealth from the American people to those that borrowed it At this point  we have created a financial nightmare for future generations that is unlike anything the world has ever seen before   We owe it to future generations to eliminate the debt problem without destroying the United States economy   Adopting debt free money would allow us to do that But sadly  neither political party is even talking about debt free money   In fact  most of the politicians in both political parties probably do not even know what debt free money is So we need to get the American people educated about these things   Because if we stay on the course that we are currently on  an economic collapse is inevitable ,2011-12-19,Michael T.

122138,343653,NYT,Why The Mario Put is Bullish for Stocks,opinion,It s taken many observers including me longer than it might to comprehend  but ECB chairman Mario Draghi has done something that should be very bullish for U S  stocks  Floyd Norris noted some of the ramifications in today s New York Times  The Long Term Repurchase Operation  LTRO  in effect is an extension of credit from the ECB to EU sovereigns How can this be  when Mr  Draghi said all along he would not lend directly to governments  Because of the symbiotic relationship that exists between EU governments and their banks  The banks own most of the debt  If the banks can t afford to roll over maturing bonds governments will default  If governments default banks will go with them  Both are locked together  and we believed that the ECB was holding off from proving needed sustenance while the politicians showed some evidence of imposing fiscal austerity  They  sort of  did at the last summit  and now the ECB has taken a path from which it will be difficult to turn Eurozone banks took down 489 billion Euros of three year loans at 1  this week  Whether they choose to buy sovereign debt or not is really not the point  They can  and now whenever the banks appear sufficiently shaky that they won t be able to finance what their sovereigns need  the ECB can be relied upon to provide it  There will no doubt be more brinkmanship and dire warnings about delaying needed economic reforms in the south  but the problem has always been the absence of a credible punishment to wavering countries  The Maastricht Treaty incorporated enormous fees  1  of a country s GDP  that were soon shown to be implausible when Germany and France were among the first to breach the 3  deficit GDP criteria  Forcing a country to default is clearly unacceptable  The Eurozone s countries are all roped together  and the ECB recognizes that pushing one off the cliff endangers them all  The ECB is the lender of last resort to banks  It has become the lender of last resort to EU governments as well  and Germany as a guarantor of the ECB s balance sheet is now part of this solution This is not necessarily bullish for the Euro  although the tail risk of a disorderly collapse has been removed  But it is assuredly bullish for U S  equities  By far the single biggest question mark hanging over stocks has been Europe  and now the roped together have stepped away from the cliff  Equities are attractively priced compared with bonds and have been for some time  This may just be the development that nudges investors off the fence ,2011-12-22,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-mario-put-is-bullish-for-stocks-109598,109598
122139,343654,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,North Korea  Dictator Kim Jong Il died of a massive heart attack at the age of 69  after a 17 year reign that saw him kill  directly or indirectly  millions of his subjects while building up the North s nuclear and other WMD programs  Incredibly  neither South Korean or U S  intelligence knew of his death for 51 hours until it was announced on state TV  It s bad enough Washington didn t know  but picture being a citizen of Seoul  within artillery range of the North  and trying to have confidence in your nation s intelligence gathering capabilities Kim was replaced by his son  Kim Jong Un  a pudgy 27   28   or 29 year old described as being  aggressive    erratic   and a  sadist   by some  The kid was named  the Great Successor   and  Supreme Commander   today  I just saw  and official media this week has been calling him the  outstanding leader   It s important to note that thus far all is calm during the period of mourning  which will end Dec  28 29 with Kim Jong Il s funeral After the funeral  though  the eyes of the world  particularly the United States  and those of South Korea  Japan  Russia and China  will be on the Great Successor and any signs of a power struggle  The U S  will also be looking for signs of stepped up activity between Pyongyang and Tehran  the two having cooperated extensively in the past on sharing nuclear and weapons technology   Syria to a somewhat lesser extent  It is anticipated that Kim Jong Un will initially share power with one of his uncles and the military  At least as of today  it appears the military is solidly behind the kid  Some say the younger Kim does already have his own power base after being named the successor 15 months ago  but we ll all know a lot more in just a few months  For now  yes  those in power with the father have a vested interest in keeping the status quo as much as possible to ensure their own survival  The big question today  though  is   Who controls the nukes    That is if they ve successfully mated the material with bombs or ballistic missiles  which isn t known for certain  Victor Cha  former director of Asian affairs in the George W  Bush administration and now an advisor to the Center for Strategic and International Studies  in an op ed for the Financial Times  The moment is dripping with irony  Just last week  the U S  was engaging in painstaking diplomacy on food aid agreements and on prisoner of war remains recovery with the North Koreans as a prelude to a return to the denuclearization negotiations  These bits of diplomacy constituted small bites at the apple  We are now talking about a whole and new apple  Approaching the post Kim Jong il leadership is not advisable in part because we do not know who is really in charge  Contacting the young son could do more to alienate him within his own system of anti American military generals  Establishing contacts with others involved in politics or the military could emasculate the young leader s authority and set off unknown and destabilizing dynamics  We do not know North Korea s future after Kim Jong il  But if this decrepit regime were to finally collapse of its own weight  there are a host of factors analysts would be able to point to   including economic decay  food shortages  an unstable leadership transition  and an increasingly restless population   which would make the Dear Leader s death the straw that broke the camel s back  Senator John McCain  I can only express satisfaction that the Dear Leader is joining the likes of

against his Sunni coalition partners   Former Prime Minister Allawi  a Shiite  on Tuesday offered the following analysis to Reuters   The Americans have pulled out without completing the job they should have finished  We have warned them that we don t have a political process which is inclusive of all Iraqis and we won t have a full blown state in Iraq  We want to resolve issues between Iraqis in a peaceful way and we want to bring stability  Iraqis should fill the vacuum  rather than anyone else   Iranians and al Qaeda may fill the vacuum now   The White House  which hoped to take credit for success  seems to understand it has a problem  CIA Director David Petraeus flew to Baghdad on Tuesday to press the case for moderation  Vice President Joe Biden called Mr  Maliki and requested an  inclusive partnership agreement   Yet the U S  finds itself with little leverage  On Wednesday  Mr  Maliki ignored Mr  Biden and declared his intention to take Iraq to  a new stage  of Shiite dominated rule  If Iraq now descends into a sectarian brawl or dictatorship  Mr  Obama s withdrawal will have been the needless trigger  I wrote last week that  during the course of the 2012 campaign  President Obama will increasingly find he cannot tout his Iraq policy as a success  A few days later  amidst the violence and Maliki s moves  Republican Sen  John McCain said   The president and vice president are taking victory laps while Iraq unravels  It s a low point in American involvement in national security affairs  And regarding my comment over the past year that if you didn t think we lost the war  all you had to know is that Christians in Iraq can t celebrate Christmas openly without being targeted  none other than  Doonesbury  highlighted the topic in Garry Trudeau s Wednesday strip The character  a professor  is teaching a class on the Iraq War and says  Okay  Let s discuss the war s impact on Iraq s Christian community  one of the oldest in the world Since 2003  about 600 000 Christians of an estimated pre war population of one million have been driven from their homes  A majority left Iraq  In other words  our invasion of Iraq set in motion one of the worst Christian diasporas in history  So what do we think of that  Ray Ray   Is  freakin  ironic  an answer  Sir  Syria  It was a horrible week here  probably the worst in terms of a death toll that would appear to be in excess of 250  following twin suicide bombings on Friday in the capital of Damascus that took out at least 44  Friday s attacks targeted an upscale neighborhood and heavily guarded intelligence buildings and came just one day after an advance team of Arab League observers arrived to monitor the Assad regime s promise to end its crackdown on protesters  The blasts were the first suicide bombings since the uprising began in March and  according to the government  back its claims the turmoil is the work of terrorists  State TV blamed al Qaeda and on one hand it does follow the group s pattern of trying to foment civil war I would just observe that the government has an incentive to carry off such attacks itself to help with its message  You won t see this anywhere else  but I take you back to the days when Vladimir Putin was about to take over for Boris Yeltsin and there was a series of apartment bombings in Russia that Putin directed as a pretense to expanding the war against Chechnya  as was my lone opinion at the time  Putin blamed Chechen terrorists  I thought  and I expressed in this space  the idea that he blew them up  Months later  the late William Safire expressed the very same thoughts in his New York Times column  Could Assad be taking a page out of Putin s playbook   I emphasize  to date  no one in authority has had the guts to take on Putin in this regard  Earlier in the week  at least 200 were killed in Syria in a spasm of violence ahead of the Arab League visit Iran  Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said in an interview with CBS News that when it comes to Iran s nuclear efforts   It would probably be about a year before  they could build a bomb   Perhaps a little less   Panetta warned Washington was ready to take  whatever steps necessary to stop it   including military action   That s a red line for us If we have to do it  we will deal with it  The United States and Israel  though  continue to believe they will be able to gain the intelligence needed to know when Iran tries to  break out  and build the bomb taking the uranium it has already enriched  for example  to a higher level for use in a bomb  a step that doesn t take long  The hard work has already been done  though the West believes they only have enough enriched material for one or two bombs currently On a different matter  the Jerusalem Post reports that Iran  has embarked on an ambitious plan to boost its offensive and defensive cyber warfare capabilities and is investing  1 billion in developing new technology and hiring new computer experts  Spanish language TV network Univision aired a documentary recently that reported to show Venezuelan and Iranian diplomats  based in Mexico  being briefed on plans for cyber attacks against U S  targets  including nuclear power plants Israel  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for a deal that paves the way for Hamas to join the PLO  saying  through a spokesman  that if Abbas  embraces Hamas  if he walks toward Hamas  he is walking away from peace  So in the agreement reached among the leaders of various Palestinian groups on Thursday  the likes of Hamas and Islamic Jihad will join the PLO  Heretofore  Hamas  founded 24 years ago  had refused to recognize the PLO as the  sole legitimate representative  of the Palestinians Egypt  The death toll in last weekend s brutal crackdown by the military on protesters in Cairo s Tahrir Square reached 10  with more than 300 wounded  Soldiers were filmed assaulting female demonstrators Meanwhile  in the second of three rounds of voting for a new parliament  Islamists claimed they once again secured a vast majority of the votes cast  this time up to 3 4s  In this round  the Muslim Brotherhood and its allies said they won 40   while the ultra conservative Salafists won 35    In the first round it was 37  and 24   respectively   From my reading of the situation  the last round of the voting should see results more similar to the second than the first Pakistan  The U S  conceded it bears much of the responsibility for the airstrike last month that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on the Afghan border  The Pentagon said U S  and Afghan troops were acting in self defense  while admitting there was poor coordination between U S  and Pakistani forces  which speaks to the level of mistrust that has only grown worse between the two  Unbelievably  U S  officials admitted they had incorrect mapping information that they then shared with a Pakistani liaison officer  which resulted in an incorrect understanding of where the Pakistani troops were  as in the map coordinates were like nine miles off The whole mission went bad from the beginning when NATO didn t share with their Pakistani counterparts details of the U S  Afghan operation in the first place because they feared the Pakistanis would tip off the insurgents  While the Pentagon admitted its errors  the White House has refused to apologize to Pakistan for the deaths  although it has expressed its condolences to the victims  families  Meanwhile  President Zardari returned from Dubai  where he was undergoing medical treatment  to a firestorm over a memo accusing the military of plotting a coup against him  Whatever Zardari s ailment is  he is unable to resume full work  making his position even more tenuous  The memo was reportedly delivered to the Pentagon  asking for help in staving off the coup  Army chief Gen  Kayani  the real power in Pakistan these days  has called for an investigation Afghanistan  Senator John McCain called Vice President Biden s statement in an interview with Newsweek that the Taliban are not our enemy   bizarre  Tell the men and women fighting them that   said McCain  The Poles  loyal members of the NATO fighting force here  lost five soldiers in a single roadside bomb attack on Wednesday  according to reports  Our thoughts go out to this good nation and ally  Russia  Today  Saturday  is to be the big demonstration in Moscow  further protests against the recent fraudulent Duma election  though sanctioned by the Kremlin to allow the disaffected to blow off some steam  even as President Medvedev said the government won t allow  provocateurs and extremists  to upset Russia s stability  Separately  Medvedev pledged various reforms to the political system in an attempt to appear relevant as he is due to swap seats with Prime Minister Putin next year  Earlier  you had the death of an investigative journalist who was writing about corruption  shot eight times by a masked gunman in the province of Dagistan  one of eight journalists on a 2009  execution list  published anonymously there And in the Sea of Okhotsk  off Russia s eastern coast  an oil rig sank in rough and frigid seas  53 of 67 men aboard are said to have died  The platform was being towed to an island when a huge wave hit it  broke through the portholes  and the rig capsized  One survivor told NTV television that he swam away and saw it go down   I was afraid I d be sucked down into the crater that formed when it sank   Survivors  as you can imagine  needed treatment for trauma as well as hypothermia China  In yet another hack attack  the U S  Chamber of Commerce was infiltrated by a group of Chinese hackers who gained access to everything on the lobbying group s systems  While this just became public  it was discovered and quietly shut down in May 2010  The hackers  while having access to information on all three million members  appear to have been focusing on four Chamber employees specializing on Asia policy  with weeks of their emails being stolen And China s future president and current vice president  Xi Jinping  focused on improving ties with Vietnam in a three day visit to Hanoi  A Vietnamese government report said that regarding the two sides  longstanding disputes over island groups in the South China Sea   the Vietnamese side agreed to be ready  with China  to solve disputes through peaceful negotiation  respecting and paying attention to each other s legitimate benefits   A Chinese mouthpiece echoed similar sentiments  So this is good  Xi will slowly gain more responsibility next year and be fully in charge by 2013 Finally  on Friday  Chinese writer and dissident Chen Wei was sentenced to nine years in jail for  inciting subversion of state power   one of the harshest sentences imposed on those seeking to replicate the Arab Spring uprising in China  Mr  Chen s lawyer told Reuters that after the verdict was announced  Chen told the court   Dictatorship will fail  democracy will prevail  Japan  The military has opted to go with Lockheed Martin s F 35 jet as its next mainstay fighter  choosing it over Boeing s F A 18 and the Eurofighter Typhoon  It was a reflection of Japan desiring a tighter security alliance with the United States in the face of China s growing capabilities and uncertainty over North Korea France   Turkey  A nasty diplomatic fight has erupted between these two as one chamber of the French parliament passed a bill criminalizing denial of the 1915 16 Armenian  genocide   In retaliation  Ankara recalled its ambassador and adopted a number of other measures  including freezing political visits  The French National Assembly approved the bill on Thursday and the Senate will pick it up next year  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has opposed it Armenians claim 1 5 million were killed by the Ottoman Turks almost one hundred years ago  while Turkey claims it was closer to 300 000 and was more the result of a civil war  Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan said   This will open very grave and irreparable wounds  This is politics based on racism  discrimination and xenophobia  This all goes back to French President Sarkozy s opposition to Turkey joining the EU  and while his foreign minister may disagree with the bill  Sarkozy has given his tacit approval  In the latest poll on the French presidential race  it has tightened  Socialist Francois Holland  27 5   Sarkozy  24   Marine Le Pen  20   Francois Bayrou  11   Dominique de Villepin  3 5   This is getting interesting  Philippines  Over 1 000 were killed in flash flooding spawned by a typhoon  Half a million are impacted by the catastrophe as a United Nations official described the devastation in two cities as looking like they had been by a tsunami  Disease is now a major concern as bodies are still being retrieved from the mud a week later Angola  Human Rights Watch said the government must account for  32 billion missing from state coffers   32 billion  And this is our new  oil rich buddy  The missing funds were identified by the IMF and believed to be linked to the state oil company Sonangol  The IMF says the money disappeared between 2007 and 2010 ,2011-12-28,Brian Trumbore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review-part-iii:-foreign-affairs-109853,109853
122140,343655,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,As noted last week when I went to post  it was clear Newt Gingrich s poll numbers would begin to suffer as he was under attack from his fellow Republicans seeking the party nomination  A Gallup national poll now has Gingrich at 26 percent  Mitt Romney at 24 percent  when just a week earlier  Gingrich had a 14 point lead in the same survey  A CNN ORC national poll had Gingrich and Romney tied at 28  A Washington Post ABC News national survey had Gingrich and Romney tied at 30 CBS News national poll  Gingrich 20Romney 20Paul 10  the previous month  Herman Cain was on top remember him  The pizza guy  Mr  9 9 9  Didn t tell his wife he was paying another woman a rather sizable stipend   Among those identifying themselves as Republican primary voters  79  said it was still too early to declare a preference Iowa State Gazette poll of likely Republican caucus goers Paul 28Gingrich 25Romney 18Rasmussen Survey IowaRomney 25Paul 20Gingrich 17Public Policy poll IowaPaul 23Romney 20 Gingrich 14  Most news organizations don t like the way Public Policy polls are conducted and thus don t play up their data   Romney gained the endorsement of the Des Moines Register Newt Gingrich s attacks on the judiciary are nuts  Or as George Will comments in the Washington Post  Gingrich radiates impatience with impediments to allowing majorities to sweep aside judicial determinations displeasing to those majorities  He does not  however  trust democratic political processes to produce  over time  presidents who will nominate  and Senate majorities that will confirm  judges whose views he approves  Although not a historian  Gingrich plays one on television  where he recently cited Franklin Roosevelt  and Jefferson  Jackson and Lincoln  as  just like  him in being  prepared to take on the judiciary   Roosevelt  infuriated by Supreme Court decisions declaring various progressive policies incompatible with the Constitution s architecture of limited government  tried to  pack  the court by enlarging it and attempted to purge from Congress some Democrats who opposed him  Voters  who generally respect the court much more than other government institutions  reelected those Democrats and so thoroughly rebuked FDR s overreaching that Congress lacked a liberal legislating majority for a generation  To teach courts the virtue of modesty  President Gingrich would attempt to abolish some courts and impeach judges whose decisions annoy him   decisions he says he might ignore while urging congress to do likewise  He favors compelling judges to appear before Congress to justify decisions  out of sync  with majorities  and he would sic police or marshals on judges who resist congressional coercion  Never mind that judges always explain themselves in written opinions  concurrences and dissents  Gingrich s unsurprising descent into sinister radicalism   intimidation of courts   is redundant evidence that he is not merely the least conservative candidate  he is thoroughly anti conservative  He disdains the central conservative virtue  prudence  and exemplifies progressivism s defining attribute   impatience with impediments to the political branches  wielding of untrammeled power  He exalts the will of the majority of the moment  at least as he  tribune of the vox populi  interprets it  New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie is not ruling out a possible veep slot on a Romney ticket  It seems pretty clear to me he could provide the shot in the arm needed come next summer and fall as no one would be a more effective attack dog  allowing Romney to take the high road  if he chose Former President George H W  Bush endorsed Romney  with Bush saying of rival Rick Perry  governor of Mr  Bush s home state  he  doesn t seem to be going anywhere   Bush called Romney  mature and reasonable   not a bomb thrower   Of Gingrich  he said   I m not his biggest advocate  Regarding President Obama  an AP GfK survey had 52  saying Obama should be voted out of office  43  said he deserved a second term  But the above referenced Washington Post ABC News poll has the president s approval rating rising to 49 percent  the highest since March  excluding the bump from the killing of Osama bin Laden  In the same survey  approval of Republicans in Congress is at 20 percent  while Democrats are at 27 percent  Incredibly  Republican support for the GOP has plunged from 63 percent in April to just 38 percent today  while Democrats  approval of their own representatives in Congress is down to 51 percent  In a USA TODAY Gallup Poll  in general election matchups  President Obama edges Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich by identical 50 48 margins  In a separate Gallup Poll  only 11  of adults give Congress good marks  the lowest job approval rating for the body since Gallup started asking the question in 1974  In an outtake of Obama s interview on  60 Minutes  with Steve Croft  Croft asked Obama to reflect on his presidency to date and at one point Obama goes  The issue here is not going to be a list of accomplishments  As you said yourself  Steve  you know  I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president   with the possible exceptions of Johnson  FDR and Lincoln   just in terms of what we ve gotten done in modern history  But  you know  but when it comes to the economy  we ve got a lot more work to do  As the Wall Street Journal opined  You ve got to love the  possible  in that sentence about FDR and Lincoln  Perhaps Mr  Obama would have dropped the diminishing modifier if old Abe hadn t taken so darn long to free the salves or win the Civil War  It s also notable that poor George Washington didn t make the Obama cut  Historians may consider Washington to be America s  indispensable man   but he never did campaign on a promise to lower sea levels  Ego aside   or super duper ego aside   Mr  Obama s claims are instructive because they explicitly reject any connection between his  accomplishments  and the economy that Americans elected him to fix  Might Mr  Obama s appetites for more government   for more LBJ style accomplishments   have something to do with the weak recovery  The New York Times reported in November that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told Mr  Obama shortly after the election in 2008 that  Your legacy is going to be preventing the second Great Depression   Mr  Obama responded   That s not enough for me   At this point  we d settle for Chester A  Arthur or Martin Van Buren  Speaking of super duper egos  Donald Trump has left the Republican Party to register as an independent  thus setting himself up to run for president as a third party candidate should he so choose The FBI reported that violent crime continued to decline in America  down 6 4  in the first half of the year  compared with a year ago  with murders down 5 7  and rapes falling 5 1   While more sophisticated policing methods have been a huge help  one of the preeminent criminologists  Prof  James Alan Fox of Northeastern University  cites the proliferation of technology  such as security cameras  as playing a major role But  the killings of law enforcement officers rose 14  over the same six month period U S  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood refuses to back the National Transportation Safety Board s proposal to prohibit drivers from talking on cellphones  Yet another reason why LaHood will go down in history as one of the very worst cabinet officials of any administration And how can I be so harsh  Because this is the same bumbling fool who has himself pushed to reduce driver distraction and a year ago  said a ban on cellphone use on the road may be necessary I should say I m not in the best mood on this topic because on Wednesday night in my town  at 6 00 p m   a 60 year old woman crossing the street in our downtown area was struck and killed by a man driving an SUV  She was crushed to death    There was  a lot  of blood all over the street  as one story had it This is exactly what I have half facetiously written about since I started this column  That one day I ll meet my end in downtown Summit  innocently crossing the street  There is no word as yet whether the driver was  distracted   but seeing as this occurred about 30 yards from where I had my office for 11 years  I know the location well and he had to be When I posted that as part of the  1 trillion spending bill  the incandescent bulb was saved  I didn t realize the protection ends Sept  30  2012  Let s see  if I m not hit by an SUV crossing the street and live about another 25 years  and I blow through six bulbs a year  I don t use many lights in my place   that s 150 bulbs I need to buy  minus the 70 or so I already have One of the great men of the 20th Century died  Vaclav Havel  the dissident playwright turned politician who led the nonviolent  Velvet Revolution  in Czechoslovakia in December 1989  In just four months  Havel went from being in prison  sent there a fourth time  to becoming the first democratically elected president of his country  He later oversaw the peaceful breakup into the Czech Republic and Slovakia  Havel then being elected president of the former two times while overseeing his new country s admittance into NATO in 1999 and then  eventually  the European Union  Havel left office in 2003  months before the country joined the EU in 2004  Havel was elected Czechoslovakia  president by the country s still communist parliament on Dec  29  1989  Three days later he told the nation in a televised New Year s address  Out of gifted and sovereign people  the regime made us little screws in a monstrously big  rattling and stinking machine   We have become morally ill because we are used to saying one thing and thinking another  We have learned not to believe in anything  not to care about each other Love  friendship  mercy  humility  or forgiveness have lost their depths and dimension They represent some sort of psychological curiosity  or they appear as long lost wanderers from faraway times  Havel  from his 1985 essay  An Anatomy of Reticence   A state that denies its citizens their basic rights becomes a danger to its neighbors as well  internal arbitrary rule will be reflected in arbitrary external relations  The suppression of public opinion  the abolition of public competition for power and its public exercise opens the way for the state power to arm itself in any way it seems fit A

122141,343656,NYT,2012 Will be More Difficult than 2011,opinion,Do you believe that 2012 will be more difficult for the global economy than 2011 was   Well  that is what German Chancellor Angela Merkel believes   The woman that has become the most important politician in Europe recently declared that 2012  will no doubt be more difficult than 2011    The funny thing is that she has generally been one of the most optimistic public figures in Europe throughout this debt crisis   But now even Merkel is openly admitting that 2012 is going to be a really  really bad year   Sadly  most Americans simply do not understand how important Europe is or how interconnected the global financial system has become   The United States actually has a smaller population and a smaller economy than the EU does   In fact  the EU has an economy that is nearly as large as the economies of the United States and China combined   The EU also is home to more Fortune 500 companies that the U S  is  and the European banking system is far larger than the U S  banking system   Anyone that does not believe that a financial collapse in Europe will have a devastating impact on the U S  economy is living in a fantasy world   Americans better start paying attention to what is going on over there  because we are about to be broadsided by a massive financial tsunami originating out of Europe It is not just Angela Merkel that is warning that 2012 is going to be a difficult year   The following are several more very prominent individuals that are warning that bad times are on the way     Citigroup s chief equity strategist  Tobias Levkovich  recently made the following statement         Europe is likely to have a meaningful recession in 2012  Christian Lagarde  the head of the IMF  recently said that we could soon see conditions  reminiscent of the 1930s depression  and that no country on earth  will be immune to the crisis    Willem Buiter  the chief economist at Citigroup  recently said the following         Time is running out fast   I think we have maybe a few months    it could be weeks  it could be days    before there is a material risk of a fundamentally unnecessary default by a country like Spain or Italy which would be a financial catastrophe dragging the European banking system and North America with it    Even Paul Krugman of the New York Times is sounding quite apocalyptic         At this point I d guess soaring rates on Italian debt leading to a gigantic bank run  both because of solvency fears about Italian banks given a default and because of fear that Italy will end up leaving the euro  This then leads to emergency bank closing  and once that happens  a decision to drop the euro and install the new lira  Next stop  France  I have written quite a bit recently about all of the signs that parts of Europe have already entered a recession Well  in just the past few days even more numbers have been released that indicate that a recession has now begun in Europe      Manufacturing activity in the euro zone has fallen for five months in a row  Bad loans in Spain recently hit a 17 year high and the unemployment rate is at a 15 year high  Government revenues in Spain have not been up to the level that was expected   The Spanish government just announced that the budget deficit for 2011 is going to end up being much larger than anticipated  Unfortunately  it appears that virtually all sectors of the Spanish economy seem to be slowing down         The central bank said early indicators show that Spanish tourism  exports  spending and investment have been hit  which is likely to have led to a contraction in GDP in the fourth quarter  Of course one of the most alarming things happening in Europe is the rapid contraction of the money supply   It is almost impossible to avoid a recession when the money supply shrinks substantially   The following comes from an article a few days ago in the Telegraph         Simon Ward from Henderson Global Investors said the ECB s  narrow  M1 money figures   tracked for clues on shorter term spending patterns   show a drastic divergence between the North and South of the eurozone   Parts of the core may avoid recession but there is no light at the end of the tunnel for the periphery  Real M1 deposits in Greece and Portugal have been falling at an annual rate of roughly 20pc over the last six months   he said Right now  the rest of Europe is heading down the same road that Greece has been traveling on for several years Today  Greece is essentially bankrupt and is experiencing a full blown depression   At this point  nobody in Europe is even pretending that Greece is going to be okay   The following comes from a recent Der Spiegel article         With debts amounting to 150 percent of GNP  Greece is de facto bankrupt  Over the course of 2011  even the leading representatives of the euro zone finally accepted this fact    after having claimed its opposite a year previously  Greece desperately needs relief from all of this debt  but the other nations in the eurozone do not want to provide that relief   Instead  it looks like Germany is going to ask private creditors to take an even bigger  haircut  on Greek debt than previously proposed   The following comes from a recent Bloomberg article         Germany s government declined to comment on a report that it may push for creditors to accept bigger losses on Greek debt than previously agreed upon  saying only that talks on lowering Greece s debt level may end soon       Germany is studying a proposal to write down 75 percent of Greek government bonds held by private creditors as part of a planned debt swap to ensure greater debt sustainability If Germany ends up publicly proposing this  it will shatter what confidence is left in European sovereign bonds There is not that much of a difference between a 75 percent haircut and a full default   If investors are forced to take a 75 percent haircut on Greek debt  then the financial world will have to start wondering if it is just a matter of time before giant haircuts are proposed for Italian debt  Spanish debt  Portuguese debt and Irish debt as well Hopefully Germany will not be this stupid But something has to be done about Greece   Right now the IMF is projecting that Greek debt will reach 200  of GDP at some point in 2012 if changes are not made Of course Greece could cut government spending even more  but the cuts that have already been made have pushed that country into a total economic nightmare In a recent article  I discussed how the brutal austerity measures that we have seen have plunged the economy of Greece into a full blown depression         Just look at what happened to Greece   Greece was forced to raise taxes and implement brutal austerity measures   That caused the economy to slow down and tax revenues to decline and so government debt figures did not improve as much as anticipated   So Greece was forced to implement even more brutal austerity measures   Well  that caused the economy to slow down even more and tax revenues declined again   In Greece this cycle has been repeated several times and now Greece is experiencing a full blown economic depression   100 000 businesses have closed and a third of the population is living in poverty   But now Germany and France intend to impose the  Greek solution  on the rest of Europe  The  solution  that the EU and the IMF have imposed on Greece is not working So why are all of the other troubled nations in Europe being pushed down the same path Just consider the following statistics out of Greece     The unemployment rate for those under the age of 24 is 39 percent  The number of suicides has increased by 40 percent in the past year  Thefts and burglaries nearly doubled between 2007 and 2009 Is that what we want to see throughout the rest of Europe The financial path that Europe is now on was criticized very harshly recently in the New York Times         Every government in Europe with the exception of Germany is bending over backwards to prove to the market that they won t hesitate to do what it takes   said Charles Wyplosz  a professor of economics at the Graduate Institute of Geneva   We re going straight into a wall with this kind of policy  It s sheer madness  Yes  it is sheer madness Right now  authorities in Europe are desperately trying to keep a lid on this crisis   The European Central Bank has been trying really hard to keep the yield on 10 year Italian bonds from rising above the very important 7 percent level   But unless the ECB is prepared to spend hundreds and hundreds of billions of euros buying up Italian debt in 2012  the yield on Italian bonds is likely to go much higher eventually At this point  it is hard to find any economist that is optimistic about Europe or about the euro in 2012 One of the leading economic think tanks in Europe  the Centre for Economics and Business Research  is extremely pessimistic about the future of the euro as we enter 2012         It now looks as though 2012 will be the year when the euro starts to break up In fact  they say that there is a 99 percent chance that the eurozone will break up within the next ten years Terry Smith  the chief executive of Tullett Prebon  recently used language that was even more apocalyptic         If the eurozone crisis could be solved by confident pronouncements  it would already be saved  I would be shocked if Greece does not leave the eurozone in 2012 and this does not lead the markets to test the resolve to defend the positions of Portugal  Spain  Italy and  ultimately  France  Yes  there are a whole lot of people out there saying that 2012 will be more difficult than 2011 Fortunately  there are a few nations out there that are choosing to try some different things We aren t hearing much about it in the United States  but right now Hungary is actually taking some measures to get their central bank under control The following comes from a recent article in the Telegraph         Hungary passed laws for its central bank in a move that experts warned could jeopardise its chances of securing international bail out funds if it needs them  Officials from the International Monetary Fund  IMF  have warned about the rules which will undermine the independence of the central bank  Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban the country would not bow to the  European fashion that the central bank must be in a sacred state of independence  Of course the IMF is absolutely furious about this   The IMF is warning that there will be no bailouts for Hungary if they mess with the  independence  of the central bank But hopefully more countries out there will start going after their central banks   The truth is that it is the central banks and the endless debt spirals that they create that got us into this mess in the first place If central banking truly worked  Europe would not be in such a massive amount of trouble   The euro would not be dropping like a rock and the European financial system would not be paralyzed by panic and fear The reality is that central banking does not work and it a colossal failure For example  in the United States the U S  dollar has lost well over 95 percent of its value since the Federal Reserve was created  and the U S  national debt is now more than 5000 times larger than it was when the Federal Reserve was created It is amazing that there is anyone out there that is still willing to defend central banking 2012 is going to be one of the most interesting years that we have seen in a long  long time Yes  2012 will be more difficult than 2011 was  but it will also be a great opportunity to wake people up Our world is changing faster than ever before  and the Internet has made it possible for average people such as you and I to significantly participate in that change Resolve to do what you can to make a difference in this world in 2012  because time is rapidly running out ,2012-01-03,Michael T.

122142,343657,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,With just a few days to go before the Iowa caucuses  a CNN Time ORC poll of likely Iowa caucus goers was a mini bombshell Mitt Romney 25 percentRon Paul 22Rick Santorum 16Newt Gingrich 14Rick Perry 11Michele Bachmann 9 A follow on CNN Time poll had Santorum at 15   Gingrich at 13   A month ago in the same survey  Gingrich was at 33 vs  Romney s 20  Santorum only had 5  So terrible news for the former speaker  whose campaign also screwed up royally in not getting on the Virginia primary ballot  especially given it s his home state   while Santorum basked in the late glow of the media spotlight  Heck  the guy deserves it  No one has worked the state harder and by my admittedly fickle thinking  should he finish where the above poll has him  and can hang in there another 6 8 weeks  if nothing else he has put himself in the veep sweepstakes  Seriously  he s not a bad match with Romney  Santorum has the Washington experience Romney lacks  could be a decent go between with Congress  has foreign policy experience  and if something happened to a President Romney  Santorum is just as qualified to be the nation s leader as any of the others we ve had since Bush 41   I know that s not saying much  NBC Wall Street Journal IowaRomney 23Paul 21Santorum 15Gingrich 13Michele Bachmann s campaign was roiled by the defection of her two main staffers  including her Iowa state chair  Kent Sorenson  who defected to the Paul camp  Bachmann said Sorenson was bought off and that he told her so in a phone conversation  Sorenson said the conversation never happened and that no money was exchanged  The timing was awful and at this point I ll be shocked if she gets 7  and moves on to New  poll New Hampshire Romney 44Paul 17Gingrich 16Huntsman 9New Hampshire Survey Center poll Romney 39Gingrich 17Paul 17Huntsman 11Nationally  a Rasmussen Reports survey had Romney topping Obama 45 to 39 percent  But just a week earlier  Romney trailed Obama 44 41  so not sure about this one   Actually  I m not keen on the Rasmussen surveys  period  I hope I ve made it clear I don t have a personal favorite yet in the presidential race  I was interested in Herman Cain for a week or two  thought Perry was intriguing for an equal amount of time just as he showed up in Iowa when I was there in August  and am glad the likes of Santorum and Ron Paul are in the race to make it interesting  Speaking of Paul  Stephen F  Hayes of The Weekly Standard   When likely Iowa caucusgoers  were asked to pick the most important issue from a list of 12  35 percent said  jobs and the economy   24 percent said  the size and role of the federal government   and 21 5 percent said  national debt and the deficit   Asked the most important quality they were seeking in a candidate  more voters answered  takes a strong stand   32 percent  than anything else  Is there a candidate in the race who has taken stronger stands than Paul  Who has focused more directly and consistently on those top three issues than Paul  How has Paul overcome his often wacky  sometimes indefensible foreign policy views  In a state that historically has some strong non interventionist tendencies  it doesn t take much    If  Paul were to win the Iowa caucuses  he would likely do so with something like a quarter of the vote  He won t be the nominee  But a quarter of Iowa caucus voters will have rewarded a traditional grassroots campaign and a message of aggressive free market solutions to our problems  and will at the same time have chosen to send a message about the weakness of the rest of the field  If they do this  why couldn t one say the Republicans of Iowa are doing their job  As for Ron Paul and a third party bid  Karl Rove notes the following in his  Predictions for 2012  column for the Wall Street Journal  After failing to win the GOP presidential nomination  Ron Paul will not run as a third party candidate because that would put his son  Rand Paul  in an untenable position  Does the Republican senator from Kentucky support his father and effectively re elect Mr  Obama  or back his party and defeat him  But as another piece in the Journal points out this week  if Paul doesn t run as a Libertarian  former New Mexico Gov  Gary Johnson is expected to seek that party s nomination  while the nonpartisan group Americans Elect is now on 13 state ballots  including Florida and Ohio  two key swing states  and supposedly will have completed paperwork to get on 30 ballots by the end of this week  Which begs the obvious question  does Donald Trump go this route  It s largely an online affair  He wouldn t have to shake any hands  an act he detests I always get a kick out of the polls that say a majority of Americans view President Obama as  likeable   regardless of whether they approve of his performance  What cracks me up is that he doesn t like people  We had another example of this in an article by Helene Cooper of the New York Times this week  Air Force One had just landed in Manchester  N H   on a brisk Tuesday morning last month when President Obama made an admission to Valerie B  Jarrett  his close friend and senior adviser    I just called Reggie   Mr  Obama said  It was his first domestic trip without Reggie Love  the former Duke University basketball player who had been his constant companion and presidential  body man  until he left in November to study for his M B A  full time   I miss him   the president confessed  More noteworthy than Mr  Obama s spending the short flight calling his longtime aide is what he did not do  schmooze with Washington politicians  No one from the New Hampshire Congressional delegation traveled with Mr  Obama on the plane  a perk that presidents often offer to lawmakers to foster good will  Mr  Obama  in general  does not go out of his way to play the glad handing  ego stroking presidential role he keeps Congress and official Washington at arm s length  spending his down time with a small   and shrinking   inner circle of aides and old friends   His relationship with Washington insiders is described by members of both parties as  remote    distant  and  perfunctory       It s about building relationships   said Gerald Rafshoon  a television producer who was President Jimmy Carter s communications director   Some people are saying he s a recluse  You don t want that reputation  He needs to show that he likes people   Don t agree  Reminder I noted some thoughts of Michael Goodwin   New York Post  in my 10 15 2011 WIR on this very topic  The reports are not good  disturbing even  I have heard basically the same story four times in the last 10 days  and the people doing the talking are in New York and Washington and are spread across the political spectrum  The gist is this  President Obama has become a lone wolf  a stranger to his own government  He talks mostly  and sometimes only  to friend and adviser Valerie Jarrett and to David Axelrod  his political strategist  Everybody else  including members of his Cabinet  have little face time with him except for brief meetings that serve as photo ops  Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner both have complained  according to people who have talked to them  that they are shut out of important decisions  The president s workdays are said to end early  often at 4 p m  He usually has dinner in the family residence with his wife and daughters  then retreats to a private office  One person said he takes a stack of briefing books  Others aren t sure what he does  According to a survey by the Pew Hispanic Center  Obama leads Romney by 68 percent to 23 percent  even as Hispanic adults disapprove with the way the administration is handling deportations of illegal immigrants  by 59 percent to 27 percent  His job approval rating among Hispanic voters is at 54 percent  nine points lower than last year   The latest Washington Post ABC News poll had Obama s overall job approval at 49 percent   The latest Gallup Poll has Obama s approval rating among Hispanics at 60 percent  In 2008  Obama won the Hispanic vote over John McCain by a 67 31 margin   Peter Wallstein   Washington Post Democratic Sen  Ben Nelson  70  announced his retirement in heavily Republican Nebraska  giving the GOP another opening  Nelson joins fellow conservative Democratic senators Jim Webb  Va   and Kent Conrad  N D   in bowing out  as the Republicans have a great shot at picking up the four seats they need to get back in the majority   Nelson would have been vulnerable due to his vote for Obamacare  The other week I was talking about how the United States needs to drastically reduce its troop strength in Europe  some 52 000 strong  of which 40 000 are in the Army   In 2012  the U S  is indeed reducing its troop level to the lowest since before the Cold War  cutting 4 000 or so On another topic I ve discussed before  reducing the ranks of generals and admirals  Craig Whitlock of the Washington Post reports  Pentagon officials said they have eliminated 27 jobs for generals and admirals since March  the first time the Defense Department has imposed such a reduction since the aftermath of the Cold War  when the collapse of the Soviet Union prompted the military to downsize  The cuts are part of a broader plan to shrink the upper ranks by 10 percent over five years  restoring them to their size when the country was last at peace  before the attacks of Sept  11  2001  Good we have former Sec  of Defense Robert Gates to thank for setting this in motion  But far more needs to be done  As Vice Adm  William E  Gortney  director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon and appointed by Gates to review the number of top officers  said   If 10 years of combat have taught us anything  it s that flat is faster   It s not just about saving a few dollars  it s about being more nimble  Sen  Lindsey Graham  R S C   is among those supporting the Pentagon s efforts in this area  But others have said the Pentagon isn t moving fast enoughCraig Whitlock notes   Benjamin Freeman  a national security analyst said the number of generals and admirals on active duty stood at 970 as of Sept  30  That represented an increase of six active duty positions from March  when Gates ordered the cuts  I get so sick of this crap  and while Freeman expressed deep disappointment  I find it depressing more Americans don t know or give a damn about their bloated and deeply corrupt Pentagon  Again  check out my  Hot Spots  link on the topic  I have to admit I cracked a smile upon hearing that the hacker network  Anonymous  stole thousands of credit card numbers from the U S  intelligence outfit  Stratfor  because I don t respect Stratfor s work  Just an opinion  but it s highly overrated  as is  quite frankly  the CIA  as they have proved time and time again  Remember when the CIA said Fidel Castro was near death and your editor wrote  Castro will not die  on 12 30 06  referring to 2007 Of course at the same time  it would be highly disturbing if Anonymous released stolen emails that compromised various sources Stratfor has  even if many of these same folks are worthless New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was able to brag about the past decade being New York s safest ever  in terms of fire deaths and murders  both near record lows  though I wish he d wait until New Year s Day to tout the statistics  I m superstitious  you see   As of Dec  28  64 people had died in fires this year  second only to last year s record low 62  so the mayor can rightfully say response time hasn t been hurt despite some high profile budget cuts  In 1969  by comparison  310 people died in fires And on the murder front  there were 500 through Dec  27  compared to 523 last year  Back in the crack epidemic years  before Rudy Giuliani took over  there were over 2 000 Howard Bryant   ESPN The Magazine  on the horrible year in college sports  The NCAA   under assault from its college football programs that are bigger than it  fearful that its basketball programs will realize the same  facing its long standing hypocrisy of generating billions at the expense of its athletes   knows its empire is collapsing  Now the child sexual abuse scandals at Penn State and Syracuse have destroyed another previously impervious front  the myth of coach as great moral influence   Like the rest of the NCAA foundations that have proven to be fraudulent  there s no believing in the coach as guide ideal anymore  The lie of it has been exposed  the rot setting in  as the game s biggest  richest names run from perhaps the most damaging crisis in the history of college athletics  counting their money  staying quiet  nervously checking the headlines in the hopes that their program isn t next  And now my selection for  Week in Review Person of the Year   For my purposes it must go to a political figure  the consequences of governance  or lack thereof  being central to what we explore in this column  As you can see below  if there is no obvious choice  I m not naming one  I also stretched the definition a little in naming Gen  Petraeus  and Bernanke   but his position was as political as they come  I also readily admit  in hindsight  that these selections may have peaked the year chosen 2001   George W  Bush2002   no one citing  unfinished business in Iraq 2003   George W  Bush  Tony Blair  John Howard2004   Hamid Karzai2005   Ariel Sharon2006   no one2007   Gen  David Petraeus and Defense Sec  Robert Gates2008   Gen  Petraeus and Sec  Gates2009   Ben Bernanke2010   David Cameron2011   no one let me explain I stare at a big world map on the wall across from my desk all day and spent some good time scouring it for ideas this year  All of the above were deemed to have made positive contributions  For the life of me  I can t find one national figure who fits the bill for 2011    If I wanted  I could be cute and name Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie as two governors who got things done in 2011  thus proving leadership matters  but their spheres of influence are too small So  sorry I know this is wimpy but I ve been decrying the lack of leadership in the world for years  2011 proves it As for  Dirtball of the Year   this is given to the person s  who has most negatively impacted the lives of millions 2000   Robert Mugabe2001   Osama bin Laden2002   Mugabe2003   Saddam Hussein and bin Laden2004   Abu Musab al Zarqawi2005   Zarqawi2006   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad2007

122144,343659,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,Days before the Iowa caucuses  the Des Moines Register released its final poll Mitt Romney 24 percentRon Paul 22Rick Santorum 15Newt Gingrich 12Rick Perry 11Michele Bachmann 7Then the votes came in Romney 30 015 24 6Santorum 30 007 24 5Paul 26 219 21 4Gingrich 16 251 13 3Perry 12 604 10 3Bachmann 6 073 5Just a few weeks ago  Santorum registered 5 percent  or less  in most of the surveys  You can see the Des Moines Register and others pretty much nailed the final tally except for the former Pennsylvania senator s vote and his remarkable surge As for Perry and Bachmann  the former has opted to focus solely on South Carolina in an attempt to restart his campaign  while Bachmann dropped out  Not that it was particularly bold  but I did say last week   I ll be shocked if  Bachmann  gets 7 percent and moves on to New Hampshire  Speaking of which  Suffolk University has a respected tracking poll and it shows Romney 41Paul 18Santorum 8Huntsman 7Gingrich 7But a different survey has the Top three now at 40  17  11 again  with Santorum surging a bit while the others tread water  I was listening to the guy from Suffolk and he thought Santorum would peak at 11 12 percent  Romney is gaining the most from women  incidentally  and this is where Ann Romney has been a plus  I m not a fan  The same professor  sorry  forget his name   who made his name nailing the 2008 Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primaries  said that in  08  Mike Huckabee won with 35 percent to Romney s 25 in Iowa  but then Huckabee only did 11 percent in New Hampshire  this gentleman drawing the same parallels with Santorum After New Hampshire on Tuesday comes South Carolina  Jan  21  and on Friday  CNN ORC released a poll from that state Romney 37 percent surprising strengthSantorum 19Gingrich 18Paul 12Ah yes  it s going to be quite an election year  When I saw Newt Gingrich on Thursday  he said he wanted to open with a statement on President Obama s recess appointments for both the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the pro union activist National Labor Relations Board  Gingrich said Obama s moves were unconstitutional because the appointments were made even though the Senate isn t actually in recess  Yes  the president has the power to make such appointments  including the three new members of the NLRB  but as the New York Post editorialized  Obama is the first president to declare that he  and he alone  can decide whether the Senate   which must confirm his picks   is actually meeting   In order to block recess appointments  the Senate intentionally has been holding pro forma sessions every few days  each of which lasts only a few seconds  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid   with then Sen  Obama s support   did the same thing in 2007 to block any recess appointments by President George W  Bush  But now Obama  with Reid s concurrence  contends that such sessions are actually  gimmicks    and that the Senate is in recess  So much for the separation of powers and the carefully calibrated system of checks and balances that are hallmarks of the U S  constitutional system  Obama  of course  plans to run for reelection against Congress  painting it as Wall Street s puppet  But what he did yesterday was no shot across the bow  it was  rather  a direct hit   with the Constitution taking the brunt of the blow  Robert Samuelson   Washington Post Could 2012 turn conventional wisdom on its head  Here s the conventional wisdom  President Obama s reelection is vulnerable to the weak economy and high joblessness  Here s what might happen  The economy gradually improves  and although unemployment stays high  exceeding 8 percent   what counts politically is the palpable sense that things are moving in the right direction  This allows Obama to argue  as he already does  that his policies are slowly repairing the economic calamity he inherited from Republicans  To which they respond  Obama s anti business rhetoric and policies have impeded recovery  the Affordable Care Act   Obamacare   and new regulations create uncertainties that deter hiring  and Obama hasn t dealt with the explosion of federal debt  Just which narrative triumphs may well determine the election  If Obama convinces Americans that he s set a course for a stronger recovery  then he wins  If the Republicans successfully cast his policies as producing prolonged stagnation  they win  Though the debate matters  the economy s actual performance   for better or worse   will decide how many Americans feel  And this will depend on forces and events over which the candidates have little or no control  David Brooks   New York Times This year  Romney is trying to establish some emotional bond with the working class by waging a hyperpatriotic campaign  I may be the son of a millionaire with a religion that makes you uncomfortable  but I love this country just like you  The strategy appears to be only a partial success  Enter Rick Santorum  Santorum is the grandson of a coal miner and the son of an Italian immigrant  For years  he represented the steel towns of western Pennsylvania  He has spent the last year scorned by the news media   working relentlessly  riding around in a pickup truck to more than 370 towns  He tells that story of hard work and elite disrespect with great fervor at his meetings  His worldview is not individualistic  His book   It Takes a Family   was infused with the conservative wing of Catholic social teaching  It was a broadside against Barry Goldwater style conservatism in favor of one that emphasized family and social solidarity  While in Congress  he was a leader in nearly every serious piece of antipoverty legislation  On the stump  he cries   The left has a religion  too  It s just not based on the Bible  It s based on the religion of self     He is not a representative of the corporate or financial wing of the party His economic arguments are couched as values arguments  If you want to enhance long term competitiveness  you need to strengthen families  If companies want productive workers  they need to be embedded in wholesome communities   If you took a working class candidate from the right  like Santorum  and a working class candidate from the left  like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio  and you found a few islands of common ground  you could win this election by a landslide  The country doesn t want an election that is Harvard Law versus Harvard Law  You know who I was impressed with the other day in an interview with Wolf Blitzer  Sen  Rand Paul  Not that I agreed with him  as he backed his father s policies  but I was blown away by his superior knowledge of foreign affairs compared to just about all the Republican candidates in the field  Since father and son  though  don t believe in a mainstream foreign policy  I was struck by how maybe it is Rand  not the father  who is the viable third party candidate someday   Rand could easily change his party affiliation to  independent  and just caucus with the Republicans for now I was talking to a local Republican county chairman up in Plymouth and was startled by how extensive voter fraud is in New Hampshire  according to him  The state has same day registration and all you need to do is show ID  The problem is this includes student IDs  so he said the kids run around voting multiple times  and up here that means they are voting predominantly Democrat So my new friend said that challengers actually do their job in New Hampshire and one guy asked a kid for different ID and the kid produced an envelope with his address on it  Then the kid realized what he had done  panicked  and ran off  What was on the envelope  It was his absentee ballot application for Massachusetts President Obama unveiled his plans for a slimmed down military  Last year the administration and Congress agreed on  450 billion in cuts over the next decade  on top of earlier cuts to weapons programs  and the potential for another  500 billion in cuts next January as a result of  sequestration   unless Congress acts on finding other ways to reduce spending  1 2 trillion  again per previous agreement as part of the summer s debt ceiling debate I ve made it clear where I stood  There are lots of areas to cut defense spending  particularly on the procurement front  But as the Wall Street Journal editorializes  what makes this round of cuts different is the growing entitlement state  The administration is making a political choice and sparing Social Security  Medicare and Medicaid  which are set to hit nearly 11  of GDP by 2020  And that s before  2 6 trillion for Obamacare  which will surely cost more   Part of the problem is that military personnel costs are exploding on pace to exceed the entire defense budget by 2030  according to Andrew Krepinevich of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments  It s hard to make the political and moral case to reduce benefits for veterans and soldiers  but here s where  Defense Secretary  Panetta could show mettle on Capitol Hill  especially by reforming military health care  The bulk of any defense budget is better spent on equipment  training and research   The real message to the world is that the Administration wants to scale back U S  leadership  This was part of the rationale behind the White House s reluctance to take the initiative in the Middle East last year  as well as the attempts to mollify Iran s mullahs and Russia s Vladimir Putin   President Obama ended his remarks yesterday by quoting Dwight Eisenhower on  the need to maintain balance among national programs   The line comes from his 1961 Farewell Address  better known as the  military industrial complex  speech  Mr  Obama s new defense posture brings to mind another Eisenhower line offered two years earlier   Weakness in arms often invites aggression   Back to the issue of military personnel costs  the Pentagon currently spends  181 billion  a third of its budget  on this item   107 billion for salaries and allowances   50 billion for health care and  24 billion in retirement pay The park ranger killed in

122179,343694,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Iran  A new clock is ticking the time from when the U N  s International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  issued its long awaited report on Iran s suspected nuclear arms program  Nov  8  and the 2012 presidential election in the United States  next Nov  6  I have argued for weeks that should the Obama administration feel compelled to take military action against Iran  it will be next spring because the White House cannot afford to have Iran test a nuclear weapon after next Labor Day at the height of the presidential campaign as it would spell the end for the Obama presidency   This happened under your watch  Mr  President   the Republican nominee would repeat over and over again during the debates Now most experts say that Iran won t have a nuclear capability until 2013 at the very earliest   I just argue there isn t a soul in the Western World  or Israel  who really knows how far advanced Iran is  and my point on fixing the spring as the date for action  assuming any efforts at increased sanctions against the Iranian government go nowhere  is because Obama needs time for damage control  as would probably be inevitable  before Americans went to the polls  Trust me  should the White House act next year it will be as much about our election as anything else  That s simply the way our corrupt system works So what did the IAEA say  The agency found some of Iran s activities pertained to civilian applications but others were  specific to nuclear weapons development   The IAEA had acquired more than 1 000 pages of documents relating to Iran s program  sourced from the agency and 10 of its member states  as well as from Iran itself  All of this information  taken together  gave rise to concerns about possible military dimensions to Iran s nuclear program   the report stated  Other intelligence provided to the agency pointed to Iran s construction of  a large explosives containment vessel  at a previously little known site called Parchin that could be used for nuclear related testing The report also shows that Iran worked to redesign and miniaturize a Pakistani nuclear weapon design   It is a very  very well thought out program and it is clear they are proceeding relentlessly with it   as a senior research fellow  Ephraim Asculai  of Tel Aviv University put it  But the quarterly report stopped short of claiming that Tehran is determined to acquire atomic weapons The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  Republican Mike Rogers  said the findings heightened fears Israel would launch an attack without world action on sanctions  urging President Obama to tighten economic measures  including cutting the supply of refined fuel to Iran and targeting its central bank For his part  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a simple  yet pointed  statement  The significance of the report is that the international community must bring about the cessation of Iran s pursuit of nuclear weapons  which endanger the peace of the world and of the Middle East  But while the U S   France and Britain have called for a new sanctions regime unless Iran comes clean  permanent U N  Security Council members Russia and China will block such efforts  China s Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Friday   Dialogue and cooperation is the most effective way to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue  Sanctions and pressure cannot fundamentally solve it  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said   We should exhale  calm down and continue a constructive discussion of all issues on the Middle East agenda  including the Iranian nuclear program   adding a military strike on Iran could be a  catastrophe   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned the  arrogant  West s talk of a strike Of course both Russia and China seek to protect their commercial interests in Iran  first and foremost As for Iran s position  President Ahmadinejad said   Unfortunately  there is someone in charge of the IAEA who not only has no authority but tramples upon the IAEA laws and only echoes U S  words   On Thursday Ayatollah Ali Khamenei weighed in  saying his country was the victim of  Iranophobia  mounted by the West and Israel to justify a possible pre emptive strike   If the thought of invasion against the Islamic republic of Iran crosses anybody s mind he must ready himself to receive a strong slap and iron fist  The enemies  especially the United States and its puppets and the Zionist regime  should know that the Iranian nation will not invade any country or nation  but it will respond to any invasion or threat with full force in a way that it will break up invaders from within   said the Son of Satan  France s Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe  warned   If Iran refuses to conform to the demands of the international community and refuses any serious cooperation  we stand ready to adopt  with other wiling countries  sanctions on an unprecedented scale  At week s end  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said any military strike on Iran would have a  serious impact  on the region and possibly U S  forces there  without having any real impact on Iran s nuclear program   You ve got to be careful of unintended consequences here   Meanwhile  the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the U S   has quietly drawn up plans to provide  the United Arab Emirates  with thousands of advanced  bunker buster  bombs and other munitions  part of a stepped up U S  effort to build a regional coalition to counter Iran   The UAE is seen as the most hawkish against Iran in the region  at least as much so as Saudi Arabia  and its air force could act as an American proxy if called upon  The Pentagon is also arming the Saudis and Oman with advanced fighter jets and munitions Editorial   Wall Street Journal  The IAEA s  14 page annex detailing the state of Iran s weapons work should  keep you up at night   It lays to rest the fantasies that an Iranian bomb is many years off  or that the intelligence is riddled with holes and doubts  or that the regime s intentions can t be guessed by their activities  So much  then  for the December 2007 National Intelligence Estimate  which asserted  with high confidence  that Iran had abandoned its nuclear weapons work in 2003 and ended any chance that the Bush administration would take action against Iran  So much  too  for the Obama administration s attempts to move Iran away from its nuclear course  first with diplomatic offers and then with sanctions and covert operations  The serious choice now before the administration is between military strikes and more of the same  As the IAEA report makes painfully clear  more of the same means a nuclear Iran  possibly within a year  It s time  then  to consider carefully what that choice means for the United States  In the run up to the war in Iraq  we wrote that  the law of unintended consequences hasn t been repealed   and that  no war ever goes precisely as planned   That was obviously true of a boots on the ground invasion  but it would also be true of an aerial campaign to demolish or substantially degrade Iran s nuclear facilities   The question for the world  and especially for the Obama administration  is whether those dire consequences  Ed  including potential nuclear war as an Iranian bomb leads to nuclear proliferation in the region  are worse than the risks of a pre emptive strike  We think we know what the Israelis will decide  especially if they conclude that President Obama stays on his current course  Opponents of a pre emptive strike say it would do no more than delay Iran s programs by a few years  But something similar was said after Israel s strike on Iraq s Osirak reactor in 1981  without which the U S  could never have stood up to Saddam after his invasion of Kuwait  In life as in politics  nothing is forever  But a strike that sets Iran s nuclear programs back by several years at least offers the opportunity for Iran s democratic forces to topple the regime without risking a wider conflagration   No U S  president could undertake a strike on Iran except as a last resort  and Mr  Obama can fairly say that he has given every resort short of war an honest try  At the same time  no U S  president should leave his successor with the catastrophe that would be a nuclear Iran  A nuclear Iran on Mr  Obama s watch would be fatal to more than his legacy  The IAEA s 35 nation board meets this coming Thursday and Friday to decide whether to report Iran to the U N  Security Council Israel  Talk about a diplomatic disaster  French President Nicolas Sarkozy and President Obama didn t realize a private conversation at the recent G20 summit in Cannes was overheard by a number of journalists and inadvertently transmitted over a system used for translation  Sarkozy says of Benjamin Netanyahu   I can t see him anymore  he s a liar   Obama retorted   You may be sick of him  but me  I have to deal with him every day     While Israeli media played it up  Israeli officials kept their mouths shut Syria  I reached out to my friend in Beirut this week  wondering why he hadn t written anything recently  and in learning he was on vacation I asked him about the border issues between Syria and Lebanon  voicing my own concerns  Michael observed   Very nasty and it will get worse  I fear   Seeing as there is no bigger expert on the region than he  in my humble opinion  this says it all  Lebanon s president  Michel Sleiman  confirmed this week that Syria was mining the border with Lebanon to prevent arms smuggling to the Syrian opposition  as well as prevent dissidents from fleeing into Lebanon And after the Arab League and Syria supposedly reached agreement on ending the violence against protesters  ten days ago  Bashar Assad s regime continued the killing  another 20  on Thursday alone  a reported 18 on Friday as I write   as the U N  estimates the toll at 3 500   I listed a figure of 4 000 last week  which was from various human rights groups  the same groups the U N  is relying on   The epicenter of the violence remains Homs  where fighting between army defectors and soldiers has been intense in pockets  while elsewhere Assad s goons round up suspects a la Hitler s SS Separately  Syria stopped paying for oil produced within the country by Royal Dutch Shell and Total  as reported by the Financial Times  further evidence of the regime s unease amid the pro democracy protests and economic sanctions  Oil export earnings  some  3 5 billion a year  have been hit by an embargo imposed by the European Union  The oil companies had continued to pump the crude  despite not being paid  but now the government ordered them to cut output because storage capacity has been met owing to the EU embargo The only encouraging item this week was a story in the Jerusalem Post that Assad is being offered asylum by several Arab leaders  this according to U S  Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman  formerly an excellent ambassador to Lebanon  as I recall  Meanwhile  the U S  is investigating reports that Syrian leaders are moving their cash into Lebanese banks  this as there are increased concerns that Palestinian groups loyal to Damascus are once again taking root in Lebanon  the last thing this Hizbullah led country needs  One group I never heard of  Saiga  a pro Syrian Palestinian faction  has  restructured and a younger generation has taken the leadership    Daily Star  You read something like this and you understand how the war on terror will never be over in our lifetime that is if you needed further proof Lastly  Lebanese opposition leader Saad Hariri said he would not attempt to topple the Hizbullah government and would wait for 2013 parliamentary elections instead  But Hariri really needs to return to the country  seeing as how he s been holed up in Paris  I understand the assassination threats  but he s doing his people zero good in France  Iraq  I would encourage you to visit my  Hot Spots  link for an analysis of how the United States  imminent withdrawal  is the mother of all disasters   Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki is a bad guy and he continues a purge of leading Sunni figures  particularly in the security apparatus under the guise of ridding Iraq of Baathists  Remember  Maliki is still acting defense and interior minister  since the elections of 2010  He s nothing more than Tehran s puppet  It s Sunni vs  Shiite all over again  and the U S  won t be there to keep the peace  while al Qaeda looks for openings to reignite the civil war  As Maj  Gen  Jeffrey Buchanan  the top American military spokesman in Iraq  told the New York Times   I cringe whenever anybody makes a pronouncement that al Qaeda is on its last legs  Meanwhile  ExxonMobil became the first major oil company to sign a contract with Kurdistan s Regional Government to explore for oil and gas  It s a huge vote of confidence for the semi autonomous region  but Exxon could face a backlash in Baghdad  which believes the contracts are illegitimate  Under a landmark deal with the central government  Kurdistan receives half of all revenue from the oil it can export India   Pakistan  Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said this week that the two rivals needed to open a new chapter in their relationship amid signs of a warming in ties between the nuclear armed nations  A week earlier  Pakistan announced it would normalize trade with India  Singh met with Pakistani Prime Minister Gilani and praised him as a man of peace This all sounds great  but the terrorists have zero incentive for allowing peace to break out  or as Pakistani Foreign Minister Khar said   We have many  many long miles to move ahead still   And the U S  Embassy in Islamabad on Monday acknowledged the existence of a  potential threat  to Pakistan s nuclear warheads from local extremists  according to a press report out of India  Also  as reported by the Global Security Newswire   The Atlantic and National Journal jointly reported that the Pakistani army had taken to transporting nuclear warheads around the country via unmarked civilian style vans on congested roadways in an attempt to keep their whereabouts away from prying U S  intelligence efforts  Boy  that makes me feel a lot better  Of course it was just a month or so ago that U S  Sec  of State Hillary Clinton told us all not to worry about the safety of Pakistan s nukes  I can t remember if she cackled after saying this North Korea  This little hellhole is not going away in terms of its potential to ruin our day and roil global markets further  This week a senior South Korean officials said North Korea s uranium enrichment program at Yongbyon was now a  small industry   capable of generating nuclear weapons  It was one year ago Pyongyang revealed its uranium work  U S  specialists at that time were allowed to tour a plant that contained 2 000 centrifuges  The official asserted the North could make one to two bombs a year just from this  known  operation on top of the existing stockpile  estimated last I saw at 8 to 12 weapons China   Speaking of nukes  according to a report from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  China appears to be fielding four new nuclear ready ballistic missiles  someone tell Herman Cain  and is spending an increasing amount on developing bombs for use on longer range missiles Authors Hans Kristensen and Robert Norris estimate that China now possesses 240 nuclear weapons as well as some 140 ballistic missiles fielded on land  72 missiles with ranges that can hit U S  targets and 40 capable of striking the U S  mainland But China has had trouble  according to Kristensen and Norris  in developing a sea based platform for its nuclear warheads  They add  China s main concern is the survivability of its minimum nuclear deterrent  and it spends considerable resources on dispersing and hiding its land based missiles   The U S  government has complained for years that China is too opaque regarding its military forces and budgets and that it needs to be more open    Global Security Newswire Meanwhile  the chiefs of China s leading information technology companies said they would cooperate with the government s efforts to more strictly police the Internet and online media  The CEOs of 39 internet  telecom and computer groups reached a  consensus  that internet companies  must strengthen self control  self restraint and strict self discipline   as reported by official news agency Xinhua and the Financial Times  Kathrin Hille   Love the spelling of  Kathrin   I have to add  Now we wait to see how this is implemented and the reaction among China s 500 million Internet users Finally  last week I mentioned dissident Ai Weiwei and his  2 million  tax bill  but since the government said it was hitting him up for this  which he vehemently disputes  over  800 000 has come flooding in from supporters  a figure as of Tuesday so easily higher now   A government mouthpiece  The Global Times  said the donations may violate the law   Since he s borrowing from the public  it at least looks like illegal fund raising  Ai is uncertain as to what to do with the money because to hand it to the government is an admission of guilt   I haven t had a chance this morning to read a report that says he s thinking of paying off half of the bill with the proceeds  Nigeria  Last weekend was a horrible one here as the Islamic militant group Boko Haram launched a wave of coordinated attacks  killing more than 150 in a single day  The group is bent on the imposition of Sharia throughout Nigeria and took responsibility for the suicide bombers  A spokesman said   We will continue attacking federal government formations until security forces stop persecuting our members and vulnerable civilians   Aside from military barracks  six churches were blown up in one Christian neighborhood   Initially  the death toll was said to be in the 60s  but then a Red Cross official went into the morgue and counted at least 150 bodies personally  Australia  President Obama will be here next week and he ll announce at that time that the United States will begin rotating troops through an Australian base in Darwin  intensifying the alliance as the China threat grows  2 3s of all Marines are based in the Pacific  with large concentrations on Guam and Okinawa  where new Chinese long range missiles make the forces there highly vulnerable  thus the thought of repositioning some of them  Both Obama and Aussie Prime Minister Gillard will argue China has nothing to do with the decision cough cough Some Aussie analysts say this is a highly risky move for Australia and its own relations with China  a critical trading partner Nicaragua and Guatemala  I have to admit I didn t realize President Daniel Ortega  eviscerated  the constitution  Los Angeles Times  to become eligible for a third term in Nicaragua as he was reelected in last weekend s vote  while in Guatemala  a true narco state controlled by Mexican drug cartels these days  a retired army general  Otto Perez Molina  appears to have won the race there though he s helpless to stop the violence Remember when Latin America was democratizing across the continent  That is hardly the case today Mexico  In a huge blow to President Calderon s efforts to combat the drug cartels  his top cabinet secretary in the effort  Jose Francisco Blake Mora  was killed in a helicopter crash on Friday that claimed seven other lives  including government officials  Bad weather appears to be the initial cause ,2011-11-17,Brian Trumbore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/week-in-review-part-iii:-foreign-affairs-105890,105890

In the Washington Post ABC poll  70  say the allegations against Herman Cain make no difference in their vote   Editorial   The Economist The European Union may seem the epitome of political dysfunction  but America has been running it close  All this year the deadlock between the Republicans in Congress and Mr  Obama has meant that precious little serious legislation has been passed  The president s jobs bill is stuck  the House of Representatives  budget plans have been scuppered by the Democrat controlled Senate  At the end of this year temporary tax cuts and other measures  worth around 2  of GDP  are set to expire   which could push America back into recession   The right is mostly to blame  Ronald Reagan  a divorcee who did little for the pro life lobby and raised taxes when he had to  would never be nominated today  Mr  Romney  like all the Republican presidential candidates  recently pledged to reject tax rises  even as part of a deal where spending cuts would be ten times bigger  Mr  Cain surged briefly to the front of the pack because of a plan that would cut personal taxes to 9   Mr  Perry lost support for wanting to educate the children of illegal immigrants  Meanwhile  in Congress  the few remaining pragmatic Republican centrists  like Senator Richard Lugar  are being hunted down by tea party activists  Mr  Obama has tried harder to compromise  But he foolishly failed to embrace a long term budget solution put forward by the bipartisan Simpson Bowles commission  which he himself appointed  Ever since the furor over the debt ceiling this summer  he has  pivoted  to the left  dabbling in class war  promising his supporters that the budget can be solved by taxing  millionaires and billionaires    The divisiveness is hardly new  but it is increasingly structural  As the battle for billions of campaign dollars heats up  neither side dares grant the other any modicum of success  or risk the ire of its donors by appearing to compromise    As part of the above NBC News Wall Street Journal survey  57  of those who voted for Republican John McCain in 2008 say they are more enthusiastic to vote in the coming election than past elections

embarrassing  Of course it was  John Podhoretz   New York Post The Titanic like campaign of Texas Gov  Rick Perry crashed into the iceberg of his own brain at 9 18 EST last night  Perry  who entered the race as an immediate frontrunner in August and then sank like a stone after a series of wretched debate performances  outdid himself with the most embarrassing single televised minute any important American politician has ever inflicted upon himself  Ever  In history   We saw a moment of utter blankness  of paralyzed thought  that offered the perfect illustration of why people tell pollsters they fear public speaking more than they fear death   It wouldn t have meant anything if it had happened to Mitt Romney  who is so fluid by now that he sounds like a carnival barker trying to tempt you into seeing the Hall of Wonders  Or to Newt Gingrich  who has been liberated by the ultimate pointlessness of his campaign into a genuinely refreshing devil may care looseness  Such a moment for either man might have humanized him  might have suggested that they had some commonality with ordinary folk and were not simply Terminator 2012s programmed by Skynet to speak perfect Republican blarney  Not Perry  He literally had no margin for error coming into last night s event in Michigan   His only hope of reviving his damaged candidacy was to deliver unexpectedly brilliant performances in public events  Well  he was unexpected last night   we thought he couldn t possibly have been any more unimpressive than he had been previously  He sure surprised us    As for Herman Cain and the women accusing him of sexual harassment  the AP reported that one of Cain s accusers  Karen Kraushaar  filed a complaint  not of sexual harassment but of unfair treatment while working as a spokeswoman at the Immigration and Naturalization Service  three years after she settled a sexual harassment complaint against Cain with the assistance of the same lawyer  Joel Bennett  It s complicated  but I want to wait 24 hours when it comes to Kraushaar and another 24 hours  a week  before commenting further on Cain  Hopefully it takes care of itself and I don t have to   There were few big issues in Tuesday s elections  but Ohio voters rejected a new law sharply restricting public worker s collective bargaining rights  important as Ohio is going to once again be a real battleground state in the 2012 presidential election  It was also seen as a referendum on Ohio Rep  Gov  John Kasich And Atlanta approved Sunday alcohol sales  No wonder I never seemed to stay in Atlanta on Sundays  I always left at the crack of dawn for another city  come to think of it   Editorial   Washington Post on further looming cuts to the defense budget  True  the Pentagon brass are known for pushing hard for their funding  But they rarely speak in such apocalyptic tones   and there is good reason to take their warnings seriously  Under President Obama s budget plan   465 billion is already due to be cut from military spending over the next decade  from an annual budget now of about  700 billion  That will already require a downsizing of the Army and Marines  the reduction or cancellation of more weapons systems and a shrinking of the Navy to its lowest size in decades  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta  a lifelong budget hawk  is rightly concerned that such cuts may go too far  If the additional sequestration goes forward  the total reduction could come to  1 trillion  This  Gen  Odierno said  would  almost eliminate our modernization programs  in the Army  including new armored vehicles  Adm  Greenert said it could force the two U S  companies that build Navy ships out of business  The Air Force would have to retire some 1 000 aircraft  In all  about 1 million military and civilian jobs would be lost   In the meantime  a bad and even dangerous message would be sent to U S  allies and adversaries   We ll have those who attempt to exploit our vulnerabilities   Gen  Odierno said   We might lose our credibility in terms of our ability to deter   Congress set this bomb in place when it agreed in the summer that half of  1 2 trillion in automatic cuts would be assessed to defense if a debt reduction plan failed to pass this year  Now it has heard from senior commanders just how much damage its explosion would cause  It would be an unconscionable act of political irresponsibility to allow their predictions to come true    I have a nephew who this year had a choice between going to Pitt or Penn State and thankfully chose the former  Otherwise  I have little to add here in the hideous case of Jerry Sandusky  having already commented exclusively in another column I do for the site  except to say that aside from wanting to know what Joe Paterno really knew all these years  like you I m trying to figure out how assistant coach  then graduate assistant  Mike McQueary lived with himself all this time after witnessing what he did back in 2002  I also just want to put in my two cents when it comes to Penn State s students  Think twice  kids  before you act like an idiot  These days it follows you everywhere  as opposed to the time of my own youth when we could get away with a lot of stuff with nothing more than personal memories as opposed to photos splashed on the Internet for all future employers to see    The Pew Research Center s Internet   American Life Project surveyed 800 children between the ages of 12 and 17 and while eight in 10 teenagers said they have developed positive feelings about themselves and forged better friendships on social networking sites  nine in 10 say they have witnessed cruelty by their peers on the same networks Pew concludes  though  that online bullying is not as common as what takes place on the schoolyard or in the hallway    According to Air Force officials  for years the Dover Air Force Base mortuary disposed of portions of troops  remains by cremating them and dumping the ashes in a landfill  The practice was abandoned in favor of burial at sea  Officials acknowledged the practice to the Washington Post  saying  the procedure was limited to fragments or portions of body parts that were unable to be identified at first or were later recovered from the battlefield  and which family members had said could be disposed of by the military  Said Gari Lynn Smith   portions of whose husband s remains were disposed of in the landfill after his 2006 death in Iraq  she was  appalled and disgusted  by the way the Air Force had acted  She learned of the landfill disposal earlier this spring in a letter from a senior official at the Dover mortuary    My only peace of mind in losing my husband was that he was taken to Dover and that he was handled with dignity  love  respect and honor   Smith said   That was completely shattered for me when I was told that he was thrown in the trash   The Dover mortuary changed its policy in 2008  No officials have been fired over their past actions  Each week there is yet another example  or two this time  including the Penn State debacle  where you see how America is falling short  It has to stop   I was reading some stories on the

122181,343696,NYT,When Everything s a Macro Trade  Look at Natural Gas,opinion,A perverse but totally understandable consequence of the current crisis is that even though it was an excess of debt that got us here  the cost of borrowing is about as low as it could get   at least in the U S   thanks to the Fed s confiscatory monetary policy  But in Europe  the cost of borrowing is rapidly reflecting the unfortunate reality that there s just been altogether too much of it On Tuesday  the FT ran an Op Ed piece by Jim Millstein   Europe s largest banks have become too big to save   I can t stop thinking about it  He makes the point that Europe s biggest banks and governments are now so intertwined that one cannot fail without the other  Europe s banking system is much larger relative to its economies than in the U S   in part because European corporate debt markets are far less developed  Banks are also loaded with government bonds  an unfortunate consequence of the old BIS capital rules assigning no risk weighting to sovereign debt of any developed country  Bankers loaded up on peripheral European debt because it yielded more than German and French bonds but owning it didn t require any greater capital  This is really the cause of today s problems  the common currency simply eliminated the foreign exchange risk  but the capital rules made the build up of risk virtually free and bankers suspended critical judgment So what we have today is a symbiotic relationship  Europe s governments sell bonds to their banks  Those banks  now sagging under the weight of mark to market losses on bonds are having to raise capital at a time of depressed equity prices  This creates the potential for Europe s governments to need to support their own banks because they already own too much of their government s debts  It s a spiral  and the standard austerity prescription from the Germans may be starting to wear thin  The New York Times notes this in an article and wonders whether  as rising bond yields spread to northern Europe  France s 10 year yields are currently 3 76    the focus on deficit reduction may lose support   All this underscores the ongoing nervousness about Europe generally and the banking sector specifically   says my friend Barry Knapp from Barclays It s not clear where it ends  and Jim Millstein s piece leads quite logically to just about the worst outcome  So what s an investor to do Well  as dire as things seem  timing equity markets is never easy and although the U S  will inevitably be dragged down by Europe s travails there is a world outside the eurozone and many stocks provide attractive return potential  We continue to be short the   in our hedge fund Within our Deep Value Equity Strategy we don t invest in banks  too much leverage for my taste  and natural gas E P names are no doubt cyclically exposed although it s hard to see how much lower the price of domestic gas can drop than the  3 40 per MCF it s at currently  Among the large E P names we like Devon Energy  which is all domestic  has an attractive exposure to liquids and trades close to the value of its proved reserves  McMoran Exploration  MMR  is a smaller and highly speculative position that will likely resolve itself by the end of the year when it gets results from its Davy Jones Flow Test  MMR had some mildly positive news earlier in the week from their Lafitte Ultra Deep Exploration Well but this company s future will likely be driven by Davy Jones  MMR will move up and down with the European debt crisis but its value really has absolutely nothing to do with the price of Italian bonds We re avoiding obvious risks such as financials  and using bottom up analysis to manage top down risks ,2011-11-18,Simon Lack,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/when-everything’s-a-macro-trade,-look-at-natural-gas-106036",106036
122182,343697,NYT,The Weekend Press Looks for Yield,opinion,Barron s ran an interesting article on places to go for higher income than high grade bonds  The writer pointed out quite accurately that ten year treasury bonds do not provide sufficient income to preserve after tax real purchasing power  The Federal government doesn t believe its creditors should earn a real return  and has adopted a policy to prevent that  The thinking investor s response is to look elsewhere and to keep more money in cash waiting for better opportunities Closed end funds  which  Reeling in the Yields  can be interesting if they trade at a discount  However  much of the market is characterized by funds that pay distributions in excess of their earnings in order to maintain a high  distribution yield   even though they are in part giving investors back their own money  Closed end funds are best owned if they re mispriced  in combination with a hedge to neutralize the NAV movements  We have owned Boulder Total Return Fund  BTF  for some time  The fund has a substantial holding in Berkshire Hathaway  BRK   and its second biggest holding is Yum Brands  YUM   BTF doesn t pay a distribution  an omission that has caused traditional closed end fund investors to shun the stock  Consequently  it trades at a 21  discount to NAV  The PM and affiliates own over a third of the shares  One day they may reinstate the distribution or engage is some other value creating exercise  In the meantime  it represents attractively priced exposure to BRK or can be hedged to focus on the discount narrowing Another area we like is Master Limited Parterships   6  tax deferred distributions with a reasonable expectation of 4 5  distribution growth  MLPs have historically outperformed stocks  bonds and REITS but remain an under invested asset class  K 1 s deter many potential investors  But MLPs  particularly the midstream firms that invest in pipelines  storage facilities and refineries have only modest exposure to energy prices and toll based fee models that create earnings stability  We think of MLPs as a good substitute for high yield bonds  Historically similar levels of price volatility but more attractive return profile Many high dividend stocks are attractive  In some cases large companies with stable earnings growth offer dividends higher than their own debt  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ  and Pepsi  PEP  are both examples  and are names that we own in our Hedged Dividend Capture Strategy  where a diversified portfolio of such names is combined with an equity market hedge seeking to profit from dividends with reduced market volatility The Fracturing of Pennsylvania was another in a series the New York Times has been running on shale gas and potential environmental damage from its extraction  We like natural gas E P names   shale gas represents an enormous source of fuel for the U S  in the years ahead  It s far cheaper than oil on a BTU equivalent basis and it s here in the politically stable U S  But it needs to be mined safely  The issue of toxins leaking into drinking water remains a vexing one  So far the science strongly suggests that the risks are extremely low  But the number of stories of undrinkable water and high levels of metals in residents bloodstream is growing  The evidence that fracking is to blame is inconclusive at best  but it s not an issue to ignore for investors or the landowners who sell drilling rights to their land  Range Resources  RRC  appears to have reacted professionally  which doesn t shock me at all having met the management  We continue to like the company but believe the stock is expensive  We prefer Devon Energy  DVN   which trades closer to the value of its proven reserves The news from Europe remains a poker game  We are short the   through owning EUO  Kyle Bass has a thought provoking perspective ,2011-11-22,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-weekend-press-looks-for-yield-106339,106339
122183,343698,NYT,Whose Fuse is Shorter ,opinion,With fiscal time bombs ticking in both Europe and the United States  the pertinent question for now seems to be which will explode first  For much of the past few months it looked as if Europe was set to blow  But Angela Merkel s refusal to support a Federal Reserve style bailout of European sovereigns and her recent statement the she had no Hank Paulson style fiscal bazooka in her handbag  has lowered the heat  In contrast  the utter failure of the Congressional Super Committee in the United States to come up with any shred of success in addressing America s fiscal problems has sparked a renewed realization that America s fuse is dangerously short  Chancellor Merkel has been emphatic that European politicians not be given a monetary crutch similar to the one relied on by their American counterparts  Her laudable goal  much derided on the editorial pages of the New York Times  is to defuse Europe s debt bomb with substantive budget reforms  and as a result to make the euro  the strongest currency in the world   Much has been made of the poorly received auction today of German Government bonds  with some saying the lack of demand  which pushed yields on 10 year German Bonds past 2    hardly indicative of panic selling  is evidence of investor unease with Merkel s economic policies  I would argue the opposite  that many investors still think that Merkel is bluffing and that eventually Germany will print and stimulate like everyone else  It is likely for this reason that yields on German debt have increased modestly In contrast  the U S  is crystal clear in its intention to ignore its debt problems  With the failure of the Super Committee this week it actually became official  American politicians will not  under any circumstances willingly confront our underlying debt crisis  While the outcome of the Super Committee shouldn t have come as a great surprise  the sheer dysfunction displayed should serve as a wakeup call for those who still harbor any desperate illusions  Some members of Congress  such as John McCain  have even come out against the  1 2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that would go into effect in January 2013  Expect more politicians of both parties to cravenly follow suit Over the next decade  the U S  government expects to spend more than  40 trillion  Even if the  1 2 trillion in automatic cuts are allowed to go through  the amount totals just 3  of the expected outlays  In a masterstroke of hypocritical accounting   216 billion of these proposed  cuts  merely represent the expected reductions in interest payments that would result from  984 billion of actual cuts  These cuts won t make a noticeable dent in our projected deficits  which if history can be any guide  will likely rise by much more as economic reality proves far gloomier than government statisticians predict  Finally  the cuts are not cuts in the ordinary sense of the word  where spending is actually reduced  They are cuts in the baseline  which means spending merely increases less than what was previously budgeted In the mean time  the prospect of sovereign default in Europe is driving  safe  haven demand for the dollar  So contrary to the political blame game  Europe s problems are actually providing a temporary boost to America s bubble economy  However  a resolution to the crisis in Europe could reverse those flows  And given the discipline emanating from Berlin  a real solution is not out of the question  If confidence can be restored there  each episodic flight to safety may be less focused on the U S  dollar  Instead  risk averse investors may prefer a basket of other  higher yielding  more fiscally sustainable currencies  The irony is that Europe is actually being criticized for its failure to follow America s lead  This misplaced criticism is based on the mistaken belief that our approach worked  It did not  Sure  it may have delayed the explosion  but only by assuring a much larger one in the future  In the mean time  many have mistaken the delay for success However  if Merkel s hard line works  and real cuts follow  Europe will be praised for blazing a different trail  As a result the euro could rally and the dollar sinks  Commodity prices will rise  putting even more upward pressure on consumer prices and interest rates in the United States Any significant reversal of the current upward dollar trend could provide a long awaited catalyst for nations holding large dollar reserves to diversify into other currencies  My guess is that Merkel understands the great advantage the U S  has enjoyed as the issuer of the world s reserve currency  I believe she covets that prize for Europe  and based on her strategy  it is clearly within her reach  There is an old saving that one often does not appreciate what one has until it s lost  The nearly criminal foolishness now on display in Washington may finally force the rest of the world to cancel our reserve currency privileges  The loss may give Americans a profound appreciation of this concept ,2011-11-24,Euro

122184,343699,NYT,Why We Should Borrow in   and Invest in Natural Gas,opinion,As the reality sets in of guiding 26 countries  i e  the EU less Britain  towards agreement on a common set of revisions to the Treaty  the smug satisfaction of the tabloid press and at least a substantial minority of the British population is almost palpable even here on the U S  side of the Atlantic  One by one  other member nations are commenting on the challenges of not only finding agreement but then achieving ratification through 26 parliamentary processes  The FT has a good synopsis of the growing acknowledgment of challenges ahead  The UK has to avoid any overtly self congratulatory behavior  but the truth is that for those afforded the luxury of expressing opinions unburdened by the reins of government  seeing any project related to the French founder is never dull  And there s many decades of suspicion of German power  even though the competition nowadays is thankfully economic and on the football pitch  I must confess I share many of these sentiments myself Michael Cembalest  CIO of JPMorgan s Private Bank and an eloquent  insightful observer  put it well in a recent newsletter  Likening the ongoing Euro debt crisis to Bergman s  Scenes from a Marriage   Cembalest observed that   Holding assets of countries suffocating themselves is not something that sounds very rewarding  unless prices get extremely cheap   That s the point  The prescription of austerity may be the right solution  but the widening differential in Real GDP growth between the U S  and the Euro zone  2 5 3  in 2012  is scarcely likely to make Euro zone assets attractive  The   is becoming a funding currency   a currency with reliably low interest rates for the creditworthy  or those with good collateral   Borrowing in   and investing in U S  assets   even risky assets like U S  equities   has been the right position in recent weeks and events are unfolding in a way that s likely to continue current trends  It s hard to see why the   should rally much other than on the back of short covering   and if it does  equities will surely move up as well   As a result  we continue to be long U S  equities  We like Microsoft  MSFT  in our Deep Value Equities Strategy  at 7X earnings after adjusting for cash on balance sheet  You re unlikely to wake up worrying about their future  although there is always the risk of an over priced acquisition with all that cash sitting around  And we are still short   through owning EUO Several weeks ago we switched our investment in Range Resources  RRC  into Devon Energy  DVN   We had liked RRC for a long time  but it had been looking less like a value stock as its price eventually doubled in a year  Shale drilling for natural gas is an area to which we ve had some exposure for almost two years  Natural gas is likely to represent an increasing share of the means of power generation in the U S  It is  1  far cheaper than crude oil on a BTU equivalent basis   2  cleaner than other fossil fuels  and  3  here in the U S   as opposed to having to be shipped through the Straits of Hormuz past Iran  RRC represents a concentrated bet on the Marcellus Shale  an enormous area that stretches from New York State to Tennessee  RRC strikes us as a well run company  and we like the management  However  challenges to the shale gas story seem to be multiplying  In August  the EIA sharply reduced its estimate of the Estimated Ultimately Recoverable  EUR  amounts of shale gas in the Marcellus  causing a huge difference between the aggregate potential reserves from all the companies drilling there and the EIA s estimate Recently the New York Times highlighted growing concern about the legality surrounding the transfer of certain drilling leases in Pennsylvania  Fracking  the technique by which drillers pump fluids  mostly water  into deep rock formations  imposing stress on rock formations that then frees up trapped natural gas  continues to be the target of environmental criticism  It has long been blamed for contaminating local drinking water  a movie  Gasland  was made to focus on this  and there have also been questions about how the fracking fluids  which are almost all water but do contain tiny amounts of very nasty chemicals  are disposed of  Just the other day the EPA blamed fracking fluids as the likely source of water contamination in Wyoming  And there s even suggestions that fracking and the disposal of fluids deep under ground can cause minor earthquakes  Added together  there s a growing source of potential problems for shale gas  Tighter environmental regulations around drilling would be fine   natural gas prices are so cheap that increased production costs across the industry would simply reduce some of the price advantage  so there shouldn t be much problem with that  But the risk remains of some environmental disaster requiring expensive remediation  Not the most likely outcome  but a concern nonetheless As a result  in Energy our biggest holding is Devon Energy  DVN   which while focused on natural gas has a significant exposure to liquids and crude oil as well  They are all domestic and trade at around the value of their proved reserves  i e  unproved and possible are thrown in for nothing   We switched our RRC holding into DVN some 2 3 months ago  and while we could have chosen better timing it s currently looking like a good move   We also own Comstock Resources  CRK   whose recent acquisition in West Texas was greeted positively by the market since it s in an area where the company is already active with continued success  And most speculatively  we own McMoran Exploration  MMR   which has nothing to do with shale gas but which is pursuing shallow water deep drilling for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico  Results from their Davy Jones flow test will be available soon and the stock will no doubt move sharply in one direction or another  The stock trades with a high beta which is not that meaningful since its ultimate value is a binary outcome based on the abovementioned flow test ,2011-12-15,Simon

122185,343700,NYT,MLPs Offer Steady Income and Exposure to Shale Gas Development,opinion,The New York Times today has a piece on Richard Kinder  founder of Kinder Morgan  KMP  the largest publicly traded partnership in the U S  KMP recently agreed to acquire El Paso Corporation to create an entity controlling 80 000 miles of pipeline crisscrossing the U S  KMP is a Master Limited Partnership  MLP   which is to say that owners of LP units  as their shares are known  own a proportional stake in the underlying assets rather than shares in a corporation  The big advantage of this structure is that there is no 35  corporate income tax  so the profits flow straight through to the unitholders without the double taxation that occurs when corporations use after tax profits to pay dividends that are themselves taxable  MLPs and KMP in particular also represent an investment in the growth of natural gas as a source of America s energy production  Cheap shale gas is increasingly being used to produce residential electricity  From 2005 2010 consumption for this purpose grew from 5 9TCFE  Trillion Cubic Feet Equivalent  to 7 4TCFE  more than 70  of the increase in total natural consumption to 24TCFE last year  according to the EIA   A shifting mix of energy sources requires new infrastructure to transport  store and refine it  which is what KMP recognizes  JPMorgan initiated coverage on the sector in October and expects  130BN in infrastructure spending over the next 10 years KMP pays a  4 64 distribution  giving a current yield of 5 9   They ve grown this distribution at a compound annual rate of 14   This is high for an MLP  but 6  annual distributions with likely growth of 4 6  over the next 2 3 years is a reasonable assumption  offering the potential for 10 12  total return  assuming multiples are unchanged   Distributions are also largely tax deferred  since much of the cash received by unitholders is classified on their K 1 as a return of capital  rather than income  Ah yes  you have to deal with a K 1 instead of a 1099  They re not for everybody  and unless you use a tax accountant and can afford to invest at least  250K in a diversified portfolio of individual names this sector is probably not for you  But for high net worth investors interested in a 6  tax deferred distribution yield with likely 4 6  growth and tolerant of K 1s  this is a sector that belongs in most portfolios  In fact  I think MLPs are a great substitute for high yield bonds  They exhibit similar levels of price volatility  in a weak equity market they can fall farther than you d like  but offer better return prospects  While unitholders do own equity interests  the overall risk return characteristics are more bond like than equity like MLPs are putting in another solid year  with the Alerian MLP Index returning 7 7  for the year through November  That s ahead of both high grade bonds  the Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index is  6   and the S P 500   1 1   over the same period Government policy is to transfer real wealth from savers to borrowers  Policy rates and bond yields are being maintained at levels so low that  after taxes and inflation savers are virtually guaranteed to lose purchasing power  Bonds have their place in a portfolio  and no doubt there are plenty of issues facing markets right now starting with the Eurozone  But given the guaranteed poor long term outlook for bonds  we think investors should be reducing their overall fixed income weighting in favor of alternative sources of income  such as MLPs  and dividend paying stocks  Retail investors have been steadily increasing their holdings of corporate debt  For example  the  iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund  LQD  has seen steady growth in outstandings all year  Corporate bonds have been strong performers for the past couple of years  but with yields on high grade bonds currently around 4   you can only make 4  and after 2 5  inflation there s about enough to pay taxes and that s it  The Federal Reserve is causing this distortion in the fixed income markets  They can keep it up for a long time  Today s fixed income investors are competing with the world s deepest pocket   it s probably time to look elsewhere ,2011-12-16,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mlps-offer-steady-income-and-exposure-to-shale-gas-development-108986,108986
122218,343733,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,There is still mass confusion over the Republican primary schedule  thanks to Florida s decision to move their date up to Jan  31  South Carolina is now Jan  21  Nevada s caucuses Jan  14 and Iowa announced this week that its caucuses would be Jan  3  So that leaves New Hampshire The problem is the state has certain laws mandating that New Hampshire be the first primary  but that it also be held seven days ahead of the next one or caucuses  New Hampshire could thus hold the primary on Jan  7  but this doesn t allow enough time after Iowa  So New Hampshire could move to December  like Dec  3 and 10 are being thought of The easy step would be for Nevada to move to Jan  17 and allow New Hampshire to hold its primary Jan  10  but Nevada  like Florida before it  is playing the role of a hole  On the other hand  New Hampshire should just hold it Jan  10  retain some goodwill  and be done with it   In a new AP GfK poll  Mitt Romney was the choice of 30  of Republicans  with Herman Cain next at 26  and Rick Perry at just 13   Among all adults surveyed  half said President Obama should not be re elected  while 46  said he should be  In hypothetical head to head matchups  Obama edges Romney  48 45  while the president takes Cain 49 43  and Perry 51 42   Obama has an overall job approval rating in the poll of 46   Significantly  among all adults  Romney s favorability rating has risen ten points since August to 49   The above polling data was taken in the days before this week s Nevada GOP debate John Podhoretz   New York Post At the moment about half an hour into last night s Republican candidate kerfuffle when it looked  seriously  like Mitt Romney and Rick Perry might haul off and start busting each other in the bazoo  it became clear that the Emmy for Best New Television Drama should go to the weekly series called  The Republican Presidential Debates     Those who are still in mourning for the series  Lost  have finally found their new obsession  The story of eight mysterious strangers trapped in an alternate reality trying to figure out how to escape an endless series of convention centers and cable channels by finally getting transported to the snows of Iowa and New Hampshire for judgment by the most mysterious force of all  The Republican primary voter   As for Herman Cain  the first 20 minutes of the debate was taken up with the glaring difficulties with his 9 9 9 tax plan  which he himself could not defend  Later he seemed unaware of or unclear about something he had said earlier in the day about prisoner swaps  Cain s moment is fast coming to an end  Perry got himself a second wind   a faint one  And Mitt Romney is still the name above the title  The next debate isn t until November  I m speaking without irony as a television watcher when I say I m very  very sad about that  Economist Arthur B  Laffer   Wall Street Journal on Herman Cain s 9 9 9  The whole purpose of a flat tax  a la 9 9 9  is to lower marginal tax rates and simplify the tax code  With lower marginal tax rates  and boy will marginal tax rates be lower with the 9 9 9 plan   both the demand for and the supply of labor and capital will increase  Output will soar  as will jobs  Tax revenues will also increase enormously   not because tax rates have increased  but because marginal tax rates have decreased  By making the tax code a lot simpler  we d allow individuals and businesses to spend a lot less on maintaining tax records  filing taxes  hiring lawyers  accountants and tax deferral experts  and lobbying Congress   Still  a number of my fellow economists don t like the retail sales component of the 9 9 9 plan  They argue that  once in place  the retail rate could be raised to the moon  They are correct  but what they miss is that any tax could be instituted in the future at a higher rate  If I could figure a way to stop future Congresses from ever raising taxes I d do it every day of the week and twice on Sunday  Until then  let s not make the perfect the enemy of the good   On Friday  Cain began tweaking his plan to exempt those below the poverty level from the 9  income tax  or 9 0 9  I was so frustrated watching Cain during the Nevada debate because he didn t come close to spelling out the positives  It s clear from the polls the people want the system blown up  He has a winning issue  Cain just needs a good adviser to show him how to sell it    Speaking of the Nevada debate  where Rick Santorum lambasted Mitt Romney for his health care record as Massachusetts governor  the Wall Street Journal opined   Mr  Romney  did previously promote his plan as a model until Democrats took his advice   How much of our health care plan applies to other states  A lot   he wrote in these pages in 2006  Mr  Romney repeated those sentiments in the hardcover version of his book  No Apology   though he cut them from the paperback  But the larger and more important point is that Mr  Romney continues to defend his Massachusetts plan as a success for precisely the same reasons that President Obama says it should be imposed on all states  In reality  the Massachusetts plan is not a success and its problems are the best refutation of the duo s arguments  Here s Mr  Romney Tuesday night   What we do is rely on private insurers  and people   93  of our people who are already insured  nothing changed  For the people who didn t have insurance  they get private insurance  not government insurance   Here s Mr  Obama in his health care speech to Congress in 2009   If you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job  Medicare  Medicaid  or the VA  nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have   And the uninsured  Mr  Obama continued  would simply receive  affordable choices  from  private insurers   The trouble with the Obama Romney definition of  affordable  is that in practice it means subsidies  and once the government provides  free  health care  the private sector and entitlement state are fungible  Government inevitably dictates choices that used to be left to markets  as Mr  Santorum and Newt Gingrich pointed out  And  sure enough  due to the subsidy gusher that Mr  Romney opened  Massachusetts is now moving to impose price controls on private insurance and tightly regulate the type of care patients can receive   Mr  Romney has every right to cling to theories that were flawed in conception and have proven false in practice  though the rest of the GOP field has the responsibility to challenge his canned answers  The mental contortions that his health care record requires need to be dissected   the way Mr  Obama will do if Mr  Romney is the nominee   to give GOP voters a chance to weigh the political liabilities that his candidacy might pose in 2012   Mr  Obama s unbridled expansion of government means that the election will present the electorate with the largest philosophical choice since 1980  To continue the trend toward a larger and growing government and the ever higher taxes to pay for it  or to modernize the 20th century s broken government institutions  Republicans do not want to wake up in 2012 to discover that they have nominated someone who is unprepared  and maybe unwilling  to lead the reform of government that America needs    Bye bye Michele Bachmann as her New Hampshire staff quit on Friday  citing frustration with her lack of commitment to campaigning there   In a CNN Opinion Research poll just 42  of Democrats said they were either  extremely  or  very  enthusiastic about the 2012 vote  In the spring and summer  the same CNN surveys had 56  and 55  of Democrats  respectively  in the  extremely  or  very  enthusiastic categories  Not a good sign for the donkeys Contrast that with Republicans  who in the same two categories registered 64  in the spring  and then an equal 64  this month  So the enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats went from 8 points in the spring to 22 points today   Mort Zuckerman  publisher of U S  News and World Report  told the Wall Street Journal s James Freeman of his experience dealing with President Ronald Reagan after one of U S  News  correspondents  Nicholas Daniloff  was seized without warning by the KGB  I worked in the White House for the next four weeks virtually every day and through that I met Reagan   says Mr  Zuckerman  Reagan secured Mr  Daniloff s release in a swap that included a Soviet spy held in the U S  Reagan surprised me   says Mr  Zuckerman   He got the point of every argument He was very decisive  And everybody loved working for him  They followed his lead because they really respected his decisiveness and his instincts  I was not a Republican and I was not an admirer of his before I knew him  and you know  Harry Truman had a wonderful definition for the presidency  He said the president has to be someone who can persuade the American people to do what they don t want to do and to like it  And that s what you have to do  Somebody like Reagan had that authority  He was liked so much and he had a kind of moral authority  That s what this president  Obama  has lost  Democracy does not work without the right leadership  and you can t play politics  The country has got to come to the conclusion at some point that what you re doing is not just because of an ideology or politics but for the interests of the country    Robert Samuelson   Washington Post A specter haunts America  downward mobility  Every generation  we believe  should live better than its predecessor  By and large  Americans still embrace that promise  A Pew survey earlier this year found that 48  of respondents felt that their children s living standards would exceed their own  Although that s down from 61  in 2002  it s on a par with the mid 1990s  But these expectations could be dashed  For young Americans  the future could be dimmer   In the Pew poll  54  of respondents with a high school diploma or less felt their children would do better  only 35  of graduate school alums agreed   A kind of depression has set in   writes Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen   We ve lost our mojo  our groove   It can be argued that all this glumness repeats a historical error  projecting the present onto the future  Just because the economy is rotten today doesn t mean that it will always be  After World War II  the Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Fogel has recalled  there was widespread  alarm about massive unemployment   Eleven million veterans and 9 million defense industry workers had to be re employed  People feared a new Depression  It didn t happen  because pent up demand for homes  cars and appliances fueled a hiring boom  Unfortunately  this caveat is only half relevant now  Our future would certainly be brighter if the economy resumed strong growth  but that wouldn t automatically ensure higher living standards  A society generates those through productivity   increases in efficiency  technology or business organization that lower costs or enable firms to pay higher wages  Without higher productivity  broad living standards won t rise  But even with it  the young may not enjoy gains  The explanation is that productivity improvements have already been committed to demographic trends we can t alter  aging  or problems we haven t addressed  runaway health costs  deteriorating infrastructure   Future productivity and income gains will be diverted to these uses  higher taxes to pay for an older population  health spending  and taxes and fees to repair roads  schools and water systems  It s already happening   A decade of health care cost growth has wiped out real income gains for an average U S  family   report two Rand Corp  researchers in the journal Health Affairs   Meanwhile  spendable incomes   what people consider their living standards   stagnate  The squeeze will continue  In 1990  there were 32 million Americans 65 and over  by 2040  that s reckoned at 80 million  Rising costs for Social Security and Medicare have created a new political dynamic  If benefits for the elderly aren t cut  burdens on the young will go up  Decaying infrastructure poses similar choices  Either pay for repairs or tolerate substandard roads and dilapidated schools  Our children s futures have been heavily mortgaged  If today s weak recovery persists  the outlook darkens   America is a competitive society  It s not guaranteed that children achieve their parents  relative economic status  The children of parents in the richest 20  won t automatically stay in the richest 20   Some children advance  some fall  But if overall incomes are rising  even those who don t advance relatively often have higher absolute incomes than their parents  Studies by the Pew Economic Mobility Project confirm this  Two thirds of Americans have higher incomes than their parents  Generational gains tempered individual setbacks  We may now lose this comforting cushion  Our leaders might try to avoid that by boosting economic growth  controlling health spending and trimming benefits for the elderly  But we aren t sure how to do the first and lack the political will to do the second and third  The future is never entirely predictable  but downward mobility is not just a scary sound bite  It s a real possibility    Michael Goodwin   New York Post on the Occupy Wall Street movement  Each day  about 3 7 million people go to work in New York City  For the last month  fewer than 500 people have been sleeping in a park near Wall Street so they can curse the economy that produces all those jobs for all those people  Guess which group is getting expressions of sympathy and even solidarity from the president to the mayor  The demonstrators include open anti Semites  homeless people and anarchists  along with students  trust fund babies and the terminally bored  They are supported by municipal unions and other leftist groups  whose agendas run the gamut from higher taxes to higher taxes   When times are tough  the tough don t quit work so they can complain  And the people who really want a job aren t playing drums in a park  getting stoned and taunting cops  Too many protesters  with their gauzy demands for an end to capitalism and more free stuff  feel entitled to be supported by others  If they ruled the world  we d all be living in mud huts and begging for handouts  And yet  as befits a culture that lacks the courage to fight for its own values  this tiniest faction is taking Gotham hostage  They are wreaking havoc on local businesses and residents while breaking numerous laws  including the open use of drugs  Civic appeasement has emboldened them    I thought my friend Liz S  had a great point in talking about the OWS crowd   This is the generation that received medals for participating because everyone is a winner  Well guess what  They re finding out not everyone is a winner  It s this non stop sense of entitlement that drives some of us crazy    The Washington Post reports that the tale Sen  Marco Rubio tells of his family s history is embellished  as a review of documents  show that Rubio s parents came to the United States and were admitted for permanent residence more than 2   years before  Fidel  Castro s forces overthrew the Cuban government and took power on New Year s Day 1959  Rubio has continually said he was the  son of exiles   Cuban Americans forced off the island after  a thug  took power In response to the new information  Rubio said his accounts have been based on family lore   I m going off the oral history of my family   he told the Post   All of these documents and passports are not things that I carried around with me  Bottom line  there are numerous times that Rubio dramatically stretched the truth in his accounts of his family s life that went unchallenged  until now   In catching up on some reading  I finally got around to a piece in the September issue of Smithsonian by Lynnell Hancock on Finland s superior  No  1 in the world educational system  Among the many surprising bits I picked up  There are no mandated standardized tests in Finland  apart from one exam at the end of students  senior year in high school  There are no rankings  no comparisons or competition between students  schools or regions  Finland s schools are publicly funded  The people in the government agencies running them  from national officials to local authorities  are educators  not business people  military leaders or career politicians  Every school has the same national goals and draws from the same pool of university trained educators  The result is that a Finnish child has a good shot at getting the same quality education no matter whether he or she lives in a rural village or a university town  The differences between weakest and strongest students are the smallest in the world   Ninety three percent of Finns graduate from academic or vocational high schools  17 5 percentage points higher than the United States  and 66 percent go on to higher education  the highest rate in the European Union  Yet Finland spends about 30 percent less per student than the United States   It s almost unheard of for a child to show up hungry or homeless  Finland provides three years of maternity leave and subsidized day care to parents  and preschool for all 5 year olds  where the emphasis is on play and socializing  In addition  the state subsidizes parents  paying them around 150 euros per month for every child until he or she turns 17   Finnish educators have a hard time understanding the United States  fascination with standardized tests   Americans like all these bars and graphs and colored charts    school principal Kari  Louhivuori teased   It s nonsense  We know much more about the children than these tests can tell us     In a study of 360 000 cellphone users in Denmark  investigators found no increased risk of brain tumors with long term use  However  the study focused on cellphone subscriptions  not actual use so it does not settle the debate about cellphone safety  As reported by Tara Parker Pope of the New York Times   A small to moderate increase in risk of cancer among heavy users of cellphones for 10 to 15 years or longer still  cannot be ruled out   the investigators wrote    Divers found the carcasses of about 2 000 sharks  slaughtered for their fins  in a Pacific Ocean marine sanctuary 300 miles off the coast of Colombia  The discovery was made when divers saw 10 fishing trawlers   flying the Costa Rican flag   entering the zone illegally  When the divers dove  they began finding a large number of sharks without their fins  none of them alive  Yes  it was about shark fin soup and appetites in Asia  Man plummets further on the All Species List   But this just in   A great white shark has killed an American diver in the second fatal shark attack off Western Australia in 12 days  Police Sgt  Gerry Cassidy says the man was below water Saturday when a witness on the dive boat  saw a large amount of bubbles   The body soon surfaced with fatal injuries  The sharks have had enough  It s payback time    Pray for the men and women of our armed forces and all the fallen God bless America

122219,343734,NYT,The Energy Report,opinion,When it comes to the markets confidence is key  Yet obviously if you look at the last 24 hours confidence has been shaken  Whether it be the call for a Greek referendum on the EU bailout or the weakness in the Chinese manufacturing data or the situation with the bankruptcy of MF Global confidence has been shaken  And despite the blow to confidence  the markets are something that you can believe in  You can also believe in the protections offered the customer provided by the exchanges The oil market  despite the absence of MF Global traders  had a very low volume and oil prices acted like they would have if all traders were present   They reacted as you might expect to the movement from the Japanese yen and dollar intervention and the economic data  They reacted to strong Libyan oil production that rose 245 000 barrels to 345 000  the highest level since March  Or strong production out of Iraq and the highest OPEC oil production since 2008 Yet while the markets functioned correctly  a disturbing story by the New York Times is making people nervous  The New York Times reports that   Federal regulators have discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars in customer money has gone missing from MF Global in recent days  prompting an investigation into the brokerage firm  which is run by Jon S  Corzine  the former New Jersey governor  several people briefed on the matter said on Monday  The recognition that money was missing scuttled at the 11th hour an agreement to sell a major part of MF Global to a rival brokerage firm  MF Global had staked its survival on completing the deal  Instead  the New York based firm filed for bankruptcy on Monday  Regulators are examining whether MF Global diverted some customer funds to support its own trades as the firm teetered on the brink of collapse  The discovery that money could not be located might simply reflect sloppy internal controls at MF Global  It is still unclear where the money went  At first  as much as  950 million was believed to be missing  but as the firm sorted through its bankruptcy  that figure fell to less than  700 million by late Monday  the people briefed on the matter said  Additional funds are expected to trickle in over the coming days  But the investigation  which is in its earliest stages  may uncover something more intentional and troubling  In any case  what led to the unaccounted for cash could violate a tenet of Wall Street regulation  Customers  funds must be kept separate from company money  One of the basic duties of any brokerage firm is to keep track of customer accounts on a daily basis  Neither MF Global nor Mr  Corzine has been accused of any wrongdoing  Lawyers for MF Global did not respond to requests for comment  ,2011-11-01,PFGBest Forex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-104344,104344
122220,343735,NYT,Week in Review Part IV  Random Musings,opinion,Thomas Friedman   New York Times on Barack Obama s foreign policy   While  Obama has been deft at implementing Bush s antiterrorism policy  he has been less successful with his own foreign policy  His Arab Israeli diplomacy has been a mess  His hopes of engaging Iran foundered on the rocks of  well  Iran  He s made little effort to pull together a multilateral coalition to buttress the Arab Awakening  in places like Egypt  to handle the post revolution challenges  His ill considered decision to double down on Afghanistan could prove fatal  He is in a war of words with Pakistan  His global climate policy is an invisible embarrassment  And the coolly calculating Chinese and Russians  while occasionally throwing him a bone  pursue their interests with scant regard to Obama s preferences    In a New York Times CBS News poll  89 percent of Americans say they distrust government to do the right thing  but 74 percent say the country is on the wrong track and 84 percent disapprove of Congress  President Obama s approval rating is 46 percent Among Republican primary voters in the above survey  it s Herman Cain with 25 percent  Mitt Romney 21 percent  New Gingrich 10 percent  Ron Paul 8 percent  and Rick Perry a pathetic 6 percent  Regarding the Texas governor  he is going to skip some of the upcoming debates after his poor early performances  How he thinks this will help him I ll never know   Income inequality continues to rise as an issue  Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats  2 3s of independents and just over 1 3 of all Republicans say that the distribution of wealth in the country should be more equitable  even as a majority of Republicans said they think it is fair  according to the New York Times CBS poll It s largely about the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office study that revealed the top 1  of households saw their after tax incomes grow by 275  from 1979 to 2007  or more than quadruple the growth of the rest of the top 20  of the population during that period  Meanwhile  income for the 60  of households that make up the middle of the income scale increased by slightly less than 40   the study found  The poor   the 20  of the population with the lowest incomes   saw just an 18  increase    Jim Puzzanghea   Los Angeles Times   Nevada backed off and will now hold its caucuses on Feb  4 after pressure from New Hampshire and the Republican National Committee So  assuming New Hampshire goes for Jan  10  as expected   it s Iowa  Jan 3New Hampshire  Jan  10South Carolina  Jan  21Florida  Jan  31Nevada  Feb  4Nevada remains the first state in the West to vote So what did your editor immediately do upon hearing the Nevada news  I booked a flight to Manchester  N H   first week in January  that s what I did  And seeing as how a simple Radisson in downtown Manchester was suddenly displaying a  400 rate when it would normally be about  100  I scooped up a decent alternative right at the airport for far cheaper  Anyway  I ll be on the ground  hitting a few of those last frantic speeches  with the goal of catching Romney and Cain at a minimum  It was in 2004 that I saw John Edwards and John Kerry in New Hampshire  plus two or three others  including Joe Lieberman  and it s a lot of fun  as long as the weather cooperates   Richard L   send me a note if you re still in the area     John Podhoretz   New York Post Memo to the Republican field  You re running for president  Of the United States  Of America  Start acting like it  Stop proposing nonsense tax plans that won t work  Stop making ridiculous attention getting ads that might be minimally acceptable if you were running for county supervisor in Oklahoma  Stop saying you re going to build a U S  Mexico border fence you know perfectly well you re not going to build  Give the GOP electorate and the American people some credit  This country is in terrible shape    They know it  You know it  They want solutions  You re providing comedy  This is a serious time  It requires serious leaders  Where s the gravity  The reason that many on the Right have spent the year hunting somewhere  anywhere  for better candidates to challenge President Obama is becoming ever more plain with each passing day  Herman Cain now leads in at least one major poll  He released his first TV commercial on Monday  In it  his campaign manager talks about how different the campaign is  then lights up a cigarette and exhales the smoke in a curlicue  Next comes a shot of Cain smiling devilishly  It s impossible not to like Cain  But this ad is a humiliating embarrassment  This is his moment  and rather than rising to it  he s behaving as though even he can t imagine he ll one day sit in the Oval Office  He discards positions when they are inconvenient  and speaks dismissively of the notion that a presidential candidate ought to know something about foreign policy  These are not the actions of a serious man  Good October poll data or not  if he doesn t take himself seriously  few will once voting commences  And Podhoretz goes on to talk about Rick Perry and his flat tax proposal that isn t really flat because you can pick and choose  So there will be two parallel tax systems  But this doesn t simplify matters at all  since there are already two parallel tax systems  one is called the Alternative Minimum Tax     Perry s refusal to pick and choose with his non flat  optional  flat tax  constitutes an act of egregious cynicism  He wants the credit for proposing something bold while denying that any such boldness will have palpable consequences as well as benefits  Yet a truly flat tax will necessarily raise taxes on middle income earners and lower them on those making more money  Rather than acknowledge this and do the hard work of explaining why and how a flat tax will work to create the economic growth that will get us out of this morass  Perry simply wishes the hard work away    This is really too much the fact the Occupy Wall Street crowd in Manhattan is sitting on over  500 000 in cash from donors  Members of the  finance committee  are like Al Pacino in  Scarface     The biggest problem I have is what to do with all the     So OWS has endless meetings to decide how to distribute it But then you have the dirtballs in London who have been occupying an area outside St  Paul s Cathedral  a major tourist destination  City officials allowed the group to close the cathedral down for a week  a longer period than during the Blitz  for crying out loud  as reported by the London Times  Fay Schlesinger  Even when it reopens this weekend  the upper parts will be closed because London s Fire Brigade would be blocked from using ladder trucks  If I was a tourist there today  I d be going ballistic  Plus  the Times of London has taken infrared camera shots to prove that most of the protesters don t sleep in their tents at night  they just go home  Like try 9 out of ten  Sweep  em into the Thames By the way  I seem to be in a minority over my opinion towards the Occupy Wall Street group  43  of those surveyed for a CBS New York Times poll agree with OWS s goals  while 27  said they disagree  Aside from a communist class warfare agenda  however  what are the group s goals  pray tell Here s one issue I ll grant OWS  however  the cost of college  New figures show that average in state tuition and fees at four year public colleges rose an additional  631 this fall  or 8 3 percent  compared with a year ago  Including room and board  the average price for a state school is now more than  17 000 a year  though many families pay far less because of a large increase in federal grants and tax credits  Nonetheless  President Obama unveiled a plan to deal with the student loan issue and give 1 6 million some relief on their payments  The plan isn t new  it s just accelerating a program already passed by Congress that reduces the maximum required payment on student loans from 15 percent of discretionary income annually to 10 percent  Like the White House s plans on the housing front  the impact will be minimal and is hardly about job creation But the president also said something incredibly stupid in his speech addressing student loans at a school in Denver  that being graduates will have more money to spend on things  like buying homes  What bank these days is going to give a mortgage to a person with a large student loan balance  Maybe they did in the bubble days  but not now  The College Board reports  after all  that roughly 56 percent of 2009 2010 bachelor s degree recipients at public four years graduated with debt  averaging about  22 000  Total student loans outstanding are slated to exceed  1 trillion this year  which in future years could be a significant drag on economic growth  And  no  President Obama  a slight reduction in the amount owed will not lead to a surge in home buying I knew the student loan issue was going to be a White House topic this week and thus held off last time on a comment by Rich Lowry in an op ed for the New York Post from Oct  14  as it would be more appropriate today  College students and recent graduates are overrepresented  on the  We Are the 99 Percent  Web page   Their complaint comes down to too much debt  and too few job opportunities to get out from under it  There s the guy with the master s from Harvard who owes  60 000 and lives off temp jobs  There s the woman who is paying her  50 000 in debt and the  20 000 in debt for her 22 year old daughter  There s the graduate with a master s from  a major U S  university  who is unemployed and  92 000 in hock  And on and on  The representatives of these debt burdened grads shouldn t be at Zucotti Park  but at the American Association of University Professors or some other arm of the academic complex that gouges students  College tuition has been increasing at a rapid clip  Does anyone believe that higher ed is getting constantly better  It s an inflationary spiral  partly driven by a federal student loan program that feeds the maw of the beast regardless of quality of outcomes  Another running theme is the high cost of health care and the lack of insurance  One man writes of his job  that pays 15 percent less than it did five years ago  even as  health insurance costs are up over 175 percent      Downward mobility  is a dismaying constant   The puerile ideology of Occupy Wall Street is irrelevant to all of this  Goldman Sachs could be dissolved tomorrow and the wealth of the 1 percent confiscated  and it wouldn t make college or health care cheaper  or create one new job  If the  revolution  yearned for by the protesters is insipid  there s no doubt that the moment calls for bold economic reforms and a rethinking of health care and higher education  President Obama s misbegotten contribution is a health care law that won t control costs and will insure more people only while making the current system more unsustainable  Republicans often don t even bother to try to connect their program to the troubles of workers down the income scale  The leading establishment Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  wants to cut their capital gains taxes  The leading Tea Party presidential candidate  Herman Cain  wants to raise their taxes   If nothing else   We are the 99 Percent  is a reminder that the suffering is real    Shootings are way up in New York City thanks to Occupy Wall Street  How is that  you may ask  Because  When OWS marches  as many as 3 000 cops a day could be called on to keep the peace  That s about 10 percent of the total force    The city is going crazy with demonstrations and protests  and I m lucky if I can get four cars out there   said Deputy Inspector Ted Bernstein  commander of the 13th precinct in Chelsea    Brad Hamilton   New York Post   Robert Samuelson   Washington Post Clinton and Bush won t apologize and atone  for their failure to tackle entitlements   They won t play truth squad  But the fact that my fantasy seems so outlandish offers a sobering commentary on our politics  There s no culture of moral accountability  There s no sense that political leaders  retired from office seeking  should come clean with the public  The essential nature of the country s budget problem   the dominance of spending on retirement benefits and uncontrolled health costs   was no secret to either Clinton or Bush  It would be healthy for the country if they confessed that their dodging of unpopular choices helped create today s mess  Their silence contributes to continued public confusion and political stalemate  Polls consistently show that Americans want budget deficits closed but dislike the policies that would close them  higher taxes on much of the public  cuts in retirement benefits  reductions in other government programs  On both left and right  myths persist of painless solutions   eliminating waste  or  taxing millionaires   It s true  as Democrats charge  that Republican rigidity on taxes obstructs agreement  But that s not the only obstacle  Democrats  intransigent defense of Social Security and Medicare reflects the programs  utility as a partisan vote getter  Republicans  have launched an all out war on Medicare and Social Security  says a new fundraising mailer from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  Why sacrifice this pitch even if it s untrue  Congress   supercommittee    charged with reducing budget deficits   is reportedly floundering  Small wonder  Our political system prefers rhetorical fairy tales to unpleasant budget realities    So last week I mentioned that about the only two politicians I want to listen to these days are Republican Congressman Paul Ryan and Senator Tom Coburn  who speak the truth about the problems facing our nation  In her Wall Street Journal op ed this weekend  Peggy Noonan writes the following  People are increasingly fearing the divisions within  even the potential coming apart of  our country  Rich poor  black white  young old  red blue  The things that divide us are not new  yet there s a sense now that the glue that held us together for more than two centuries has thinned and cracked with age  That it was allowed to thin and crack  that the modern era wore it out  What was the glue  A love of country based on a shared knowledge of how and why it began  a broad feeling among our citizens that there was something providential in our beginnings  a gratitude that left us with a sense that we should comport ourselves in a way unlike the other nations of the world  that more was expected of us  and not unjustly    To whom much is given much is expected   a general understanding that we were something new in history  a nation founded on ideals and aspirations   liberty  equality   and not mere grunting tribal wants   Where is the president in all this  He doesn t seem to be as worried about his country s continuance as his own  He s out campaigning and talking of our problems  but he seems oddly oblivious to or detached from America s deeper fears  And so he feels free to exploit divisions  It s all the rich versus the rest  and there are a lot more of the latter   Which gets us to Rep  Paul Ryan  Mr  Ryan receives much praise  but I don t think his role in the current moment has been fully recognized  He is doing something unique in national politics  He thinks  He studies  He reads  Then he comes forward to speak  calmly and at some length  about what he believes to be true  He defines a problem and offers solutions  often providing the intellectual and philosophical rationale behind them  Conservatives naturally like him   they agree with him   but liberals and journalists inclined to disagree with him take him seriously and treat him with respect   The president   Ryan said in a highly publicized speech at the Heritage Foundation   has made a shift in his appeal to the electorate   Instead of appealing to the hope and optimism that were hallmarks of his first campaign  he has launched his second campaign by preying on the emotions of fear  envy and resentment     In a study reported in The Lancet  a daily dose of aspirin should be given to people at high risk of colon cancer  Newcastle University Prof  Sir John Burn  who led the study  said the evidence  seems overwhelmingly strong    I loved George Will s piece on noise in airports  like the recorded voice that says   The moving sidewalk is coming to an end  Please look down  Will   Well  yes  Pretty much everything does come to an end  doesn t it    Passing through a U S  airport is an immersion in a merciless river of words  They are intended to be helpful  but clearly they flow from an assumption that increasingly animates our government in its transactions with us  The assumption is that we are all infants or imbeciles in need of constant  kindly supervision and nudging  lest we allow ourselves to be flung off a moving walkway and over the edge of the world   At Kansas City s airport  a recurring announcement tells travelers   Designated smoking areas are located outside  away from doors   That means the designated smoking areas are pretty much the entire Midwest and everything contiguous to it   all of Creation that is  away from  this airport s doors   The drizzle of superfluous words continues on the plane  beginning with  this is a no smoking flight    please tell us something we don t already know  Smoking on planes has been banned for more than a decade   and ending with the admonition that deplaning passengers should  make sure you have all your belongings   Shoes  Check   Trousers    Check   More and more public spaces are like airports  places where we are assaulted by instructions  advice  warnings and unwanted information  Almost none of this noise is necessary for people mature enough to be allowed to walk around the block  let alone fly around the country  This is the way the world will end  not with a bang but with an environmental blitzkrieg of blather    Further evidence that as a species we can really suck  Headline from the Star Ledger  New Jersey  this week  Linden man

122221,343736,NYT,Spain s Infrastructure Spending  A Flight to Nowhere ,opinion,Recently there s been much talk about how infrastructure spending can be a viable solution to our country s current economic woes  President Obama s proposed  447 billion dollar jobs bill contains  among other things  investment in infrastructure projects like road construction  Many progressive economists have called for much more  with some even saying that the utility of such programs is secondary to the short term economic stimulation that would result from hiring unemployed workers  In other words  it doesn t matter what is built  as long as the government creates jobs  But even if the projects are widely regarded as needed  will the benefits justify the costs  Oftentimes the answer is no  as the actions of the Spanish government over the last two decades suggest Spain covers an area about the size of Utah and Arizona combined  and is home to a little more than 46 million people  Although it is neither the largest  most populous  or most prosperous country in Europe  over the past two decades it has nevertheless built the largest high speed rail network on the continent  covering 2000 kilometers  The same is true of its aggressive highway construction program which has added 5 000 kilometers of new roads over the same time frame   But the most ambitious element of its plan was the construction of 48 airports  43 of which were international In June  the New York Times ran an article that quoted Spain s industry minister Jose Blanco accusing the government of  bad planning and excessive spending   This is nowhere more obvious than in its disastrous airport construction policies A perfect  and highly publicized  example is the Castellon airport  which cost the Spanish government nearly 150 million euros   213 million   Although Castellon was finished in March of this year  it has yet to welcome a single flight  In fact  it doesn t even have an airport license  Originally  the airport was supposed to ride the wave of Spain s booming tourism industry and bring money and jobs into the local economy  But central economic planners in Madrid misread the market and failed to recognize a growing bubble  The airport now stands as one of many expensive white elephants that dot the Spanish landscape In Spain  the larger airports are run by regional governments and only 11 turn a profit  The government is currently considering selling concessions to run the two biggest   Madrid Barajas and El Prat in Barcelona  Even some of Spain s more successful regionals are in the red  A recent piece in Spain s El Pais newspaper revealed the practice of paying discount airlines to land in regional airports  For example  Girona airport  located about two hours outside of Barcelona  paid Ireland s Ryanair around seven million euros a year to continue operating  largely empty  flights to the airport While recent austerity measures have reduced this practice  subsidies to discount airlines is common among many of Spain s regional airports  These payments allow Ryanair and other discount airlines to play Spain s many regional airports against one another  demanding higher subsidies and lower fees   The existence of this market would evidence that Spain has built out these facilities well beyond the point of economic sense  But as with all politically motivated spending  economic necessity is never a high priority In the past few years  the country seems to have doubled down on its infrastructure investment in spite  or perhaps because of the global financial crisis  For example  a November 2008 stimulus initiative focused heavily on infrastructure projects  The stimulus cost eleven billion euros  1 1  of Spain s GDP   eight billion  73   of which went to public works projects  An April 2010 report by the US Department of Labor called the program a relative success but acknowledged the difficulty in calculating the number of full time jobs that resulted  It highlighted how some of the jobs lasted only a few hours  After the dust settled from these projects  it has slowly become clear that the employment didn t last and all that remained were unneeded facilities and unsustainable debt  Meanwhile  according to the same report  despite the spending  Spain s GDP contracted an estimated 3 6  in 2009 and unemployment now stands at 21  There are of course  significant differences between infrastructure projects in Spain and in the United States that make it difficult to compare the two  We may not build airports but choose to focus on high speed rail  But  when it comes to the efficient allocation of scarce economic resources  why should we expect our government planners to be wiser than their Spanish counterparts ,2011-11-04,Euro Pacific,https://www.investing.com/analysis/spain's-infrastructure-spending:-a-flight-to-nowhere‏-104647,104647
122222,343737,NYT,Week in Review Part III Foreign Affairs,opinion,Iran  This coming week is critical in the realm of international affairs as the U N  s International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  is slated to release its most detailed report yet on Iran s nuclear program  While it may not spell out specifically that Iran is intent on building nuclear weapons  and that its nuclear program is not for peaceful  civilian purposes  evidently all the clues will be there  making it readily apparent just what Iran is up to  Thus  this gives the United States the pretext to ask the U N  and the likes of Russia and China to not only strengthen the existing sanctions regimes  but to apply more direct pressure on Tehran to give it up Israel is pushing for a strike  though it prefers Washington take the lead  and I ve been writing the White House will  perhaps sometime in the spring should Iran not change its behavior beforehand  I ll have a lot more on this once the report is out Meanwhile  President Ahmadinejad s finance minister survived a vote in parliament to remove him over the country s banking scandal  which would have been a huge blow to the president  The bank fraud is a record  2 6 billion  Parliament is still trying to call Ahmadinejad to answer questions  which would be the first time since the 1979 revolution that a president was summoned for questioning by parliament Iraq  To give you a sense of how happy Iran is that the U S  is leaving Iraq  Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamanei praised Iraq s  unified resistance  in forcing the U S  military out  The New York Times reports  however  that the Obama administration is looking to reposition many of the departing Iraqi forces elsewhere in the region  such as in Kuwait to be able to respond to a collapse of security in Iraq or a confrontation with Iran Max Boot   Wall Street Journal Friday afternoon is a traditional time to bury bad news  so at 12 49 p m  on Oct  21 President Obama strode into the White House briefing room to  report that  as promised  the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year   after nearly nine years  America s war in Iraq will be over   He acted as though this represented a triumph  but it was really a defeat  The U S  had hoped to extend the presence of our troops past Dec  31  Why did we fail  The popular explanation is that the Iraqis refused to provide legal immunity for U S  troops if they are accused of breaking Iraq s laws  Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki himself said   When the Americans asked for immunity  the Iraqi side answered that it was not possible  The discussions over the number of trainers and the place of training stopped  Now that the issue of immunity was decided and that no immunity is to be given  the withdrawal has started   But Mr  Maliki and other Iraqi political figures expressed exactly the same reservations about immunity in 2008 during the negotiation of the last Status of Forces Agreement  Indeed those concerns were more acute at the time because there were so many more U S  personnel in Iraq   nearly 150 000  compared with fewer than 50 000 today  So why was it possible for the Bush administration to reach a deal with the Iraqis but not for the Obama administration  Quite simply it was a matter of will  President Bush really wanted to get a deal done  whereas Mr  Obama did not  Mr  Bush spoke weekly with Mr  Maliki by video teleconference  Mr  Obama had not spoken with Mr  Maliki for months before calling him in late October to announce the end of negotiations  Mr  Obama and his senior aides did not even bother to meet with Iraqi officials at the United Nations General Assembly in September   Iraq will increasingly find itself on its own  even though its air forces still lack the capability to defend its own airspace and its ground forces cannot carry out large scale combined arms operations  Multiple terrorist groups also remain active  and almost as many civilians died in Iraq last year as in Afghanistan  So the end of the U S  military mission in Iraq is a tragedy  not a triumph   and a self inflicted one at that  By the way  Army Times  Michelle Tan points out that by year end  the U S  will be redeploying 700 000 pieces of equipment out of Iraq  or 300 to 500 convoys each week Afghanistan  Speaking of pullouts  the White House appears to want to speed up the withdrawal from Afghanistan  moving it up to next year rather than 2014 in assuming an early advisory role  which Obama would like to announce during the campaign  The White House and U S  military will make the claim that Afghan security forces have made great strides Otherwise  it was a terrible week as the Taliban launched the largest single suicide attack on Kabul of the war  attacking an armored shuttle bus that killed four U S  soldiers  eight American contractors  a Canadian soldier and four Afghans  In Kandahar  a separate Taliban attack on a U N  refugee agency killed three U N  employees Syria  President Bashar Assad was said to have accepted an Arab League proposal calling for an end to attacks against protesters and the withdrawal of forces from cities  as well as to release detainees and allow foreign media into the country  That was on Wednesday  On Thursday  20 were reportedly killed in Homs as violence resumed  with tanks in the streets on Friday as well  The death toll is now said to be 4 000 in eight months of unrest  The bottom line is Assad will entertain reform as long as he stays in power So now  as the Wall Street Journal editorialized  President Obama gets to lead from behind again since Turkey s Prime Minister Erdogan is the one applying the most pressure on Syria  Turkey is looking to impose further sanctions on Damascus  as well as provide for a possible buffer zone to protect Syrian civilians as tensions rise between the two former strategic partners  I wrote just a few weeks ago that we should encourage Erdogan to invade Syria give it to Turkey  I say that just half tongue in cheek  And remember  ousting Assad would be a huge blow to Hizbullah and that is good Speaking of Lebanon  Syria is accused of orchestrating the kidnapping of Syrian dissidents in Lebanon  I have no problem repeating that Assad should be assassinated Israel  UNESCO  the United Nations  cultural agency  accepted Palestine as a member  on Monday  infuriating Israel which is now withholding  100 million in monthly tax payments it holds and then transfers to the Palestinian Authority  Also in response  no doubt  Israel said it would accelerate the construction of 2 000 housing units in contested areas of East Jerusalem and the West Bank  The Palestinians have been demanding a complete halt to construction before they ll resume negotiations  A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Israeli government s decision would  accelerate the destruction of the peace process   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded  We are building in Jerusalem because it is our right and our duty to this generation and future generations  not as punishment but as the basic right of our people to build in its eternal city  Jerusalem will never return to the state it was in on the eve of the  1967  Six Day War  that I promise you  So you combine Israel s move with that of the U N  and you have zero cause for optimism  not that you should have ever had cause for such in the first place Along these lines  I was reading a piece by Barbara Opall Rome in Defense News and two recently published reports from respected think tanks in Washington and Tel Aviv come to the same conclusion   Lack of progress toward Israeli Palestinian peace will intensify Israel s international isolation  strain ties with Washington  ignite hostility from new governments taking shape in the region and restrict Israel s ability to use its military might  even for legitimate purposes of self defense   The U S  and Canada cut off funding for UNESCO due to its admittance of Palestine  a move both say is not in the best interests of Middle East peace  Canada contributes  10 million  the U S   60 million  critical funding for the organization Egypt  Ironically  liberals and Islamists are now united against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces  which is seeking to give the generals a veto over legislation dealing with military affairs  as well as curtail the influence of Islamist lawmakers in writing a new constitution down the road  with the generals being granted veto power over drafts   Plus the generals seek to keep the military budget secret  while wanting to place their financial interests beyond civilian scrutiny even after handing over power Egypt s parliamentary elections begin Nov  28 and last six weeks  after which a 100 member constituent assembly will be nominated which will write the new constitution  The presidential vote will be much later in 2012 Lastly  if you stupidly thought now must be a good time to discover Egypt  a Financial Times piece this week echoed everything I ve read and written of before on the crime problem  There is no police presence anymore  and what were once simple commutes for workers have now become a living hell as armed gangs with automatic weapons rob businessmen on the highways and take their cars  One business had 100 tons of copper taken by a gang that tied up security guards  More importantly for the future of Egypt  what foreign business would want to operate there Libya  The inability of the interim government to control the 25 or so militias is a major concern  Militias are fighting in the streets of Tripoli  including  as reported by the Financial Times  in the corridors of the main hospital  The militias all say they won t give up their weapons until they know who they are giving them up to  Innocents are terrified  Gangs just drive around the capital with heavy weapons mounted on their trucks  firing in the air  those bullets are indeed killing people on the way down  it was also reported this week  something the National Transition Council is trying to tackle   These people are idiots Additionally  smuggling of arms into Egypt is rampant  including shoulder fired anti aircraft missiles  The new government is unable to secure arms depotsPakistan  In what could be a significant positive  Pakistan s cabinet agreed to normalize trade relations with India  Both countries said they want to more than double trade between them  Consumers in Pakistan will benefit from more and cheaper Indian goods  Consumers in India  Give me five minutes not sure how they benefit just yet China  A report out of the U S  intelligence community says cyberattacks by Chinese and Russian intel services have stolen large amounts of American high tech research and development data  not that anyone didn t already know this  It s easier to steal the information through cyberattacks than laborious human intelligence  after all  What makes the report different is in its targeting of Russia and China directly  though it offers no specifics  including what percentage of the attacks are government directed  Actually  in typing this up it s really about some U S  high level types trying to cover their ass  Meanwhile  dissident artist Ai Weiwei vowed to fight Chinese authorities  to the death  over the government s claim a company linked to him  owned by his wife  owes  2 4 million in taxes  So say  Bye bye  to Weiwei Russia  The Kremlin has reached a deal with Georgia on a bilateral agreement that opens the door for Russia s admittance into the World Trade Organization  Yeesh  It only took 18 years  But instead of the U S  and Europe being the final stumbling block  it came down to Georgia  with whom Russia fought a brief war in 2008  Actually  the Swiss brokered the deal  a compromise to monitor trade flow between the disputed regions in the Caucasus Mountains  And in the investigation of the Yak 42 jet crash that claimed the lives of virtually the entire Lokomotiv hockey team back on Sept  7  authorities have determined the cause to be pilot error  as in the pilots were so ill trained they evidently continued takeoff even as they inadvertently applied the brakes  according to the investigation  It was discovered the Russian charter operator falsified training records and had lax discipline and safety procedures  while the co pilot had a medical condition that should have prevented him from ever being in the cockpit The report is pathetic  The pilot was literally slamming on the brakes as he tried to gain speed and lift  not knowing he was stepping on the brakes because he was used to the pedal configuration in another plane he had flown North Korea  Kim Jong il isn t allowing 200 North Koreans working in Libya to return home because he doesn t want their takes on the Arab Spring reaching his isolated regime   Man  falls another few notches on the All Species List Japan  It s alive    Reactor No  2 at Fukushina  that is  Radioactive elements were detected this week as the plant s owner admitted fuel deep inside three stricken reactors is probably still experiencing bursts of

Kyrgyzstan  The only reason why you should care that this country elected a new president this week  AlmazbekAtambayev  Herman Cain isn t expected to know this guy s name   is because he said he would

region  Atambayev actually has a good point   We know that the United States is often engaged in military conflicts   he said   There was Iraq and Afghanistan  and now there are tensions with Iran  I would not want any of these countries to launch a retaliatory strike on the military base one day    Michael Schmidt   New York Times I have a little interest in Kyrgyzstan as a rare earth mineral

122223,343738,NYT,Week in Review Part III  Foreign Affairs,opinion,Iran  This coming week is critical in the realm of international affairs as the U N  s International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  is slated to release its most detailed report yet on Iran s nuclear program  While it may not spell out specifically that Iran is intent on building nuclear weapons  and that its nuclear program is not for peaceful  civilian purposes  evidently all the clues will be there  making it readily apparent just what Iran is up to Thus  this gives the United States the pretext to ask the U N  and the likes of Russia and China to not only strengthen the existing sanctions regimes  but to apply more direct pressure on Tehran to give it up Israel is pushing for a strike  though it prefers Washington take the lead  and I ve been writing the White House will  perhaps sometime in the spring should Iran not change its behavior beforehand  I ll have a lot more on this once the report is out Meanwhile
