195913,417429,LVS,Las Vegas Sands Stock Appears Resistant to the Worst Effects of Coronavirus,news,"Las Vegas Sands  NYSE LVS  stock has done something a bit unexpected since the beginning of the Chinese New Year on Jan  25    it has risen  Despite rising fears related to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and temporary casino closures in China  investors appear to be trading up the Las Vegas based casino company 
Granted  the casino company s Chinese operations have become more important to Las Vegas Sands as people in China and many parts of Asia find new options for their discretionary income  And the company has come to rely heavily on Macao for revenue growth  so concerns have risen about the financial effects of the virus creating a sell off situation 
But it appears that worries about the outbreak having an outsized effect on the stock are subsiding  and Las Vegas Sands is facing this financial concern and showing why the company is in a strong position to continue delivering investor returns once the crisis has passed  

Admittedly  Las Vegas Sands relies on China for growth
Officials in Chinese controlled Macao had asked casinos in late January to close for two weeks as a response to the coronavirus outbreak  This took its toll on Las Vegas Sands stock initially  As the lunar new year came and went  stock in Las Vegas Sands and peers such as Wynn Resorts and Melco Resorts   Entertainment dropped as visits to Macao by mainland Chinese fell by about 80  
Why is this important  Put simply  Macao  not Las Vegas  is the gambling capital of the world  In terms of revenue  Las Vegas does not even come close  In 2018  Macao casinos earned  28 04 billion in gross gaming revenue  compared with only  6 5 billion in Las Vegas  Given this reality  investors should consider Las Vegas Sands a de facto Chinese company  despite its name  
The outbreak led to fears that officials would close all Macao casinos for a time  While that did finally happen  the stock price seems to be recovering some of its initial losses  despite the news  
Las Vegas Sands should improve soon after
Although there has been a partial price recovery  I might suggest interested investors be wary about buying in just yet  The casino closures  even if they persist for only two weeks  are likely to significantly hurt the bottom line of this company on its next earnings report  still three months away   This leaves the stock vulnerable as analysts revise down their revenue and earnings forecasts or possibly even the company itself issues lowered earnings forecasts  Expect this stock to be somewhat volatile for the short term 
But I would also not expect more than just temporary volatility related to the coronavirus  Because there is time before the company releases its next earnings report  the worst effects and the fears surrounding coronavirus quite possibly will have subsided by then  The company has a chance to adjust and better absorb the hit it s going to take  Lately  Las Vegas Sands stock has become a reasonably priced investment  at least from a valuation perspective  The company trades at about 19 times forward earnings  Analysts expect an average annual earnings growth of 3 9  per year over the next five years  With its huge presence in Macao  the long term outlook points to the company being a safe and lucrative income investment  This current crisis doesn t necessarily change that 
To mitigate future issues like this having an outsized effect  Las Vegas Sands expansion plans are working to become less dependent on China over the long term  While it is expanding existing facilities in Macao to take advantage of China s continued economic expansion  the company sees that gamblers are also beginning to flock to other locations in and around Asia  For instance  Las Vegas Sands opened a casino in Singapore in 2010 and CEO Sheldon Adelson announced an expansion of this Marina Sands property last year  adding 1 000 hotel rooms as well as more convention and meeting space  The company is also looking at sites for a casino in Japan  In the future  it could also follow other casino operators into countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines  
As the casino operator seeks to expand to other parts of Asia  it should find itself less reliant on Macao  Moreover  as East Asia becomes wealthier and develops a larger interest in gambling  Las Vegas Sands will help investors benefit from Asia s economic expansion  virus outbreak or not ",2020-02-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptg91,2080982

you for joining us today  We had a great quarter and a great year across all our markets  Companywide adjusted property EBITDA for the fourth quarter was  1 39 billion  an increase of 9  over the prior year  Our cash flow generation is unmatched in our industry with full year 2019 EBITDA of  5 39 billion  Nobody has ever earned that before in this industry Our capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore are exceptionally exciting with over  5 billion of capital projects  which will be completed over the course of the next few years  These investments will further strengthen our leadership position in the premium mass  mass and non gaming segments in Asia  Let s now turn to our financial results by the region  In Macao  adjusted property EBITDA was  811 million in the quarter  an increase of 3  over the prior year  In contrast to the 8  decline  that s a 3  increase for us in contrast to an 8  decline gross gaming revenue in the Macao market overall  Pretty good We grew our mass gaming revenues by 3  over the prior year with growth in both    in mass    with growth in both mass tables and slots  Retail sales remained strong growing by 11  over the prior year  Most importantly  our profitability continues to lead the industry with EBITDA margin reaching 36 2   up another 140 basis points compared to the prior year We couldn t be more excited about our investment of  2 2 billion to expand our critical mass of non gaming offerings in Macao  We believe there is no better market in the world in Macao with regard to the continued deployment of our capital  The initial trial results at both The Londoner hotel and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons have been very promising and we will update you on our progress in the future We look forward to making additional investments in Macao as we contribute to Macao s diversification and evolution into Asia s leading leisure and business tourism destination I would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of dollars to expand our hotel  entertainment  retail and MICE facilities in Macao  I believe Macao has the opportunity to become the greatest business and leisure tourism destination in the world and the MICE capital of Asia  We stand ready to make substantial additional investments to contribute to Macao s future success In 2019  over 900 MICE events were held in sales channels properties in Macao  with good participation from over 900 000    sorry  800 000 attendees  This is by far the highest number of MICE events and attendees that hosted by any operator in Macao  And indeed we estimate that we represent as much as 90  of the MICE market Entertainment is another area in which we contribute to Macao s growth and diversification  We continue to lead the Macao market in this respect as it continues its development as the premier entertainment center in Asia  In 2019  we brought 45 different events to Macao in our Cotai Arena  featuring top Asian and Western artists Our leadership in MICE and entertainment are just two examples of our firm commitment to supporting the government s objective to diversify the economy in Macao  Our market leading investment in non gaming facilities  including hotel capacity  large scale retail malls and our team tourism attractions  are designed to attract the widest possible range of visitors to Macao Having made the largest investment in this economic diversification  we will continue to invest and to work to support the business  Phonetic  for Macao in the future With the opening of the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge and the progress of The Greater Bay initiatives  we truly believe Macao has the potential to become the MICE and leisure capital of Asia  We fully intend to contribute to that objective to both our existing assets and potential future of this Let me also address another topic  the evolving situation with the corona virus  The current situation is unique and serious  Our top priority  Phonetic  is the health and safety of our employees and guests and we are doing everything we can to support the government both in Macao and China Our sales China team is in close consultation with the relevant healthcare and public safety authorities in Macao and we have implemented significant procedures and safeguards  We will continue to implement measures in line with the government direction and hope for a swift containment of the virus Now turning to Singapore  Marina Bay Sands adjusted EBITDA was  457 million  Rolling volumes were strong and was 16  higher than the prior year  Mass win per day remains solid  The hotel continued to enjoy strong average daily rate and occupancy  At the same time  annualized retail sales per square foot increased to more than  2 000 per square foot Singapore s leading tourism infrastructure continues to receive significant investment  And we are excited to be a part of Singapore s continued growth as a leading business and leisure tourism destination as we develop the Marina Bay Sands expansion  The expansion will include a 15 000 seat state of the art arena for live entertainment events  a hotel tower designed to set a new standard of luxury in the region as well as an additional MICE offerings We continue to make progress on the MBS expansion and we ll provide additional updates in the future  We will continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands to enhance the customer experience in advance of the expansion Now turning to Las Vegas  Our Las Vegas operations had another great quarter with adjusted EBITDA of  120 million  an increase of 20  over the prior year  The hotel convention and slot segments all set yearly revenue records leading to a record adjusted property EBITDA performance in 2019 of  503 million on a whole normalized basis Regarding US China trade relations  phase one of the trade deal between China and the United States has been completed  United States and China coming together to work collaboratively on the future of global trade is good for the US  it s good for China and it s good for the rest of the global economy  Finally  we continue to increase the return of capital to shareholders The dividend remains the cornerstone of our strategy for the return of capital and that dividend has continued to grow  For 2020  the Board of Directors has increased the dividend by  0 08 per share to  3 16 per share  At the same time  we repurchased  300 million of stock during the quarter  gain  Phonetic  dividends  gain buybacks Thanks again for joining us on the call today  Now  we ll take questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff of J P  Morgan  Your line is open Joe Greff    J P  Morgan    AnalystGood afternoon  everybody  Sheldon  good to hear you again  My first question is going to be probably an obvious topic and to the extent you can talk about it  but just with regards to the corona virus  if there is going to be a lengthy impact that dissuade visitation and spend both in Macao and Singapore  how do you manage to fix the operating expense there  How much flex is there in both respective markets And then my follow up question is  relating    looking backwards  relating to Macao in the fourth quarter  if you were to parse through maybe you look at it  because you have most  Phonetic  of the numbers that we don t have access to  but how much of an impact do you think Hong Kong protest had versus the travel disruption related to government visit in December  And that s all for me  Thank you Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerHi  Joe  it s Rob  I ll take    I want to take the first part of the question  There are two different markets  Macao and Singapore  As you know  Macao visitation  based on the public reports  is down as much as 80   It s not nearly as higher in Singapore  There has been some adverse impacts  but nowhere near the same level of problem in Singapore as Macao starts there As to our offer  our business is revenue dependent  There is no way to hide from the fact we employ tens of thousands of people in these markets and it s an expensive  Phonetic  business to operate  The same way operating leverage swings you in a direction when volumes are good  It swings again to times like this  We re doing our best  we ll do all the paid time off  all things we can do to mitigate  But I think it d be silly to think that we can make a material impact on operating costs  the real  And that s the problem with these businesses when this kind of thing hits Having said that  we ve been just  Phonetic  been through a lot of years of problems in Macao and Singapore and Las Vegas  when things like this happen  And this storm will pass  We don t know when  We do know when it passes  we will be first in line in each of our markets to be the biggest investor  most aggressive in Macao  And we ve shown our strength in our things that market    extraordinary market  when it  returns  we will return with it and do  very  well and keep investing  But I think it would be foolhardy to think we can reduce cost enough to offset what s happening in the    if this 80  decline continues that s a real problem for any operator Your second question  I didn t grasp it  Try that again The pace of how October  November and December went Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOh  OK  Well  October was a terrific month in Macao  extra ordinary month in Macao  Decelerate  as you might imagine with the visit from the President as it has in the past  no surprise there  Deceleration really happened in December  I think it s again predictable  So  I guess you d look at the month as    the quarter as October extraordinary  November  strong  and December was soft  No big surprise  I think  we reflect the market in that prospect  very different place in December it was in October  And I think that s all I can say now and I am  Phonetic  sure it s pretty clear to everybody Joe Greff    J P  Morgan    AnalystGot it  Thanks guys Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley  Your line is open Thomas Allen    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  So just sticking with Macao and focusing on premium mass  you had really strong premium mass results in the third quarter and then they were down in the fourth quarter  Do you think that was just mostly a function of President Xi visit or something else going on there on that  Thank you Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So let s break it apart  A great base mass quarter ending up at almost 9   8 9   or something like that  So base mass  we were    I think our strongest base mass performance on our history  which we were delighted with and that remains a core part of our success  You re right  the premium mass business was not as strong  but still not a bad performance  I think what really is happening here  I wouldn t blame on what happened in the market as much as we are under construction in Four Seasons and in Londoner And I think  as you know this market is based upon product  like most gaming  but especially Macao better product win today  We re soon going to open up all the suites of the Four Seasons  all the suites of The Londoner by the end of the year and St  Regis  And I m pretty confident  we will not just be the leader in the premium mass  but by far the leader  I think the success with the other products to market demonstrate what happens when you build quality product  in Macao people shop for it I think our Four Seasons product which is extraordinary  290 keys base  the size of room between 2 000 and 4 000 feet  Phonetic   St  Regis equally powerful and Londoner  I think we re looking a whole new offering from SCL once these things open up  So I m very confident our premium mass business reflect  that s our base mass business  strong growth in the time ahead As you know we are the biggest investor at Macao with the most committed and these  2 2 billion worth of investments that Sheldon and the Board authorized will pay off enormously in  21 and beyond and  20 as well Thomas Allen    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks  Rob  And just as my follow up  Vegas revenue was really strong  your strongest quarter of the year  but margins were a little light at 25  versus    first half is 29   Was there anything unique going on there Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerNo  I just think you re seeing a shift to more non    I mean  our business as you know is driven by  we have a gaming to follow up  Phonetic   but the non gaming is powerful  If we can make  0 5 billion a year in Vegas every year  I ll be OK with that  the margins fall a few points  I think what you re seeing is  one thing you should realize with our business is that we are driven    I mean the    forget the rooms and the slot machines and the gaming business  but look at our revenues coming out of convention center  almost  200 million this year of revenue coming out of banquets and convention related services  which is extraordinary  And I think that s becoming more and more indicative where our business is heading So I would gladly    as we keep going  and I think we will keep going toward  500 million and beyond  I would gladly trade a few points of margin for more growth in non gaming  Our gaming performance is good  but as you know visitation from Asia is not as strong at the super high end Baccarat which has been one of the strengths in Las Vegas  But again we re overjoyed  Phonetic  with the  500 million a year  And if we trade 1 point or 2 point of margins here and there  we re pretty happy  Nothing extraordinary  nothing out of the ordinary Thomas Allen    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks  Rob Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank  Your line is open Carlo Santarelli    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHey  good afternoon  guys and thanks  Sheldon  for the first time that I could recall  at least  you talked a little bit in your prepared remarks about the trade war and obviously the signing of phase one of the deal  Is that something    and I don t know with all the other things going on right now in the market that it s    it would have been discernible  but do you feel that was something that maybe has provided a little bit of a governor on results in Macao and something that you re optimistic as the resolution of phase one and potentially subsequent phases play out you will start to see maybe a better cadence of business across the high end for the market Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think that it s the perception that the China    the trade negotiation with China and the contradictions that are inherent there are just perceived  I don t think that they re doing very much  I think people think that if President Trump puts on tariffs on different imports from China that    and then China reciprocates by putting tariffs on stuff from the US  I talked to my friend Steven Mnuchin when I was at the White House for the signing of the China trade agreement  and he says that they re moving forward    probably moving forward faster than what people would expect for phase two of the resolution of the so called trade war  So  although it s perceived to be a problem  it s    in reality  it s not causing much of a problem Carlo Santarelli    Deutsche Bank    AnalystUnderstood Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerCarlo  I just    Carlo  it s Rob  Let me jump in and just echo a comment on that  No question  we hear from customers in Asia the importance of resolution of trade war  especially for entrepreneurs and business people who reside in the provinces in China  I think it s very helpful  The war comes to an end  We ll see more confidence  We ll see more growth in their businesses  It translates across all segments  but primarily in the premium mass segment  which is so important to the success in Macao  So  it s very  very helpful and bodes well for the future of our business and our competitors in Macao Carlo Santarelli    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  Thank you  both  And then just as a quick follow up  Obviously  the situation right now is difficult to handicap with everything that s going on  But in the event Macao were to decide that maybe the best approach would be to close the casinos temporarily until things stabilize  My understanding is that maybe business interruption insurance wouldn t apply here  Do you guys kind of have a view of how that potentially could play out  if that were to be the path this followed Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I ll ask Patrick to respond to that Patrick Dumont    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo how are you  I appreciate the question  I think right now  it s too early to say  I think each operator has different risk management programs  And so  I m not sure where you have the information coming from  But I think it s something we ll take a look at  Hopefully  that s not something that ever comes down to  We do have a very robust risk management program here  We re actually one of the largest acquirers of certain types of risk products in the market or in various markets  So I think we re very proud of that I think we try to protect our balance sheet  try to protect our operations That being said  I don t think we can comment specifically on the causes of our policy and the likelihood of that type of event or the coverage that we have  but we are prepared  The other thing to note is we re very fortunate to have a very strong balance sheet  We re very fortunate to have liquidity on hand  And I think we re looking to manage through this in the best way that we can and support whatever initiatives from the government that we need to The other thing is I think in the long run we re very cautious with our balance sheet and we expect variability in our markets  And this is something that unfortunately comes up periodically and we have to deal with Carlo Santarelli    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  Thank you Patrick Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Speech Overlap  the question  Hope it goes away and resolves quick enough  It s not an issue for us Carlo Santarelli    Deutsche Bank    AnalystUnderstood  For sure  Thank you  guys Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Carlo OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs  Your line is open Stephen Grambling    Goldman  Sachs   Co     AnalystHi  good afternoon  Thanks for taking the question  I guess one other follow up on the corona virus  Is there any way to frame or is there any impact that we should be anticipating as it relates to the construction projects that you have under way now  or is that still something that we should generally be thinking is on track or regardless of the current disruption to be still accelerated to be on track  Thanks Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerStephen  hi  it s Rob  We don t anticipate any slowdown as a result of virus  Obviously  it depends on what happens in Macao  But as we speak today  we saw no indication at all of that and we re full speed ahead on all of our projects in Macao Stephen Grambling    Goldman  Sachs   Co     AnalystThat s great  And then one other quick clarification on Singapore  Obviously  very strong results  If you look at your customer database there  is any of that     Indecipherable  you tell if any of that is folks that are transitioning out of Macao because of the Hong Kong disruption or otherwise  or what do you think is kind of driving that underlying strength Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerGreat property and great management  No  I don t think we have    we really can t determine   Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNot to mention our good looks Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  We can t determine that  I think Singapore has always been for us a    it s such an interesting place  great country to visit  culturally in sync with the foreign visitation  As you know the increased levy entrance has made us pivot more and more toward foreign visitation  And we continue to grow that properties in terms of quality of product  entertainment and service to make it more desirable for that customer  So whether    I don t know if pivoting take  Phonetic  place  But I think we want to make that product so damn good that people want to come more often to Singapore It s an incredible product in certain ways  a great country to operate in  very favorable to foreign visitation  So we re very pleased about it  And I think our strength that I believe will continue to grow  I think as we invest more again    our history has always been the same  We invest heavily in the right places and Singapore is the right place  We re making a huge commitment  both in Towers 1  2 and 3  as well as our new addition  the arena  etc  So I think our future in Singapore is very bright and that s why we re putting billions of dollars to work there Stephen Grambling    Goldman  Sachs   Co     AnalystMakes sense  That s super helpful  Thanks so much and best of luck Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix of Barclays  Your line is open Felicia Hendrix    Barclays Capital    AnalystHi  thank you so much  So  Rob just digging back into the premium mass performance in the fourth quarter  if you look at your premium mass growth year over year in like each month of the quarter  would it be fair to say that December was the major driver of the year over year decline just because of the visitation decline  And then so the lull kind of around the President Xi s visit  or was it similar throughout the quarter  And then I was also wondering  if there is any way you could share with us how things were going in the first 19 days or so of January prior to the outbreak Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  To your question  December clearly was the problem child in the    of the quarter  I think that s true of all of our competitors in the market as well  Now it was a great    October  we thought we re heading for a massive quarter and then it s slowly declined as the quarter went on  As for the    we didn t see any effect from this virus  the first 21 days was a pretty    if this call have been a week or two ago  the hold different type of conversation  But very strong in January  I think the market was strong  visitation was good  So it s a real comeuppance to have this whole thing  the visitation being down  I think it s 80  marketwide at this point  But there was no signs in early January of this disruption  It s a recent occurrence Felicia Hendrix    Barclays Capital    AnalystYeah  Can I    and I know you guys  focus is mainly on the mass side  but just within those first 21 days  did you see any like change in behavior on VIP  Like is there any reason why we should think once we get past this outbreak and all that kind of stuff that you could    we could see some improvement in VIP year over year Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  Felicia  we don t get into that  We don t have a break out the first 21 days other than say visitation was strong and it reflected more of a fourth quarter trend  VIP  as you know  is an enigma  We don t know when it gets better  I ve been wrong so often predicting MICE  I won t make that mistake again  I think VIP will resurrect  I think Sheldon s comments about the trade war are indicative of a market that entrepreneurs who populate the VIP segment  via  Indecipherable  direct are influenced by their businesses and their success And I think today  as usual  premium mass will blossom  keep blossoming  but it s more product driven  I think the trade war s resolution is very helpful in China  and very helpful for Macao in general Felicia Hendrix    Barclays Capital    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you so much Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America  Your line is open Shaun Kelley    Analyst    Bank of America Merrill LynchHi  good afternoon  everyone  Thank you for taking my question  So just to go back to the corona virus and a few of the prepared remarks  Sheldon  I think you mentioned that there    you re implementing measures in line with government policies  Could you just give us maybe a little bit better sense of what some of those policies or contingency planning looks like at this stage  I mean  again  I think we all know they stopped short of ordering foreclosures  But just kind of    what s the kind of    what s the interaction been with the government and how are they kind of helping to smooth over and work with you on the situation right now Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  the government wants us to measure the temperature of the visitation and to see if there s anybody that s got the virus  And they requested that we put masks on all our dealers  everybody in the casino  we ve done that  And whatever else    whatever other details    Rob  are there any other details Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  that s    Sheldon is right  Across the board  all of our employees now have masks in all the areas  And to Sheldon s point  screening is part of our business now today  And Wilford and the team are in constant contact with the government  We speak daily  And the government    our job is to protect our employees  our team there and to help the government every way possible to be good corporate citizens in respect to people of Macao  respect to people of China and be as contributory as we can to the resolution of this crisis and we ve done that  We re there    we re actually looking into our contribution  a monetary contribution  into helping into China and Macao  protecting our dealers  So that s job one  And we are in constant communication with mass  Speech Overlap Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhen  Indecipherable  an operating way Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Indecipherable Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerIt started with dealers but then went into everybody and masks are in short supply  We re trying to get more supplies to make contributions and Sheldon and the family have asked us to look into what else we can do to help Macao recover and help the government Shaun Kelley    Analyst    Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat  thank you  Thank you for the color  And then just as a    as my follow up  but to switch gears a little bit  obviously there s been plenty of questions about the impact on just the financial performance from President Xi s visit  But it felt like a pretty big policy shift as he really  I think  shined a pretty positive light on Macao s future role Could you just give us maybe a little bit more color on your take on kind of how that commentary went  Any conversations with the new Chief Executive just how the    just general tenor of policy is moving forward with Macao under the kind of the new administration  that d be great Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerWe    Shaun  we don t    I ll say this  We have been there for what 18 years  19 years and I think Sheldon s contribution  this Company s contribution as the biggest investor in Macao speaks for itself  We are raging bulls on Macao s future  We think the last 20 years were great  We look forward to being the biggest investor the next 20 years  And our goal is to invest billions of dollars in Macao We have had conversations with the government repeatedly about our desire to invest heavily to make Macao everything it can be  It s already the most important city in the world    in the gaming world  We want to see it become the most important city in the MICE leisure destination business  We d like to see more families  more kids  more everybody  And that takes more rooms  that takes more MICE space  that takes more retail  more leisure activity  This city has the potential with the airports and the bridge  the infrastructure to become the most visited city in the world  It could happen if it had the rooms  The demand is there  The supply has to grow Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe had 40 million    39  million something  Phonetic   almost 40 million people come in in 2019 Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  I mean  Sheldon has been very vocal about his willingness to invest heavily  We ve spoken  Technical Issues  over the years about that  There is no surprise that we feel  And as the authors of the current    the Cotai success story  I think Sheldon has listened to pretty well We can t speak to what the government plans to do  We don t know  We simply wait for their advice and their direction and we adhere to that  But we ve been very vocal on our willingness to invest  We want to see Macao reach full potential  I think in Macao  it s in its infancy  it s in its infancy  Vegas in the mid  90s we built up a nation  was considered a mature city  And it turns out the next 25 years way better than the first 25 years  I think Macao is in that same point where as good as it looks today  Macao has so much potential to do so much more and we have been a raging component of that city s growth and that city s maturation beyond gaming into a non gaming destination  That s our hope  that s our desire  We await the advice and direction of the government  but Mr  Adelson and the Board is excited to invest in Macao s big  big future Shaun Kelley    Analyst    Bank of America Merrill LynchThank you very much OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS  Your line is open Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystGreat  Thank you  I wanted to ask about Singapore just thinking about how    I wonder if some of that increase was helped by the slowdown in Macao in December  Can you quantify or just in some ballpark term was the December increase in Singapore up a lot more than the other months in the quarter Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerI missed the last part  Robin  But I don t think we can quantify    it s very hard to sit there very honestly and tell you that the downturn in Macao drove customers into Singapore  I think what drives people into Singapore is Singapore  It s a very desirable destination  It s a very desirable building  We think we can continue to grow far in visitation  We continue to invest heavily in making the product better in terms of service and quality of room  So I don t look to Macao s demise to help Singapore s growth  I think   Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystAnd I didn t mean    I just meant there was    to some degree  was the month of December in Singapore up more than October and November were Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerWe don t want to break it out  but I think we ll treat the quarter as a whole  I don t think    I wouldn t break it out  I wouldn t do it anyway  but I don t think you need to  The quarter was solid across the board  It was    the Singapore had a nice solid rolling business and non rolling business strong visitation  It s just a good month  a good quarter in Singapore across the board Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystOkay Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerI don t think  Singapore    you might look at obviously as this virus continues that might be an interesting thing to look at the future  But we believe Singapore unto itself is a powerful product and a powerful country that will prosper and grow as we reinvest heavily in it Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystOkay Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLook at the mall in Singapore  If that mall were in the United States  it would be the highest grossing mall in the country   2 000 a foot  Now we have a mall in the Four Seasons in Macao that does like  5 000 a foot and say in US dollars in sales  So it s been around the  Phonetic  other malls on Orchard Road Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystYeah  And   Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerA lot of things done over there  We think there s a lot of room to grow  though  We honestly believe we can do a lot better in Singapore and that s why we re investing in future Singapore Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystOkay  thank you  And then just my follow up question  And I feel like Dan is going to say the answer to this  This is buried on Slide 84 or something that is like hard to get through all in 10 minutes before the call starts  So   Daniel Briggs    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsSpeaker C Daniel BriggsWe apologize for all  Indecipherable  Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystWell  no  no  it s great  But I hope if it is buried in there that you ll be kind  But the question was just thinking about the pace of the quarters this year and the potential disruption at The Londoner  just how should we think about like when to expect like maybe more disruption versus less disruption in the quarters  And actually is a slower environment right now a time to accelerate some of the disruption and say  let s get that out of the way Sheldon G  Adelson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat s a great    the second part of your question  Indecipherable  I am curious if there s an    we don t have the answer today  but I ve asked the team to explore that very question  Is there a chance to accelerate construction process in Macao during this slowdown  I don t know the answer of that  So I won t represent  I will tell you having been there a couple of weeks ago in The Londoner and walked through it  it was comical and I thought of people in this call as I walked through dust and jack hammers and construction everywhere and the customers  Indecipherable  playing like crazy And I did laugh myself  I said I feel like I m making up a bad story here to say disruption will happen  I think it will happen  Just don t understand why people keep coming  I guess the rooms are so valuable  We re right now in the middle of building 10 new restaurants with blowing  Phonetic  up a casino over there and redoing it  All the Londoner rooms are in construction  St  Regis  there is a lot of people in that building working on to make it disruptive and yet are not being disrupted  We keep getting visitations  The quarter was very  very good  And I hope I m a liar and wrong that this market will eventually stop coming to the SEC as it transitions into Londoner However  having been there with my own two eyes  I had to stop and chuckle  how busy it was  And the rooms  Phonetic  remain again Macao is underserved from a lodging perspective  You realize that when you walk through Londoner  right  people are sleeping there  They re not necessarily coming from the properties  It s not a destination property  but they re sleeping there  And they re gambling there  And it s just extraordinary to watch  If that building were in Las Vegas  there wouldn t be a soul in there  but in China  it was a much different story  So we continue to tell you when you build a brand new casino  brand new facade  redo  1 200 keys  build a St  Regis  rip the facade off  someday there ll be some disruption  I just don t know when Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystOkay  That sounds great Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating Officer Speech Overlap  Dan is going to address that  Dan would have had a slide  but we didn t think of that Robin Farley    UBS    AnalystThank you Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerAll right  Thank you  Robin OperatorYour last question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research  Your line is open Jared Shojaian    Wolfe Research    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  everybody  Thanks to return  In terms of the visitation declines  are you seeing that more on the mass side or the VIP side  And then for my follow up  I know the corona virus is quite unique  I don t know  if there is any precedent  or anything historically that would suggest call it one time interruptions normally lead to pent up demand  Is that something you re thinking about  Thank you Robert G  Goldstein    President and Chief Operating OfficerSure  Two things  we cannot    at the level of visitation decline we re experiencing  I think  Indecipherable  for us to break out  it s 80  of the market  it s every segment being affected  Let s not be    let s not try to be cute about this  It s across the board  every segment is in decline for every property  It is no way be anymore honest in that As for pent up demand  I m a big believer in pent up demand  the fact there    and in fact this is killing Chinese New Year  I think when this does resolve  whether it s next month or next quarter    I don t know when it resolves  I don t pretend to know  There s a very good article in a journal today about the history of these viruses in the last 60 years  70 years  And they get solved  be the Hong Kong flu  the Russian flu  the Asian flu  the flu I had when I was 12 years old  they resolve  And they will resolve this time  whether that s February or March  I don t know  But when it does resolve  Macao is going to be very  very  very busy because    whether you know it or not  these folks like to gamble  And we have the biggest and best properties in Macao  They will come back in force  And it s a very  very wonderful market  We re delighted to be there  It s a very strong government that we like working with  And I think the brighter day will come very quickly for Macao  We just don t know when that happens  but you can count on pent up demand  Believe me  you  there ll be a lot of people there the day that virus is resolved and we will be happy to serve them and welcome them back  So it s a fair question  a good question  and I have a very strong answer  Yes  pent up demand is a real issue in a place like Macao Jared Shojaian    Wolfe Research    AnalystAll right  Thank you very much Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  40 minutesCall

195978,417494,LVS,Foreign casino operators go all in as they vie for Osaka license,news,"By Thomas Wilson and Mari Saito OSAKA  Reuters    In late July  a lavish fireworks display lit up Osaka s skies in the finale to one of Japan s most famous festivals  courtesy of a first time sponsor  Macau casino operator Melco Resorts and Entertainment Ltd  O MLCO    The company s chief executive  41 year old billionaire Lawrence Ho  had only hours earlier met Osaka s governor after a donation for natural disaster preparation   Also in town was MGM Resorts International s  N MGM  chief executive  Jim Murren  He didn t bring a donation   just the Blue Man Group to entertain around 100 guests on a chartered boat   The partying and pageantry were part of a concerted effort to convince Osaka who should operate one of Japan s first casino resorts  Just days before  the country authorized the initial three licenses  Thanks to strong local political support  an available site and a supportive business community  the western Japanese metropolis of 2 7 million is widely expected to become the first major city to host a casino   Tokyo has not raised its hand  Yokohama has not raised its hand   Osaka has raised its hand   said Ed Bowers  MGM s executive vice president of global development   A huge new revenue stream is on the line for the casino operators  which also include Galaxy Entertainment Corp  BO GALE    Caesars Entertainment Corp   O CZR   Genting Singapore Ltd  SI GENS  and  Las Vegas Sands  Corp  N LVS   An Osaka casino could generate  4 billion a year   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  says   For Osaka  which has seen its wealth and power fade in relation to Tokyo  gambling could boost tourism and bring in much needed money  It hopes to open a resort by 2024  but even after it picks an operator it must win government approval    I want to properly nurture the tourism industry in Osaka as one of its pillars   Osaka Governor Ichiro Matsui told Reuters in an interview   Interviews with dozens of casino executives  lobbyists and politicians depict sophisticated campaigns aimed at winning over a skeptical public  wooing local businesses and persuading officials  And Osaka  eager to avoid even the appearance of corruption  has become more cautious in dealing with casino operators  In July  the city reiterated a ban on officials  attending parties  sharing meals or receiving gifts  It also prohibits officials from meeting casino representatives alone   All told  at least eight major operators are courting Osaka  MGM  Sands and Melco have in recent years pledged to sink  10 billion into a resort   DREAM ISLAND Osaka wants to build a casino on a man made site called Yumeshima  or  Dream Island    Yumeshima was built during Osaka s 1970s boom times  Its bayside area was once a blue collar district crowded with chemical factories and shipyards  But those companies moved production abroad  The city was hit hard when Japan s bubble economy popped  and politicians have for two decades tried with little success to revive both the waterfront and Osaka  Still  with a four fold surge in foreign tourists over the last five years   more than 11 million people visited Osaka in 2017  attracted by its rich culinary culture and wealth of nearby sights   casino operators see a fertile market    This is the greatest opportunity of my lifetime   Melco s Ho told Reuters by phone   Executives from 11 casino companies have met Governor Matsui for  courtesy calls  25 times between 2012 and May 2018  prefectural records show  Operators and other related companies have met Osaka officials 119 times since May 2017  Osaka declined to provide breakdowns of meetings by company   HEARTS AND MINDS Melco s most recent donation to Osaka  reported by local media to total about 50 million yen   450 000   wasn t its first  Melco also gave money for victims of a June earthquake that killed four in Osaka  and for parts of western Japan devastated by flooding a month later  The company declined to say how big those donations were  its fireworks sponsorship was worth about  9 000  Ako Shiraogawa  Melco s Japan president  told Reuters she reassured local officials the donations were not meant to curry favor  It was a coincidence that Ho met Osaka s Matsui before the fireworks display  she said   It looks like we are doing too much   Shiraogawa said   But it just happened to be the same day as the festival    Like its Macau rival  MGM is building a bigger presence in Osaka  including an office  It says it is trying to win the  hearts and minds  of the city s public and businesses  Before the festival  for instance  it gave shoppers at a local arcade the chance to win tickets to its boat party   Behind the scenes  MGM has worked to connect with Osaka companies  said Kanji Hori  who runs the Hyakusha Kai association of small businesses  which is hoping for a stake in an operating consortium  Tokyo based GR Japan lobbies on behalf of MGM  Bowers told Reuters  GR Japan opened an Osaka office in February  hiring as associate director a former national lawmaker from Matsui s Ishin no Kai party   For its part  Las Vegas Sands says it has focused on engaging with local officials  businesses and community groups  Its chief executive  Sheldon Adelson  met Matsui in September  Officials from Sands declined to be interviewed   SENSITIVE SUBJECT In Osaka  42 percent of residents are opposed to a casino over fears of gambling addiction and less than a fifth are in favor  a poll by public broadcaster NHK in March showed  The city s government is trying to swing public opinion with seminars on dependency and a message of prosperity  A resort would create more than 80 000 jobs a year in the region  officials say  But Teruo Sakurada  a professor at Osaka s Hannan University who heads an anti casino group  said those positions would most likely be part time and lower paid   They want tourism and foreign demand to drive the local economy  but this isn t a sustainable model   he said   Despite casino operators  enthusiasm in courting Osaka  there have so far been no major accusations of impropriety   The only incident approaching scandal  a PwC Consulting employee on a 377 million yen contract to advise the city on casinos attended MGM s boat party  breaking no laws but earning a scolding from a local official  A PwC Japan spokeswoman said the incident did not violate its agreement

195989,417505,LVS,In Vietnam  a mega casino rises with the help of a Macau junket company,news,"By Farah Master HONG KONG  Reuters    Along a three kilometer  2 mile  stretch of coastline in central Vietnam  construction cranes are digging up mounds of sand and rubble where the country s biggest casino is set to open next year  When completed  the  4 billion Hoiana project will extend across almost 1 000 hectares  and also include shops  restaurants  golf courses and water parks  Driving the project is Suncity Group Holdings Ltd  HK 1383   which has made billions luring high rollers   mainly from China   to the baccarat tables in the Chinese territory of Macau  Vietnam is betting big on developing a gambling industry  targeting the Chinese tourists who have been flocking to the country in recent years  In addition to Hoiana  two other casinos  one in Van Don in the northern province of Quang Ninh  and one on Phu Quoc island in the south  are also under construction  The two projects will be part of a pilot program that would allow Vietnamese citizens to gamble at casinos for the first time  Hoiana will be the first casino owned by SunCity  which will have a one third stake in the project  VinaCapital  a Vietnamese investment management and real estate firm  and the Hong Kong based VMS Investment Group will also have similar sized stakes   The government really wishes to bring tourism here   said Henry Tam  project director of Hoi An South Development  the local company which is building Hoiana  He added that development of the area would also include a school and sports stadium for local residents   This is a 15 20 year project   he said   The area is four times the size of Macau s Cotai strip   The Hoiana project comes with challenges  Local Vietnamese will not be allowed to gamble at the casino and operations are subject to Vietnam s uncertain regulatory environment   Competition around Asia is also heating up  with Macau  the world s largest gambling center  building more resorts  and South Korea and the Philippines expanding their casino footprints  Other countries like Singapore also compete in the sector  Ho Tram  a multi billion dollar casino project located a two hour drive from Ho Chi Minh City  had construction delays and financing problems before it opened in 2013  The casino   which is owned by Asian Coast Development  headed by the hedge fund manager Philip Falcone   has struggled to attract foreign gamblers to its remote location  There are fewer than 10 casinos in Vietnam  mostly smaller ones outside major cities  At present  only foreign passport holders can enter and gamble in them  Suncity executives are optimistic for Hoiana  citing strong government backing  local support through VinaCapital and large scale infrastructure works like the four lane highway that will connect it to Danang s international airport 40 kilometers away  And they are pinning their hopes on Chinese tourists  In 2017  Vietnam welcomed 4 million Chinese visitors  up 49 percent from the previous year  The first phase of the project  which includes a 140 table casino and a golf course  is due to open in 2019  The second phase  which will add a lagoon  water park  second golf course  entertainment village and four more beach resorts  is slated to open by 2023  Anthony Chiu  Suncity s chief financial officer  said the cost of the first phase was  650 million  of which VinaCapital  Suncity and VMS have put in around  70 million each  with the rest coming from bank financing  Companies associated with Chow Tai Fook Enterprises  headed by the Hong Kong billionaire Henry Cheng  are building 100 villas and a 1 176 room hotel as part of the first phase  In addition to Hoiana  Suncity has also signed a management service agreement for the Van Don project in the north  Van Don is scheduled to open in 2019 according to Suncity but details are scarce on the nature of the development  Foreign investors are required to invest over  2 billion in order to qualify for casino licenses  Las Vegas operators including  Las Vegas Sands   N LVS  have been interested in setting up in Vietnam for several years  But Sands has said it would only invest in a casino if locals were allowed to gamble there  CASINO EXPANSION For Suncity  the stakes are high in Hoiana  Booming gambling revenues in Macau have created enormous wealth for junket operators like Suncity  who bring in players from mainland China and collect their debts  But as tighter regulatory controls and a lack of space crimps further development in Macau  junkets have been trying to expand overseas  Their role remains critical for Asian casinos eager to attract Chinese players  as gambling debts are not legally enforceable in China   Suncity is responsible for all the casino operations in Hoiana  including bringing in VIP players  Macau s government will also soon be deciding on whether to allow new contenders to set up casinos in the glittering enclave once the six existing licenses start to expire from 2020  Suncity s 34 percent stake in Hoiana will help position it as a contender for a casino license in Macau  said Grant Govertsen  an analyst at Union Gaming in Macau  Suncity s executive director  Andrew Lo  said Hoiana also gave the company an opportunity to be in control of an operation rather than just a service provider

196046,417562,LVS,Republican donor Adelson and Trump may be aligning on Israel,news,By Farah Master MACAU  Reuters    Top Republican Party donor Sheldon Adelson said on Friday he met presidential candidate Donald Trump earlier this week and that the two American billionaires broached the issue at the heart of Adelson s political agenda  support for Israel   While the mega donor didn t disclose his degree of backing for the front runner in the race for the Republican nomination  he did say he found Trump to be  very charming  and called his standing in the crowded candidate field  unheard of    It was very nice   the gambling tycoon told Reuters in a rare interview in Macau when asked if he had met Trump  who leads in opinion polls of Republican voters   He was very charming   Hours later  Trump returned the compliment to Adelson  telling Reuters   Sheldon and I have been friends for a long time  He is an amazing man  I am the only one who doesn t need his money  But I would love his support   On the subject of Israel  Trump added   Sheldon knows that nobody will be more loyal to Israel than Donald Trump    The meeting and Trump s pro Israel stance   coming after more ambiguous remarks a few weeks ago   could pave the way for a deeper relationship between the two men  a month and a half before the first Republican nominating contest in Iowa  Israel is  by far  the most important issue to Adelson  a fierce supporter of the nation and close friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  Adelson also owns the newspaper with the largest circulation in Israel  a free daily   The 82 year old chief executive of  Las Vegas Sands  Corp  N LVS   the world s biggest gambling company by market value  made his comments a few days after hosting the latest debate among Republican Party presidential candidates at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas  where and his Israeli born wife  Miriam  an accomplished medical doctor and philanthropist  live   Adelson said much of his discussion with Trump was about Israel    He  Trump  had talked about potentially dividing Jerusalem and Israel  so I talked about Israel because with our newspaper  my wife being Israeli  we are the few who know more about Israel than people who don t   Adelson said   Courted by most of the Republican candidates and widely expected to be the party s top donor in the November 2016 presidential election  Adelson said earlier on Friday during a news conference that he may wait until February s primaries to decide who to back  He described the field of Republican candidates as  all very good   RECOVERING FROM A MISSTEP Some 14 candidates are still in the race for the Republican Party nomination  The latest Reuters Ipsos poll showed Trump leading the field with support of 31 percent of Republican voters  followed by Texas Senator Ted Cruz at 17 percent  pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 13 percent  Florida Senator Marco Rubio at eight percent and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush at seven percent   We like a lot of the candidates  some more than the others   Adelson said during the interview in Macau  the world s largest gambling hub  ahead of the formal opening of his new St  Regis hotel in the former Portuguese colony   It s changing every day  I saw in the news today that Trump said his percentage approval was 41 percent  Out of 14 candidates  41 percent is unheard of    Asked what characteristics he would like the Republican party s nominee to embody  Adelson said   They have got to be able to win   Trump s brash  off the cuff style has not dented his popularity  despite predictions to the contrary  But on Israel  he did find himself in trouble two weeks ago  and he also angered prominent Jewish leaders with his comments on Muslims   Speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition in Washington  Trump wavered in answering a question about whether he would consider Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel  drawing boos from the crowd  Palestinians want East Jerusalem  captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war  for their future state  Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its indivisible capital  a claim not recognized internationally  A week after Trump spoke to the gathering of Jewish leaders  and in the wake of a shooting by two Muslim radicals in California that killed 14  Trump proposed barring all foreign Muslims from entering the United States  His call drew the immediate ire of some prominent Jewish Republicans   Trump does  however  have deep ties to the Jewish community  He is the only presidential candidate who lives  makes deals and hobnobs among some of the world s most prominent Jewish power figures on the Upper East Side of Manhattan   He s also the only Republican candidate with Jewish grandkids  his daughter  Ivanka  became Orthodox after marrying real estate scion Jared Kushner  The family keeps kosher  observes the Sabbath and attends the upscale synagogue Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun   BUYS LAS VEGAS NEWSPAPER In Macau  Adelson also made his first public comments confirming his family s acquisition of the Las Vegas Review Journal newspaper   The  140 million deal to buy the largest paper in the state of Nevada  an important swing state  had been shrouded in secrecy  Described by Forbes magazine as the 15th richest man in the United States  Adelson said his family had bought the paper as a financial investment  dismissing speculation the deal was aimed at controlling media in the United States    The Review Journal is already on my side of the political spectrum   Adelson said   This newspaper has been making money   we left the  everyday  operation in the hands of the owner from who we bought it    We are not going to hire an editor  we left it up to them  current management

 SINGAPORE  April 8  Reuters    Singapore s casino regulator
is investigating allegations of illegal activities in the
city state s casinos  its spokesman said on Friday 	
 The regulator has  received some information alleging
illegal activities in the casinos  The authorities take these
allegations seriously and have initiated investigations   the
Casino Regulatory Authority  CRA  said in an emailed statement 	
 The investigations follow comments from Las Vegas Sands 
 chief executive  Sheldon Adelson  that unlicensed junket
representatives could be operating in Singapore 	
 Junket operators bring in gambling groups in return for
commissions from casinos 	
  Adelson  on his part  has informed CRA of his concerns over
alleged illegal activities at the casinos  CRA has asked Adelson
and MBS to provide further information   CRA said 	
 Las Vegas Sands owns Marina Bay Sands  a  5 5 billion casino
in Singapore  while Genting Singapore operates the
only other casino  Resorts World Sentosa  in the city state 	
 The Casino Control Act provides for the licensing of junket
operators and representatives in Singapore and junket operators
that meet the regulatory requirements would be allowed to
operate in Singapore after being licensed  CRA said 	
 So far  no licenses have been issued 	
 The CRA said it has received junket applications endorsed by
Resorts World Sentosa and is currently processing them 	
 Adelson s own operations in Macau are under investigation by
the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and the company
also faces a U S  lawsuit alleging corruption and bribery 	
 Sands China Ltd disclosed the investigation in
late March 	
 The company is being sued by its former chief executive 
Steve Jacobs  who said he was ordered to use  improper leverage 
against Macau government officials to help expand the company s
operations 	
 An investigative report by Reuters in March disclosed that
Jacobs played a key role in the expansion of Sands China  but
clashed repeatedly with Adelson over hiring more junket
operators  who in the past have been connected with triad
criminal gangs

 By Michael Flaherty
 HONG KONG  Sept 20  Reuters    Las Vegas casino company Wynn
Resorts has raised the size of the initial public share offer in
Hong Kong for its Macau unit by around 25 percent  according to
sources familiar with the matter  seeking to raise up to  1 6
billion 
 U S  casino operators  grappling with high debt levels and a
recovering economy  are hoping to boost valuations through
spinoffs in China s gambling hub  Macau  the former Portuguese
colony located an hour away from Hong Kong by ferry which now
hosts the world s biggest gambling market that raked in record
bets in August   
 Macau casino offers from Wynn and its rival Las Vegas Sands
 come amid an expanding pipeline of other Hong Kong IPOs 
 Wynn Macau previously sought to raise up to  1 billion  but
after positive feedback from investors it has raised the offer
and the company now plans to sell 25 percent of the division  up
from the 20 percent it originally expected to sell 
 The price range of the offer is expected to be HK 8 52 10 08
per share  the sources said on Sunday  with at least 1 25
billion shares being sold  The sources have direct knowledge of
the offering but were not authorised to speak publicly about the
deal yet 
  The IPO has attracted a combined  250 million from several
so called  cornerstone investors   or investors who take a
substantial stake in the company before the offering  one of the
sources said 
 Among them is Thomas Lau  the billionaire managing director
of Lifestyle International  the retailer that operates the Sogo
department stores in Hong Kong s Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui
districts and the Jiuguang Department Store in Shanghai 
 Another is Walter Kwok  of the Kwok family run Sun Hung Kai
Properties  Asia s largest property group by market value 
Malaysia s wealthy Guoco family is also investing in the IPO 
 Wynn s second resort in Macau  called Encore at Wynn Macau 
is scheduled to open in the first half of 2010  the company said
in the IPO prospectus  The total budget for the construction is
about  650 million and so far construction costs have totalled
about half that amount 
 The company is funding the construction through existing
cash balances and cash flow from operations  it said in the
filing 
 Wynn s archrival Las Vegas Sands which has filed an
application for a possible listing on the Hong Kong stock
exchange  aims to raise  1 billion to  2 billion through the
sale of a minority stake in its Macau operations at the end of
November or early December 
 But analysts say Wynn s offering in Hong Kong could be
better received than the Sands one due to its lower debt levels
and its strong brand name  
 Wynn  which had shelved its plans to list its Macau assets
late last year amid the stock market plunge  will kick off its
roadshow for the deal on September 21  The shares could be
priced on October 2

   Hong Kong IPO markets show signs of weakening
   Peak Sport falls 17 pct in Tuesday debut
 By Michael Flaherty
 HONG KONG  Sept 29  Reuters    Days before the highly
anticipated pricing for Wynn Macau s  1 6 billion public
offering  Hong Kong s soaring IPO market is sputtering  with
sportswear company Peak Sport the latest weak debut 
 Sources said the Wynn Macau deal  a spin off of the Asian
assets of U S  casino operator Wynn Resorts  is several times
covered  with one source saying the institutional portion was
more than 10 times over subscribed 
 The public listing looks to have solid demand before its
scheduled pricing on Thursday  though sources also cautioned
that the books just closed and pricing is still a day or two
away 
 The sources had direct knowledge of the IPO but were not
authorised to speak publicly about it 
 If priced at the top of the price range of HK 8 52 to
HK 10 08 per share  Wynn Macau will raise HK 12 6 billion
  1 63 billion  in the fourth largest global IPO this year 
 Interest in Wynn Macau offer is especially high given the
deal s potential impact on the company s flagship Las Vegas
operations  Wynn is hoping that a high valuation through the
Macau listing here will boost valuations at its other
divisions 
 But the red hot Hong Kong IPO market  which ripped out
several billion dollar offerings that met with heavy demand and
strong debuts  is showing signs of cooling 
 Investors  which are seeing roughly  15 billion worth of
IPOs hit the Hong Kong market over a three month span  appear
to be getting more selective 
  There are too many deals coming out at the same time  
said Andrew Mantel  managing director of Pacific Sun Investment
Management   There s only so much to go around  
  Mantel  who went to the Wynn Macau investor luncheon but
would not say whether the fund has committed money to the deal 
said first mover advantage was important for Wynn 
  Companies are scrambling to raise money   he said   For
Wynn  it s important to tap the market before other casino
operators  
  Rival Las Vegas Sands is aiming to raise  1 billion to  2
billion through the sale of a minority stake in its Macau
operations at the end of November or early December 
 RECENT ISSUES STRUGGLE
 Several recent issue have struggled 
 Peak Sport Products became the latest victim of cooling
investor enthusiasm for Hong Kong offerings when its shares
ended down 17 percent from their IPO price on Tuesday 
 That weak showing followed a 13 percent fall late last week
for Hong Kong listed shares of Metallurgical Corp of China  a
building and engineering firm that raised  2 3 billion in Hong
Kong s largest IPO so far this year 
 Despite the strong interest in Wynn Macau  the offering may
not price at the actual top of its range due to lacklustre
trading debuts in recent days for other major offerings 
 JPMorgan  Morgan Stanley and UBS AG are joint sponsors and
global coordinators of the deal  with BofA Merrill Lynch and
Deutsche Bank as joint bookrunners 
 The Wynn IPO comes on the back of record monthly gaming
revenues in Macau in August  and news that China has quietly
eased restrictions on its citizens travelling from Guangdong
province to Macau  signaling a faster than expected recovery in
the world s largest gaming market

196081,417597,LVS,PREVIEW High price  tough market stack odds against Wynn Macau,news,"  Wynn Macau shares likely to trade sideways in HK debut
   Recent weak listings  high IPO price to weigh
   Good stock for strong growth prospects analysts
 By Sui Lee Wee
 HONG KONG  Oct 7  Reuters    Investors betting on Wynn
Macau s stock when it debuts in Hong Kong on Friday may need a
little luck  as recent lukewarm listings and a relatively high
IPO price could limit the upside and even send shares down 
 IPO markets globally have been recovering after a near
year long freeze prompted by the financial crisis  Santander
Brasil and Verisk Analytics raised nearly  10 billion between
them on Tuesday 
 Asia has led the recovery in IPOs with many large offerings
primarily in Hong Kong and China in recent months  But already
the boom has begun to show signs of fading on concerns of
oversupply  rich pricings and an uncertain economic outlook 
 A weak debut for Wynn Macau s  1 63 billion listing  likely
to be the world s sixth largest IPO this year  could bode ill
for gambling rival Las Vegas Sands  which plans to raise
billions of dollars in a similar Hong Kong offer this year 
analysts say 
 Both offerings would mark a major win for Hong Kong 
bringing two global marquees to what is otherwise a regional
market 
 Even a flat opening day for Wynn Macau would be a positive
sign for Sands and push it to move ahead with its plans to
list 
  It s too expensive and it doesn t give enough room for
people to make money  not in this current environment   said
Francis Lun  general manager at Fulbright Securities  referring
to the IPO of Wynn Macau 
  Shares of the Asia unit of Wynn Resorts could fall
slightly below their IPO price or remain flat on their debut 
according to a Reuters poll of five traders 
 The company priced its IPO at the top of its indicated
range at HK 10 08 a share  
 Since opening its first Macau property three years ago 
Wynn has nearly doubled its casino space there  and now offers
205 000 square feet of slot machines  baccarat  roulette and
other table games  up from an original 110 000 square feet 
 Lun said many recent listings had seen weak performances 
as investors burn out on a flood of new IPOs coming to market
after a one year hiatus during the global financial crisis 
 The dismal September debut of Metallurgical Corp of China
has weighed heavily on the market  China Resources Cement
became the latest lacklustre debutant on Tuesday  down 4
percent from its IPO price  
 Traders said there was more scope for Wynn Macau shares to
fall due to its steep valuations 
 Wynn Macau trades around 16 times its 2010 enterprise value
to EBITDA  versus 7 5 times for gambling tycoon Stanley Ho s
flagship SJM Holdings   according to Credit Suisse 
 M
 ACAU  PURE PLAY 
 But traders also see firm demand for the Wynn Macau stock
over the longer term  as it will give investors a rare chance
to buy a premier name in the world s biggest gambling market 
 Sources said the IPO is already several times covered  with
one saying the institutional portion was more than 10 times
over subscribed  
 Wynn  which had a 16 4 percent market share of Macau in
2008  is one of a handful of gambling  pure plays  in Macau 
alongside Melco Crown Entertainment  Galaxy Entertainment Group
and SJM Holdings  
  I do think it s one of those more unique stocks   said
Jackson Wong  investment manager at Tanrich Securities   They
priced  it  pretty high  so if it comes down to a more
reasonable P E  price earnings  comparable to other gambling
stocks  that would be a stock to hold and buy  
 Gambling revenues in Macau hit a new high of  1 4 billion
in August  signalling a faster than expected recovery in the
only place in China where gambling is legal  
 Analysts said September figures will likely be stronger 
after China eased restrictions on its citizens travelling from
Guangdong province to Macau  
  How can you not be more excited about the growth prospects
in Macau when every month is a record month for gaming
revenues   said Janet Brashear  analyst with Sanford Bernstein
in New York

   Table limits on casinos good for existing players  analysts
   Adds broker  analyst quotes  details 
 By Sui Lee Wee
 HONG KONG  Oct 13  Reuters    Macau casino stocks slid early
on Tuesday after the former Portuguese enclave said it may review
rules governing the world s fastest growing gambling market  and
could introduce new ones that might limit expansion 
 But analysts and brokers said the reaction from investors was
purely psychological and did not reflect the growth fundamentals
of the enclave  the only place in China where gambling is legal 
  Wynn Macau  the Asia unit of U S  casino giant Wynn Resorts 
lost 1 1 percent before later turning positive  and rival SJM
Holdings eased 2 2 percent at the opening 
 Galaxy Entertainment Group and Melco International were down
1 4 percent and 3 8 percent  respectively 
 Some of the stocks later pared those losses  with Wynn Macau
even rising slightly above Monday s close 
 Macau is considering rules that might impose limits on the
number of tables and raise the age limit for casino customers 
according to a statement posted on the city s official website 
  
  The problem of Macau now is oversupply  so if the government
restricts the supply  it is good for the existing players   said
Francis Lun  a general manager at Fulbright Securities 
 Macau s six casino operators include Las Vegas Sands  Wynn
Resorts  Galaxy  SJM Holdings Ltd  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd
and a casino jointly operated by MGM Mirage and local
businesswoman Pansy Ho 
 Among new regulations now under discussion  the government is
considering raising the entry age for casinos to 21 from 18 and
dictating that slot machine halls be moved away from residential
areas and into commercial zones 
 The new rules appear to be aimed at cleaning up an industry
that has seen explosive growth in the last three years 
 That would contrast with rules introduced in April 2008  when
the government slapped a moratorium on new casino licenses and
implemented a building freeze  a move seen as motivated by an
increasingly concerned Beijing 
  I do not believe the age limit restriction will have a
material impact on gaming revenues in Macau   said Aaron Fischer 
head of Asian property and gaming at CLSA 
  I think it s unlikely that the government will limit the
number of tables   he said   If they limit the table numbers  it
should be positive for the stocks because of higher returns  
 Macau stepped onto the global gambling stage following
reforms that put an end to a monopoly earlier this decade and
awarded licenses to many players that boosted competition  The
Chinese territory generated HK 105 6 billion   13 5 billion  of
gross gaming revenue in 2008  more than double the HK 46 7
billion generated by the Las Vegas Strip during the same period 
  On the supply side  if the Macau government really wants to
curb growth  they should limit the number of casinos because new
casinos drive demand  tables don t   Fischer said

dusk atop the half finished husks of three massive towers 
while weary batches of construction workers  laid off en masse 
stream out of the site s turnstiles  many for the last time 
 After a golden streak since 2002  which saw Macau
transformed from a sleepy former Portuguese colonial backwater
into a Las Vegas style gambling paradise  Macau s luck may be
running out 
  I m in a state of shock  the whole thing has made me
sleepless for days   said Chen Rui  a native of Zhanjiang
across the Chinese border  one of an army of migrant workers
brought in to ease Macau s acute labour shortage amid the
construction boom 
  The economy s bad in China and everything s more expensive
so it s going to affect us badly  Even if we want to find
another construction site it ll be very difficult   Chen  25 
added while other sacked blue collar brethren stared at him in
silence 
 Last week  debt straddled Las Vegas Sands shocked many in
this brash boomtown  by laying off most of the 11 000 workers
on two Cotai strip sites    a stone s throw from the palatial
3 000 suite Venetian Macau  which Sands owner Sheldon Adelson
had opened just a year ago with much fanfare 
  I never thought that was possible before  that such a big
elephant could collapse so easily   said Lam Wai  manager of
the San Tio watch and jewellery pawn shop  one of many
operators feeding off luckless gamblers spilling from the
glitzy casinos 
 TOO MANY LICENSES
 Others blamed the government for the casino glut  for
issuing too many casino licenses and giving precious land to
developers without redistributing the new found wealth 
  I m a Macau person and all of Macau s half million people
are angry with the government   said Ng Sek Io  a laid off
worker still clutching a red helmet outside the suspended
construction projects  which included five star hotels such as
the Sheraton  Shangri La and St  Regis  as well as luxury
shopping malls 
  It s a corrupt and incompetent government and it hasn t
considered our current livelihood difficulties   Ng added 
 Macau s gaming tycoon Stanley Ho has warned the recession
could last up to three years  But even before the downturn 
visa restrictions imposed by China on risk loving Chinese
punters had begun to corrode gaming revenues 
 Macau has yet to see other major casino operators keel over
like the Sands  Analysts say that while Adelson s bold dream of
transforming the Cotai strip into a fully integrated family
entertainment and conference hub rivalling Vegas  legendary
strip may be delayed for several years  it is not broken 
Melco s City of Dreams casino  a joint venture by the sons
of Australian tycoon Kerry Packer and Stanley Ho  is still due
to open next year and the sprawling reclaimed isthmus is still
the only place left in land cramped Macau for mega projects to
rise 
  You ve hit a speed bump where you ve seen growth slowing 
but it s not a case where everything s gone over the cliff  
said David Green  gaming practice director in Macau for
PricewaterhouseCoopers 
 Macau is still the only place on Chinese soil where casinos
are allowed to operate 
  Macau will always have one unbelievable advantage and
that s location  It s geographically and politically part of
China and as long Chinese have their penchant for gambling 
this place will do well   Green said 
  By the end of next year there should be enough confidence
around to see an increase in gambling activity   he added 
 AFFECTS EVERYTHING
 But on Macau s historic and winding Portuguese cobblestoned
streets  more and more Macanese with lives outside the casino
orbit are becoming nervous 
  We re all a bit worried   said Connie Chan  a recently
laid off clerk at a textiles firm looking for work in the
enclave s bustling Labour Services Bureau   I d be lying if I
said I wasn t  The environment is not so good because if the
gaming sector isn t good  it will affect everything  
 Many hope China will soon respond to Macau s woes by easing
recent visa restrictions on Chinese visitors to stimulate
retail spending and sagging gaming receipts 
 But the enclave faces a competitive threat from Singapore 
which opens its first casino resorts late next year  Analysts
say that could end up scooping more business from Macau than
many expect  given the city state s broader family and cultural
appeal 
  We are going to have enormous difficulties because those
laid off may have great difficulties in finding another job as
we have not diversified our industry in Macau   So overall
we re quite dependent on the gaming   said Jose Coutinho  a
Macau lawmaker 
 Those who have benefited from higher property prices and
wages are taking Macau s shifting fortunes in stride 
  Before  jobs looked for people  but now people are looking
for jobs   said Martin Kou  a 45 year old restaurant manager 
  It s like a change of feng shui for us  the end of a
cycle

 JERUSALEM  Jan 6  Reuters    One of the main partners in a
group seeking to build a multi billion dollar casino on the Las

Sheldon Adelson to become a partner in the project 
 Israel s TheMarker financial news website said that Israeli
businessmen Yitzhak Tshuva and Nochi Dankner  head of Israeli

 Adelson is chief executive of Las Vegas Sands Corp  which
has lost more than 90 percent of its market value in recent

the agenda   IDB said in a statement 
 Dankner and Tshuva are in New York to meet bankers regarding
financing for the project

plans to use the Plaza name on the proposed  5 billion resort
casino in Las Vegas 
 Elad teamed up with IDB to form Elad IDB Las Vegas LCC  the
group which purchased the site to build the hotel 
 Elad IDB in 2007 bought the now demolished New Frontier
Resort   Casino for  1 25 billion  taking out a loan of  625
million from Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse 
 The company  which received a postponement for repayment of

 HONG KONG LOS ANGELES  May 26  Reuters    The world economy
may be slumping  but don t tell that to Macau    the former
Portugese colony which is set to trump Las Vegas heading out of
the worst global downturn since the Great Depression 
 In the smoke filled gambling halls of Macau s MGM Mirage
casino  hundreds of Chinese gamblers were crammed around tables
flipping cards  playing roulette and rolling dice on a recent
day  seemingly unaffected by the slowdown 
 The ace up the sleeve of Macau  the world s biggest
gambling market  is this steady influx of risk loving Chinese
flocking to the only place in China where casinos are legal 
Las Vegas  on the other hand  is saddled with a stagnant U S 
economy and glut of new casinos preparing to enter the market 
  We ve seen better than expected performance in the overall
gaming market of Macau   said Credit Suisse analyst Gabriel
Chan   Vegas is still suffering and will take a longer time to
recover  but in Macau  we are beginning to see the light at the
end of the tunnel  
 Macau  a special administrative region that is now under
Chinese rule  will be more resilient than Las Vegas thanks to
its proximity to China  which is propping up its economy with a
massive 4 trillion yuan   586 billion  stimulus package to
offset a big drop in exports  analysts said 
 Investors are also betting that a new Macau chief executive
who takes office on July 26 will convince Beijing to relax visa
restrictions on mainland tourists  Curbs were imposed last
October amid concerns about corruption and problem gambling 
 Executives from Macau s top gaming companies have been
cautiously optimistic to outright bullish on their prospects in
recent interviews with Reuters  citing recent gains in Chinese
tourist numbers 
 Mainland Chinese accounted for 51 percent of Macau s
visitors in 2008  according to Macau s Statistics and Census
Service 
 ON A ROLL
 The upbeat outlook has put Macau casino operators on a
roll  making them some of the top performing stocks in Hong
Kong  Shares of Melco International Development have more than
doubled in the past three months  Galaxy Entertainment has
soared 80 percent and SJM Holdings has gained 64 percent 
 Shares of their U S  peers have also rallied  but more on
relief that the companies have staved off bankruptcy concerns 
In the past three months  MGM Mirage has jumped 81 percent  Las
Vegas Sands has nearly quadrupled  while Wynn Resorts has risen
44 percent 
 On a 2009 enterprise value to earnings before interest 
tax  depreciation and amortisation ratio  EV EBITDA   Wynn now
trades at around 15 5 times  versus 7 4 times for Galaxy and
about 1 4 times for MGM  according to Macquarie Research 
 Both gambling centres have reported year on year revenue
declines in recent months  but Macau has fared slightly better
with first quarter revenues down 12 6 percent year on year
compared with a 16 6 percent drop for the Las Vegas Strip 
 For a graphic on gaming revenues  click 
 
 Despite recent declines  Macau s gaming revenue is likely
to return to a growth track by September and post a 6 2 percent
rise in 2010  BNP Paribas forecasts 
 In contrast  the third quarter is expected to be still
challenging for Las Vegas  with convention bookings likely to
remain weak  Barclays Capital said  Las Vegas revenues are
likely to remain depressed next year as operators have to
contend with a stream of new casino openings  
  There will be a fairly dramatic increase in supply over
the next couple of years     at a time when Las Vegas is
struggling to fill the rooms that it has right now   said
Susquehanna Financial analyst Robert LaFleur 
 Luxury projects such as MGM Mirage s massive CityCenter
will start opening later this year  increasing by more than 10
percent the number of hotel rooms along the Vegas gambling
corridor 
 So far  Macau casinos     which mostly rely on day trippers
who arrive by ferry from Hong Kong or by road from mainland
China     have largely avoided the deep discounts that are
eroding profits for Las Vegas s operators  analysts said 
 MATURING MARKET 
 While Vegas has been a global gambling centre for decades 
mega casinos began opening in Macau barely five years ago and
issues such as fee structures for tour operators and visas are
still being ironed out 
 But while Macau looks more promising than Vegas to most 
some analysts warned increased competition means a return to
explosive growth rates seen earlier this decade is unlikely 
 Four new casinos will open within the next two years  with
Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd s City of Dreams set to open on
June 1  In addition  Las Vegas Sands and Galaxy are in the
process of building new mega resorts that are temporarily on
hold due to funding issues and slowing conditions in Macau 
  I do think there will be some sort of cannibalisation of
revenues   said JP Morgan analyst Billy Ng   The competitive
landscape is definitely worse than a few years ago and the
opening of the City of Dreams will make it worse for sure

Thursday 
 Melco Crown s stellar performance is part of a broad based
rally in shares of other Macau gaming companies  which have
soared on hopes of a recovery in the world s biggest gambling
market 
 MACAU TRANSFORMATION
 The new casino is a stone s throw from Las Vegas Sands 
palatial 3 000 room Venetian Macau  the world s largest casino
resort  which opened just a year ago 
 The City of Dreams is targeting a similar level of visitors
as the Venetian  which now attracts 50 000 to 70 000 visitors per
day  said Greg Hawkins  the president of the casino resort 
 Ho said he hoped the City of Dreams would help transform
Macau  which mostly attracts day trippers from mainland China and
Hong Kong  into a destination where gamblers would stay for
longer periods and come from more distant locations 
 Analysts and industry executives are watching to see if the
City of Dreams will cannibalise gaming revenues in Macau  which
has 31 casinos  Three more are expected to open by 2010 
 But analysts such as CLSA s Aaron Fischer are optimistic 
  Clearly the Venetian will lose some market share  most
companies do in the beginning when new casinos open   Fischer
said 
  But the City of Dreams will be the tipping point for Cotai  
he said   Cotai will start attracting more visits and that means
more revenue being shared among the operators  We think it s
going to be net positive for the Venetian  
 The opening phase of the City of Dreams has a 420 000 square
foot casino  with 520 gaming tables and two hotels    the Crown
Towers and Hard Rock Hotel    which have about 300 rooms each 
and a dome shaped theatre 
 The third hotel  the Grand Hyatt Macau  has about 800 rooms
and is set to be completed by October 
 Ho hopes the City of Dreams will expand Melco Crown s
mass market segment  which commands higher margins because the
company would not have to fork out gaming commissions to  junket 
operators   middle man operations that bring in high rolling
gamblers

Wynn Resorts has submitted an application to list its Macau
unit on the Hong Kong stock exchange  sources said on Tuesday

year  Both gaming groups  saddled with debt after expansions

196110,417626,LVS,UPDATE 1 ANALYSIS Macau casinos go from boom to gloom,news," Adds quotes from Las Vegas Sands 
 By Dominic Whiting
 HONG KONG  Nov 13  Reuters    When multi billionaire
Sheldon Adelson unveiled a gleaming model of casinos and plush
hotels in a dimmed Macau room nearly four years ago  he
promised a  15 billion Asian  neon alley  to rival Las Vegas 
 But the vision Adelson said came to him in a dream could
remain largely idle reclaimed land for a few years longer as
the financial crisis and slowing gaming revenue puts him
billions of dollars short of the funding he needs to complete
the project 
 Left in the dust of Macau s Cotai Strip are the hopes of
some of the world s biggest hotel chains  such as Starwood
Hotels and Intercontinental Hotels  which imagined a bustling
centre of fun and conferences 
  It s all doom and gloom   said a construction executive at
a rival casino project in Macau  who asked not to be identified
in making comments about a competitor 
  There are going to be some mass cullings on building
sites  
 Hampered by steep construction costs  frustrated by Chinese
visa restrictions and squeezed by tour operators asking high
commissions to ship in gamblers  Macau casinos have had a tough
time in the last year 
 Now Adelson s Las Vegas Sands is struggling to fund
projects because falling revenue from Las Vegas means it risks
breaching U S  loan covenants  which tie debt levels to
earnings  Banks could demand early repayment 
 The firm  stretched by a casino project in Singapore 
suspended construction on its Macau expansion and said on
Thursday it was laying off most of the 11 000 construction
workers on the projects 
 It also said it was in talks with a syndicate of banks to
raise between  1 5 billion and  2 billion in project finance
but gave no timetable 
  We would not have suspended if we could see clarity on how
long it would take to raise the funds   Stephen Weaver  the
firm s Asia president  told reporters at the Venetian Macao 
 The loans come on top of some  2 1 billion in fresh equity
raised by Las Vegas Sands this week  of which about half will
come from Adelson  The other half will from a public share
offering priced on Tuesday at  5 50 each for shares that were
trading at  122 in December  The stock slide meant Adelson  the
son of a taxi driver  lost  4 billion of wealth in September 
Forbes says 
  The plan to develop the Cotai Strip in three years time
was overly aggressive   said Credit Suisse analyst Gabriel
Chan   But it s not a demand problem  more a financing
problem  
 Macau is forecast to notch up nearly  14 billion in gaming
revenue this year  a gain by nearly a third on 2007  despite a
recent slowdown as China cut back on visa approvals 
 Beijing has become nervous about the territory s impact on
society and its use by corrupt officials to launder money 
analysts say 
 DREAM BIG
 Adelson was encouraged to dream big by a 2002 move to end a
four decade casino monopoly held by tycoon Stanley Ho and
welcome U S  operators such as Wynn Resorts and MGM
 Beijing then eased rules on travel  unleashing a flood of
gamblers into the only place in China where casinos are legal 
 Hordes thronged Adelson s first casino in the former
Portuguese enclave  the Sands  when it flung open its doors in
2004  Last year he opened the world s biggest casino  the
Venetian  months after Macau overtook Las Vegas as the most
lucrative gaming market 
 The plan was to build a huge complex on the Cotai Strip
that would draw not just hard core gamblers but families and
the convention crowd  who would shop and watch shows 
 But Macau could now fail to reach a critical mass of
attractions  with Las Vegas Sands halting construction of an
850 000 sq ft shopping centre and hotels run by the likes of
Starwood Hotels  Hilton and Intercontinental 
 Many in the industry say Macau needs a breather from
frenetic building  with growth in gaming tables likely to drop
to 12 percent annually over three years  from the planned 35
percent 
  In any other market people would be cheering this growth 
people got spoiled by Macau numbers   said Steve Rosen  senior
vice president at Macao Studio City  which has delayed building
a casino  retail and film studio because of the credit crunch 
 STOMACH ACHE
 While all casinos are keen for Macau to draw the masses 
some could enjoy the respite from a pause by Las Vegas Sands 
 Adelson s arch nemesis  Steve Wynn  has opened one casino
in Macau but held off on building on its land on the Cotai
Strip  And Melco PBL  a joint venture by the sons of Australian
tycoon Kerry Packer and Stanley Ho  has the funding in place to
finish its City of Dreams casino next year 
 But Galaxy Entertainment Group could find it tough to get
the funding to finish its Cotai Mega Resort  analysts say 
  Those who have the money to complete projects next year
will be the big winners   Credit Suisse s Chan said   The City
of Dreams might be the only opening on Cotai in 2009  
 The finished Cotai Strip could be put off for as long as
seven years  Chan said  But few in the industry doubt Adelson 
now aged 75  is determined to make his dream reality  even if
he needs to spend more of his own money 
  He s got the vision  he believes in it   said Rosen 
  And five years down the road people will look at the Cotai
Strip say it was a visionary project   he added

196258,417774,LVS,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Zynga  Las Vegas Sands  MGM Resorts International And Boyd Gaming,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   March 27  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Zynga Inc    NASDAQ ZNGA    Las Vegas Sands Corp    NYSE LVS    MGM Resorts International   NYSE MGM   and Boyd Gaming Corporation   NYSE BYD   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  Gaming Industry Outlook  Macau Volatility Continues to HurtThe Zacks industry includes companies  which primarily own and operate integrated casino  hotel  and entertainment resorts  Some of the companies in the industry also deliver technology products as well as services across lotteries  electronic gaming machines  sports betting and interactive gaming Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes   Legalization of sports betting outside Nevada has given the industry a new lease of life  The Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act  PASPA  that banned sports betting outside Nevada  The scope for casino operators will grow as  illegally  the activity is valued at billions of dollars annually in the United States  Sports betting has been legalized in Delaware  Mississippi  New Jersey  New Mexico  West Virginia  Pennsylvania and Rhode Island  Moreover  Connecticut  Illinois  Kentucky  Michigan  Indiana  Massachusetts  Maryland and more states are also likely to tread the same path in the coming months    Improving tourism in Las Vegas and rising demand for gaming and leisure will continue to drive the industry  Per a report published by Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  on Jan 18  Las Vegas casinos will shine in 2019  Moreover  the firm suggests that investors looking to invest in casino stocks this year should look no further than Los Angeles  based casinos  Most of the companies are opting for alternative avenues to expand customer base and business  Additionally  casinos operators are collaborating with the hospitality sector  setting up luxury hotels and taking initiatives to improve gaming businesses  Since these non gaming services generate higher margins  companies are increasingly focusing on other streams to drive revenues    Macau  the world s largest gambling hub  remains volatile  Slowdown in China and the trade war between Beijing and Washington have impacted casino operators in Macau  Though gaming revenues from Macau increased for the 29th consecutive month in February  it lagged analysts  expectation  However  revenues from the region declined 5  in January  However  gaming revenues for the period January to February Chinese New Year declined 0 5  compared to a year ago  Flagging China property price impacted the high end VIP segment  The recent smoking ban in the city impacted the VIP segment  However  mass market revenues continue to be impressive  Moreover  Macau s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau   DICJ   is increasing its audits of the junket industry owing to money laundering concerns  Markedly  junkets are responsible for about half of gaming revenues in Macau  Thus  this crackdown may affect Macau revenues Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming Industry is grouped within the broader  The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates gloomy near term prospects  The Zacks Gaming industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  205  which places it in the bottom 20  of 256 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since Oct 31  2018  the industry s earnings estimate for the current year has gone down 16 6  Despite the industry s drab near term prospects  we will present a few gaming stocks that one can hold on to  But it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder return and current valuation Industry Lags Sector and S P 500The Zacks Gaming industry has lagged the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector as well as the S P 500 Index over the past year The industry has declined 17 8  over this period against the S P 500 Index s rise of 9 8   The broader sector has declined 0 4  in the said time frame  Gaming Industry s ValuationSince gaming companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 12 51  which is below the high of 24 29 in the past year and the median level of 21 50  The space looks quite pricey when compared to the market at large as the trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio for the S P 500 is 10 84 and the median level is 11 08 Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 24 29X  as low as 10 46X and median of 13 26X  as the chart below shows Enterprise Value to EBITDA Ratio  Past 5 Years  Bottom LineVolatility in Macau gaming revenues remains a concern for the industry  Speculations of another crackdown on capital outflows by China have kept investors on the edge  However  with continued innovation and rampant use of smartphones as well as other electronic devices  online gambling is fast gaining popularity and is positioned for long term growth None of the stocks in the gaming space currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   So  we are presenting one stock with a Zacks

Solid Business Model
Las Vegas is one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry  Additionally  its solid business model  extensive non gaming revenue opportunities  high quality assets and attractive property locations are encouraging  In fact  the company s strong portfolio has somewhat aided Las Vegas in withstanding the economic downturn in China  which has hurt its Macao operations 
Meanwhile  with the economic recovery in the United States  the company s business should continue growing in Macao  Also  some entertainment offerings in the pipeline are expected to deliver increased profitability across the company s properties 
Macao Business to Spur Growth Over the Long term
Las Vegas generates a major part of its revenues from Macao  In first quarter 2018  the company reported robust growth in its Macao business  EBITDA from Macao operation in the quarter was up 26  year over year to  789 million

The improvement in employment rate and rise in tourism numbers in the region has been increasing demand at the company s properties in Las Vegas  Further  the diversification of its resort portfolio and non gaming options should contribute to significant revenue growth

196311,417827,LVS,General Motors  GM  And Las Vegas Sands  LVS   Growth   Income Stocks ,opinion,"Over the past week the financial news cycle has been dominated by the expanding tariff war between the U S  and China  and technology data privacy issues   But while those two items have been getting most of the headlines  there has been some very positive reports regarding both General Motors  GM   and Las Vegas Sands  LVS   Each company has had several important data points mostly brushed under the rug  but that does not mean the data was not important to their long term growth stories  
On April 3rd  the March motor vehicles report was released  and overall the data was much better than expected   Total vehicle sales came in at 17 5 million  well above the expected reading of 16 9 million   Moreover  domestic vehicle sales totaled 13 7 million  ahead of the 12 9 million consensus estimate   This strong sales month reversed the downturn that had been in place for the past 3 consecutive months   It was believed that increasing interest rates  and the millions of nearly new vehicles coming off lease would continue to dampen the appetite of new buyers  
This vehicle sales bounce back was led by General Motors   NYSE GM    who reported selling 296 341 crossover  truck  and car deliveries in the U S for the month of March   This was a banner month for the company  as it was the best March in GM s history   Further  total sales were up  16  as Buick had its best March since 2004  Chevrolet had its best March since 2007  and Cadillac posted its best March since 2014  
General Motors also posted a  14  YoY improvement in retail sales  and increased its retail market share to 17 7   its biggest percentage since 2009   Chevrolet was also recognized as the industry s fastest growing full line brand  
On a segment basis  the company posted some impressive March year over year sales numbers as well  Buick crossovers  50   Chevrolet crossovers  39   GMC crossovers  42   Cadillac XT5  17   Cadillac Escalade  14   Chevrolet Silverado  24   Chevrolet Colorado  52   GMC Canyon  9    The company s electric vehicle division also saw some positive traction as Bold EV deliveries totaled 1 774 in March  
After the report was released  Kurt McNeil  U S  vice president  Sales Operations  stated   March was an exceptional month for us  A growing economy and strong new products helped us execute a very successful plan to conquest customers from other brands  Once customers purchase a GM product  they tend to stay in the family as we deliver an award winning ownership experience that is hard to beat 
Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS   had two recent news items that will help the company both in the near and long term   First  the casino operator announced that they sold their Bethlehem  Pennsylvania casino for  1 3 billion to Wind Creek Hospitality  an affiliate of Poarch Band of Creek Indians of Alabama   This was a sizable gain from its cost of  743 million when it built the property in 2009   Further  Sheldon Adelson  CEO  had been trying to divest the company of its Pennsylvania exposure due to a new state law that legalizes online gambling later this year 
Even more important to LVS investors was the March Macau gaming numbers  this data showed that sales leaped up by  22 2  to  3 2 billion  well above the expected growth range of 13 18    The report also revealed that demand for gambling in the region remained high as March was the 20th consecutive month of gains in Macau   While impressive numbers  March s data was still below the highs reached in 2014  but the data is trending in the right direction 
You can see the correlation between the success in Macau and LVS s stock price  in the graph below   In 2014  Macau gaming receipts peaked  as did LVS s stock price   and then gaming revenues began to decline all the way to 2016   In 2016  gaming returns began to pick up  and so did LVS s stock price   So  basically stated  as Macau does well  so does Las Vegas Sands Las Vegas Sands Corp  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   
Las Vegas Sands has invested a lot of money into the region  and is expected to begin the redevelopment of Sands Cotai Central casino resort into The Londoner Macao   Mr  Adelson stated   The Londoner Macao will feature dynamic new attractions and features from London including some of London s most recognizable landmarks  an expanded and reimagined retail mall and 350 luxurious new suites  the St  Regis Tower Suites

196320,417836,LVS,3 Brazen Insiders Buying Their Own 7  To 9  Yields,opinion,"Insider buying can be a useful tool in identifying stocks that may be ready to move  I typically don t put much weight into analyst recommendations because they don t have any skin in the game  But when CEOs and other executives   who know more about the company than you and I   put their money where their mouths are and make significant purchases  I listen 
And I ve had my ear especially close to the ground over the past few weeks  Market chaos like what we ve seen of late chums the water  turning insiders into frenzied buyers who think they can get a deal  I m particularly excited because three high yield stocks   doling out between 7  and 9    have high level managers using their own money to buy shares for their personal accounts 
Gaming and Leisure Properties  NASDAQ GLPI   Dividend Yield  7 4 
Gaming and Leisure Properties  GLPI  is a relatively young REIT  real estate investment trust   spun off of Penn National Gaming  NASDAQ PENN  in 2013  that owns properties leased out to gaming companies in  triple net  contracts 
However  while GLPI does share a little space near Vegas with the likes of MGM International  NYSE MGM  and Las Vegas Sands  NYSE LVS   this is a diversified   play that includes brands such as Hollywood Casino  Ameristar and Boomtown in places such as Louisiana  Ohio  Mississippi and Illinois 
In February  CEO Peter Carlino and CFO William Clifford combined to snap up 125 000 shares of GLPI for over  4 1 million  They bought shares between  30 and  33  What s interesting is that the pair bought following a slightly disappointing earnings report that saw revenues and net income both fall under GLPI s own guidance   and sent the stock lower as a result  That s a vote of confidence that they can achieve their 2018 guidance  which includes upticks in just about every metric  including the all important funds from operations 
Kite Realty Group Trust  NYSE KRG  Dividend Yield  7 9 
Kite Realty Group Trust  KRG  is a retail focused REIT that specializes in neighborhood and community shopping centers  with interests in 117 operating and redevelopment properties  It also has two more under construction 
You won t be surprised  then  to find out that KRG s weakness isn t wholly recent  Shares have been on the decline for the better part of two years  though the selling really has accelerated over the past three months   Kite Realty has shed nearly a quarter of its value over that time 
Four insiders have bought roughly 120 000 shares across the past couple weeks amid that weakness  What s puzzling is  there s not much recent news that would seem to inspire confidence  Bank of America  analyst Craig Schmidt downgraded KRG shares from  Buy  to  Neutral  amid a 2018 FFO forecast of  1 98 to  2 04 per share  the high end of which was shy of Schmidt s forecast by 4 cents 
Schmidt lowered his price target  but only to  18   well above current prices  implying the possibility that Kite has been oversold  Moreover  the fact that Kite raised its dividend despite its struggles could be management s way of telegraphing that the company can navigate its way back to safety 
Compass Diversified Holdings  NYSE CODI  Dividend Yield  8 8 
I last discussed Compass Diversified Holdings  CODI  about a year ago  and for those of you who aren t familiar  This is an interesting one 
Compass was actually listed in a group of  because it s so similar to one  it actually goes to pains in its frequently asked question section to deny it  Instead  CODI s business is buying controlling interests in companies  with an average target business of between  75 million and  500 million in enterprise value  with stable operating cash flows of at least  10 million a year 
At the moment  current holdings include Crosman  a maker of airguns  archery products and related accessories  Ergobaby  which designs baby wearing products  and hemp based foods maker Manitoba Harvest  Compass has been adding to its portfolio in 2018  too  buying Foam Fabricators  a maker of custom molded protective foam solutions  and announcing an add on acquisition of Rimports  a home fragrance specialist  and
A batch of Compass insiders appeared to be chasing relatively low prices in the stock near the beginning of last month  snapping up 29 200 shares for about half a million dollars  Current prices are about a buck a share lower than where they bought  on average  which could indicate an even better value given insiders  recent confidence

196333,417849,LVS,GM And Las Vegas Sands  This Week s Growth And Income Stocks ,opinion,"Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS   is headquartered in Las Vegas  and has properties in Macau  Pennsylvania  Singapore  and Vegas   It is a developer  and operator of world class resorts and hotels   They offer retail  gaming  entertainment  convention facilities  and fine dining  
Management has been focused on several key drivers for the company which include  a three year  1 1 billion capital plan  strengthening its VIP business  and property remodeling   The capital plan will rebrand and renovate its resort in Macau from the Sands Cotai Central to The Londoner Macao  This plan also includes the renovation and the addition of hundreds of new suites at the St  Regis and Four Seasons Macau   The goal is to increase the company s share of high spending Chinese tourists at Asia s leading leisure tourism and business destination  
Management has also improved its position in the VIP area as volumes and margins continue to rise across the world  with better than expected traction in both Macau and Singapore   The remodeling plan has already begun to attract more customers who are flocking to the luxury accommodations  and expanded retail shopping within its malls    The addition of the new suites and retail offerings has already positively impacted the top line as both occupancy rates  and retail mall revenues have increased  
On the income side  last quarter management increased its quarterly dividend payment by 3  for an annual dividend yield of 4 16    Further  due to the continued growth in both Macau and Singapore  expectations are that the company will approve another dividend hike after it reports earnings on January 24th   Further  LVS has a share repurchase program that has consistently purchased about  75 million of common stock each quarter as part of its  2 billion program started in 2013 
Las Vegas Sands is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and has beaten both the top and bottom line expectations for the past three consecutive quarters   Also  over the last four quarters the company has posted an average positive surprise of  9 1    These better than expected performances  management s long term plans  and an improving economy has caused analyst s earnings estimates to improve of the past 90 days as the next two quarters and FY 17   FY 18 have all seen positive revisions  
General Motors   NYSE GM   recently announced full year 2017 and December sales numbers  and they were much better than expected   The company reported that they delivered just over 3 million vehicles in the United States in 2017 with record sales in both the truck and crossover categories  1 3 million and 965 090 respectively   GM also set delivery and sales records for electric vehicles  and average transaction prices   Further  management was able to reduce year end inventories to 63 days  well below the expected 70 day supply  
In Canada  total vehicle sales improved by  9 2  in December YoY   GM Canada sold 302 826 total vehicles in 2017  a  13 3  increase YoY  
In the crossover segment  GM s deliveries were up 17  YoY  and grew its retail share by 1 6  to 13 1  growing more than any other automaker   In the pickup truck segment  GM sold more vehicles in the U S  than any other automaker for the fourth consecutive year with a record 948 909 units sold   In the full sized SUV segment  GM sold 239 719 units  and maintained its grip as the segment leader since 1935   In the Commercial and Government segment  GM sold 296 000 units  the highest total since 2008   The sales enabled GM to capture more of the market share than any other competitor  
Also  GM saw its average transaction prices increase to  35 400 for the year and  38 000 in December which were both record highs   The industry average is  31 600  
Management s focus to move away from passenger cars and concentrate on SUV s and pickups has helped it capture a bigger portion of the market share  and reduce costs   Going into 2018  management expects to sell just below 17 million new vehicles  about a half a million shy of the record 17 55 million units in 2016   Further  the company believes that increasing interest rates will only be a minor headwind with the tax cuts being a net positive for the industry  
GM is also looking to the future  as they recently announced that they will launch a  new family  of electric vehicles in 2021   Management is looking to launch 20 new vehicles by 2023   These electric vehicles are expected to cost less to build  and have higher profit margins than their predecessors   The goal is to sell 1 million electric vehicles by 2026   This push into electric vehicles will help them capture more of the Chinese market as its government has recently imposed new emission rules set to begin in 2019 
GM also has a very nice  3 64  annual dividend  and has consistently repurchased millions of shares over the past three years  2015 102 million  2016 77 million  2017 85 million for a total of 265 million shares at a cost of just over  9 billion

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 55 cents on  2 73 billion in revenue  slightly below Wall Street on both the top and bottom line
Macau continues to be a thorn in the side of casino operators including Las Vegas Sands
Improvements in non gaming segments and a focus on Las Vegas markets are expected to boost margins and foot traffic
Las Vegas Sands is scheduled to report second quarter earnings Monday after the market opens  The casino and resorting group has struggled jumpstarting revenue growth the past 2 years  In each of the past 7 quarters revenue has missed expectations due to sluggish performance in Macau  Macau is the Las Vegas of China and contributes a large portion of revenue to the casino industry  Unfortunately the turmoil hasn t subsided and Las Vegas Sands appears to be on course for another poor quarter 

The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of 55 cents on  2 73 billion in revenue  slightly below Wall Street on both the top and bottom line  Compare to the year earlier earnings are projected to decline by 8  with sales down by 6   The stock is up almost 25  in the past 6 months but investors shouldn t expect to see a boost afters it reports  Typically shares have stayed flat through and the month following earnings 
Like its peers  Las Vegas Sands has had trouble stabilizing operations in key markets  mainly Macau  Macau is one of the largest casino destinations in the world which has struggled lately from new gaming regulations and a general slowdown in China Unfortunately there doesn t seem to be any major improvements in the Macau region for the quarter to be reported  Nonetheless improving non gaming segments and a focus on Las Vegas attractions should lead to greater traffic and boost margins

First is Pier 1  NYSE PIR   that purveyor of throw pillows  scented candles  and coconut monkey dolls 

As mentioned before there is  of course  Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM   whose overpriced food is appealing during opulent times but  as grocery shoppers begin to clip coupons  not so much

US futures are trading 0 1  lower ahead of the market open  

Economic reports due out  all times are eastern   ICSC Goldman Store Sales  7 45   Redbook  8 55 
Technical Outlook  SPX  

Excellent follow through on Friday s bounce  
Challenged  broke and closed above the pivotal 1883 price level  
I expect a push into the 1890 s and another attempt to close above 1900 to be forthcoming  
At all costs  bulls have to make sure that no sell off results in a close below 1862  
There is a short term rising trend line off of the 4 28 lows  This needs to hold as well at 1871  
Volume was non existent    but frankly that seems to always be the case on up days  
VIX remains at 12 42  
Bears have shown that despite having favorable market conditions time and time again  that they simply cannot push this market lower over a long period of time  
Major milestones like 1900 can often lead to profit taking as it represents a predefined psychological level where investors decide to book their gains  
Small caps continue to be the market s weak spot  
The market doesn t care about the economy nor earnings  That is not what is driving it  The market only cares about what the Fed is doing to keep equities propped up

196451,417967,LVS,Fear Creates Early Dividends And Requires A List Of Winners,opinion,The two houses of Congress and the President of the United States have amongst them sort of solved a crisis that was itself the artificial creation of   the two houses of Congress and the President  They have negotiated a way off of the  fiscal cliff   while an onrushing debt ceiling crisis now absorbs their attention instead  and while wise guys kick around the idea of a platinum coin as magical solution There will be plenty of time yet to discuss the consequences for asset managers  traditional and alternative  of that settlement  What we might do first is take note of who the long build up  the long period of fraught hand wringing negotiation  most enriched Threat to Dividend IncomeDuring that period of negotiation  corporations in the U S   and their investors  had to concern themselves with the possibility of a sharp increase in the extent to which their dividend income would be subject to taxation once the ball fell on the New Year 2013  The President s plan in particular would have nearly tripled the tax rate for dividend income for families making more than  250 000 a year  from 15 percent to 43 4 percent Predictably  then  several companies  Las Vegas Sands  Oracle  Whole Foods among them  rushed dividend payments  getting them out to investors while Old Man 2012 and the lower tax rate still reigned Now  as it happens  the bill that passed the Senate on December 31 and the House on January 1 only included a quite modest increase in the taxation of dividends  For single filers with taxable incomes above  400 000  or couples with income over  450 000  dividend taxation increases from 15 percent to 20 percent But Wealth X  a Singapore headquartered firm that provides its members  global private banks  luxury brands  and so forth  with intelligence on ultra high net worth individuals  has prepared a list of the top 10 recipients of the special dividends that this near collision with a 43 4 percent rate produced The Top ThreeSheldon Adelson easily tops the list  receiving  1 2 billion  You ll remember that Adelson attracted a good deal of attention during the recent US presidential campaign season as a free spending supporter of the aspirations of former Speaker Newt Gingrich  However much he may have expended in that losing cause  this windfall may have left Adelson  chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corp   somewhat consoled The second name on the list is Thomas Frist III  There is  though  a big gap between spots  1 and  2   Frist received less than half of what Adelson did  Still  that leaves him with a special dividend take of  497 million Frist  one of the founders of Hospital Corporation of America  also has connections in politics  He is the brother of William   Bill   Frist  also a member of the HCA board  Bill Frist  a former U S  Senator  served as the Majority Leader in that body from 2003 to 2007 Third on the list of beneficiaries of the rush to pass out dividends before a feared increase in taxes is Lawrence Ellison  one of the founders of enterprise software giant Oracle  Oracle paid dividends for the second  third  and fourth quarters of 2013 on December 21  2012  record date  December 14  and Ellison owns more than a billion shares of that company s stock ,2013-01-16,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fear-creates-early-dividends-and-requires-a-list-of-winners-151060,151060
196452,417968,LVS,Play To Win With Casino Stocks,opinion,Stock Analysts like to pick winners for their clients  In the context of the downturn where many stocks are doing badly  it becomes important for the investor community to be apprised of emerging winners and those with a potential to return steady earnings  This is especially true of those stocks that are considered penny stocks but have the future prospects for growth  Since many Americans consider Las Vegas a pilgrimage site that is akin to a pot of gold  it makes sense to evaluate the Casino Stocks that are currently trading at a discount but have the potential for good returns  Among the prominent casino stocks are Caesars  Las Vegas Sands  MGM  and WMS  These stocks represent the premium casinos in Vegas and in other gambling hotspots  Indeed  if the recent trends are anything to go by  it is a good time to invest in these stocks Compared to the mainstream stocks of blue chip companies  these stocks might look like risky and unstable  However  do not be fooled by the valuations alone as they are trading at a good discount to the premium  Consider for instance  Caesars  it is trading at 94 cents below its IPO price of  9 a share  If its cash flow projections were anything to go by  it would certainly trade at a premium over its IPO price  In addition  with the recession not having a noticeable impact on casinos  one can be assured that the roulette is spinning to gain  Next  MGM is another undervalued stock that promises a better show this year  It was up 17 cents this week and with a price of  13  it looks like it is a good investment With the Federal Government opening more reservations  the places where casinos are not outlawed   it is a fair guess to say that the Casinos would have the potential for business in the coming years  The fact that these casinos are not confined to Vegas or Atlantic City alone should make the investors research these stocks in a detailed manner  All things being equal  the chances of Casinos like the ones cited here going out of business seems remote  Hence  it is worth the wait for these stocks as a longer term investment  Moreover  with the psychological boost that the recent rally on the Dow  that has now crossed 14000  a level not seen since October 2007   these casino stocks are sure to be carried forward in the momentum and it is the case that they would be bumped up as well Finally  if you have moral qualms about investing in Casino stocks  remember that these stocks represent companies that are totally legit and legal and that they follow all the legal requirements that need to be complied with  There is no reason to suspect that these companies are anything less respected than mainstream stocks  Start investing in these stocks and you would be playing to win on the table with all hands ready to get you hooked ,2013-02-04,Marcus Holland,https://www.investing.com/analysis/play-to-win-with-casino-stocks-153667,153667
196460,417976,LVS,This Stock Is Up 4 000  From Its Lows    And It s Not Finished Yet,opinion,I m a big fan of Las Vegas  I try to visit at least once a year to try my luck at the tables  I leave the club hopping to the socialites    I m also an advocate of gaming stocks  In fact  I spent over a year writing a regular monthly feature for Casino Player Magazine called the  The Gaming Investor   That column enabled me to follow every bend and twist in this fascinating industry  This was back in 2007  when casino resort owners  slot vendors  and racetrack operators were filled with promise  Unfortunately  the gaming sector was obliterated by the recession of 2008 and 2009  After years of stellar earnings and scorching stock gains  investors fled when consumer spending went cold and business conventions stayed closer to home     Las Vegas is a poster child for the excesses of the real estate bubble  Land that was bid up to astronomical levels now sits vacant  strewn with half finished projects that were abandoned when funding dried up  Overcapacity from the construction boom has made life difficult  even for experienced operators    Just look at Las Vegas Sands  NYSE  LVS   which owns the glitzy Venetian and Palazzo mega resorts and is also the world s largest casino operator by market volume  The shares ran up to the exorbitant price of  148 in October 2007 amid unbridled optimism  But they plummeted 99  over the next 18 months  By March 2009  you could pick up shares for about the price of a cup of coffee     1 38 per share  Clearly  the market overcorrected to the downside  The stock has since clawed its way back to  57  Bargain hunters who invested just  1 380 to scoop up 1 000 shares at the bottom are now sitting on a cool  57 000   One of the quickest ways to gauge the health of a resort is revenues per available room  a metric that reflects both occupancy and pricing  If the resort is full  and not marked down just to fill beds   then demand is healthy   Keep in mind  those hotel visitors don t just sit in their rooms  They will book show tickets  reserve time at the spa  have a few meals and spend some time rolling the dice   Looking at the latest numbers from the quarter ended Dec  30  2011  Las Vegas Sands  Venetian and Palazzo properties reported revenue that increased 9 3  percent to  339 5 million  compared with  310 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010  In its earnings report  the company cited a bump up in meeting and convention business and a 13  increase in revenue per available room  which hit  174  That s down from  244 at the end of 2007 before the bottom fell out of the market  but it s a substantial improvement from  149 at the beginning of 2011   But forget Vegas  THIS is where the growth is   That s all nice and everything  but the real reason I like this stock has nothing to do with the Las Vegas properties  In fact  Sin City only accounts for about 10  of the company s profits  Most of it comes from Macau  a vibrant gaming enclave and tourist destination a few miles from Hong Kong in the South China Sea   For years  Macau was referred to as the Las Vegas of China  But that s not even a fair comparison any more    Macau s gaming revenue overtook Las Vegas in 2006  Macau is the only venue in town  gaming on the mainland is restricted   So the region draws heavily from a population of 1 3 billion people that live within a short three hour flight  Las Vegas Sands  Venetian Macao resort has been a hit with both high rollers and everyday players since it opened  Even in the first three months of 2009  when Macau s total visitor count dropped almost 10   the Venetian Macau saw a 14  increase  6 million visitors   This glamorous resort  which anchors the famed Cotai Strip  almost prints cash  Las Vegas Sands has two other properties nearby  the premium Four Seasons Resort and the Sands Macau  the first American resort to crack this market   The newest addition  slated to open in April  is the Sands Cotai Central    a 5 800 room resort with every amenity imaginable to coax Macau s day trippers into spending more time But wait  there s more   Remarkably  though  Las Vegas Sands  flagship property isn t located in China or the United States  It s the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore  where the company holds one of just two coveted casino licenses  This resort pumped out a colossal  426 million in EBITDA last quarter  with an unheard of margin of 52 9   many resorts would be happy with 30     All in all  the company posted fourth quarter 2011 revenue of  2 5 billion  the highest in its history  I d say the tables have turned for the better in the gaming world  particularly for Las Vegas Sands  Risks to Consider  Las Vegas Sands depends heavily on Chinese visitors to Macau  and an economic downturn could lead to quieter tables and slots  An ongoing federal corruption probe could also be a distraction  There are allegations that senior company officials greased a few palms to expedite condo sales  But the company flatly denies any wrongdoing  And in any case  the probe isn t really as serious as it sounds  According to Morningstar  similar infractions have typically resulted in nothing more than slap on the wrist fines  Las Vegas Sands has a strong foothold in three of the world s top gaming markets  Best in class property margins indicate the company is generating more cash from its resorts than rivals by Nathan

196461,417977,LVS,Las Vegas Sands Sideways With A Kicker Coming,opinion,There is a possibility that this note will not use the word  bearish  to describe what is being analyzed and that will be a first in quite some time should it turn out to be true  It is a delicate situation  however  as shown by the monthly chart in the fact that Las Vegas Sands  LVS  remains above the trendline to mark its more than three year uptrend  but just barely so  Should LVS drop below  52 48  it will have begun to reverse that trend and particularly if the potential breach is made on a closing basis   There is not a strong reason to be concerned about this potential reversal in looking at the six month chart below with a 50 DMA above the 200 DMA and LVS above its LTRO Rally trendline and the very trendline shown above with the possibility existing for a Bull Pennant pulling LVS up to that pattern s target of  62 on confirmation of about  60 40   It is not a particularly strong Bull Pennant  though  and there could even be a Head and Shoulders type pattern in there with a target of  50 38 on confirmation of  56 19 marked just by its neckline and so the recent sideways trading to top a decent uptrend seems not to deserve a strong commitment in either direction  Below  56 19  though  and the downside target of that H S plus a potential drop to  40 will be worth thinking about while a possible close above  62 will shift the attention to a continuation of the three year uptrend in LVS  Right now  then  LVS seems mainly sideways with a kicker coming and a trend worth respecting in itself considering there are few good clues as to whether it breaks up or down when it does shift and possibly soon ,2012-04-22,Abigail Doolittle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/las-vegas-sands-sideways-with-a-kicker-coming-120946,120946
