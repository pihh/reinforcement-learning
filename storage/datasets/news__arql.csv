4191,225706,ARQL,5 Charts To Watch  ARQL  HROW  PYX  WKHS  XNCR,opinion,"It was another really bad day on Wall Street on Tuesday  but the technicals weren t as bad as the price looked  I don t know what that means yet  but we ll see  A lot of the stocks we follow may  or are  swinging  In the meantime  let s take a look at a few we highlighted here along with the charts 
ArQule  Inc   ARQL 
ARQL is in a beautiful uptrend  It had the breakaway move a week and a half ago  and now it s in a beautiful rising channel or flag  On Tuesday  it was up 81 cents or 8   to 10 82  on nearly 13 million shares  That s a significant increase in volume  If it could get through resistance  it could blow  It s at the highest level in 17 years  The next target has to be up around 11 1 2  and 13  Keep your eye on this one going forward 
Harrow Health  Inc   HROW 
HROW has been up for nine days in a row  On Tuesday  it popped 35 cents  or 4 62   to 7 92  on 652 442 shares traded  The volume is excellent and it did break out  I m still looking for more upside to 9 9 1 2 10 before it pulls back  At least that appears to be what is happening 
Pyxus International  Inc   PYX 
PYX has a new swing I put on it on Tuesday  It had a nice pop of 3 61  or 27   to 17 04  on 3 4 million shares  That s huge volume for a stock that averages 638 681  I m looking for a test around 20 1 2 21  If it gets through that  I m looking at targets at 23 1 2  and then 26 
Workhorse Group Inc   WKHS 
WKHS is looking well  It had a large ascending wedge after an explosive move in May and has a flag that really looks juicy  It popped out of the wedge to gain 21 cents  or 8   to 2 85  on 3 7 million shares  I think this stock is going to make a run at 3 3 3 4  If it gets through that  3 3 3 4  and then 5  are our targets 
Xencor  Inc   XNCR 
XNCR has spent about nine months consolidating in a declining channel  It popped out and retested  forming a base  and then had a breakaway gap on Tuesday of 4 69  or 14   to 38 56  on 1 9 million shares  That is massive volume for this stock  It tells me it needs to break out and run  The next target is 43  and then  ultimately  a retest of the high at 48 is my target

4209,225724,ARQL,Forget Valeant  Invest In These Attractive Drug Stocks Instead,opinion,"Once an acquisition giant  Canada based Valeant Pharmaceuticals   NYSE VRX   has been in the spotlight since the second half of 2015 for all the wrong reasons like a price hike of specialty drugs  erroneous financial reporting  and termination of contracts with Philidor Rx Services  The going got worse in the first half of 2016 leading to a massive decline in its share prices 
Further  Valeant delayed its first quarter earnings release due to the review of certain accounting practices  which led to a notice of default from its debtors  As if the delayed results and the ensuing notice were not enough  the company slashed its annual guidance when it announced its first quarter results earlier this month  dampening investor sentiments even more  In addition  management transition issues  heavy debt levels and persistent organizational distractions continue to plague the company VALEANT PHARMA Price and Consensus
   Even though the new CEO  Joseph Papa has set out to rebuild the company in the wake of the catastrophe  regaining investor trust is going to be a Herculean task  In this scenario  it s probably best to forget Valeant and instead invest in some other drug stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank  They also have healthy pipelines products and strong growth potential

Five9  Inc   NASDAQ FIVN   one of my Top 25  broke out of its base with a breakaway gap  it formed a wedge  and has been wedging  On Monday  it popped 1 22  or 4   to 31 57  on nearly 300 000 shares traded  I think this stock is designed to get into the mid 30 s  and then maybe 40 
Vipshop Holdings Limited  NYSE VIPS  ripped right back on Monday  bouncing 1 00  or 5 88   to 18 00  on nearly 9 million shares  There s big resistance here  so watch that level going forward around 19  If it gets through that  it should see 22

4231,225746,ARQL,ArQule  A Strong Speculation Bio Pharma Poised,opinion,ArQule  ARQL  engages in the research and development of cancer therapeutics directed toward molecular targets and biological processes  Its lead product candidate Tivantinib  ARQ 197  is an inhibitor of the c Met receptor tyrosine kinase  which is in Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of liver cancer and colorectal cancer  CRC   The company also develops ARQ 621  an inhibitor of the Eg5 kinesin motor protein that has completed Phase I trial  ARQ 736  an inhibitor of the RAF kinases  which is in Phase I clinical trial  ARQ 761  an activator of the E2F 1 damage response checkpoint pathway  and ARQ 087  an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor that is in pre clinical stage  It has partnership agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Co   Ltd  and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co   Ltd  The lead product candidate is Tivantinib  ARQ 197   an orally administered  small molecule inhibitor of the c Met receptor tyrosine kinase  C Met is a promising target for cancer therapy based on its multiple roles in cancerous cell proliferation  tumor spread  new blood vessel formation and resistance to certain drug therapies  Arqule and its partners  Daiichi Sankyo Co   Ltd  and Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co   Ltd  are implementing a clinical development program designed to realize the broad potential of Tivantinib as a well tolerated single agent and in combination with other anti cancer therapies in a number of disease indications The company s strategy is to focus on the most promising indications within the clinical programs based upon data that is continually generated  Its leading indications include liver cancer  non small cell lung cancer  and colorectal cancer  The company is also completing earlier stage combination therapy trials with Tivantinib and other anti cancer agents that may provide data to support later stage trials in additional indications  On October 16  2012  the company announced a Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the U S  Food and Drug Administration for the design of a pivotal Phase III trial of Tivantinib in patients with HCC  The Phase III trial will be a randomized  double blinded study of Tivantinib as single agent therapy in previously treated patients with MET diagnostic high inoperable HCC  The primary endpoint is overall survival in the intent to treat population  and the secondary endpoint is progression free survival in the same population  Approximately 300 patients are planned to be enrolled at approximately 120 centers worldwide  ArQule has advanced into Phase III clinical with ARQ 197  C Met is a promising target for cancer therapy  as evidence suggests that it plays multiple roles in cancerous cell proliferation  tumor spread  new blood vessel formation and drug resistance  The company believes that the inappropriate expression of c Met in many cancers and its involvement in multiple signal transduction pathways affecting tumor growth and metastasis render it a compelling target for cancer therapy  Oncology research and development activities are increasingly focused on kinases  which play pivotal roles in modulating diverse cellular activities and have been implicated as important mediators of certain forms of cancer and other diseases  The success of kinase inhibitors such as Gleevec and Nexavar has focused attention on the kinase field  resulting in the increased development of next generation inhibitors that target cancers and other diseases such as inflammation  The current market for protein kinase inhibitors is estimated to exceed  7 billion  and by 2020  small molecule kinase inhibitors are projected to generate collectively annual revenues greater than  25 billion    ArQule has extensively studied the mechanism by which ARQ 197 selectively inhibits its target c Met receptor kinase  These studies have revealed the molecular and structural basis by which ARQ 197 targets c Met  ARQ 197 inhibits c Met autophosphorylation and is selective for the inactive or unphosphorylated form of c Met  Elucidation of this novel mode of inhibition of c Met has opened up the opportunity for the design and development of similar selective inhibitors for other kinases  Drug discovery at ArQule utilizes a proven innovative and efficient drug discovery engine which employs a proprietary structure based drug design technology known as the ArQule Kinase Inhibitor Platform AKIP    This platform targets inactive forms of kinases that have pivotal roles in cancer and other diseases  AKIP integrates in silico drug design  parallel robotic chemistry  and novel assay development expertise to create non ATP competitive inhibitors that interact with these kinases in novel binding modes  Inhibitors identified through AKIP are optimized into drug candidates having the appropriate efficacy and selectivity for their target with minimal side effects   The company believes it has within this platform the capability to rationally design novel kinase inhibitors that encompass new chemical spaces and allow for an expanding intellectual property estate  It anticipates that these novel kinase inhibitors  when targeted against selected therapeutically relevant kinases  will have utility in a broad range of human diseases in addition to cancer  The company is seeking to expand the applications of this proprietary drug discovery platform through collaborative research programs as well as through our own internal discovery and development activities in multiple therapeutic areas   ArQule has a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo Co   Ltd  to apply its AKIP technology in the discovery of therapeutic compounds that selectively inhibit certain kinases in the field of oncology  It is also independently applying AKIP to the discovery of inhibitors of fibroblast growth factor receptor  FGFR   Progress to date has resulted in a series of small molecule inhibitors of FGFR that are not ATP competitive and show potent anti tumor activity in FGFR driven human and animal cancer models  Daiichi Sankyo  DS  is ArQule s co development worldwide partner for ARQ 197   except Asia  and paid ArQule  60 Mil upfront  with another  560M due for potential milestones and tiered double digit royalties  The most recent milestone was a  25M payment for the initiation of the MARQUEE Phase III trial  DS retains all ex Asia commercial rights  with ArQule retaining the US co commercialization rights  There has been some speculation that DS is considering acquiring ArQule  but I have yet to hear from a real source on this front regarding this  Right off the bat  it seems to me that ArQule is very undervalued speculation wise  with its current market cap of  178 30M  Right off the bat  it

AKT Inhibitor   a deep pipeline along with the near term catalyst event of top line Phase II data  makes the company s  178 30M market cap undervalued for a mid stage Oncology biotech in my opinion  and also makes for a good catalyst trade opportunity   Institutions have increased their stake by over 10  in the company lately  which is always a good sign  The above chart was taken from Robert Pedone s  published a couple of weeks ago  I spoke to Robert yesterday to get his updated take on the charts  and we both agree that if the stock breaks past  3 on decent volume  we could see an upwards gap fill to  4 rather quickly  With the data release expected any day now  I feel ArQule is a good long side trade for the short term  and with good data  possibly a longer term buy and hold  The Biopharma segment of the market is rather hot these days with companies like Sarepta  SRPT  and Acadia  ACAD  recently seeing large price gaps up on positive data releases  My short term price target opinion is  4 a share  and a 1 year target over  10 if the company s platform proves successful in 2013 ,2012-12-18,Scott

4234,225749,ARQL,ArQule Inc   276m Or  4 48 Per Diluted Share ,opinion,"Value of c Met inhibitor in NSCLC questioned
Detailed data presented at ASCO 2014 on c Met inhibitors  including Roche s onartuzumab and ArQule Inc s  NASDAQ ARQL  tivantinib  failed to show much clinical benefit when a c Met inhibitor is added to other therapies in NSCLC  and posed the question of whether inhibiting c Met in this disease setting is clinically meaningful  This  however  should not have reduced tivantinib s value in HCC  in which two Phase III trials  METIV HCC and JET HCC  are progressing in second line HCC  ArQule ended Q114 with cash and marketable securities of  85 8m  enough to support its operation beyond 2015 

Met inhibition in NSCLC failed to show efficacy
Detailed data of the Phase III METLung trial  stopped prematurely in March 2014 after it failed a pre planned interim futility analysis  showed that the combination of onartuzumab  an anti Met mAb  and Tarceva  Roche  did not have any clinical benefit  OS  PFS and ORR  over placebo and Tarceva in NSCLC patients with high c Met expression status  This was in contrast to OS and PFS benefits seen in the same patient population in a previous Phase II trial  Similarly  the combination of tivantinib and Tarceva  t T  failed to show any clinical benefit over placebo and Tarceva in previously treated  squamous NSCLC with EGFR wild type  c Met high patients  The t T combination did cause higher incidences of interstitial lung disease  ILD   which caused the ATTENTION trial to be stopped prematurely in August 2012  The lack of clinical benefit of a c Met inhibitor when added to an EGFR inhibitor  Tarceva is an EGFR inhibitor  in patients with high c Met expression  patients were specifically selected based on their high c Met status in both trials  has casted doubts on c Met as a valid drug target in NSCLC 
No crossover read to tivantinib in HCC
We continue to caution a crossover read of the NSCLC results into that of HCC  and  more specifically  the probability of success of tivantinib in the ongoing Phase III METIV HCC  The trial was based on a positive Phase II trial in which a statistically significant OS benefit was demonstrated  and tivantinib was compared to a placebo  a lower hurdle than Tarceva  in the two aforementioned trials

4235,225750,ARQL,Keryx  KERX  Q1 Loss In Line  Auryxia Up On Strong Demand  Revised ,opinion,"Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Inc  s   NASDAQ KERX   first quarter 2016 loss of 22 cents per share  excluding  15 7 million in non cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount on its convertible senior notes and a  2 0 million non cash charge related to the increase in fair value of derivative liability that was recorded in connection with the issuance of convertible senior notes  was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but wider than year ago loss of 28 cents 
On a reported basis  the company posted a loss of 39 cents per share 

The company generated revenues of  6 8 million in the quarter  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Reported revenues were up from the prior year figure of  1 2 million 
The Quarter in Details
Net sales of Auryxia in the U S  were about  5 6 million  up from  4 8 million in the previous quarter  The drug s prescriptions were approximately 9 150  up 17  sequentially  driven in part by continued gains from new prescribers and an increase in the number of prescriptions per prescriber  The company gained EU approval for Auryxia  under the trade name Fexeric  in Sep 2015  It is now looking for pan European or regional partners for the commercialization of the drug in the region 
The company recorded license revenues of  1 2 million 
Meanwhile  ferric citrate  the compound name for Auryxia in additional indications  is being evaluated in a phase III study for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia  IDA  in patients suffering from stage III V non dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease  NDD CKD   The company reported positive data from the trial that demonstrated statistically significant differences from placebo in the primary as well as all the pre specified secondary endpoints 
These results should support Keryx s plans to submit a supplemental new drug application  sNDA  in the third quarter of 2016  through which it intends to expand the ferric citrate s label to include the treatment of IDA in patients with stage III V NDD CKD 
Research and development expenses declined 20 6  year over year to  7 6 million  primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with the company s recently completed phase III trial evaluating ferric citrate for the treatment of IDA stage III V NDD CKD in adults 
Selling  general and administrative expenses were  20 8 million  up 10 2   primarily related to incremental costs associated with the hiring and onboarding of Keryx s expanded field team 
2016 Guidance Reiterated
Keryx continues to expect Auryxia sales in the U S in the range of  31  34 million  It projects sales to ramp up throughout the year  as the company realizes the full impact of its expanded sales force  Notably  Keryx completed its sales force expansion in 2015  whereby the company now has some 95 sales representatives pitching in for the drug  The company expects cash operating expenses in the range of  87 million to  92 million 
Our Take
Keryx reported in line results for the first quarter  The sequential improvement in Auryxia revenues was encouraging  Going forward  growth should be driven by the sales force expansion in 2015  which will increase the company s reach and frequency of contact with physicians  dieticians and the entire dialysis care team  Meanwhile  a potential approval of the compound for IDA in patients suffering from stage III V NDD CKD will further boost sales  The company is gearing up for a potential launch in 2017 for this indication

4237,225752,ARQL,Catalyst  CPRX  Posts In Line Q1 Loss  Firdapse In Focus,opinion,"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ CPRX   reported a loss of 7 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016  which was wider than the year ago loss of 6 cents but in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate 

Being a development stage company  Catalyst Pharma does not have any approved product in its portfolio yet 
Quarter in Detail
Research and development  R D  expenses were  3 5 million  up 50 9  from the year ago quarter primarily due to activities related to an expanded access program for Firdapse  including manufacturing of the drug  and increased activities associated with other ongoing studies and trials 
General and administrative expenses were up 38 5  to  2 7 million  Expenses rose primarily due to higher pre commercialization expenses  and an increase in headcount  payroll and benefit expenses 
Pipeline Update
In a major setback  the company received a  refusal to file  letter from the FDA in Feb 2015 in connection with its new drug application  NDA   for its lead candidate  Firdapse  The FDA had determined that the application was not sufficiently complete after a preliminary review 
Catalyst recently announced that it held a meeting with the agency to get better clarity on the agency s requirements  The FDA informed the company that it needs positive results from an additional adequate and well controlled study in patients with Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome  LEMS   in addition to previously submitted results from the phase III LMS 002 trial 
The company is currently in discussions with the FDA regarding the protocol and logistics for this confirmatory study  The agency is also ready to discuss a design that could efficiently accomplish the requirement with a small  short term study  It has also requisitioned several additional short term toxicology studies  which are expected to be initiated soon 
Meanwhile  the company is evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of certain types of congenital myasthenic syndromes  CMS  and a specific form of myasthenia gravis  The company has initiated an investigator sponsored study of the candidate for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis  MuSK MG  in Feb 2016 and top line results from this study are expected in 2017 
The company had earlier planned to conduct a phase I dose ranging study in 2016 on its other candidate  CPP 115  at lower doses  subject to the availability of funding  and a phase II trial on the candidate which is being evaluated for the treatment of epilepsy and other selected neurological indications  such as complex partial seizures and Tourette s disorder 
Our Take
Catalyst Pharma s first quarter results were on par with estimates  Going ahead  we expect investor focus on updates regarding the additional study on Firdapse as requisitioned by the FDA  As the company is required to conduct additional studies per the FDA s requirement  this will not only mean additional costs but further delay the NDA resubmission 
On the other hand  R D spend for 2016 would increase due to continued clinical development efforts for Firdapse  including the recently initiated clinical trial for CMS in a pediatric population and a clinical program for MuSK MG among others 
Currently  Catalyst Pharma carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the health care sector include ArQule  Inc    NASDAQ ARQL    Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG   and Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT    All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2016-05-11,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/catalyst-(cprx)-posts-in-line-q1-loss,-firdapse-in-focus-200129431",200129431

4286,225801,ARQL,6 Stocks To Watch  ARQL  AXSM  CATS  RIOT  RLGT  TIGR,opinion,"Markets had a consolidation type session  first up at the opening  sharply lower  then sharply rallying back up  only to pull back a little at the end of the day  It was a decent session for a lot of stocks  We have highlighted quite a few that look like they may be on the verge of breaking out and moving to the next level 
ArQule  Inc   ARQL 
ARQL which had a V bottom in December like many biotechs  and the market in general  popped to resistance and backed off to form a left head right shoulder  formed a big breakaway gap on big volume with a breakout  followed by a month long wedge  and then popped out of the wedge  On Monday  it had a bullish engulfing day  advancing 34 cents  or 6 12   to 5 90  on 1 7 million shares  or 70  more volume than average  If this should get above 6 00  which may happen quickly  targets are 7 1 4  8 1 2  and 9  I think it looks good 
Axsome Therapeutics  Inc   AXSM 
AXSM jumped 85 cents  or 6 32   to 14 31  on 1 8 million shares  I think the wedge is about to come to fruition and breakout  The targets are 16 and 21 going forward 
Catasys  Inc   CATS 
CATS one of our swing trades  climbed 76 cents  or 6 08   to 13 25  on 113 964 shares traded  This stock has been backing and filling in a wedge  I think it s ready to go  It s needs to get above 14 1 2 3 4 to really get going  If it does  targets going forward are 18 and 24 
Riot Blockchain  Inc   RIOT 
RIOT a cryptocurrency company  popped and formed a wedge  gaining 10 cents  or 2 17   to 4 71  on 1 8 million shares on Monday  I m inclined to think that if this breaks out of the wedge  it s just too bullish of a formation  Good volume pattern  good technicals  and good rising OBV  I think the pop and the wedge will lead to about the 6 1 4 1 2 area  maybe 3 4  Then it will go to 8 3 4 9  Those are my targets 
Radiant Logistics  Inc   RLGT 
RLGT a shipping logistics firm  broke out and ran up 38 cents  or 5 74   to 7 00  on 1 7 million shares  It has an amazing base  and now it s coming to a level that I haven t seen it do for four years  It might ramp toward a 7 3 4 8 range  It soared a 52 week high at 7 09 just three days ago and it was right back up there again  Keep an eye on it 
UP Fintech Holding Limited  TIGR 
TIGR since its IPO  has been phenomenal  only pausing for four days because of a falling wedge  It popped out of the wedge and took off  On Monday  it was up another 1 60  9 09   to 19 21  on 2 7 million shares  The target on this one is 22 23 short term

ASYS has a beautiful base breakout and pullback  This ongoing swing that looks like it broke out of a wedge on Tuesday  gained 20 cents  or 3   to 6 97  on 119 702 shares traded  It should go to 7 1 2  and then 8 3 4  my next two targets

4291,225806,ARQL,Wall Street drops as tariff deadline looms,news,"By Shreyashi Sanyal
 Reuters    Wall Street s main indexes fell in afternoon trading on Monday  with investors keeping a close watch on U S  China trade relations as planned tariffs on Chinese imports kick in on Dec  15 
Beijing and Washington are negotiating a first phase trade deal aimed at de escalating tariff disputes but they continue to wrangle over key details 
Analysts said markets are still hoping for a delay in the deadline  while expecting more positive gestures from both sides  but a lack of fresh update on trade talks sapped risk appetite 
 There is optimism about the potential of a roll back or some positive news on trade that is keeping stocks where they are   said Randy Frederick  vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  in Austin  Texas 
 But as always it ultimately depends on what we get from President Donald Trump or China on what might be going on with the trade deal  
The latest data from China showed exports in November shrank for the fourth consecutive month  underscoring persistent pressures on manufacturers from trade tensions 
The S P 500 came within striking distance of a record high hit two weeks ago  The three indexes are now less than 1  away from their all time highs 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  was down 75 84 points  or 0 27   at 27 939 22  the S P 500  SPX  was down 4 02 points  or 0 13   at 3 141 89 
The Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  was down 12 54 points  or 0 14   at 8 643 99 
CMC Markets analyst David Madden said   The common theme today is low volatility and small trading ranges but the uncertainty surrounding trade is hanging over equities  
Also in focus is the Federal Open Market Committee s two day policy meeting  which starts on Tuesday 
3M Co  N MMM  fell 0 7  after  Citigroup   NYSE C  cut its rating on the industrial conglomerate s shares 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  suppliers  Qorvo Inc   O QRVO  and  Skyworks Solutions Inc   O SWKS  rose about 2  each  after Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  upgraded shares of both companies
