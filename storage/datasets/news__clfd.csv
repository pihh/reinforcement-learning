3010,224525,CLFD,Zacks com Featured Expert Kevin Matras Highlights  First  Clearfield  BioDelivery Sciences International  MGIC Investment And Kratos Defense   Security Solutions,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   February 28  2019  Stocks in this week s article include First BanCorp    NYSE FBP    Clearfield  Inc    NASDAQ CLFD    BioDelivery Sciences International  Inc    NASDAQ BDSI    MGIC Investment Corp    NYSE MTG   and Kratos Defense   Security Solutions  Inc    NASDAQ KTOS    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research 5 Affordable Breakout Stocks for Super Returns
Seeking out breakout stocks is probably one of the most favored techniques among active investors  The logic behind this kind of stock selection is to determine which stocks are trading within a narrow band  These stocks are to be bought as soon as they move above this channel and sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum 
At the same time  market watchers warn against incorrectly timing such a move  This is because there is a significant risk of identifying stock movements as breakouts even when this is not the case  However  when utilized judiciously  this strategy yields formidable gains  which is the reason why it remains popular 
Spotting Prospective Candidates
In order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement 
At the breakout level  demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those which have just breached this level 
Checking Whether It s for Real
Stocks that have breached their resistance levels should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge 
Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns

3025,224540,CLFD,5 Affordable Breakout Stocks For Superlative Returns ,opinion,Seeking out breakout stocks is probably one of the most favored techniques among active investors  The logic behind this kind of stock selection is to determine which stocks are trading within a narrow band  These stocks are to be bought as soon as they move above this channel and sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum At the same time  market watchers warn against incorrectly timing such a move  This is because there is a significant risk of identifying stock movements as breakouts even when this is not the case  However  when utilized judiciously  this strategy yields formidable gains  which is the reason why it remains popular Spotting Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  demand for the stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those which have just breached this level Checking Whether It s for RealStocks that have breached their resistance levels should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive    Current Price  52 Week High greater than or equal to 0 9  Stocks which are trading 90  close to their 52 week highs    Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through    Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2  Stocks which move by a greater degree than the broader market but within a reasonable limit    Current price less than or equal to  20  Stocks which are reasonably priced  These criteria narrow down the universe of over 7580 stocks to only 24 Here are the top five stocks that meet these criteria First BanCorp    NYSE FBP   is a bank holding company for FirstBank Puerto Rico which offers a range of financial products and services  First BanCorp has a

3054,224569,CLFD,ViaSat  VSAT  Earnings And Revenues Miss Estimates In Q1,opinion,ViaSat Inc    NASDAQ VSAT   posted yet another earnings miss in the first quarter of fiscal of 2017  The company posted adjusted earnings  including stock based compensation adjustments  of 6 cents per share in first quarter fiscal 2017 which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents by 60  GAAP earnings came in at 4 cents  down 20  from 5 cents in the year ago quarter The bottom line deterioration is largely attributable to a rise in cost of service revenues and selling  general   administrative expenses Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted revenues of  363 1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017  led by robust growth in Satellite Services  Though revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  366 million  it was up 5 4  year over year Segment wise  Satellite Services revenues achieved a record high for the fourth consecutive quarter  up 15 1  year over year to  152 4 million  The impressive figures were driven by continued strength in residential broadband offerings and a thriving in flight connectivity business However  Commercial Networks revenues continued to show weakness  edging down 1 8  on a year over year basis to  65 6 million  This was largely a result of lack of activities due to the completion of certain antenna systems and mobile broadband satellite communications systems programs  However  these declines were somewhat offset by a higher number of broadband terminal orders received under the NBN project On the other hand  Government Systems reported record revenues of  145 2 million  flat on a year over year basis  This was primarily fuelled by strong performance in government satellite communications systems products  offset by softness in the information assurance product line During the quarter  sales backlog increased 4 6  year over year to  912 9 million  Adjusted EBIDTA rose 3 5  from the comparable quarter last year to  80 2 million Quarterly HighlightsViaSat s Satellite Services average revenue per user  ARPU  in the residential internet business grew 8   primarily fuelled by higher bandwidth  increased value plans and growth in value added services  Also  the company s high speed in flight Internet service was selected by American Airlines for its new Boeing  NYSE BA  737 MAX fleet  Moreover  in partnership with Eutelsat  ViaSat launched in flight Internet service in Europe in collaboration with EL AL Israel Airlines Moreover  the company s Commercial Networks business  ViaSat 2 satellite communications platform passed critical program milestones  including completion of assembly  functional performance and first phase of environmental testing in preparation for a launch window  Also  the collaboration between ViaSat and Boeing Satellite Systems International  BSSI  on the ViaSat 3 program is progressing well as the two organizations continue to integrate ViaSat s communications payload with Boeing s upgraded platform Finally  the company s Government Systems business is progressing well as ViaSat was awarded a sole source contract to provide global in flight connectivity service to Air Force One and other prestigious U S  government senior leader aircraft  Also  the company continued to execute on its contract with NEXCOM  Navy Exchange Service Command   which proved conducive to Managed Wi Fi revenues In addition  Royal Canadian Air Force selected ViaSat s KOR 24A STT technology for its CP 140 Aurora aircraft and the company also managed to secure NSA certification for two of its information assurance encryption devices LiquidityViaSat exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  47 2 million  compared with  42 5 million as of Jun 30  2015 VIASAT INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   To ConcludeViaSat s first quarter fiscal 2017 results can be best described as mixed with the bottom line performance lagging expectations but revenue growth continuing  The company s ViaSat 1 satellite remains a star performer even after five years of launch  delivering record earnings and margins  Going forward  the company aspires to deliver more bandwidth efficient satellites and improve its stronghold in regional and global markets by leveraging on its state of the art technology  ViaSat exhibits a bullish sentiment regarding the launch of ViaSat 2 class satellites as it compounds the company s ability to expand its foothold in residential broadband  mobile WiFi  aeronautical and maritime applications in both thriving commercial and

3064,224579,CLFD,Buy 4 Wireless Equipment Manufacturers On Strong Demand,opinion,The global telecommunications industry is witnessing rapid technological improvement   A growing global economy speeds up the demand for real time voice  data  and video manifold  The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  This in turn has stimulated the requirement for telecom infrastructure developers  particularly wireless equipment manufacturers Massive government spending like U S  broadband infrastructure development program and similar structural subsidies in China and India  have been a boon to telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers   At this stage  investment in wireless equipment stocks with favorable Zacks Rank will be lucrative Strong Wireless Infrastructure MarketFifth generation  5G  superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry  In September 2017  Moody s Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for the U S  wireless carriers In this regard  Internet of Things  IoT  has the potential to emerge the numero uno factor for future growth in the space  Statista s 2018 report estimates that global telecom services revenues will reach around  1 5 trillion in 2019 4G LTE ThrivingThe LTE network has the highest penetration rate of 90 5  in the North American region  Both Western Europe region   Oceania and Eastern   South eastern Asia region have a LTE penetration rate of 54   In the Latin American and Caribbean region  LTE market share has more than doubled year over year to 23  in 2017 This figure is projected to grow 28  by the end of this year and further to 59  in 2021  By the end of 2020  C RAN  small cells  DAS and carrier Wi Fi  together with their fronthaul and backhaul segments  will account for more than 45  of total wireless infrastructure spending Growing Demand for Fiber Optic NetworkFiber optic cable is a vital infrastructure in order to meet the growing need for cloud based business data  along with more video streaming services by individuals  Moreover  fiber optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last mile local loop  which are required by wireless service providers for their upcoming 5G network Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth which is of utmost necessity for the smooth functioning of high speed wireless networks such as 4G and 5G  Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells  The increase in adoption of small cells can be attributed to the inconvenience in installing large towers in inaccessible areas Pro Growth MeasuresThe two pro growth agendas of President Trump  namely  significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Telecom industry  The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35  to 21    marking the rate s lowest in 78 years  Trump s tax proposal will result in a huge windfall for telecom operators  The carriers can utilize this money for 5G network R D and its deployment  This will naturally bolster demand for wireless equipment The telecom regulatory body  Federal Communications Commission  FCC   which was revamped by Trump  repealed the Net Neutrality laws in December 2017  Telecom industry will immensely benefit from this decision and will ramp up their project investment  Higher telecom expenditure will eventually benefit wireless equipment manufacturers Our PicksThe U S  wireless equipment industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  In order to stay abreast of competition  existing players

3107,224622,CLFD,ViaSat  VSAT  Q4 Earnings Miss Despite Record Revenues,opinion,Following an impressive beat in the third quarter  ViaSat Inc  s   NASDAQ VSAT   fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results fell far short of expectations as its adjusted earnings  including stock based compensation adjustments  of 12 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents by a wide 45 5  The decline was due to a huge rise in operating costs  particularly in research and development  which more than offset the record top line GAAP earnings came in at 9 cents  tumbling 43 8  from 16 cents in the year ago quarter For fiscal 2016  the company reported GAAP earnings of 44 cents  down 47 6  from the fiscal 2015 figure of 84 cents Inside the HeadlinesThe company posted record revenues of  372 million for the quarter  led by robust growth in Satellite Services and Government Systems segments  Revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  363 million and were up 2  year over year  Strong growth in these segments more than offset the decline in th commercial networks business For fiscal 2016  the company reported revenues of  1 417 4 million  up 2 5  Segment wise  Satellite Services revenues achieved a record high for the second consecutive quarter  up 11 5  year over year to  145 4 million  The impressive figures were driven by continued strength in residential broadband offerings and emerging in flight connectivity business However  Commercial Networks revenues continued to show weakness and tanked 26  on a year over year basis to  62 2 million  This was owing to the winding down of the NBN Co  infrastructure project in addition to the completion of certain antenna systems and mobile broadband satellite communications systems programs  However  these declines were somewhat offset by strength in initial broadband terminal orders under the NBN project On the other hand  Government Systems reported record revenues  which were up 9 3  to  164 4 million  The numbers were primarily fuelled by strong performance in government satellite communications systems products and tactical data link products sales  However  low revenues from information assurance products limited growth to some extent During the quarter  sales backlog increased 2 9  year over year to  941 9 million Adjusted EBIDTA fell 9 5  from the comparable quarter last year to  80 7 million  The company commenced construction of the ViaSat 3 class satellites  which generated high R D expenses and contributed to the fall in EBITDA  In fact  expenses related to the construction of ViaSat 3s are expected to rise in the upcoming quarters Notable Quarterly DevelopmentsConcurrent with the earnings release  ViaSat announced a multi year agreement with leading aerospace company  Dassault Aviation  Per the deal  ViaSat will equip the first Falcon 8X with its Ku band terminal to deliver advanced internet and corporate network access to operators  The bundled global Ku band broadband services offering will include in flight connectivity service and in cabin network equipment The company is progressing on the ViaSat 2 satellite program as well  with its launch window expected to come in less than seven months with launch partner Arianespace Also  ViaSat is ramping up investments in the development of its revolutionary ViaSat 3 broadband communications platform  and has commenced the construction of the first two ViaSat 3 class satellites  The ViaSat 3 platform will help to form a global broadband network with sufficient network capacity to allow better consumer choices with an affordable  high quality  high speed internet and video streaming service These launches will aid ViaSat progress toward its goal of delivering new high speed service plans across major geographic regions by mid 2017 LiquidityViaSat exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  42 1 million  compared with  52 3 million as of Apr 3  2015 To ConcludeGoing forward  ViaSat expects healthy growth as it capitalizes on its competitive advantage and strong demand for its cost effective satellite bandwidth products  The company expects robust growth opportunities in satellite services and government systems segments  which should drive the top line in the coming quarters In addition  the company s record new orders for fiscal 2016  combined with the disruptive satellite technology translate into attractive revenue growth prospects for the future ViaSat looks set to benefit from its fixed and mobile broadband businesses that are expected to grow further aided by high consumer  enterprise and mobile users demand worldwide for broadband solutions and high speed and high bandwidth broadband services ViaSat currently carries a

3111,224626,CLFD,Ericsson  ERIC  Report Shows Huge Potential In Wearables,opinion,"Communication technology and services giant Ericsson  ST ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   has released a new ConsumerLab Report  which focuses on wearable technology and the Internet of Things   IoT    and its demand projections in the future  The findings of its survey offer interesting insights to the future of wearables 
Most Desired Wearables Functions
With the demographic of wearable owners having evolved over the past few years  it seems that users are now younger and less concerned about fitness and health  According to the study  about 6 in 10 smartphone users are looking for more functionality from wearables  Specifically  consumers are showing great interestin devices that are related to personal safety and security  such as personal locators and panic buttons 
Other most desired wearables functions include smartwatches  identity authenticators and wearable water purifiers  according to the opinions given by 5 000 smartphone users surveyed across Brazil  China  South Korea  U K  and the U S  Among these consumers  about half use wearables 
Market Poised for Growth
It s almost a given that the wearables market is poised for tremendous growth in the coming years  Smartphone users who also own wearables have doubled over the past year in the surveyed markets 
Per a report from Transparency Market Research  the global wearable technology market stood at  750 0 million in 2012 and is expected to reach  5 8 billion in 2018  at a CAGR of 40 8  
Smartphones to Be Replaced 
Ercisson s report offers a peek at the market s potential beyond 2020  The report says that wearables will increasingly help consumers interact with physical things and objects  with 43  smartphone users believing that wearables might actually replace smartphones sometime in the future 
Wearables will gradually get smarter and more independent in terms of connectivity  and this might make the smartphone less significant  38  of smartphone users believe it likely that most smartphone functions will be performed by wearables within just five years 
About one third of the smartphone users expect to use at least five connected wearable devices by 2020 
Further  wearable technology will also help people connect to the IoT  and thus accelerate the convergence of the digital and human worlds 
About 60  of the users believe that ingestible pills and chips under the skin will be common in the coming five years  In addition to health monitoring  these might also be used to authenticate identity and transactions  unlock doors  and other such tasks In fact  a quarter of smartwatch owners are already using their smartwatches to control other digital devices remotely 
However  users expect that the current market wearables will take another year or so to become mainstream 
Risks in Wearables 
Also  all this wearable technology use gives rise to apprehension about safety and security of personal information and data  About 53  of users surveyed acknowledged that wearables are vulnerable to hacking  data breaches and viruses  Yet  60  think that they have complete control of their data 
To conclude  anything seems possible for this new technology  and most people seem to be on board with wearables becoming a part of their daily life

3115,224630,CLFD,Make Or Break Week For Q4 Earnings Season,opinion,"The picture emerging from the 2014 Q4 earnings season at this stage is one of weakness  with earnings and revenue growth rates tracking below levels that we have been seeing in other recent periods  Weak results from the Finance sector has been a big drag on the aggregate picture at this stage and the growth rates improve once Finance is excluded from the aggregate numbers  But aside from high proportion of companies beating EPS estimates  the results thus far don t compare favorably to the recent past  whether looked at with or without the Finance sector 
 The reporting cycle really accelerates this week  with almost 500 companies coming out with Q4 results  including 136 S P 500 members  This week s line up packs plenty of leaders from all the key sectors  ranging from Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  to Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Dupont  NYSE DFT   and much more in between  As such  it may not be unfair to characterize this week as a make or break week for the Q4 earnings season  This week will either fully confirm the weak start we have had thus far or turn it around in the opposite direction  But the trends established this week will carry through the rest of this reporting cycle with only minor changes The Q4 Scorecard  as of 1 23 2015  We have seen Q4 results from 91 S P 500 members that combined account for 25 5  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are up  3 2  from the same period last year  with 73 6  beating EPS estimates  Total revenues are up  2 1  from the same period last year and 50 5  of them are coming ahead with top line estimates  The table below shows the current scorecard for the S P 500 index

This is a weaker performance than we have seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters  The charts below compare the Q4 growth rates and beat ratios for these 91 companies with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent quarters  As you can see  the earnings and revenue growth rates are weaker than what we have been seeing in other recent quarters  With respect to positive surprises  they are more numerous for earnings and less so for revenues  The charts below compare the results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of companies in 2014 Q3 and the average for the preceding four quarters 

Finance has the most weightage in the results thus far  with Q4 reports from 52 1  of the sector s total market capitalization already out  Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are down  6 1  on  2 0  lower revenues  with 69 0  beating EPS estimates and 55 2  coming ahead of top line expectations  This is the weakest performance that we have seen from these Finance sector companies in other recent quarters  thanks to tough comparisons at Citigroup  NYSE C  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   Had it not been for Citigroup and J P  Morgan  the Finance sector earnings would be up  3 7  from the same period last year  The charts below compare the Finance sector results thus far with what we had seen from this same group of companies in other recent quarters  As you can see  more companies have beat EPS estimates compared to Q3 or the average of the last four quarters  but the growth rates are clearly on the low side 

Keeping the Finance sector out of the results thus far  total earnings for the rest of the S P 500 companies are up  9 8  on  3 8  higher revenues  This improved growth picture notwithstanding  it is still weaker relative to what we had seen from this same group of ex Finance companies in other recent quarters  The charts below present the aggregate data thus far on an ex Finance basis

Finance results are not doubt weak  but the Technology sector isn t doing much better either  With results from almost one quarter of the sector s total market cap already  total Tech sector earnings are up  2  on  2 5  lower revenues  with 80  beating EPS estimates and only 40  coming ahead of top line estimates  As you can see in the comparison charts below  this is weaker than what we have been seeing from these companies in other recent quarters 

Most of the sector results thus far have been the legacy old line Tech players like IBM  NYSE IBM   Intel  NASDAQ INTC   Oracle  NYSE ORCL  and others  This week brings in the  growthier  and more glamourous of the sector players like Facebook  Google and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   While the growth picture isn t expected to materially change  but we will know for sure only at the end of this week The Composite Q4 Picture Combining the actual results for the 91 S P 500 companies that have reported with the 409 still to come reports  total Q4 earnings are expected to be up  1 9  on  0 6  lower revenues  Four sectors   Transportation  Medical  Utilities and Business Services  are expected to have double digit earnings growth in Q4  while five sectors are expected to have lower total earnings this quarter relative to the year earlier period  The Energy sector has the weakest growth profile for understandable reasons  with total earnings for the sector expected to be down  24 6  on  16 0  lower revenues  The table below presents the summary picture for Q4 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the Q3 earnings season 

Falling Estimates Estimates for the current period  2015 Q1  have started coming down at an accelerated pace  with total earnings for the quarter now expected to be up  1 9   down from the  4  growth rate expected in mid December and  10 8  in early October  As was the case in Q4  Energy is the biggest driver of this negative revisions trend  While total Q1 earnings for the Energy sector were expected to be down  only   35 6  in mid December  they are now expected to be  56 6  year over year  Given the persistently weak oil prices  there is likely more room for downward adjustments to these estimates  Estimates for Q4 went through an even sharper negative revision process  though almost half of the drop in estimates was due to developments in the Energy sector  The chart below plots the evolution of current and following quarter estimates over the last 3 plus months  As you can see  the first half 2015 growth rate has effectively fallen victim to developments in the oil patch 

The Q4 Energy sector results that we have seen thus far are fairly strong  with total earnings for the 14 8  of the sector s market capitalization that have reported results are up  24 2  on  9 3  higher revenues  But this growth picture will look very different once Chevron  NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips report results this week  Exxon reports the following week  Note  Want more articles from this author  Scroll up to the top of this article and click the FOLLOW AUTHOR button to get an email each time a new article is published Note  For a complete analysis of 2014 Q4 estimates  please check out weekly  Here is a list of the 494 companies reporting this week  including 136 S P 500 members ",2015-01-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/make-or-break-week-for-q4-earnings-season-239538,239538
