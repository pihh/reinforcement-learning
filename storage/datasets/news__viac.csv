200406,421922,VIAC,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch ,news,"Investing com   Here s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1  Durable Goods Orders  ISM Non Manufacturing  ADP Data on Tap
A raft of economic reports on services  private sector jobs and durable goods orders could dictate market direction Wednesday amid a recent lack of top tier economic data  
ADP nonfarm employment data  which often serves as a precursor to the monthly nonfarm payrolls data slated for Friday  is expected to show the private sector created 205 000 jobs in March  slightly below the 235 000 jobs created in the prior month 
The Institute of Supply Management s Non Manufacturing Purchasing Managers  Index is expected to show a reading of 59 2 for March slightly below the previous reading of 59 5 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity 
A pair of reports on the durable goods and factory orders  meanwhile  will be closely monitored to assess whether recent tax cuts have encouraged spending 
On the monetary policy front  speeches by both St  Louis Fed President James Bullard at 09 45 a m  ET  and Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta at 11 00 a m  ET could offer an insight into the Fed s thinking on monetary policy measures 
The dollar tacked on gains against its rivals on Tuesday  as risk on sentiment helped the greenback claw back some of its losses against safe haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc 
2  Fresh Inventory Data to Threaten Crude s Relief Rally  
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration  EIA  on Wednesday is expected to show that U S  crude stockpiles rose for the second straight week 
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 264 000 barrels in the week ended March 29 amid an ongoing rise in U S  output  which hit a record 10 43 million barrels a day last week  according to the Energy Information Administration 
Crude oil futures settled higher on Tuesday at  63 51 a barrel as risk on sentiment supported demand for riskier assets 
3  CBS  Viacom  Spotify In Focus

The talks between the two companies reportedly hit a roadblock earlier in the session amid a squabble concerning who would lead the merged company 
The battle is between Joe Ianniello  the chief operating officer of CBS  and Bob Bakish  the CEO of Viacom  CNBC reported  citing the sources

200525,422041,VIAC,Battle over Redstone s media empire sparks hope for change,news,"By Jessica Toonkel  Reuters    The legal battle over control of Sumner Redstone s  40 billion media empire has investors hopeful that change will come to underperforming Viacom Inc  O VIAB   On Friday  Sumner Redstone removed both Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and Viacom board member George Abrams from the trust that will determine the future of CBS and Viacom after controlling shareholder Redstone dies or is declared mentally incapacitated  Dauman fired back on Monday saying the moves to replace him and Abrams from both the trust and National Amusements board would amount to an  unlawful corporate takeover  by Sumner s daughter  Shari Redstone  Sumner Redstone s privately held movie theater chain National Amusements holds 80 percent of the voting stock in both Viacom and CBS  Separately  Sumner Redstone on Monday asked a Los Angeles Court for an order validating his removal of Dauman and Abrams from his trust and from the board of National Amusements Inc  The outcome of the court cases  and who ends up with control over the trust  and over the National Amusements board  will have wide ranging implications for Viacom and CBS shareholders and could result in changes at the top of both companies  possibly through mergers and acquisitions   Some investors are hopeful that change is imminent  Viacom shares rose 2 5 percent to  40 02 on Monday    This whole company should be a case study of how to destroy shareholder value   said Salvatore Muoio  principal with New York based S  Muoio   Co  a major owner of Viacom voting shares   They should sell this business to the highest bidder and get it over with   Michael Cuggino  president and portfolio manager at San Francisco based Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds  which owns voting shares of CBS and Viacom  said he would also welcome some change at Viacom  including a sale  but had concerns about what kind of premium Viacom could get from a potential buyer right now   Cuggino said he would welcome the idea of Viacom becoming part of CBS again  but would need to make sure it made sense for CBS  Viacom spun off CBS in 2006   There are certainly a lot of good synergies there   he said  Others investors are showing more patience  Mario Gabelli  the second largest owner of Viacom voting shares  told CNBC on Monday that Dauman has six months to turn the company around  Representatives for CBS and Viacom declined to comment  Viacom  like other media companies  has suffered from falling ratings at its cable networks such as Nickelodeon and MTV as younger viewers migrate online and to mobile video   Over the past 12 months  Viacom is down 40 percent  lagging the Standard   Poor s 500 Media Index   which is off only 4 7 percent  CBS shares edged down 0 5 percent to  52 49  BATTLE FOR CONTROL  Redstone  who turns 93 on Friday  suffers from diminished mental capacity and is dependent on his daughter  Shari Redstone  the lawsuit said    Shari Redstone is attempting to illegally hijack her father s well established estate plan   Dauman said in a statement   The complaint named Shari Redstone  her son Tyler Korff  as defendants and trust members David Andelman  Norman Jacobs and Leonard Lewin as nominal defendants   A statement sent on behalf of Shari Redstone said   It is absurd for anyone to accuse Shari of manipulating her father     Sumner makes his own decisions regarding whom he wants to see both in his home and elsewhere   Redstone s attorneys have said he made the changes to the trust and board after trying to reach out to Viacom s board to discuss the future strategy of the company  The California and Massachusetts courts will need to sort out which of them has jurisdiction  and that may not be easy  said Keith Davidson  a probate lawyer in California   Massachusetts will likely have a strong preference to let California take jurisdiction  especially since a part of the case has already been litigated here  But you never know   Davidson wrote in an email  The standards for determining that someone is not mentally competent differ  California requires evidence of a mental defect that correlates to the specifics of the situation  such as a will or contract  Massachusetts does not have that requirement but does look to expert opinion and would evaluate a person s ability to manage affairs effectively  lawyers said   Viacom said in a statement its board has tried to meet with Sumner Redstone many times  adding that he was silent during a recent call about the company s strategy  Sumner Redstone has not participated in an earnings conference call or an annual investor meeting since 2014  Sumner Redstone plans to name National Amusements general counsel Tad Jankowski and family friend Jill Krutick to the trust  sources told Reuters on Sunday   Besides Shari  trust members include her son  lawyer Tyler Korff  David Andelman  another lawyer who is on the CBS board  Norman Jacobs  Sumner Redstone s divorce lawyer  and Leonard Lewin  who represented Redstone s first wife  Phyllis  in her divorce from Redstone   LIVING GHOST   Sumner Redstone and Dauman have worked together for more than 30 years  and Redstone has called Dauman  a great friend   In February  Shari Redstone was the only one to vote against Dauman s elevation to executive chairman of Viacom to replace her father  This month  a judge dismissed a lawsuit by a former girlfriend who had argued Redstone was not mentally competent to remove her from his advance healthcare directive  The case  which claimed that Redstone was  a living ghost   shined a spotlight on Redstone s health  The mogul struggled to speak when questioned by attorneys  But he was clear about wanting ex girlfriend Manuela Herzer out of his life  and putting his daughter in charge of healthcare decisions if he could no longer make them   In that trial  Dauman submitted statements in November that Redstone was

200537,422053,VIAC,Redstone competence trial ends as judge tosses lawsuit,news,By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Media mogul Sumner Redstone never set foot in the Los Angeles courtroom where his mental competency was on trial in recent days  But the 92 year old billionaire had the final word on Monday when Judge David Cowan  citing blunt videotaped testimony from Redstone  threw out a lawsuit brought by a former girlfriend challenging her removal from his healthcare directive    Redstone s testimony has ultimately defeated her case   Cowan wrote in a 17 page ruling that abruptly ended the lawsuit brought by the billionaire s ex companion Manuela Herzer  The quick end to a months long and at times salacious legal drama was a clear victory for Redstone and his daughter Shari over who should handle the mogul s medical decisions  If Herzer  52  had proved her case  it could have triggered a chain of events that would result in the transfer of Redstone s controlling stake in media giants Viacom Inc  O VIAB  and CBS Corp  N CBS  to a seven person trust that includes Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman and Shari Redstone  Monday s decision did not address Redstone s ability to handle business matters at the two companies  where he controls roughly 80 percent of voting shares through his movie theater company National Amusements Inc  Any challenge to his competency to manage his shares would need to come from the trust  The transfer of his shares to the trust is scheduled to take place upon his death unless he is found to be incompetent to manage them prior to that  The judge s dismissal means more uncertainty around the long term future of CBS and Viacom  said Brian Wieser  an analyst at Pivotal Research Group    Yes  there is a plan for what happens when Redstone passes  but things remain as uncertain as they were before  in terms of the long term implications   he said   Redstone struggled to speak when questioned by attorneys for Herzer as part of her lawsuit  a transcript of his testimony shows  and a medical expert hired by Herzer said he believes the mogul suffers from moderate dementia  Herzer s attorneys say she plans to appeal the judge s decision   Respectfully  he got it wrong   Herzer attorney Pierce O Donnell told reporters outside the courthouse   That s why we have appellate courts   SEPARATE LAWSUIT Separately  Herzer filed a new lawsuit on Monday asking for at least  70 million in damages from Shari Redstone and Sumner Redstone s nurses  alleging they interfered with her expected inheritance and invaded her privacy  Redstone  in a statement  called Herzer s new lawsuit  total fiction   Redstone attorney Robert Klieger said in a statement that his client was now  looking forward to liberating the  150  million  in  gifts   to Herzer and another former girlfriend   Herzer s case revealed intimate details about Redstone s life inside his Beverly Park mansion  The ex girlfriend claimed he was obsessed with having sex and that he clamored for steak  even though he was on a feeding tube and no longer able to chew or swallow  After months of headlines  the trial ended after just one day of testimony and three witnesses  including Redstone   Redstone repeatedly referred to Herzer as  a fucking bitch  in his 18 minute videotaped testimony  according to a transcript  When asked what he would like to happen at the end of the trial  he responded   I want Manuela out of my life  Yeah   That clearly swayed the judge   There is no good cause for further judicial involvement where the court has now heard directly from Redstone that he has lost trust in Herzer  does not want her in his life and instead wants his daughter Shari to look after him if necessary   Cowan wrote in his ruling  Shares of Viacom  which owns MTV  Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures  were down 2 2 percent at  40 43  CBS shares fell 2 9 percent to  56 01   CBS executives have talked to investment bankers about how their CEO and executive chairman  Leslie Moonves  can gain more control over the company when Redstone dies or is declared mentally incompetent  sources have told Reuters  Brett Harriss  research analyst at Gabelli   Co  which is the biggest owner of voting shares in Viacom Inc and CBS behind Redstone s family  said he hopes that now Viacom s management can focus on turning around its business    At the end of the day this was really all just background noise for both companies   he said ,2016-05-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/redstone-legal-drama-could-come-to-abrupt-end-400773,400773

200550,422066,VIAC,Redstone seen resigning as Viacom chair following CBS move,news,"By Jessica Toonkel
NEW YORK  Reuters    Viacom s board appears poised to replace Sumner Redstone as chairman on Thursday  after the aging mogul stepped down from his executive role at the top of CBS  but it was not clear who would get his job at Viacom as Redstone s daughter made clear she did not want CEO Philippe Dauman to succeed her father 
Redstone  92 and in poor health  unexpectedly resigned as executive chairman of CBS on Wednesday  and Viacom said its directors would meet the next day  without saying what they would discuss  Both companies are controlled by Redstone and investors said that they expected him to stand down 
Daughter Shari Redstone said that both companies needed an  independent voice  who was not involved in her family s personal matters or on her father s trust  That excluded herself and fellow trust member Dauman 
Shares of CBS Corp  N CBS  were up 4 6 percent in after hours market trading  while those of Viacom Inc  O VIAB  rose 10 percent 
CBS said Redstone would be replaced by Leslie Moonves  its president and chief executive since 2006 
 It s for the best  It s too much distraction  It s time to move on   said Sal Muoio  whose investment firm is one of the largest owners of voting shares of Viacom  outside the Redstone family  He said Redstone was widely expected to resign at Viacom 
Redstone s health has been the subject of intense debate  partly due to his notable absence from the companies  recent earnings conference calls  His former girlfriend  Manuela Herzer  challenged his mental competency in a lawsuit in November 
As part of that legal fight  Redstone underwent a mental examination last Friday by a psychiatrist hired by Herzer  The results of that test have not been made public 
Herzer s attorneys could potentially use the psychiatrist s conclusions to argue that her lawsuit should not be dismissed  A Los Angeles judge is set to make a decision on Feb  29 
CBS  move effectively cements Moonves  control of the company  according to one investor 
  Redstone s  role has been diminished for some time and Les Moonves has been the guy running the company  My initial take would be that net net there s no change here   said Stephen Massocca  chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco  a hedge fund that does not own CBS or Viacom stock 
Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS through a holding company 
CBS said that  before electing Moonves  its board offered the position of non executive chair to Redstone s daughter  Shari Redstone  but she declined 
Shari Redstone confirmed she declined the offer and congratulated Moonves on his new role 
 It is my firm belief that whoever may succeed my father as Chair at each company should be someone who is not a Trustee of my father s trust or otherwise intertwined in Redstone family matters  but rather a leader with an independent voice   she said in an emailed statement   I was honored to nominate Les as the CBS Chair and am delighted to congratulate him on his new position  
Viacom said last month that it cut Redstone s total pay by 85 percent last year in light of his  reduced responsibilities   without giving further details 

Redstone s resignation as executive chairman was effective Feb  2  CBS said  He will remain as chairman emeritus ",2016-02-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/redstone-seen-resigning-as-viacom-chair-following-cbs-move-383174,383174
200551,422067,VIAC,Viacom names CEO Dauman as chair as Redstone exits  daughter protests,news,"By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK  Reuters    Viacom Inc s board of directors named Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman as executive chairman  replacing majority owner Sumner Redstone  overriding calls for an independent board chief from Redstone s daughter  who voted against Dauman   Viacom  O VIAB  announced on Thursday that the ailing 92 year old Redstone was becoming chairman emeritus  a day after CBS Corp  N CBS  said Redstone  also the CBS majority owner  was stepping down as executive chairman and being replaced by CEO Leslie Moonves  The boards of CBS and Viacom have been discussing Redstone stepping down for several weeks  according to two sources familiar with the situation   Thursday s decision puts Viacom firmly in the hands of Dauman  a longtime associate of Sumner Redstone  His daughter  Shari  said in a statement she wanted someone who was not a member of her father s trust to run Viacom  which would have excluded Dauman  Dauman and Moonves are natural rivals as leaders of the two halves of the empire that Redstone separated 10 years ago  After Redstone s eventual death  analysts expect several scenarios  such as selling the companies in pieces  leaving them as they are  or reuniting them  which could pit the executives against one another   Sumner Redstone and the rest of Viacom s board voted in favor of Dauman  and only Shari Redstone voted against him  according to a source close to the company  Viacom said Shari Redstone turned down the non executive chairman role   Shari Redstone will  continue to advocate for what she believes to be in the best interests of Viacom shareholders   she said in a statement   Viacom shares initially rose sharply  but later pared gains  closing up 1 5 percent at  45 34 on Nasdaq  Investor reaction was mixed   SpringOwl Asset Management  a Viacom shareholder that has agitated for change  was disappointed by the move   It raises questions about the board  corporate governance and fiduciary duties   the firm said in a statement   The market agrees     that someone other than Philippe Dauman should be the Chairman   Michael Cuggino  president and portfolio manager at San Francisco based Permanent Portfolio of Family Of Funds  which is the fifth largest voting shareholder in Viacom and CBS  applauded Dauman s appointment  and was willing to give him time to improve the company s performance    Viacom s issues have not gone away and they still need to be tackled  but all the noise surrounding Sumner s situation has been taken out of the equation   Cuggino said   The answer to whether Philippe is the right guy to do this will come later   Sal Muoio  whose investment firm also is a top owner of voting Viacom shares  said he is also willing to give Dauman time   This at least is a step toward clarity  I think we need to wait and see how these operational things unfold    Mario Gabelli  the largest Viacom shareholder outside the Redstone family  said on financial news channel CNBC that Dauman has six to nine months to prove himself    Philippe has to deliver   Gabelli told Reuters in an interview   How does he jump start the process  It s going to be tough to get into the digital world and over the top  Internet   given his perception of what his core competences are  It s going to be a challenge   Gabelli dismissed the idea that Moonves could take over both companies   He can t do both  I don t think    Redstone hived off Viacom from CBS  expecting faster growth from the owner of MTV and Paramount than the storied television network  but in recent years CBS has outperformed Viacom  CBS shares are up more than 135 percent in the last five years  while Viacom has eked out a 3 percent gain  Viacom in recent years has suffered from falling ratings at its cable networks as its audience of younger viewers migrate to online and mobile video  In April 2015  the company announced a restructuring to save  350 million annually  Dauman has taken steps to woo advertisers by using data to better target their commercials   The elder Redstone has faced questions about his health and leadership abilities for some time  He underwent a mental examination last Friday by a psychiatrist hired by his former girlfriend  Manuela Herzer  who has challenged Redstone s mental competency in a lawsuit  The results of the examination have not been made public  Neither CBS nor Viacom explained why Redstone stepped aside  After Herzer s lawsuit  investor Gabelli called for the media company to disclose the state of Redstone s mental competence  Shari Redstone  60  has said both companies needed an  independent voice  as chair who was not involved in the family s personal matters  She supported Moonves as CBS chief  Dauman serves as a Sumner Redstone trustee in the event of his death as well as his health care proxy   Shari Redstone believes Herzer s lawsuit is weighing on her father s mind    Ms  Herzer s lawsuit  and the fact she is actually trying to once again insert herself into my father s life  is causing my father tremendous stress and agitation   she said in a declaration to a California court filed this week   Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS Corp through a holding company  
In January  Viacom said it cut the compensation of its top two executives  Redstone and Dauman  as the company faced business pressures and a sharp drop in its share price ",2016-02-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/viacom-ceo-dauman-seen-adding-chairman-title:-cnbc-383311,383311

200561,422077,VIAC,Two medical colleagues duel over Sumner Redstone s mental fitness,news,By Lisa Richwine and Dan Levine  Reuters    Doctors Stephen Read and James Spar are collaborators on a chapter of a forthcoming psychiatry textbook  colleagues at UCLA s medical school and go to court experts on the evaluation of mental fitness in the elderly  In the 2014 fight over whether owner Donald Sterling was fit to decide the fate of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team  the two psychiatrists agreed that he was not  Now  in the high stakes battle over the mental competence of Viacom Inc  O VIAB  Executive Chairman Sumner Redstone  the two doctors are on opposite sides  At issue in a Los Angeles County probate court is whether the 92 year old media mogul knew what he was doing when he changed a document known as an advance healthcare directive  removing ex girlfriend Manuela Herzer as his designated agent and installing Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman  Read  in a declaration filed on behalf of Herzer  says no  Spar  hired by Redstone  says yes  Their opinions are playing to at least two audiences  The judge who may make a legal determination of the billionaire s mental state  as well as investors  some of whom have questioned whether Redstone  who owns about 80 percent of the voting shares of Viacom and CBS  N CBS   is a capable corporate steward  The doctors declined to comment for this article  That Read and Spar  two respected and similarly trained specialists in geriatric psychiatry  could come to such different views illustrates the intrinsic challenge in evaluations of mental capacity  experts said  Doctors  assessments can vary because they work from different sources of information  In Redstone s case  Spar examined Redstone several times in person  while Read based his opinion on reports from Herzer and other witnesses  Herzer asked the court to allow Read to examine Redstone in person and her lawyers asked to depose Redstone  The judge rejected the requests  citing Redstone s privacy and dignity  Herzer has appealed  ESCORTED OUT The law requires the court to presume Redstone is competent  putting the burden of proof on Herzer  The judge may use the doctors  evaluations  as well as other testimony  to decide if the case should proceed  A variety of factors can affect the assessment of mental capacity  such as the time of day  said Dr  Daniel Plotkin  an expert in geriatric psychiatry who co wrote a forthcoming research paper with Spar  A person may appear perfectly capable at one hour  only to seem befuddled later on  he said   It can be very difficult to determine   said Plotkin  who has worked on hundreds of competency cases  The Redstone controversy began last fall when Herzer was thrown off his advance healthcare directive and escorted out of his sprawling hilltop estate  She sued  contending the mogul was in no position to make such decisions  The suit focuses on Redstone s alleged mental decline and it suggests that this may have made him susceptible to undue influence  It portrays Redstone as a  living ghost  who communicates in grunts and is obsessed with having sex and with eating steak  even though he is on a feeding tube and no longer able to chew or even swallow his own saliva  Redstone is no longer able to write  his signature  almost a straight line  appearing as if someone moved the paper under his pen   Read said in a court declaration   In my professional opinion   he wrote   Mr  Redstone lacked the mental capacity to make a change in his appointed health care agent   Redstone s lawyers declined to comment  In court filings  they acknowledge Redstone has a speech problem but insist he knew exactly what he was doing when he changed his healthcare directive  The company and CEO Dauman declined to comment for this article  according to a Viacom spokesman  Spar said in a supporting declaration that  based on his evaluation on the day of the advance directive change  Redstone  retained the capacity  to execute the document and that it  appeared to reflect his own  authentic wishes  and not the influence of his staff members  or anyone else   Redstone s lawyers  say in the filings that the salacious nature of Herzer s claims demonstrate her lack of concern for Redstone s well being  and show she is out for personal gain  Herzer s attorney  Pierce O Donnell  said his client is concerned only for Redstone s health   It s not about money   he said  SCORES OF CASES Redstone s advance healthcare directive makes his personal physician  internist Richard Gold  responsible for gauging whether he can manage his own care or whether his designated agent should take over  court filings show  Gold visits Redstone two or three times a week and said in a court declaration that Redstone was getting  exceptional medical and personal care  under the media executive s  own direction   He declined to comment for this article  Read and Spar have each been hired as experts in hundreds of cases  Two years ago  Spar was a key witness in the suit over the sale of the Clippers  testifying that Donald Sterling lacked the mental capacity to override his wife Shelly s decision to sell the team  Read  also hired by Shelly Sterling  backed Spar up  The judge agreed and allowed the sale  The ranks of geriatric psychiatrists are thin  and the specialty is outmatched by burgeoning demand  said Dr  Gary Small  who directs the geriatric psychiatry division at UCLA s David Geffen School of Medicine  where both Read and Spar teach   There are not a lot of people around  so there are going to be a few stars  and they are going to be called upon a lot   he said  Redstone s motion to dismiss Herzer s suit is set for hearing on Feb  8  Herzer s lawyers deposed Spar and Gold last week  O Donnell  the lawyer for Herzer  said that Spar evaluated Redstone at least four times  Twice in 2014  once last September and again on the day in October when Redstone removed Herzer from his healthcare directive   He s a very fine doctor but he s not infallible   said O Donnell  who hired Spar in the Sterling case   We believe he got it wrong here   O Donnell may try to demonstrate that Spar s last evaluation of Redstone differed in some way from his previous exams  using any variation to cast doubt on his opinion  said Keith A  Davidson  a probate lawyer who teaches at Chapman University and who is not involved in the case  If the judge declines to dismiss  Herzer s lawyers could try to force Redstone to submit to a deposition  putting pressure on him to settle  Davidson said ,2016-01-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/two-medical-colleagues-duel-over-sumner-redstone's-mental-fitness-380586,380586

200565,422081,VIAC,Cablevision and Viacom reach agreement to resolve bundling lawsuit,news,"Investing com    Cablevision Systems Corporation  N CVC  and Viacom B Inc  O VIAB  announced on Friday that they resolved a longstanding antitrust litigation between the two companies  stemming from a carriage agreement reached in 2012  
In a February  2013 lawsuit  Cablevision accused Viacom of forcing it to pay for more than a dozen low rated networks if it also wanted access to a number of more popular channels such as Comedy Central  VH1 and TV Land  According to Cablevision  if it objected to the bundling agreement  it would have been subject to a  1 billion penalty by Viacom  In response  Viacom said the package deals were common in the cable industry  
Then  last August  Viacom asked a U S  District Court to void the carriage agreement  arguing that the deal was a  complete sham   At the time  Viacom threatened to pull other top networks including  MTV  Nickelodeon and BET from Cablevision s system  which services approximately three million subscribers nationwide  
 We are pleased to have put these matters behind us in ways that benefit both of our companies and look forward to working together to benefit Cablevision s customers   the companies said in a joint statement  
Details of the agreement were not disclosed  
Cablevision was under pressure to come to terms on an agreement  after it was acquired by European telecommunications company Altice last month for  34 90 a share  The  17 7 billion deal  including debt  created the fourth largest cable company in the U S  
 The strategy of Altice in the large and highly strategic US market is reinforced with the acquisition of Cablevision   Altice president Patrick Drahi said in a statement last month   We will be in a stronger position  as in all other markets in which we operate  to deliver the best services  invest in the most advanced technology  and develop innovative products for the benefit of our customers  
Cablevision is a leading cable provider in the New York City metropolitan area  which encompasses parts of New York  Connecticut and New Jersey   one of the most attractive cable markets in the U S  
 We believe that Patrick Drahi and Altice will be truly worthy successors  and we look forward to doing all we can to affect this transition for our customers and employees   Cablevision CEO James Dolan said following the announcement of the deal   We expect that Cablevision will be in excellent hands

200573,422089,VIAC,Here s Why You Should Hold World Wrestling Entertainment Now,opinion,"World Wrestling Entertainment  Inc    NYSE WWE   banks on subscriber growth  rise in TV rights fees and strategic initiatives  Though these positives instil optimism  factors like declining revenues at home entertainment and highly competitive market of entertainment video raise concerns  Further  with WrestleMania 34 around the corner  investors are treading cautiously as the stock has failed to perform post the show  Though  the stock has returned 18 3  in the past three months  outperforming the  s gain of 2 7   it has declined 4 4  in a month 
Hidden Catalyst
We believe that WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended previous deal with different companies but also signed agreement with new service providers for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries  In fact  the company s 2016 and 2017 revenues of  729 and  801 million not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also jumped 10 7  and 9 8   respectively  The company s record revenues primarily came on the back of a substantial increase in revenues in North America  Europe Middle East Africa  EMEA  and gain in WWE Network s total subscriber base 
Revenues from international sponsorship surged in 2017  courtesy of the addition of blue chip advertisers such as KFC  Nestl   AT T  NYSE T  and other gaming partners  Moreover  in an effort to boost revenues  WWE has reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagard re Sports that will facilitate it to acquire international sponsorship 
In the long haul  the company will continue to bank on its content distribution agreement  Recently  the company stated that distribution agreement  which generated a large chunk of television rights revenues  will expire in 2019 in some regions  Licensing of Raw and SmackDown in the United States will terminate in Sep 30  2019  while in the UK and India it will expire on Dec 31  2019  The company is looking to renew the distribution agreement in these regions somewhere between May 2018 and first half 2019 
After posting robust adjusted OBIDA growth in 2017  management is optimistic about witnessing another great year of OIBDA growth  In this regard  the company is targeting adjusted OIBDA of at least  115 million in 2018  Moreover  excluding stock based compensation expenses  WWE projects adjusted OIBDA to be at least  140 million in 2018 

Hurdles
WWE  which distributes home entertainment content in both physical  DVD and Blu Ray  as well as digital formats  has been witnessing decline in revenues  In 2016  home entertainment net revenues came in at  13 1 million  down from  13 4 million and  27 3 million in 2015 and 2014  respectively  Further  the trend continued in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of 2017  with home entertainment revenues declining 27   3 2   8  and 79   respectively 
With WrestleMania 34  to be held on Apr 8  2018  at the Mercedes Benz Superdome in New Orleans  The success of this event was earlier decided on the pay per views  PPV  for the show  as this was the most important source of revenue generation  The company has been broadcasting PPV since the 1980s with WrestleMania considered as the longest running PPV event  However  with the launch of WWE Network there has been a sharp decline in PPV revenues  which is a major concern for the company 
Mega event like WrestleMania is considered the Super Bowl of Sports Entertainment  Looking back  we note that WWE has not achieved its projected targets  Despite the hype  the stock has witnessed declines of 1 7   4 3   14 7  and 14 7  post the WrestleMania 33  32  31 and 30  respectively

200575,422091,VIAC,A Fox Time Warner deal would give Murdoch new heft in China,news,"By Ronald Grover  Reuters    Rupert Murdoch s plan to buy Time Warner would help the Twenty First Century Fox chairman make larger inroads in China  a fast growing market that media moguls are finding hard to crack 
Time Warner s board rejected Murdoch s  80 billion offer  but the Fox chairman is expected to continue the chase 
A deal would create a giant with more than  37 billion a year in revenues in the United States and Canada  It would also nearly double the revenues Fox generates from the emerging media markets in Latin America and Asia Pacific 
 He sees 3 billion new consumers coming into the market and a rising middle class in China and India  and mobile devices and strong demand for content   said Mario Gabelli  the CEO of GAMCO Investors  in an interview with Reuters Insider   He s going to be able to create Netflixes of his own  
Gabelli owns shares of both Fox and Time Warner 
Last year  Fox generated 42 percent of its revenue outside the United States and Canada  The company s Asian revenues  including those in Japan and China  grew by 40 percent  to  2 1 billion  over two years 
Time Warner s collection of cable channels would compliment Fox s programming in key territories 
In Latin America  where Fox faces off against large local players  Time Warner s Turner unit operates Chilevision  a large broadcaster in Chile  and also shows its TNT entertainment channel  Cartoon Network and locally tailored regional channels such as the kids channel Tooncast 
Turner offers three well regarded channels in India  POGO  Cartoonito and Toonami  which could help Murdoch s Indian programming behemoth Star India  which broadcasts 44 channels in seven languages 
HBO would likely be Fox s big draw in foreign markets  The pay channel  with a history of hit programs such as  The Sopranos   has around 84 million subscribers outside the United States  beaming its shows into more than 70 countries  and sells programming from HBO and Cinemax into 150 countries 
In China  with Time Warner in the fold  Murdoch would be able to focus more squarely on profiting from what movies and TV shows the government allows 
In January  he sold Fox s 47 percent stake in Star China TV  which owns three 24 hour Mandarin channels  and in October sold off Fox s remaining stake in Chinese TV company Phoenix Satellite Television  These move come in the face of restrictions on foreign ownership of China media assets 
 Murdoch is not unique  The Chinese government says   We cannot let these people control our media    said William Yu  an economist at UCLA s Anderson School of Management  who focuses on emerging Asian economies 
A Fox spokesman had no comment  In recent earnings calls and conferences  Fox President Chase Carey has stressed the company s strategy of selling off assets it couldn t own 
 Long term  I still think that you ultimately want to either own and operate or monetize   he said at a UBS media conference in December 
Doug Young  a professor at Fudan University Journalism School  cautioned against overestimating the potential in China   Taking two studios and combining  you ll get a company with twice as many growth prospects in China  but in terms of either having many assets in China  it s just a market for licensing and selling   he said 
Still  the China potential is alluring  Consulting and audit firm EY estimates revenue from China s media and entertainment industry will reach  138 billion by 2015  from  59 billion in 2010  The country already has embraced streaming video and EY sees advertising revenue jumping 
Its mobile web users  the most in the world  are expected to hit 750 million by 2017  according to data from China based consultancy iResearch 
Currently  China limits to 34 the total number of movies foreign companies can import  China s box office last year grew 27 percent  to  3 6 billion  second only to the  10 9 billion million U S  market 
 Transformers  Age of Extinction   a movie distributed by Viacom s Paramount studio  has so far sold more tickets in China than the United States 
With its muscular films such as the  Harry Potter  and  Lord of the Rings  fantasy franchises  Time Warner s Warner Brothers studio gets frequent quota approval 
 China is a great market and we ve all wanted to be there for years   said former Viacom president Frank Biondi  one of the first U S  media executives to visit the country   But for all the upside  there s the obvious downside that the government controls everything   what gets put into movie theaters  what s put on TV  
A merger would allow Murdoch to use the Warner Brothers studio to claim more quota slots  In 2013  seven Warner Brothers films were granted a release in Chinese theaters  and six for Fox  according to Box Office Mojo 

Fox s Hollywood studio last year produced 14 movies  to Warner Brothers  25 films  Fox has also agreed to co produce five Chinese language films with Chinese studio Bona Film Group 
Warner s movies generated  155 9 million from three of its films that ranked in China s top 20 last year  including  Gravity  and  Man of Steel   Fox s three films in the top 20  including  The Wolverine   generated  80 million  according to Box Office Mojo 
A few of Time Warner s Cartoon Network shows appear on the state owned China Central Television  and its HBO pay channel provides a five hour block of programming as well  HBO s offering included a censored version of its fantasy hit  Game of Thrones  
 It s a huge opportunity   said former Paramount President Sid Ganis  whose Jiaflix company advises movie companies in China   and media companies are only now beginning to figure the market out

200612,422128,VIAC,Is Viacom  VIAB  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Viacom Inc    NASDAQ VIAB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Viacom has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of just 9 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 3  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Viacom s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  although the number has been rising over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Media Conglomerates industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Viacom has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 14  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Viacom stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Viacom has a P S ratio of just 1 1  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 1 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  VIAB is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  Viacom s P CF ratio of 2 3 is also lower than the Zacks classified Media Conglomerate industry average of 7 1  which indicates that the stock is undervalued in this respect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Viacom currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Viacom a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Viacom might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives VIAB a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has not seen any estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven up and two down in the same time period This has lowered the current quarter consensus estimate by 5 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has remained stable  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Viacom Inc  Price and Consensus
    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineViacom is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 30  compared to over 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend                   Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy   Last year  it was generating  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early ",2017-06-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-viacom-(viab)-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200193983,200193983

economy under recovery Spending on media continues to shift from traditional to digital products and services at an overwhelming pace  In general  digital advertising rates are comparatively lower

200666,422182,VIAC,Entry Chances For Stocks In Downtrend,opinion,"Continental  DE CONG  
The leading international tire manufacturer  Continental  is suffering under the Brexit decision just as much as many other values are too  However  this value has been in a corrective downtrend for some time now 
Nevertheless  in the chart we can still see a large uptrend  whose lower end of the correction zone is where the price is currently located  This trend is still young enough to be able to push onwards 
To do so  however  it must not leave the correction zone downwards by means of a closing price  It will be interesting to see whether there are enough buyers for this  If this should be the case  an excellent long chance will be available 
Viacom  NASDAQ VIAB  
The global entertainment company Viacom is also having to adapt to the generally bad stock exchange environment  and has been in a large downtrend for a very long time now  The last low dates back to February 10th  and is located at  30 11 
The value has been able to move into its last correction zone since that low   by means of a subordinate trend   but has been showing clear signs of weakness for several days now  This means that we can expect this trend to continue on downwards once again 
Fresenius Medical  DE FMEG  
Fresenius Medical Care is a leading worldwide provider of products and services for dialysis technology  a treatment of chronic kidney failure  The current trend itself almost failed in the small trend size  since the green correction zone could only narrowly be defended 
As long as we do not see a closing price beneath this zone  the trend can continue again  In this case  a good entry chance is currently available 
Twitter  NYSE TWTR  
The short message service Twitter has also seen better days  Since its high in December 2013 at around  75  the price has generally only known one direction  and that was pointing towards the south  Interim recoveries were sold off again after some time  The last low from May 2016 is located at  13 90  the correction zone reaches from  15 33 up to  17 98 on the upper side 
The current correction led the price to  17 07  and now the trend seems to want to continue on downwards  With this  there is a nice short chance in the trend direction  Since the superior trend has already gone very far  however  the first target should be located right at the last low

200680,422196,VIAC,Twitter s Latest Moves Won t Save The Stock,opinion,"Social media darling turned dog  Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR   is making  major  headlines this week 
According to a   the company is preparing  a major shift in how it counts characters in Tweets  
No longer will Twitter count photos and links as part of its 140 character limit for messages  The change is expected to go into effect in as little as two weeks 
I know  try to contain your excitement 
The company is also making headlines for appointing a new director to its board   the third appointment in the last two months  mind you 
This time  Twitter has selected Debra L  Lee  the CEO of Viacom B Inc  NASDAQ VIAB  owned Black Entertainment Television 
So what s the big deal here 
I m afraid there isn t one 
And beware   because any stock rally on the latest news promises to be short lived  Here s why 
It s Time to Innovate or Die
Ever since returning to Twitter in October 2015  part time CEO Jack Dorsey has talked about making  to re energize user growth 
We re still waiting 
And with the stock down a portfolio crushing 50  since his return  it s fair to say that it s now time to innovate or die for Dorsey 
And this   loosening up the character limit by about 23 characters   is the best he could come up with 
Cue Ray Charles   Hit the road Jack and don t cha come back no more  no more  no more  no more  
Seriously 
As I explained on CNBC s Closing Bell earlier this week  this latest change merely eliminates an annoyance on Twitter   but does nothing to make the platform more appealing 
Less Is More
Frankly  easing character limits to any degree is a terrible idea anyway  After all  the limit is what sets Twitter apart from the competition 
It forces users to be pithy   a trait Mark Twain acknowledged as desirable long ago when he said   If I had more time  I would have written a shorter letter  
No one wants to read long winded diatribes or James Joyce esque stream of consciousness narratives 
Case in point  Earlier this year  Twitter was reportedly considering raising the character limit to a staggering 10 000 
Protests ensued over fears that a verbal diarrhea epidemic would overrun the platform  which thankfully prompted management to scrap the proposed change 
If Twitter is going to re invent itself  it needs to do so in ways that are appealing to more users  not repellent 
That s where a strong board of directors comes in  right  Not so much 
Better Board   Better Product 
As I mentioned  the other  big  news from Twitter this week is the appointment of another independent director to the board in Debra Lee 
Now  I m not diminishing the significance of Lee s addition  Twitter is actually lucky to have her on board  She s incredibly qualified  having enjoyed success in the C suite at an entertainment company for twice as long as Twitter s been in existence 
She s also the first African American on Twitter s board  Corporate America   and the tech sector in particular   is in serious need of more diversity 
For instance  only 9  of directors at the 200 largest S P 500 companies are African American   well below the overall percentage of the U S  population that s African American 
My issue with Lee s appointment is the company s false belief that a better board will solve Twitter s problems 
Twitter s got a product problem 
As I ve shared before   Mom  dad  even grandma understand Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  But they don t have a clue   
And better boards don t make better products 
So the appointment is really a non event in terms of improving the company s underlying fundamentals and  in turn  the stock s investment appeal 
So what will do the trick 
Time s Up for Twitter
 We think only significant product improvements could re ignite growth  which has virtually stalled domestically and has slowed to a crawl internationally   says MKM Partners  Rob Sanderson 
The clock is ticking  though 
With each passing day that Twitter fails to come up with any meaningful innovations  the company s mass market potential diminishes 
Like Sanderson  I believe an investment in Twitter involves taking on  significant execution risk  and the possibility of a  network collapse  ",2016-05-19,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/twitter’s-latest-moves-won’t-save-the-stock-200130851,200130851
