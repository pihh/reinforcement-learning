Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood morning  ladies and gentlemen  and welcome to the C H  Robinson Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call   Operator Instructions  Following today s presentation  Bob Houghton will facilitate a review of previously submitted questions   Operator Instructions  I would now like to turn the conference over to Bob Houghton  Vice President of Investor Relations Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThank you  Dawn  and good morning  everyone  On our call today will be Bob Biesterfeld  our Chief Executive Officer  and Mike Zechmeister  our Chief Financial Officer  Bob and Mike will provide commentary on our 2019 fourth quarter results  Presentation slides that accompany their remarks can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson com  We will follow their comments with responses to the pre submitted questions we received after our earnings release yesterday  I d like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward looking statements  Slide two in today s presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management s expectations And with that  I will turn the call over to Bob Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Bob  and good morning  everyone  I ll get right to the point this morning  Our net revenues  our operating margins and our earnings per share all finished well our long term targets  We ve been facing some rather extreme  if not unprecedented  cyclical changes in our North American trucking market  one year ago  we were experiencing near record net revenue dollars per shipment and double digit total company net revenue growth  This was followed by a period of rapid price declines  driven by excess capacity and weak demand  The resulting net revenue reported for fourth quarter of 2019 seems another stark contrast to the results of a year ago  Higher operating expenses for the quarter  including increased investments in Information Technology  magnified this effect  Mike will provide more context on our operating expenses in the prepared remarks  To be clear  our fourth quarter results do not reflect our performance expectations going forward We are committed to our investments in technology  even during more challenging periods in the freight side  Our investments this quarter led to operating margins below the low end of our historical fourth quarter averages  We re not immune to large swings in the freight market  but we believe our continued advancements through cycles will align the net revenue growth and the operating cost needed to drive operating margin expansion over the long term  We will continue our focus on cost controls with our target of eliminating  100 million in operating costs over the next three years  So as we move through mid 2020  we expect our operating margins will begin to improve  Despite results below our long term expectations  I do believe that we took some really important steps in the fourth quarter  We continue to adjust our pricing in order to optimize our results  Our fourth quarter decline in truckload net revenue per shipment was largely anticipated as the fourth quarter of 2018 benefited from contractual pricing in a rapidly falling cost environment  resulting in the highest quarterly truckload net revenue per shipment in the last decade On an absolute basis  our fourth quarter truckload net revenue per shipment was very much in line with levels experienced during the balanced freight markets in both 2016 and 2017  Pricing adjustments to reflect the current market helped enable us to deliver flat volume in mass truckload  including a mid single digit increase in contractual volume and 4 5  volume growth in LTL  These are healthy market share gains in a quarter where volumes  as measured by the Cass Freight Index  declined approximately 6   Our truckload volume trends improved further in January  increasing approximately 6   We re starting to see our increased investments in technology drive operating efficiency in our business  including a 330 basis point favorable spread between truckload volume growth and headcount growth in our NAST business  We continue to deliver industry leading operating margins in the quarter and returned  137 million to our shareholders through a combination of share buybacks and dividends  We generated  212 million in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter  And for the full year  we generated operating cash flow of  835 million  an all time high During the quarter  our teams continued to excel in the areas that we can control  including another quarter of increased win rates on contractual bids in our truckload and LTL service lines and increased awards with our largest customers  while we continue to provide the excellent customer service and innovation that our customers have come to expect from C H  Robinson  I m particularly proud of the results we delivered to our customers and carriers and the efforts of our employees to continue to provide supply chain expertise that brings capacity solutions to life for our customers and secure freight and optimize routing for our carriers  Yesterday  we announced the acquisition of Prime Distribution Services  a leading provider of retail consolidation services in North America  We re excited about the scale and the value added warehouse capabilities that Prime will bring to our existing retail consolidation platform  Prime is a strong leadership team that s experienced in retail consolidation and warehouse operations  and we re thrilled to bring the employees  the customers and the carriers of Prime to C H  Robinson With those introductory remarks  I ll now turn the call over to Mike to review our financial performance Mike Zechmeister    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Bob  and good morning  everyone  Slide four shows our Q4 income statement summary  Fourth quarter total gross revenues decreased 8 3   driven primarily by lower pricing across most transportation services due to the continued soft demand in excess capacity that Bob referenced earlier  Total company net revenues decreased 18 9  in the quarter  led by margin compression in our truckload service line  Q4 monthly net revenues per business day were down 16  in October  down 13  in November and down 27  in December when compared to the same periods last year  The net revenue deterioration in December was driven by performance in the final two weeks of the month  where the major holidays fell in the middle of both weeks  leading to a more pronounced decline in commercial activity Total Q4 operating income was down 46 5  over last year  Operating margin declined to 1 220 basis points compared to Q4 last year when margins were the highest we had seen in 8 quarters  The decline was driven by the drop in net revenue dollars and increased SG A expenses  The largest contributors to the SG A expense increase were increased technology spend in purchased services related to accelerating our growth and cost savings initiatives  Within the SG A expense in Q4 were approximately  10 million that we would not expect to be ongoing expense  Diluted earnings per share was  0 73 in Q4  down 45 5  from Q4 last year  Slide five covers other highlights impacting net income  The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 21 4   an improvement of approximately 250 basis points from the 23 9  rate in Q4 last year  The lower effective tax rate included a benefit of  3 2 million from onetime items  driven primarily by a return to provision true up in Mexico  In Q4  we removed our assertion to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries  which is consistent with our change in intent and strategy to repatriate cash in an economically efficient manner The resulting increase in income tax expense was almost entirely offset by foreign tax credits  Looking ahead  we expect our 2020 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 22  to 24   Fourth quarter interest and other expense totaled  10 8 million  up from  9 5 million in Q4 last year  Interest and other expense includes the impact of currency revaluation  primarily related to the conversion of working capital and cash balances to the functional currency in each country where those investments reside  Q4 this year included a  0 9 million unfavorable impact from currency revaluation compared to Q4 last year that included a  2 4 million gain from currency revaluation  Q4 interest expense declined by  1 6 million  driven primarily by overall debt reduction  Average diluted shares outstanding were down 1 8   primarily due to  67 4 million in share repurchases in Q4  Turning to slide six  Cash flow from operations declined to 19 9  versus Q4 last year due primarily to decreased earnings and partially offset by improved working capital  Q4 capital expenditures totaled  19 5 million  which brings full year capital expenditures to  70 5 million We expect 2020 full year capital expenditures to be between  60 million and  70 million  with spending primarily dedicated to technology  Consistent with our previous announcement  we are planning to invest at least  200 million in total technology spending in 2020  In Q4  we returned approximately  137 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends  which represents an 18 5  decrease versus Q4 last year  We have nearly 10 million shares remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and intend to opportunistically repurchase shares to enhance shareholder value  Now on to some balance sheet highlights on slide seven  Fourth quarter working capital decreased 17 2  versus the prior year  driven by the decline in net revenues  Our debt balance at quarter end was  1 24 billion  down approximately  111 million versus the end of Q4 last year  and our weighted average interest rate was 4 1  in the quarter compared to 4  in Q4 last year As Bob mentioned  we are excited about the Prime Distribution Services acquisition and the expanded capabilities that Prime brings to Robinson  We anticipate the acquisition to close by the end of Q1 and plan to finance the acquisition with cash and existing committed financing  While we expect this acquisition to be slightly accretive to EPS in 2020  we would not expect it to have a direct or meaningful impact on the level of share repurchases  I will wrap up my comments this morning with a look at our volume and net revenue trends in January  While our January truckload volume trends have improved over Q4 levels  the combination of soft demand and excess capacity is keeping pricing well below year ago levels  January total company net revenues per business day are down approximately 18   However  net truckload volume is up approximately 6  versus January last year  which would make this our highest NAST truckload volume for a January on record  For reference  in 2019  total company net revenues per business day increased 9  in both January and February and increased 13  in March Thanks for listening this morning  Now I ll turn the call back over to Bob to provide some additional context on the business and our segment performance Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Mike  I ll begin my remarks on our operating segment performance by highlighting the current state of the North America truckload market  On slide nine  the light and dark blue lines represent the percentage change in NAST truckload rate per mile billed to our customers and cost per mile paid to our contract carriers  excluding fuel costs over the current decade  During the quarter  both spot market and contractual pricing declined versus year ago levels  Price per mile billed to our customers declined 11   while cost per mile paid to our contract carriers  net of fuel  declined 7 5   The rate of cost decline moderated on a year over year basis versus the third quarter  resulting in net revenue margin compression in the fourth quarter  We do accept that managing cyclicality  price variations and margin compression in the marketplace is a big part of the 3PL value proposition  particularly with our committed relationships  Since 2010  the average price and cost  net of fuel  have each increased approximately 3  annually So with all the ups and downs  truckload pricing has been more inflationary than the broader U S  economy  Our fourth quarter results reflect a shift to contractual volume that is typical for us in a declining price and cost environment  resulting in an approximate mix of 70  contractual and 30  transactional volume in the quarter versus a 65  35  mix in the year ago period  As we ve stated before  one of the metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth of tender from our managed services business  which represents just over  4 billion in freight under management  Average routing guide depth of tender was 1 2 for the fourth consecutive quarter  representing that  on average  the first carrier in a shipper s routing guide was executing the shipment in most cases  This route guide depth remains near the lowest levels we ve experienced this decade  and contractual routing guides continue to operate with first tender acceptance rates in the high 90  range  Our pricing continues to reflect current market conditions as we work to ensure we re near the top of the route guide headed into 2020 Turning to slide 10 in our North American Surface Transportation business  Fourth quarter NAST net revenues decreased 23 2   driven primarily by the decline in truckload  Our fourth quarter combined truckload and LTL volumes outpaced year over year changes in the Cass Freight Index for the fourth consecutive quarter  Truckload net revenues decreased 29 6  in the quarter  driven by margin compression  As I mentioned earlier  our pricing to customers resulted in lower margins when compared to last year s fourth quarter  These were not  however  the lowest truckload margins we ve seen  but the 29  decline in truckload net revenue per shipment in the quarter is the highest year over year decline we ve seen in the past decade  We anticipate facing net revenue per load headwinds throughout the first half of 2020  given the historically high comparables in 2019  Fourth quarter NAST truckload volume was approximately flat versus last year  Our fourth quarter truckload contractual volume increased at mid single digit pace  Through evaluating our performance on annual truckload bids  where pricing was completed in the fourth quarter  our win rates nearly doubled when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 This solid performance in contractual volumes was offset by a double digit decline in spot market volumes  reflecting the continued softness in the transactional portion of the freight market  During the quarter  we added roughly 3 800 new truckload carriers to our network  which represents a 21  decrease over last year s fourth quarter and a 14  decline sequentially compared to the third quarter of this year  We see this as a clear sign that carriers continue to exit the marketplace  LTL net revenues decreased 3 4   driven by margin compression  LTL volumes increased 4 5  in the fourth quarter  led by growth in new customers  In our intermodal service line  net revenues decreased 3 1  for the quarter  Slide 11 outlines our NAST operating income performance  Fourth quarter operating income decreased 43 3   while operating margin of 33 4  decreased 1 180 basis points  driven by the net revenue decline  partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense in the quarter  NAST average headcount decreased 3 3  for the quarter  and NAST ending headcount is down 5  year over year for the full year Slide 12 highlights our Global Forwarding performance  Fourth quarter Global Forwarding net revenues were down 9 6   Our acquisition of The Space Cargo Group contributed three percentage points of net revenue growth in the fourth quarter  In our ocean service line  net revenues were down 10 6  in the quarter  driven by lower pricing  Space Cargo contributed two percentage points of net revenue growth  Ocean volumes were down 1 5  in the quarter  and fourth quarter air net revenues decreased 12 8   driven by a 7 5  decline in shipments and lower pricing  Space Cargo contributed six percentage points of net revenue growth  Fourth quarter results in both ocean and air were negatively impacted by reduced industry demand due to tariff uncertainty in our highest volume trade lanes from China to the U S  2019 Q4 growth rates were also negatively impacted by comparisons to the year ago period that included shipments to build inventory ahead of tariffs enacted in the first quarter of 2019  Customs net revenue decreased 3 5  in the fourth quarter  driven primarily by lower pricing and a 1  decrease in customs transactions Space Cargo contributed one percentage point to the net revenue growth in the quarter  Slide 13 outlines our Global Forwarding operating income performance  Fourth quarter operating income decreased 49 5   Operating margin of 11 7  decreased 920 basis points versus last year  driven primarily by lower net revenues and higher SG A expenses  which was partially offset by lower variable compensation  Average headcount increased 3 4  for the quarter  Excluding the headcount impact of Space Cargo  our Global Forwarding headcount was flat for the quarter  Over time  we expect to deliver operating margin expansion through the combination of volume growth that exceeds our headcount growth and investments in technology to drive efficiency  Moving to our All Other and Corporate segment on slide 14  As a reminder  All Other includes Robinson Fresh  Managed Services and Surface Transportation outside of North America as well as other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses  Fourth quarter Robinson Fresh net revenues were down 15 2  versus last year  primarily due to changes in business mix and lower restaurant traffic at several key food service customers Case volumes declined 6  in the quarter  Robinson Fresh did generate 630 basis points of operating margin expansion in the quarter  driven by a decline in personnel and service center related expenses  Fourth quarter managed services net revenues increased 5 2   driven by a combination of new customer wins and selling additional services to existing customers  Managed services operating margin expanded 110 basis points on the quarter  Other Surface Transportation net revenues declined 0 6  in the quarter  driven by truckload margin compression in Europe  partially offset by an 11  increase in European truckload volume  The acquisition of Dema Service added about nine percentage points of net revenue growth for the quarter  On slide 15  I m going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a few comments on our go forward expectations  With the cost of purchase transportation and truckload still below year ago levels and continued softness in spot market freight opportunities  North American routing guides are resetting at lower prices versus last year  and this is a trend that we expect to continue On a sequential basis  fourth quarter truckload pricing and costs were relatively unchanged  and we expect pricing to remain relatively flat sequentially over the next couple of quarters  In our truckload business  we continue to expect net revenue dollars per shipment to remain below year ago levels through the first half of 2020  And in Global Forwarding  concerns regarding tariffs and fears of recession continued to impact shipper demand  As I said in my opening remarks  our fourth quarter results are below our long term targets  With that said  I am confident that we re taking steps to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of our customers  our carriers and our employees  while we generate strong returns for our shareholders over the long term horizon  We ve reset our pricing to be more competitive with current marketplace conditions  which is driving market share gains in our truckload and LTL service lines We re leveraging our increased investments in technology to drive increased employee productivity and in order to bring innovation to our customers and to our carriers  The level of automated truckload carrier bookings doubled and automated customer orders increased by five percentage points versus the first quarter of 2019  We are rapidly increasing the occurrence of fully automated bookings in our largest service line  With the continued focus on lowering our cost to serve and our cost to sell  we do expect to deliver  100 million in operating expense reduction across the enterprise over the next three years  These initiatives will leverage our technology investments to further optimize our network and business operations  while  at the same time  continuing to expand the benefits and the services that we provide to our customers and our carriers  And with nearly 10 million shares still outstanding on our share repurchase authorization  we will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares to create value for our shareholders Regardless of the freight environment  we believe that executing over 18 million shipments a year and having visibility to roughly  100 billion in annual freight spend give C H  Robinson an information advantage that creates better outcomes for the nearly 200 000 companies that conduct business on our global platform and provides more rewarding career opportunities for our employees  We remain firmly committed to leveraging our technology that s built by and for supply chain experts to deliver smarter solutions for our customers and our carriers  We are also firmly committed to the focus areas for our investors  including generating market share gains across all of our services  leveraging our technology investments to reduce our cost to sell and cost to serve  while continuing to deliver industry leading levels of service and delivering operating margin expansion over time  Finally  I continue to be very proud of our team  and I want to thank them for their efforts that ensure the continued success of our company That concludes our prepared comments  And with that  I ll turn it back to the operator so that we can answer the submitted questions Questions and Answers OperatorMr  Houghton  the floor is yours for the Q A session Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThank you  Donna  First  I would like to thank the many analysts and investors for taking the time to submit questions after our earnings release yesterday  For today s Q A session  I will frame a question and then turn it over to Bob or Mike for a response  Our first question for Bob comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays  Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley asked a similar question  While potentially coincidental  the timing of C H  Robinson s recent material revenue declines have occurred as technology focused brokerage platforms from both industry participants and new entrants have increased investments and doubled down on share gaining strategy  Should long term C H  Robinson shareholders be concerned by the apparently rapid changing competitive landscape in truck brokerage markets Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Bob  So what we experienced in fourth quarter was really unprecedented in terms of year over year declines in truckload net revenue per load  which really isn t that surprising given the changes that we ve seen in the overall market pricing dynamics that occurred in the past couple of years  As we look back  starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2018  we saw price increases in the market at really unprecedented levels  And then we saw this pivot in the market and then prices dropped faster than we ve ever seen in the past decade  And really all this volatility in the market pricing dynamics has driven a lot of volatility in profit per load  which we re clearly in the middle of right now  Our fourth quarter net revenue per load was at the highest that we ve seen in over a decade  And that comparison alone makes this quarter s results look really stark in comparison So with that as a backdrop  I do want to come back to the direct question on the impact of competition and profitability  So in order to really peel this back  I think it makes sense to boil things down to what is really the lowest absolute common denominator  And in the case of our truckload business  it s easy to look at this in terms of the net revenue that we earn on a per mile basis  and then look at that compared to points in the past where the market conditions may be fairly similar  So as an example  in the 16 quarters  from the beginning of 2010 through 2013  the market was largely considered balanced  The routing guide metrics that we always report on showed an average about 1 4 on depth of tender  I d also call attention to 2016 and 2017  Again  relatively balanced markets  with the exception of the uptick at the end of Q4 of  17  when the market started to heat up a little bit Routing guides at that time ranged between 1 3 to 1 6  again  relatively balanced markets  If you look at the average net revenue per mile that C H  Robinson earned during those 24 quarters of similar market conditions  it is nearly the same net revenue per mile that we earned in the fourth quarter of 2019  So we know that the competitive landscape was very different in 2010  in 2013 and in 2016 than it is today in terms of both the companies that are involved and the increased focus on technology  And it s clear that supply chains have continued to shift and evolve  But really  when you boil it all down to that number of how many cents does C H  Robinson earned for the value that we create in similar markets  it lands on virtually the same number Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital  Dave Vernon from Bernstein and Tom Wadewitz with UBS asked a similar question  Mike  the crux of the fourth quarter miss was related to unusually large SG A spend  Can you please break out how much of the spend increase was related to technology investment  how much to other items  unusual or not  And what this level of SG A spend should be in 2020 Mike Zechmeister    Chief Financial OfficerYes  sure  As you know  core to our strategy is our commitment to technology investments of  1 billion over the next five years  Of the  24 million increase in SG A versus Q4 last year  approximately 1 3 of that increase was related to external technology investments  and we expect to continue to spend that in the near term  There were also purchased services related to accelerating our growth and cost savings initiatives over the next three years that will help us bring speed and quality to the implementation of those initiatives  And as I mentioned  we also had approximately  10 million of SG A expense in the quarter that we would not expect to be ongoing expense Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question for Bob comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W  Baird  Bruce Chan from Stifel asked a similar question  Noting the language of management s expectations for margin improvement over time  do you view the announced  100 million cost reduction initiative as incremental to your efforts to deliver NAST operating leverage  Or more as an offset to the magnitude of the pressure facing the truckload brokerage industry at the moment  Also  is that a net number relative to the 2019 run rate Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerSo as Mike said  most of the  100 million target is an output of the work that has been ongoing within NAST  But each of the business units across the enterprise and the shared services have goals and targets around achieving this  100 million in cost reduction as part of our transformation  For NAST  this isn t as much of a new initiative as it is really cementing some of the early stage targets around that transformation of the business through both the digitalization of internal processes and driving greater efficiency to our workforce and to interact with our trading partners  And you saw some examples of this come to life of it in the fourth quarter  But we do anticipate that the impact will continue to grow throughout 2020  and we do intend to achieve portions of this  100 million in savings this year  For the enterprise  we don t intend to amend or adjust our long term growth targets that have been previously shared based upon the announcement of this initiative Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is for Bob  and it s from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan  Has it become more challenging to grow market share in a down freight market compared to prior cycles  And what has structurally changed  Will the level of margin compression in January persist in the first half of 2020 Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerSo as you know  our truckload volume was down about 1 5  on a year over year basis for the full year of 2019  and we didn t finish the fourth quarter at a flat growth rate  While we were expecting to grow volume over the course of the past year  we did find it challenging to do so  We feel good about the fact that we outperformed the broader Cass Freight Volume index in each of those quarters  however  And structurally  I think that the biggest change in 2019 was really due to the rapid changes in the markets that preceded 2019  And if I put myself in the seat of our shipper customers  they went from managing failing routing guides at increased costs throughout the end of 2017 through most of 2018  where routing guide depth of tender was averaging two or more  And then they encountered a rapidly declining cost environment where routing guides were operating almost flawlessly with high 90  acceptance rates at lower costs than they d experienced the year before So there really wasn t a lot of motivations for shippers to diverge from their plans in 2019  And given that the spot market was really minimal  it was difficult to take share throughout the course of the year if you missed on the initial contractual bids  Now that we re deeper into the 2020 annual bid season  we feel really good about the award levels that we re receiving from our contractual customers  And I think our initial volume growth in January is a good start to the year  and it s our    it s a testament to our ability to effectively grow volume and take share  In terms of the margin compression  we know that we ve got comparables in the first half of the year that are higher than our current run rate of net revenue per load and are above our historical averages  So we anticipate a headwind as we head through the first half of the year  but it will ease as the year progresses Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is from several analysts  Mike  please discuss the cadence of the 3 year  100 million cost reduction initiative  How much of this will be realized in 2020  And please provide some context as to what line items you would expect the cost savings to show up in Mike Zechmeister    Chief Financial OfficerWith our enterprise focus on growth and cost savings over the next three years  we have dedicated resources going after a variety of specific projects focused on growth  improving customer experience and gaining efficiency on the business  The cost savings portion is  100 million of reduction by the end of 2022  The majority of that benefit will come to NAST and be realized through projects designed to enhance efficiency  including targeted automation  We d expect about 1 3 of that  100 million benefit to be realized in 2020 Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays  Ken Hoexter with Bank of America asked a similar question  Bob  the 18  decline in net revenue per day in January  relative to 6  volume growth  seems to indicate a significant reduction in pricing power in the core brokerage business  Is this the case  And what can be done to reverse a material decline in net revenue Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerI don t really think that the net revenue per day are more accurately  net revenue per load indicates really anything relative to pricing power  I mean  our net revenue on a per load basis is really a derivative of how we sell and what we re able to capture in the marketplace from our customers and how we purchase transportation  As we have said  we serve a really highly fragmented and a highly cyclical market  And while we re the largest in the industry  we still only touch less than 3  of the overall  For Hire  marketplace  I look across the landscape and see 250 000 motor carriers and over one million trucks on the road  over 15 000 brokers and literally millions of shippers in the addressable market  no one party has the power to control the market pricing dynamics  If we look at the cost side of things and we compare our cost of purchase transportation and where that falls related to some of the benchmarks that we look  we index really consistently over time  And as I said  our net revenue on a per mile basis is consistent with the past points in time with similar market conditions Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question for Bob is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer  Please contrast the level of technology investments expected in 2020 versus 2019 and how they may impact NAST operating efficiency and headcount Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerTechnology investments in 2020 are really going to be at similar levels as to what we saw in 2019 for the enterprise without any real meaningful adjustments up or down by business unit  I think the    one of the positive things that I would say is that since we d launched this increased investment in technology  I would expect that the value creation from those dollars begins to accelerate  So while the investment dollars may be the same on a year on year basis  the output of that investment should continue to increase and compound as we go through 2020 and beyond  as we continue to release new features and functionality that bring new capabilities to life  both internally and for our customers and our carriers The benefits of these technology improvements and investments  coupled with the work that s happening around the network to really reengineer workflows and continue to transform the actual footprint of the network  will add additional capacity and productivity to our team within NAST and will allow our people to be more productive  I think that my messaging around this topic has been pretty consistent over the past couple of years  And I still think that the most obvious proof point is the further decoupling of headcount and volume  and we anticipate delivering really meaningful results against this over the course of 2020 Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens for Mike  Given the strength of your balance sheet and cash flows  could you look to get more aggressive with your capital allocation strategy in 2020  Would you look to increase your 90  of net income targeted for shareholder returns going forward Mike Zechmeister    Chief Financial OfficerWe re always looking to deploy our capital in ways that maximize shareholder value through investments with high risk adjusted returns  That s the case for acquisitions or investments in our business  which is our technology investments  The Prime acquisition is a great example  As I mentioned in the prepared remarks  we do not expect the Prime acquisition to have a meaningful impact on share repurchases  which is to say that the  225 million purchase price will effectively increase our net debt  We ll also continue to reward shareholders through buybacks and dividends  In the fourth quarter  we returned 138  of net income to shareholders and 104  for the full year in 2019  As we indicated  with nearly 10 million shares still outstanding on our share repurchase authorization  we have the capacity to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares to enhance shareholder value Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryOur next question is for Bob from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan  Did competition significantly affect margins and volumes and trucking during the quarter and in January  If so  was it widespread or lane or customer specific Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So let s break that into the two pieces of margin and volume  In terms of margins  I would characterize the impacts to our margins in the fourth quarter to be almost entirely cyclical  Relative to volumes in the quarter  and frankly  for the full year  there s no doubt that in some of our customer accounts  we saw volume declines on a year over year basis from  18 to  19  And it was clear that in some of those cases  there were competitors that aggressively priced business  below where we felt the actual contractual markets existed  We look at this based on our understanding of the cost of purchase transportation across the overall market  In terms of January  specifically  I think the fact that our volumes are up 6  so far in the quarter is related to the fact that  as I ve said before  in this industry  contracts reset annually across most customers Networks change for shippers  Networks change for carriers  And as we ve seen  pricing dynamics certainly shift as well on a year over year basis  And it s really for this reason that we don t believe in the idea of chasing freight  right  We don t believe in chasing freight to the bottom of the market as inevitably  prices reset annually  And the award levels change and freight is distributed to those providers that give the best and most comprehensive service  those that provide highest quality and those that have the pricing that reflects the marketplace Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is for Bob and comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc  Please discuss your view on normalized net operating margins for NAST  The 33 4  in the quarter was the lowest since you have reclassified your segment  While not looking for guidance  what do you view as normalized margin range for this segment  And over what time frame is realistic to think about achieving normalized margins Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerSo our fourth quarter results is  as I said  in NAST  do not reflect our performance expectations going forward  And they re clearly on the low end of the historical benchmarks  We re committed to our investments in technology though  I mean  in these challenging periods in the freight cycle  certainly  in the case of the fourth quarter  technology investments had a negative impact on our operating margins  which drove them toward the lower end of our historical averages  We believe in these continued investments in tech and the purchase services that we re leveraging in order to accelerate our growth and cost savings  We believe that these investments are going to set us for a much more successful long term that bring those operating margins up over time as we move through the year and into 2021  So as we move through the year  we expect operating margins are going to improve  We ll take it from there Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryOur next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs  Bob  please discuss competitive pricing dynamics in the market  And are the new entrants placing undue pressure on prices they roll out geographically Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jordan  Again  we serve this incredibly fragmented market  and it s really difficult to give a clean answer on this one  but I ll do my best  based on the information that I have on some of the examples that I ll try to cite  As an example  when we go into an annual truckload bid for a large shipper  as we did    as we do many times throughout the year  it s where we get visibility to about  100 billion in freight on an annual basis  we might go into this bid  competing with 60  70  80  maybe more carriers and 3PLs that are invited to participate in the bid  We approach every one of these contractual bids with the customers  needs in mind  first and foremost  and not necessarily what we think the competition s pricing strategy is going to be We take these bids and these opportunities to serve these customers  and we examine the characteristics of the customers  freight  We look at the service expectations that they have  We understand the seasonality of their demand  We look at the industries that they serve as well as our freight densities in and out of the markets that the customers served  along with several other variables  From there  we apply our data  we apply our process  our knowledge of the customer and the industry that they serve  along with our forecast on where we think the market and these lanes are going to move in terms of pricing  We then align that against our capacity plan for the customer as well as expected profitability over the life of the contract And from there  we boil that out    all down  and we put a service and a price proposal in front of the customer and submit that to them  We go through that process again and again and again throughout the course of the year  and given all of the variables that are in play  all of the participants that are in each one of these pricing events  it s really difficult to see any one party emerging in the supply chain that s changing pricing dynamics  As I said  we see close to  1 billion or  100 billion of truckload freight every year  And even with all that data and the insight that we garner from that  there just isn t any real correlation that can be drawn to a broad based disruption to pricing in our industry Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryTodd Fowler with Keybank asked about our acquisition of Prime Distribution Services  Scott Group with Wolfe Research and Fadi Chamoun with Bank of Montreal asked a similar question  Mike  please discuss the strategic rationale behind Prime Distribution  Is there any revenue overlap  What is the historical growth rate for this business  And what do you expect it to grow at in 2020 Mike Zechmeister    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Consolidation has been a successful value added service within our LTL business at Robinson for more than a decade  We currently have a network of over 2 9 million square feet of warehousing across U S  to service our consolidation business  Strategically  this business is important as many of our customers value our ability to provide consolidation and related services  Upon closing the Prime acquisition  we will add scale by adding 2 6 million square feet to our network of consolidation warehouses  We ll also benefit from fulfillment and distribution services as well as lane density within our truckload and LTL business  To be clear  our non asset based business model is not changing  We re also not entering into the contract logistics business  We believe the combination of our consolidation business with Prime and solid growth potential  our businesses are complementary and we re excited about the opportunity to make each other better as we move forward together Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryJordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs asked about truckload capacity  Bob  are you seeing any changes to truck capacity now  In other words  is there are any initial signs of tighter markets Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerBeyond the publicly available data that we all are looking at  we watch our rate of new carrier sign ups  which  as we said  trended down meaningfully both sequentially and on a year over year basis  Related to market tightness  the second half of January  the late part of January around the holidays    or I m sorry  the late part of December and early January  did represent some tighter markets than we ve seen in a few quarters  But as we ve gone through January  we ve really seen the market settle as the month has progressed Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is for Bob  and it comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc  Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company and Jack Atkins with Stephens asked a similar question  What are your expectations for NAST headcount in 2020  Have you reached a point where headcount can decline while volumes increased for a sustainable period Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerWe ve made a lot of progress in our NAST business in terms of reengineering and rethinking about how that business operates moving forward  And because of that  we do feel that we can grow volume in a meaningful way without needing to add additional headcount  Our focus is less on driving headcount declines as it is about widening that productivity gap between the change in headcount and the change in volume as we continue to layer in additional digitalized and automated processes for our customers  carriers and our employees Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryOur next question for Bob is from Ben Hartford with Robert W  Baird  Tom Wadewitz with UBS and Allison Landry with Credit Suisse asked a similar question  Please discuss any expectations for contract truckload pricing growth during 2020 s bid season  Is flat year over year growth on an aggregate basis realistic  Or does the magnitude of pressure in Q4 of 2019  speak to the likelihood of declines in contractual rates during the first half of 2020 Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerIf you look at the chart that we ve provided in the earnings deck and the investor deck over the past few years of really tracking the change in rate and cost over the past several years  you do see that inflection  where it starts to trend up over the past    or declined less over the past couple of quarters  so fourth quarter wasn t the bottom of the cycle  I think we certainly must be close to that  Obviously  different customers are going to experience market differently in 2020 in terms of either increases or decreases to their freight spend  depending on the characteristics of the customer  the behavior of the customer and where their pricing was set in 2019  But in a very general statement  we think that the contractual market in 2020 will be somewhat flattish to up a couple of points by the time the year fully plays out Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is for Mike from Jack Atkins with Stephens  Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan asked a similar question  You indicated that personnel expenses decreased in the quarter due to declines in incentive compensation  To what degree were lower incentive compensation expense is a tailwind in the fourth quarter  And what is your expectation for incentive compensation accruals in 2020 versus 2019 Mike Zechmeister    Chief Financial OfficerYes  Reduced incentive compensation from bonus  to equity to commissions drove the  40 million year over year reduction in personnel expense in Q4  For incentive compensation  each quarter  we do a year to date true up of our estimated incentive expense  Given the decline in performance in Q4  a much greater reduction to the incentive compensation expense was needed in Q4 to arrive at the proper expense for the full year performance in 2019  Given the extent of that incentive compensation reduction in Q4  our annual personnel expense for 2019 is a better indicator of our annual personnel expense expectations for 2020 than simply using the Q4 run rate Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question for Bob comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer  What is C H  Robinson s strategy for winning new business with smaller shipping customers Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerSo infrequent shippers and small businesses are a huge part of our focus as they make up  really  a majority of our customer count  I think we ve said it obviously before  but our top 500 customers make up about half of our revenue  our top 2 000 customers make up about 80   But we ve got this long tail of small businesses and infrequent shippers that make up the majority of our customer count  So that s really one of the reasons why we made the Freightquote acquisition initially in 2015  and then relaunched the Freightquote by C H  Robinson new product earlier last year to serve these small businesses directly  As we work on building and launching that process We spend a lot of time in the field with small businesses  trying to really understand what was at the core of what they needed  And what we found was that for many of these customers  what they really need and want is a super intuitive and simple platform that allows them to move multiple modes of transportation with a    really with a click of a button and a swipe of a credit card  And so we delivered that to them in the Freightquote by C H  Robinson platform  What we also learned  though  is that for other companies  even though their businesses may be small  their needs were fairly complex  They needed more comprehensive services  global services or consulting support so we ve got an account management team built to serve these small businesses with more complex needs For other small businesses  we heard that what they    maybe they were a bit more advanced in their own carrier management relationships and what they needed was a low cost  yet highly functional TMS system  So in those cases  we ve got our freight viewed TMS product that we re able to implement for those businesses  So I can keep going for a while here  talking about how we serve small businesses in creative and innovative ways  but the punchline  I think  is really that  just like with our larger customers  we leverage our data advantage  our expertise and our technology to deliver solutions that are really tailored to the needs of these small businesses  And we meet them how and where they want to interact with us versus forcing them to a single option for a platform Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is for Bob from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc  Please discuss Robinson incubator  Labs  What role do you see this playing in your organization  What  if any  is the financial impact Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerSo first off  Robinson Labs is another example of where our increased technology investment is really intersecting with our customers and creating value in new ways  While we formally launched this last week  we ve been in the building stage here for a couple of years  and we re really excited about the output of this team  Robinson Labs  in its essence is an innovation incubator  where the next big ideas in logistics and supply chain are created  tested and scaled to drive smarter solutions for Robinson s customers and carriers  Through Robinson Labs  our logistics experts  our innovation teams  our data scientists are all able to collaborate with customers and carriers to create really personalized solutions for shippers challenges From there  the Robinson Labs team is able to work hand in hand with our enterprise technology team  which consists  as we ve talked about  of more than 1 000 data scientists and engineers and developers and take those solutions once proven and scale them across the Robinson network in Navisphere  which benefits our entire platform and all of our connected customers and carriers  In terms of financial impact  we re in the early stages today  But I can say that with certainty  I think it gave a lot of our customers that have been part of the Robinson Labs sandbox  And they ve shared with me directly that they find this experience to be a differentiator for us in the market  and that it will ultimately help lead us to earning more business from these customers as we continue to focus on customer led innovation  Several of the projects that have originated in Robinson Labs since its founding have already been scaled across many of our enterprise customers and our enterprise systems Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThe next question is for Mike from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc  The decline in income from operations in the All Other and Corporate segment accelerated in the quarter and for the year  Are there any unusual costs in the quarter  And how should we think about that line into 2020  Is it going to incur a greater loss to support technology initiatives Mike Zechmeister    Chief Financial OfficerThanks for the question  Todd  The Q4 loss of  8 8 million in income from operations from the All Other and Corporate results segment  was driven by increased expense associated with commercial off the shelf software  which included projects to improve our performance in HR  sales and accounting as well as additional IT headcount  We have a practice of carrying expense associated with the installation of commercial off the shelf software in our All Other and Corporate segment in the first year  In Q4 and the full year 2019  this expense more than offset the profitability of the businesses in that segment    or the business segments in there in that line item  and it caused an overall loss  In 2020  these software expenses will be allocated out to the businesses  and as a result  in 2020  we expect income from operations in the All Other and Corporate results segment to be positive again for the year Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryOur next question for Bob comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan  Headcount declined while truckload volume was flat in NAST  However  net revenue per head still declined sequentially  How will you evaluate if the significant levels of investment are improving productivity and generating the expected return on investment  Will you share additional KPIs to provide more transparency in the future Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Brian  So I d attribute the sequential decline in net revenue per head almost entirely to the sequential decline in net revenue per truckload  That sequential margin compression from Q3 to Q4 negatively impacted sequential revenue by over  30 million  It s meaningful  And we have several metrics that we re tracking internally today to evaluate the impact of investment against productivity and return  Many of these metrics are volume and activity based and tied to automation around particular parts of the business or steps and processes  which ultimately will drive productivity gains across the network Again  I d go back and I d say  I think that the relationship between headcount and volume is a really good marker for progress here as many of the other measures that we re looking at  at a lower grain all ladder up to that measure  The achievement of the cost savings target that we identified of over  100 million that we talked about earlier  is also a part of the total return on this investment  So to your question on  do we intend to be more transparent  share more KPIs  The answer to that is yes  And as the year progresses  we do intend to peel back of it and show a few more KPIs related to that transformation Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryOur next question from Mike comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company  Any other opportunistic acquisitions on the horizon Mike Zechmeister    Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Jason  As has been our history  we continue to see M A as a lever to help us expand our geographic presence  add or improve services  build scale and enhance our technology platform  We prefer strong businesses with compelling strategic benefits  good cultural fit and a proven non asset based business models  Specific to your question on opportunistic acquisitions on the horizon  we maintain a solid pipeline of opportunities  and we ll remain disciplined around value creation and strategic fit Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryOur next question for Bob comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan  What impact  if any  are you assuming the regulatory environment in trucking has on capacity in 2020  Has there been any appreciable change in capacity with the drug and alcohol database coming online and the final phase of the ELD mandate Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerWe ve not yet seen any meaningful impacts to capacity that we could directly tie to the drug and alcohol clearinghouse coming online or the final phase of the ELD mandate  Given all the other variables impacting the balance of supply and demand  we re not forecasting a meaningful change in capacity in 2020 tied directly to regulations Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryOur final question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company  Bob  we have heard that the new entrants  while still more aggressive than the legacy brokers  are starting to be less aggressive  Are you seeing this too Bob Biesterfeld    Chief Executive OfficerAnything I would share here would be second hand information  So I m not going to necessarily comment about what we hear  about other companies and their pricing strategies  I d reinforce that for the fourth quarter  our win rates on our truckload contract bids doubled when compared to fourth quarter of last year  So we see that as a really positive sign  When I reflect on where our team is focused  they re hyper focused on running our business  They re focused on building great technology  providing unmatched services to our customers  helping our motor carriers run more profitable and successful businesses and providing great careers for our people  while ultimately staying focused on creating long term value for our shareholders Robert Houghton    Vice President of Investor Relations and TreasuryThat concludes the Q A portion of today s earnings call  A replay of today s call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at chrobinson com at

months of the first quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at 80  for the soon to be reported quarter  lower than the 83  registered in the fourth quarter of 2018   Capacity overexpansion is the primary reason behind this disappointing performance Additionally  operating expenses are likely to be high in the quarter to be reported  With fuel costs moderating  expenses on wages and benefits might push up operating costs  This  in turn  might weigh on the company s bottom line performance What Does the Zacks Model Say Our proven model does not indicate earnings beat for

193615,415131,CHRW,C H  Robinson Aided By Dividends   Buybacks  Costs High,opinion,"We recently issued an updated research report on C H  Robinson Worldwide   NASDAQ CHRW    While its shareholder friendly attitude buoys optimism  issues like high operating expenses and escalated debt levels raise concerns 
Let s discuss in details the factors influencing the stock 
We are encouraged by the company s efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks  In December 2018  the board of directors of the company approved a 9  hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 50 cents per share  or  2 annually   The company has paid dividends for more than 25 years 
Moreover  the company boosted its buyback program in May  adding another 15 million shares to the share repurchase authorization of 1 2 million shares  which was approved in 2013  Over the past five years  it has returned more than  2 8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases 
We are also impressed by the company s presentation in August 2018 at the 7th Annual Intellisight Conference  where the company provided an update on its long term growth prospects  It anticipates NAST and Robinson Fresh revenues to rise between 5  and 10  and between 4  and 8  respectively over the long term 
Global forwarding and other  including Managed Services  European Surface Transportation and all other services  revenues are expected to grow by more than 10  each  Additionally  earnings per share is also predicted to rise by more than 10  over the long term 
Improvement in operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues  is also a positive  The lesser the value of operating ratio the better  as it implies that more cash is available to the company to reward shareholders through dividends buybacks 
Moreover  with consistent earnings growth and efficient working capital performance  the company s cash flow from operations increased more than 100  to  529 million in the first nine months of the year  We are also impressed by the company s growth by acquisition policy C H  Robinson Worldwide  Inc  Price
 

   On the flip side  high operating expenses have been hurting the company for quite some time and expected to dent bottom line growth in the final quarter of 2018 as well  The company s high debt levels add to the woes

193658,415174,CHRW,Is CH Stock Robinson A Great For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CH Robinson Worldwide Inc    NASDAQ CHRW   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CH Robinson has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 88  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 00  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts CH Robinson s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having roughly trended downwards over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Transportation   Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 99  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that CH Robinson has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 18 99  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for CH Robinson stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  CH Robinson has a P S ratio of about 0 72  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 10 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CH Robinson currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CH Robinson a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though CH Robinson might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives CHRW a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen nine estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upper  while the full year estimate has seen one up and eight down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by roughly 5 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 2 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below C H  Robinson Worldwide  Inc  Price and Consensus

193687,415203,CHRW,The Fed Awakens  A New Hike,opinion,"What were you doing in June 2006 
That s when the Federal Reserve last raised interest rates  just a year after the last Star Wars flick hit theaters  The biggest movie at the time was Adam Sandler s  Click   the hottest song  Shakira s  Hips Don t Lie   The best performing S P 500 Index stock for the month was CH Robinson Worldwide Inc  O CHRW   And as for Janet Yellen  she was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 
If June 2006 doesn t seem that long ago  consider this  Up to a third of asset managers working today have 
On Wednesday  Chair Yellen announced that  for the first time in seven years  easy money will become slightly less easy  The target rate will be set at between 0 25 and 0 50 percent  which doesn t sound like much  but it s important that the Fed ease into this cycle cautiously and gradually  Plus  this comes at a time when fellow industrialized nations and economic areas around the globe are considering further monetary easing measures 
Effects and Possible Ramifications  Keep Calm and Invest On

Rising rates  of course  have a noticeable effect on mortgages  car loans and other forms of credit  Savers will finally start earning interest again 
The question on investors  minds  though  is what effect they might have on their investments  After all  the last couple of days have been challenging for stocks  with the S P 500 dropping 1 5 percent on Friday alone  Is the Fed decision to blame 
To answer this  CLSA analyzed what happened to the U S  dollar and stocks in the S P 500 Index 60 trading days before and after the initial rate hike in past cycles and then calculated the averages  It s important to keep in mind that  aside from rising interest rates  a multitude of unique factors from geopolitics to economic conditions to the weather played roles in influencing the outcomes  Nevertheless  CLSA s research is instructive 
The group finds that  on average  the U S  dollar peaked 10 trading days before the rate hike  and then afterward slid lower for four to five weeks  This created an agreeable climate for gold and other precious metals and commodities  as their prices typically share an inverse relationship with the dollar 
As for equities  they traded up for 60 trading days following the initial rate hike  70 percent of the time 
But CLSA s analysis looks only at possible near term scenarios  What about the long term 
In the past  the results were just as reassuring most of the time  Barron s records S P 500 returns 250 and 500 days following the initial rate hike in six monetary tightening cycles going back to 1983  The findings suggest that the market went through an adjustment period  with average returns falling from 14 percent before the rate hike to 2 6 percent 250 days afterward  But by 500 days  returns returned to their pre hike average of around 14 percent 
Equities Survived Previous Fed Rate Hikes
Again  many other factors besides interest rates contributed to market behavior in each instance  And this time is especially different  as the market was given an unusually long runway  allowing it to price in the full effects of the liftoff before it finally happened 
I can t say whether the same trajectory will be taken this time as before  but what CLSA  Barron s and others have found should be encouraging news for commodities and stocks 
I should also point out that according to the presidential election cycle theory developed by market historian Yale Hirsh  markets do well in a presidential election year 
The consumer price index came out this week and  with an inflation rate of 2 percent  the 5 year Treasury yield is now negative   The real interest rate is what you get after subtracting inflation from the 5 year government bond   This bodes well for gold  Also  the 10 year bond yield is lower than it was six months ago 
Investors Flee Junk Bonds and Defaulting Energy Companies  Find Comfort in Tax Free Muni Bonds
In 2008  the Fed trimmed rates to historically low levels in response to the worst financial crisis since the 1930s  Most people would agree that this helped put the brakes on the U S  slipping further into recession 
But low rates were also partially responsible for driving many investors into riskier investments over the last few years corporate junk bonds among them as they sought higher yields 
Junk bonds  or high yield bonds  are known as such because they have some of the lowest ratings from agencies such as Moody s and Standard   Poor s  Because they carry a higher default risk than investment grade bonds  they offer higher yields 
But with corporate default rates nearing 3 percent for the year  and at least one large high yield bond fund cutting off all redemptions  investors are facing liquidity problems and learning the hard way why these equities are commonly called  junk  
The week before last  it was announced that a high yield bond fund whose assets under management were worth  2 5 billion as recently as 2013 would be closing after suffering nearly  1 billion in outflows this year  This sent the junk bond market into panic mode  with several similar funds experiencing near record outflows  Fears intensified when legendary investor Carl Icahn tweeted   Unfortunately I believe the meltdown in High Yield is just beginning  
To make matters worse  high yield bonds have fallen into negative territory  giving investors little reward for the risk 
Energy companies  highly leveraged since oil began to spill value in the summer of 2014  top the default list for the year 
JPMorgan estimates that the industry s overall default rate might hit 10 percent next year 
 Junk bonds will likely be dead money for at least several years   says  writing for Wyatt Investment Research   Put your money elsewhere  
But where  exactly  is  elsewhere  
With rates now on the rise  many investors have turned to investment grade  short term municipal bonds  which have seen inflows at the fastest pace since January 
Savvy investors know that bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates  but shorter term munis are less sensitive to rate fluctuations than longer term bonds  Put another way  bonds that are more sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment will have greater price fluctuations than those with less sensitivity 
 As municipal bonds head toward the strongest returns in the U S  fixed income markets this year  investors say the end of near zero interest rates will do little to knock state  and local government debt off its stride    writes 
Over the past seven years  low rates certainly contributed to one of the strongest bull markets in U S  history  Now that easy money is coming to an end  we can expect to see more volatility  But as the CLSA and Barron s data show  there s still plenty of room for growth 
It s important  therefore  to stay diversified  Focus on high quality  dividend paying stocks  investment grade  short term municipal bonds  and  as always  gold five percent in gold stocks  the other five percent in bullion
