14265,235780,VCEL,5 Nasdaq Composite Stocks That Braved The Index s Bloodbath ,opinion,Wall Street was afflicted by extreme volatility in 2018  following a fabulous 2017  Market volatility which first appeared in February on investors  concerns about hyper inflation aggravated in March  as result of the trade conflict between the United States and China Although Wall Street had a relatively smooth run in the next six months  the situation worsened significantly in the last three months of the year fueled by a plethora of factors   yield curve inversion  the recent rate hike and the Fed s tighter monetary stance  conflicting news related to trade war between the United States and China and concerns of a global economic slowdown Nasdaq Composite Plunges in 2018The Nasdaq Composite   one of the three major stock indexes of U S  stock market   erased all its gains made in 2018  Currently  the tech heavy index is down 10 3  year to date and a bear market   The tech laden index has now plunged 23 6  from the all time record high close achieved on Aug  29  On Dec 24  Nasdaq Composite closed at 6 192 92  marking its lowest closing since Jul 10  2017 The Nasdaq Composite s stiff fall in 2018 can be attributed to three reasons  First  lingering trade conflicts with China significantly dented the technology sector  China is a major source of inputs which are needed by most of the large cap tech stocks for their final products  Moreover  China also provides the largest market for these high tech products Second  introduction of tariffs in the range of 10    25  on Chinese exports of several important intermediary products of the tech sector raised the cost of production for these companies  Third  the Fed has hiked interest rate four times this year which raised the benchmark lending rate by 1  in 2018  Consequently  the cost of funds jumped up much to the disadvantage of the tech sector Tech Sector Likely to ReboundThe technology sector is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation environment  The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing  predictive analysis  artificial intelligence  AI   self driving vehicles  digital personal assistants  and Internet of Things  IoT   which set the stage for strong growth The United States is all set to witness massive deployment of 5G super fast wireless network in 2019  This will significantly raise the demand for high tech handheld gadgets and micro processors  Moreover  continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the adoption of Software as a Service  SaaS  presents significant growth opportunity several tech companies Additionally  fundamentals of the U S  economy remain robust  The U S  GDP grew 3 3  on an average in the first nine months of 2018  better than Trump administration s 3  target growth rate  The fourth quarter is likely to maintain the momentum driven by strong labor market with record low unemployment and solid consumer and business confidence 5 Nasdaq Stocks Stand Tall in 2018Despite a plummeting Nasdaq Composite  a few companies have survived the turbulence because of their internal strengths and

14266,235781,VCEL,4 Stocks With Recent Price Strength To Maximize Your Gains,opinion, In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds a good idea  Here is how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners Screening Parameters Percentage Change in Price  4 Weeks  greater than zero  This criterion shows that the stock has moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock has seen momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short period Zacks Rank 1 or 2  No matter whether market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have a proven history of outperformance  You can see  Average Broker Rating 1 or 2  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 Current Price  52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  It indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just four Here are those four stocks Alteryx Inc    NYSE AYX   provides self service data analytics software platform that enhances productivity of business analysts  The company s stock price has advanced 1 5  in the last four weeks  It has expected earnings growth of 72 7  for current year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the

14270,235785,VCEL,What s In Store For Vericel  VCEL  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Vericel Corporation   NASDAQ VCEL   is scheduled to report its fourth quarter 2018 and full year earnings results on Feb 26  2019 before market open 
The company s track record has been impressive so far  having surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four reported quarters while matching the same on one occasion  the average positive surprise being 54 88   In the last reported quarter  Vericel came up with a beat of 81 82  
Shares of Vericel have skyrocketed 162 9  in the past year against the  decrease of 17 7  

 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this quarter to be reported 
Factors to Consider
Vericel s top line consists of sales from its two marketed products  namely MACI and Epicel  Sales of both have increased year over year and sequentially in the third quarter of 2018  We expect this positive trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well  The company plans to raise MACI sales force by 20   adding a sixth sales region in 2019 
MACI  autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane  was approved by the FDA in December 2016  It is an autologous cellularized scaffold product indicated for the repair of symptomatic  single or multiple full thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement in adults 
Vericel is focused on its goal of training approximately 900 surgeons by the end of the fourth quarter 2018  up from 500 trained practitioners at the end of 2017  The company also plans to expand MACI manufacturing capacity to meet growth in demand for the medicine  We expect management to provide an update on the same on fourth quarter conference call 
Epicel  cultured epidermal autografts  is a permanent skin replacement Humanitarian Use Device  HUD  used for treating patients with deep dermal or full thickness burns comprising greater than or equal to 30  of total body surface area  TBSA  
Last month  Vericel announced encouraging outcomes data for 954 burn patients treated with Epicel  The results showed that patients treated with Epicel experienced a higher survival rate compared with the data posted for patients at the National Burn Repository with comparable burns  The findings were published in the Journal of Burn Care and Research 
However  during third quarter investor call  Vericel stated that it does not expect significant growth for Epicel sales in the fourth quarter as compared to the previous reported quarters  It also said that revenues in the impending quarterly release will be entirely driven by MACI  We expect management to publish further news on the same on the upcoming earnings call 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Vericel is likely to beat estimates this quarter to be reported  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Vericel has an Earnings ESP of  11 11   representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate wherein the former stands at 4 cents while the latter is pegged at 5 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Vericel carries a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as only a positive ESP in the combination can significantly raise the odds of a likely earnings surprise 
We caution against Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

   Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are a few health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right mix of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle 
Aduro Biotech  Inc    NASDAQ ADRO   has a Zacks Rank of 2 and an Earnings ESP of  15 23   You can see  
BioDelivery Sciences International  Inc    NASDAQ BDSI   is scheduled to release fourth quarter results on Mar 14  The company has an Earnings ESP of  38 46  and a Zacks Rank of 1

107047,328562,VCEL,3 Hot  Gap Up  Stocks To Buy Now  Plus 1 To Avoid ,opinion,"Current stock market conditions are not yet ideal for leaning on the  buy button   but here are three recent  high volume gap ups ready for pullback entry 
Stocks that have  gapped up on big volume are often the best stocks to buy 
This is especially true when a stock gaps to a new  all time high following a valid basing pattern 
Still  not every gap up is worth monitoring 
The gap ups we pay attention to are either breaking out from a base OR gapping above their 50 day moving averages within a base  press here for a quick review of basing patterns  
When a stock has already rallied 20  over a five week period and THEN gaps 15  higher  that is not  the type of gap we are looking for 
Continue reading to find out the best types of gap ups to buy  as well as our three top stock picks now  and one to avoid  
Under Armour Inc A  NYSE UAA    Gap Above Resistance
Under Armour  UAA  is a stock that recently landed on the  Wagner Daily watchlist due a high volume gap up 
On the daily chart below  notice that volume spiked to 10 times its average daily volume on the day it gapped above major moving average resistance 
The massive volume spike indicates institutional accumulation by fund managers  which is key for driving the stock higher in a legitimate breakout 

As long as UAA holds above its 10 day exponential moving average  teal line   we will continue to monitor the price action for potential buy entry 
A breakdown below the 10 day EMA would suggest the stock is headed lower in the short term  or needs another week or two of sideways chop  before heading higher 
FireEye Inc  NASDAQ FEYE    Ready To Gap   Go
Fireeye  FEYE  is another big volume gapper on our stock pick newsletter watchlist 
The recent gap up was accompanied by volume swelling to approximately 400  its average daily volume 
Like Under Armour  FEYE also gapped back above key resistance of its 10  50  and 200 day moving averages 
Tuesday s failed test of the prior high may lead to a buyable pullback to the 10 day EMA 

Vericel Corp Ord  NASDAQ VCEL    Massive Volume  Gap   Go   
Yesterday  Vericel  VCEL  investors were treated to a massive rally of nearly 50  that was driven by a huge opening gap on  800  average volume 
Unlike other stocks that have recently gapped up  VCEL also closed at its intraday high 
Massive volume gap ups from well defined bases often signal the beginning of powerful new uptrends 

The extremely bullish gap up means that VCEL will also be added to our watchlist for potential buy entry on a pullback 
Shoe Carnival  NYSE CCL   SCVL    Gaps Sometimes Fail 
As we mentioned earlier  not all gap ups are buyable on a pullback 
An example of a gap up failing to hold is Shoe Carnival  SCVL   back in September 
Here s why 

When a stock gaps on huge volume and then pulls back to the 10 day EMA  it usually presents a low risk buying opportunity to catch the next wave up 
However  when the price fails to hold the intraday low of the gap day AND its 10 day EMA support  on a closing basis   it is no longer in play for us 
Conclusion
If you patiently wait for the pullback of a gapped stock and have a proper entry  you must always be prepared to close the trade for a loss if the stock doesn t act right 
When the overall stock market is in questionable health  gap up stocks often provide the best opportunity for profitable stock trades 
However  be sure to follow the rules by waiting for a low risk entry point on the pullback  and be ready to bail out quickly if it does not follow through to the upside

American Superconductor Corporation  NASDAQ AMSC   also one of our swing trades  broke out  pulled back  formed a wedge  and popped off its support on Friday  followed through on Monday with a gain of 49 cents  or 6   to 8 85  on 118 712 shares traded  I m looking for an extension to test 10 00  and then 11 00 
Twilio Inc  NYSE TWLO  popped with a little breakaway on Monday  jumping 6 79  or 8 4   to 87 41  on 7 million shares  There s a little bit of resistance  The follow through for Tuesday could be tested around 91 1 2  followed by 99  That s my target 
Vericel Corp Ord  NASDAQ VCEL  broke out on Monday  bouncing 1 04  or 6   to 17 88  on 1 4 million shares  and we put a swing on it  I liked that little pop  then a breakaway gap to double tops to multi month resistance area  then the consolidation zone  it raised to the 50  and ran up in a consolidation where the moving average crosses over and moves up  I think it s headed to 22

promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Small Cap Stocks to Outperform This Holiday SeasonThe holiday season is off to a great start this year buoyed by a digital shopping boom  Online sales jumped 28  to  3 7 billion on Thanksgiving Day and 23 6  to a record  6 22 billion on Black Friday  according to Adobe  NASDAQ ADBE  Analytics  This makes Thursday the fastest growing day for e commerce sales in history and marks the first Friday after Thanksgiving Day in history to see more than  2 billion in sales from smartphones  About 33 5  of e commerce sales came from mobile devices compared with 29 1  in 2017 Despite the optimism  the three major indices logged in their biggest losses in a Thanksgiving week since 2011  with the Dow Jones  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index tumbling 4 4   3 8  and 4 3   respectively  The decline came amid myriad woes  especially the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China  global growth worries  FAANG sell off as well as the worsening oil price rout  read    However  if we go by history  stocks are expected to rise  recovering all their losses over the next month  This is especially true as the Dow Jones Industrial Average  the S P 500  the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 indexes all generally climb between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve  according to data from Kensho  The Dow Jones has returned an average of 1 93  in the time period since 1990  while the S P 500 and the Nasdaq gained 1 77  and 1 66  respectively  The Russell 2000 has outperformed during the holidays  rising on average 2 46  The outperformance of the small caps seems to hold true this year given that these pint sized stocks are well insulated from international headwinds  which we are currently seeing  These are considered safe and better plays if any political issue or economic turmoil creeps into the picture  Additionally  the strength in U S  dollar  which makes domestic goods more expensive overseas  will also support the small cap surge  The Russell 2000 Index was down only 0 5  in a Thanksgiving week Further  a booming economy will provide a lift to stock prices  This is especially true as the American economy has been on a solid pace of growth with robust job creation  strong GDP growth  a 50 year low unemployment rate  the fastest pace of wage gains in nearly a decade  and rising consumer and business confidence  While third quarter GDP growth slowed to 3 5  from 4 2  in the second quarter amid growing headwinds from trade  it marks the best two quarter stretch in four years  With this  the economy is on pace for the fastest annual growth in 13 years Small cap stocks generally lead the way on an improving American economy though they are extremely volatile and could lead to huge losses compared with large and mid cap counterparts in a short span  read    Given this  we have presented five stocks that are expected to outdo this holiday

Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks with Recent Price Strength for a Stouter Portfolio In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds a good idea  Here is how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test

107056,328571,VCEL,4 Best Stocks To Buy For Superb Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth interests all  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Notably  earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a rally in stock price Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Meanwhile  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance Screening Parameters Let s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth

Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the

107061,328576,VCEL,4 Stocks To Watch  CETX  EBS  LCI  OPK,opinion,"The markets had a pretty good day Tuesday morning  It pulled back in the afternoon  but it was a strong day on Wall Street  A lot of our stocks did well  so let s take a look at some of them 
Cemtrex Inc  NASDAQ CETX  had a nice pop  especially near the end of the day when it really ran  It moved up  pulled back to where I gave you a swing on it at about 4 80  then it pulled down for another few minutes  and then exploded 71 cents  or 16   to 5 05  on 1 5 million shares traded  I put a swing on it because I think it s going to run up to the 5 3 4 6 range  and maybe even 7 00  or more  eventually 
Emergent Biosolutions Inc  NYSE EBS   another stock I put a swing trade on  because this one seemed like the big break away gap on the contract announcement  and then the inside day on Monday  got it ready to pop 74 cents  or 2 2   to 34 21  on 659 037 shares traded on Tuesday  I m looking for a test of 37  and maybe the low 40 s  It has 10  short 
Lannett Com  NYSE LCI  popped 85 cents  or 3 5   to 24 95  on 843 834 shares traded  I think I may have put a swing on it prematurely  What I missed was the lack of volume and lack of technicals  Beware  I am going to put strict stops on this one underneath 22 22 40  I don t want to see it under that line because then it could roll over  The good thing is that it moved up across moving averages  which it crossed over  and then popped on Tuesday  before backing off nearly a point  Right now  it could be one big wedge and break down from it  That s why I want the stop protection  The upside  however  if it does accelerate  could see this stock trading in the 29 30 range  It has 6 7   which could fuel the fire  so to speak 
Opko Health Inc  NASDAQ OPK  is looking good  It has a long term head and shoulders  or basing pattern  and it may be coming out of it right now  It traded 26 cents  or 2 2   to 11 91  on 6 2 million shares traded  That s a total of 13 million shares traded in the last two sessions with Monday s pop  and then the follow through on Tuesday  I then put a swing on it on Tuesday  I think it has room for 13  15  and 17  potentially  as targets  It has 18 6

107062,328577,VCEL,The FDA  Small Cap Catalyst Or Small Cap Killer ,opinion,"This particular bureaucracy neither gives nor takes  Data do  If a drug works  the company that develops it will do well  If a drug doesn t work  the company that develops it had better have a diversified pipeline 
Many of the 4 000 or so drugs in the Food and Drug Administration s  FDA  approval system are there because of the work of intrepid scientists employed by small cap companies 
Some are so unique they gain special status  Some generate positive clinical trial results  Some generate negative clinical trial results 
It can be a long  cumbersome  and expensive gauntlet  But  efficacy  can be an elusive target when it comes to complex chemical interactions 
FDA decisions are  ultimately  driven by data  not by some nefarious desire to stymie innovators  and entrepreneurs  desire to save lives 
Here s how it works 
Phase 1 trials are about safety  They typically involve 20 80 patient volunteers  with testing designed to identify a candidate drug s most frequent side effects and how it s metabolized and excreted 
Phase 2 emphasizes effectiveness  with a patient volunteer pool numbering in the hundreds and the trial often placebo controlled  The goal is to gather sufficient data to determine whether the drug actually works for its intended purpose  Safety and short term side effects are also evaluated 
Phase 3 trials typically involve thousands of patient volunteers  Here  more data are gathered about safety and effectiveness  while testing is fine tuned to assess impact on different populations at varying dosages and in combination with other drugs 
Many of the 4 000 or so drugs in the Food and Drug Administration s  FDA  approval system are there because of the work of intrepid scientists employed by small cap companies 
The FDA s New Drug Application  NDA  review involves a meeting with a drug s sponsor  a formal submission of the drug  a formal review of all research on safety and effectiveness  an evaluation of drug labeling for appropriate information  and an inspection of the facility where the drug will be manufactured 
Following all that  the FDA will either approve the application or issue a response letter  The former is  obviously  positive  The latter is not 
Even after a drug is approved  the FDA continues to monitor it  as  it s not possible to predict all of a drug s effects during clinical trials   During the Phase 4 post marketing monitoring stage  a drug sponsor submits periodic safety updates 
 Fast Track Designation  is an alternative FDA process designed to facilitate faster approval of drugs developed for serious diseases that  address an unmet medical need  
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation  speeds the development and review of drugs meant for a serious condition where  preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint s   
 Accelerated Approval  regulations allow FDA to base approval of drugs  for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need on whether the drug has an effect on a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint  
 Priority Review  is granted in cases where a drug  if approved  represents  a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment of a serious condition  
Meanwhile   Orphan Drug Designation  provides clinical trial tax credits  user fee waivers  and exclusivity to incentivize development of drugs for rare diseases 
Phase 3 is perhaps the most important catalyst  Results here  are very important for biotech companies  as they offer insight into the real effectiveness of a drug in human patients and drives  sic  the ultimate market valuation  
At all points along the way  there are opportunities to make profits and suffer losses  based on positive or negative decisions and results 
Analysis by Thomas J  Hwang  formerly a researcher at Harvard Medical School and an associate in healthcare investment with Bain Capital Ventures  supports the conclusion that trial data matter for stock prices of publicly traded companies 

The release of clinical trial results is an economically significant event and has meaningful effects on market value for large biopharmaceutical companies  Stock return underperformance due to negative events is greater in magnitude and persists longer than abnormal returns due to positive events  suggesting asymmetric market reactions 

Although his study was limited to  large biopharmaceutical companies   including Amgen Inc   NASDAQ AMGN   Bristol Myers Squibb Company  NYSE BMY   Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY   Merck  NYSE MRK   and Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE   Hwang notes   These findings confirm and extend previous scholarship on the significant market reactions to clinical trial results for biotechnology companies with few compounds in development  
At all points along the way  there are opportunities to make profits and suffer losses  based on positive or negative decisions and results 
FDA catalysts affect large  as well as small cap drug developers  At the same time  research suggests small caps will react more violently in terms of changes in market capitalization than large caps 
Indeed  we have ample supporting evidence developed just in the first two weeks of December 
Take  for instance  Achaogen Inc  NASDAQ AKAO   now a  377 million company 
Achaogen announced on December 12 that its Phase 3 trial of plazomicin  for patients with complicated urinary tract infections and acute pyelonephritis   met the FDA objective of noninferiority compared with meropenem and achieved superiority for the European Medicines Agency  EMA  primary efficacy endpoints  
The stock closed at  5 25 on December 9  closed at  13 03 on December 12  traded as high as  16 20 on the day after the announcement  and is now priced at  14 00  That s a gain of 166  
Vericel Corp Ord  NASDAQ VCEL   now valued at  140 million  received FDA approval for its Maci  autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane  therapy  for the repair of symptomatic  full thickness cartilage defects of the knee in adult patients  on December 13 
The stock closed at  2 60 on December 13  opened at  4 00 on December 14  hit  4 55 that day  and closed at  4 10  It s now trading at  3 50  up 34  in two days 
Voyager Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ VYGR  surged as much as 33  on positive interim results for its Phase 1b trial of VY AADC01 for advanced Parkinson s disease  announced on December 7 
On December 8  the stock gapped up at the open to  17 50 and traded as high as  18 25  This was a short term bounce   illustrating the fleeting momentum such early clinical results provide   as the stock is now trading at  14 69  That s still a 7  gain since the results were announced 
Note that stocks often move days before announcements of key clinical trial results  possibly the result of insider knowledge of key clinical trial data 
Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated  NASDAQ CORT   which develops drugs for severe metabolic  psychiatric  and oncologic disorders  bounced from  6 92 on November 1 to  10 00 on November 14 
But it didn t announce efficacy data from its Phase 1 2 trial of its drug mifepristone in patients with metastatic or triple negative breast cancer until December 10 
The stock has settled back a bit  closing at  8 51 yesterday 
An FDA determination of special status can also be a powerful catalyst 
On September 19  2016  the FDA  granted  Sarepta Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ SRPT   accelerated approval  for its Exondys 51 injection therapy   the first drug approved to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy  DMD  
Exondys 51 enjoyed Fast Track Designation  Priority Review  and Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA 
According to the FDA   Exondys 51 is specifically indicated for patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping  which affects about 13  of the population with DMD  
In its press release announcing the approval  the FDA further explained 

Exondys 51 was approved under the accelerated approval pathway  which provides for the approval of drugs that treat serious or life threatening diseases and generally provide a meaningful advantage over existing treatments  Approval under this pathway can be based on adequate and well controlled studies showing the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to patients  how a patient feels or functions or whether they survive   This pathway provides earlier patient access to promising new drugs while the company conducts clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit 

The approval was controversial  as many FDA insiders opposed it 
Dr  Janet Woodcock  director of the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research  recently explained to CNBC that this surprise approval is indicative of the agency s  broader move toward patient focused drug development  
Sarepta s share price nearly doubled on September 19  opening at  28 81 and trading as high as  56 18 before closing at  48 94 
FDA catalysts affect large  as well as small cap drug developers  At the same time  research suggests small caps will react more violently in terms of changes in market capitalization than large caps

107069,328584,VCEL,Vericel Dives  Should You Worry ,opinion,"Vericel  NASDAQ VCEL  is having a rough day in the market today  In fact  at 9 53  the stock was trading at  4 05 per share after a loss of  0 28 per share or 6 46  thus far today  With such steep declines on the stock s value  investors are likely asking themselves   Should I be concerned   Today  we ll talk about why VCEL is falling  whether or not you should be concerned  and what we can expect to see from the stock moving forward  So  let s get right to it   
Why Is VCEL Tanking 
As mentioned above  Vericel is having a rough start to the week in the market today  Naturally  when I see such a big decline  I start to do a bit of research to see what it is that is causing the decline  So  one of the first things I did this morning was start researching VCEL to see what was going on  Believe it or not  there was not one piece of bad news  Fundamentally  the stock is flawless and should not be falling  However  there is a good reason for the declines   
Price movement in the market tends to happen through a series of overreactions  When we hear good news about a publicly traded company  we generally expect to see the value of the stock associated with that company skyrocket  However  it s not unlikely that after big gains we see declines  This is exactly what we re seeing from VCEL  Late last week  Vericel skyrocketed in a big way  gaining more than 80   and for good reason 
VCEL recently announced Phase 2b results from the ixCELL DCM study into ixmyelocel T as a treatment for heart failure do to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy  also known as DCM  Through the study  VCEL achieved its primary endpoint of demonstrating a reduction in the total number of deaths  cardiovascular hospitalizations or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits as a result of acutedecompensated heart failure during a 12 month period following treatment  In a statement  Dr  David Recker  Chief Medical Officer at VCEL had the following to say   

The result of the ixCELL DCM study  which we believe is the largest randomized cell therapy trial to treat congestive heart failure completed to date  demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cardiac events in patients who received treatment with ixmyelocel T compared to placebo     We are very excited about these study results given the lack of treatment options for end stage heart failure patients 

Should You Be Concerned About VCEL Declines 
While I understand that a decline of more than 6  in any stock will generally lead to fear among investors  this particular case is different  As mentioned above  there is no fundamental data supporting a decline  What we re seeing is a basic correction to an overreaction that sent the stock further than it should have climbed  Sure VCEL deserved gains  but over 80  is a big move  and investors are correcting the growth  bringing the stock down to a more sustainable rate before growth can continue 
What I Expect To See From Here
Moving forward  I have a relatively bullish opinion with regard to what we can expect to see from Vericel  First and foremost  I m very impressed with what we ve seen from ixmyelocel T in all phases of studies  The treatment is a much needed one in the medical field and looks like it will be approved in the long run  which will lead to big gains for VCEL  All in all  VCEL has a great team  great product  and great management  So  I see no reason to expect to see anything but growth in the stock moving forward ",2016-03-14,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vericel-(vcel)-stock-dives:-should-you-be-concerned-200121516,200121516
