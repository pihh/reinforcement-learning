10476,231991,ROP,Roper Technologies  ROP  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 19 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 35 billion  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 07  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Roper Technologies 
For Roper Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 06  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Roper Technologies will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Roper Technologies would post earnings of  3 04 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 07  delivering a surprise of  0 99  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Roper Technologies appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/roper-technologies-rop-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200474719,200474719

10493,232008,ROP,Top Stock Reports For AT T  Thermo Fisher   Schwab,opinion,"Tuesday  September 3  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features updated research reports on 16 major stocks  including AT T  T   Thermo Fisher  TMO  and Schwab  SCHW   These research reports have been hand picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
AT T s shares have gained  10 7  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s increase of  7 7   AT T is improving critical services that support Public Safety and first responders using the FirstNet communications platform  
The wireless carrier s LTE network reaches more than 400 million people in North America  It aims to deploy a standards based  nationwide mobile 5G network in early 2020  AT T s 5G Evolution technology is live in more than 200 markets  and is expected to reach more than 400 markets by the end of 2019  It is on track to achieve its target of 2 5x debt to EBITDA range by 2019  
However  the Zacks analyst thinks the company is witnessing a steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services  Its wireline division is facing loss in access line due to competitive pressure from Voice over Internet Protocol service providers  As the company tries to woo customers with discounts  freebies and cash credits  margin pressures tend to soar 
 You can   
Shares of Thermo Fisher have outperformed the Zacks Medical Instruments industry in the past three months   7 1  vs   5 6    The Zacks analyst thinks Thermo Fisher has recently been demonstrating strength in all end markets categorized by customer type or geography  In the second quarter  the company registered solid international performance with growth in Europe and Asia Pacific including China  
A series of product launches aided its performance  The company s recent purchase of Brammer Bio in the field of Gene and Cell Therapy is a major positive  Thermo Fisher s Specialty Diagnostics business  even in the face of the divestment of its anatomical pathology unit  holds immense potential  
The company s raised 2019 guidance looks encouraging  On the flip side  Thermo Fisher s operating segments are getting impacted by unfavorable business mix  Competitive headwinds and escalating costs pose threat 
 You can   
Schwab s shares have underperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the past six months  declining  16 2  vs   7 5   However  the Zacks analyst thinks the company has a decent earnings surprise history  Its earnings have surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  
The company s planned acquisition of USAA s Investment Management Company  efforts to strengthen trading business and improvement in operating efficiency bode well for the future  Additionally  the company s steady capital deployment actions are commendable and are expected to continue to enhance shareholder value  
Nevertheless  a dismal rate scenario remains a major concern for the company and will likely hamper margin and top line growth in the upcoming quarters  Rising operating expenses  mainly related to compensation costs and regulatory charges  are likely to hurt bottom line growth to some extent

10573,232088,ROP,Stocks   Dow Falls Nearly 300 Points as Red October Continues,news,"Investing com   The Dow tumbled on Friday  shrugging off data showing ongoing U S  economic growth as high flying tech companies were punished in the wake of downbeat reports from Google and Amazon 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 1 19   The S P 500 fell 1 73   while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2 07   The three indexes are on track for their worst month in years 
Investors grappled with wild swings on Wall Street amid growing concerns U S  corporates were approaching peak profit growth after tech heavyweights Google and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  delivered underwhelming quarterly reports and signalled a softer patch of growth for the fourth quarter 
Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  fell 1 80  after it posted third quarter revenue that fell short of expectations  Amazon shares  meanwhile  dropped nearly 8  as its third quarter revenue also fell short  while its weaker than expected guidance for the key holiday season exacerbated concerns 
The S P 500 tech sector closed about 2  lower  while the communication services sector  which includes Netflix  Facebook  Alphabet and telecom companies sunk more than 2  
The pair of downbeat reports overshadowed data showing the U S  economy grew 3 5  in the third quarter  above economists  estimates for a 3 3  increase  though analysts said a deeper look into the data revealed signs of a possible slowdown 
Disappointing business investment suggested  the boost in capex from tax cuts and deregulation was likely front loaded and fading quickly   BNP Paribas said   We continue to expect growth to slow from here as the sugar high in consumer spending turns into a sugar low  
Energy  meanwhile  was also caught up in the selling frenzy  falling nearly 1   exacerbating the decline in the broader market as a rise in oil prices Friday failed to offset a loss of more than  3  for the week 
Building products companies were also under pressure  led by a more than 20  drop in shares of  Mohawk Industries   NYSE MHK  after its third quarter earnings came up short of estimates and fourth quarter earnings per share guidance of  2 45 to  2 60 was nearly 30  below the consensus estimate at the midpoint 
Shares of Masco Corporation  NYSE MAS   Fortune Brands Home   Security  NYSE FBHS  and  Johnson Controls  International  NYSE JCI  also fell 
In corporate news  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  retreated from session highs  but still managed a 5  gain  shrugging off a report from the WSJ claiming the FBI launched a criminal probe into whether the electric automaker had misstated production figures and misled investors

10596,232111,ROP,U S  company directors compensated more than ever  but now risk backlash,news," This November 8 story corrects spelling of analytics firm ESGauge  paragraph 10  By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON  Reuters    It s nice work if you can get it  The average annual compensation for non executive directors at S P 500 companies rose 2 percent to  304 856 last year  topping  300 000 for the first time and 43 percent higher than it was 10 years ago  according to a new report released by executive headhunters Spencer Stuart  But thanks largely to stock grants some earned a lot more than that   Directors at biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ REGN  received  on average   1 2 million in compensation last year  That figure does not include the more than  6 million received by Regeneron s independent chairman  company disclosures show   And the non executive directors of Wall Street powerhouse  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  made  599 279 on average in 2018  the highest for any financial company in the S P  That was  though  down from  604 837 in 2017  The investment bank  which had 13 board meetings last year  declined to comment beyond disclosures in its proxy statement  S P 500 boards met  on average  just 7 9 times  in person or via telephone  during 2018  That s down from 9 a decade ago  according to Spencer Stuart  The bigger payouts are being made at a sensitive time for Corporate America  A top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election  Elizabeth Warren  has the boardroom in her sights as she seeks to tackle inequality in American society  As well as proposals such as a wealth tax aimed at billionaires  Warren has proposed that workers at U S  corporations elect at least 40  of board members   Warren s campaign declined to comment   Investors are also taking an increasingly feisty view of directors  compensation  which is typically set by the board itself  A growing number of shareholder lawsuits are challenging big ticket board compensation packages   As a result  more companies are expected to put these matters to a shareholder vote at company annual meetings  said Paul Hodgson  a compensation expert and senior adviser at ESGuage  a corporate governance data and analysis firm   There s a certain amount of nervousness within companies about what they re paying directors   Hodgson said   More attention is being paid to outliers than in the past    Compensation limits are also becoming more prevalent  with advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis backing demands from some shareholders  according to global risk advisory firm Willis Towers Watson  NASDAQ WLTW    A study by the firm found that the number of companies with an annual compensation limit for directors increased to 63  in 2018 from 55  the previous year   For some  being a director can mean doing as little as attending regularly scheduled meetings   Board experts say  though  that the job can be a lot more demanding than that  The National Association of Corporate Directors estimates board members commit at least 250 hours a year to their responsibilities   A director may visit company factories and offices  read and comment on background papers  and is often involved in board committee work  Regeneron director Christine Poon  for example  participated in 21 meetings last year  including 10 as chair of the compensation committee   Directors at software developer Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP  Inc  who on average received nearly  910 000 in 2018  participate in at least 15 days of board meetings a year  according to the company s proxy filing  That works out at over  60 000 per day  Roper says the compensation reflects their contribution to the company s superior performance   a cumulative return of 1 084  over the past 15 years compared with the S P 500 s 207   according to the proxy  Roper did not return email and calls seeking comment  Some companies are proud to be miserly   Microsoft Corp   NASDAQ MSFT  founder Bill Gates received just  3 300 last year for his work as a director of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  Inc  which is run by fellow billionaire Warren Buffett   And directors at fashion company Ralph Lauren Corp  NYSE RL  received nearly all of their pay in cash in 2018  and made a lot less than their peers  pulling down just  107 299  according to Spencer Stuart  At some companies  there is a delay in directors receiving the full benefit of their service  That is the case at Goldman  whose directors don t receive shares from their restricted stock grants until they retire  Smaller  lesser known biopharmaceutical companies can offer the biggest compensation packages   Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ VRTX  awards a  400 000 restricted stock grant to directors that vests after one year  It s the key feature in a package that averaged  613 128 per director last year  Vertex did not return messages seeking comment   Regeneron Chairman Roy Vagelos received  6 35 million in 2018  benefiting from big stock option awards  and that was down from  11 8 million in 2017   Regeneron  known for drugs that treat eye disease  held six board meetings in 2018  Vagelos  a former CEO of Merck   Co Inc  attended all of those as well as three technology committee meetings   The quality of our board is unparalleled   over half our directors are members of the National Academy of Sciences and two of our directors are Nobel laureates   said Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie when asked about the compensation  Last year  though  Regeneron did agree to curb its director pay as part of a settlement with investors who sued the company  claiming Vagelos and other directors received excessive compensation   A new compensation plan in effect this year has resulted in a nearly 50  year over year decrease in the reported value of director stock awards on the day they were granted  That will probably start to be reflected in 2019 numbers   Pharmaceutical company Incyte  NASDAQ INCY  Corp  whose board members made an average of  493 657 in 2018  also re evaluated the way it structured directors  compensation after getting investors  push back

10633,232148,ROP,Roper Technologies  ROP  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 35 billion  up 4 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 2  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Roper Technologies 
For Roper Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Roper Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Roper Technologies would post earnings of  2 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 30  delivering a surprise of  18 71  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

10639,232154,ROP,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Roper Technologies  ROP  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Roper Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ROP that show why this industrial equipment maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ROP  shares are up 2 68  over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing   General Industrial industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 5 24  compares favorably with the industry s 1 97  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Shares of Roper Technologies have increased 9 93  over the past quarter  and have gained 36 36  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 4 14  and 9 82   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ROP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ROP is currently averaging 521 483 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ROP 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ROP s consensus estimate  increasing from  12 69 to  12 97 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that ROP is a  1  Strong Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Roper Technologies on your short list ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-roper-technologies-rop-is-a-great-choice-200439851,200439851

10660,232175,ROP,ABB Suffers From High Costs   Business Integration Issues,opinion,"ABB Ltd   NYSE ABB   continues to struggle with the headwinds that have marred its operational performance over the past few quarters  We expect that persistent rise in expenses  high debt levels and ongoing challenges related to the integration of General Electric Company s   NYSE GE   electrification solutions business   GE Industrial Solutions   GEIS     will hinder the company s growth It s not surprising that the stock has also put up a dismal show in the recent times  In the past six months  ABB has lost 3 6  against the  s rally of 2 3   Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings has moved south in past seven days from 97 cents to 92 cents 
Read on to find the major factors curbing the company s growth  and why it may be prudent to avoid the stock at the moment Factors at Play
Rising cost of sales has been a major cause of concern for ABB over the past few quarters  Notably  the metric escalated 10 5  and 7 5  in fourth quarter 2018 and first quarter 2019  respectively  Notably  in the first quarter  increase in commodity price adversely impacted the profitability of the company by  3 million Also  high debt levels have been a concern for the company  In the last three years  2016 2018   the company s long term debts recorded an increase of 4 3   CAGR   Further increases in debt levels can raise the company s financial obligations  Notably  the stock looks slightly more leveraged than the industry  Its debt capital ratio is currently pegged at 0 34  higher than 0 28 recorded by the industry Moreover  ABB spolicy of acquiring a large number of companies adds to the integration risks  Frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management  and can affect organic growth over the long term  For instance  in the first quarter  GEIS integration expenses and stranded costs hurt ABB s operating margins by about 100 basis points  As a matter of fact  the company expects that the GEIS integration will dilute its margins in the upcoming quarters as well 
Further  the Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries where it operates  In addition  the company remains quite vulnerable to currency translation risks

including the Fed  have adopted a dovish stance anticipating tough times Uncertainty on Trade DealThe U S  China trade war  which started in March 2018  headed for a likely solution in 2019 but abruptly ended in May after President Trump blamed China of backtracking from earlier commitments  So far  the United States has imposed 25  tariffs on  250 billion Chinese goods and China has retaliated by levying 25  tariffs on  160 billion of U S  exports  Although the two sides renewed talks to end the impasse  a trade deal is not yet on the horizon Moreover  the Trump administration

Eurozone s economic condition deteriorates  the ECB will inject more stimulus either in the form of interest rate cut or further asset purchase On Jun 19  Fed chair Jerome Powell removed the term  patient   from the FOMC minutes and added that  the FOMC will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   Investors are considering a rate cut at least by 25 basis points in July and one or two more cuts in the rest of this year China s central bank extended around  40 billion to some commercial banks in April via its targeted medium term lending facility as it looks to provide struggling smaller business with a steady stream of affordable financing  Meanwhile  Reserve Bank of Australia decided to

Chicago  IL   July 2  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Chipotle Mexican Grill   NYSE CMG    Global Payments Inc    NYSE GPN    Arconic Inc    NYSE ARNC    Roper Technologies   NYSE ROP   and American International   NYSE AIG   
Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  
5 Top Ranked Winners from S P 500 s Record 1H19
U S  stocks ended the first half of the year on an encouraging note  with both the Dow and S P 500 notching up record gains  Broader benchmarks also created new milestones during the month of June  which helped to push year to date gains into record territory 
A strong U S  economy seems to have negated most investor concerns during the period  Robust fundamentals were supported by the Fed  which stepped in to allay investor concerns at several points  Recently  the central bank indicated that it is likely to take a softer view on rates as the year progresses 
Meanwhile  trade talks are set to resume following a meeting between presidents Trump and Xi at the G20 summit in Japan  The prospect of a near term trade deal and a rate cut later this year are likely to boost investor sentiment  This is why it makes sense to invest in S P 500 stocks  which registered strong gains during the first half of the year 
S P 500  Dow Create New Milestones  Economy Shines
In June  the S P 500 gained 6 9   its best return for the month since 1955  The broader benchmark is also up 17 4  year to date  its best gain for the period since 1997  The Dow posted its best June gains since 1938  adding 7 2   The blue chip index also increased 14  over the first half of 2019 
But the path of such gains was not altogether smooth  Trump s trade tactics led to heavy losses in May  During the month s opening days  Trump threatened to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese goods  spreading panic among investors  He went on to engage in a trade skirmish with Mexico and then issued an order effectively barring Huwaei sales  Predictably  the S P 500 closed the month 6 6  lower  
Ultimately  the economy came to Wall Street s rescue  lending a hand to deal making  The total value of deals jumped 20  from last year to hit  1 1 trillion  This is the first time ever that domestic deal volumes have exceeded  1 trillion during the first half of a year  Fresh data shows consumer spending and income exceeding estimates  which likely means that the trend will continue 
Rate Cut  Trade Deal Crucial for Future Gains
The key to future gains lies with the Federal Reserve and presidents Trump and Xi  June s gains were largely a product of indications from the Fed that it was likely to adopt a softer policy approach later this year  The central bank said that it would  act as appropriate  to preserve the current economic momentum  In the process  they have raised hopes for a July rate cut significantly 
Meanwhile  presidents Trump and Xi agreed to restart trade talks after their meeting at the G20 summit in Japan last week  Trump also said no new tariffs would be levied on Chinese items  Further  he agreed to ease restrictions on Huwaei  in order to cool down trade tensions  Trump is likely to hold off from fresh tariffs until presidential elections are concluded in 2020 
Our Choices
The S P 500 posted record gains during the first half of 2019  boosted largely by a strong U S  economy  A softer policy stance from the Federal Reserve has also enthused investors and the central bank s actions are largely responsible for June s strong gains  Given that there is a strong chance of a near term rate cut even as trade tensions decline  gains are set to continue in 2H19 
Investing in S P 500 stocks which registered searing gains in 1H19 looks like a prudent option  We have narrowed down our search based on a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and other relevant metrics  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks here

10697,232212,ROP,Can Roper Technologies  ROP  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP   which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing   General Industrial industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
When looking at the last two reports  this industrial equipment maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 10 79   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Roper Technologies was expected to post earnings of  2 78 per share  but it reported  3 30 per share instead  representing a surprise of 18 71   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 13 per share  while it actually produced  3 22 per share  a surprise of 2 88  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Roper Technologies  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Roper Technologies currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 82   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 25  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-roper-technologies-rop-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200436839,200436839

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  
5 Winners as U S  China Agree to Resume Trade Talks
The United States and China have agreed to hold off new tariffs  sending the stock market higher  In fact  receding possibility of any collateral damage from the trade war helped industrial and technology stocks gain in particular  Thus  investing in such stocks seem to be a wise move for now 
What s Driving the Markets 
The broader stock market recently enjoyed a healthy run  with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing its best June in more than 80 years  The blue chip index rose 7 2   according to Dow Jones Market Data  Also  the S P 500 and Nasdaq notched record June returns 
No doubt  the rally was partly supported by Fed s easier monetary policy stance along with the U S  China trade truce  U S  President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met over the weekend at the G 20 summit in Japan  where they have mutually decided not to impose tariffs against each other s commodities 
Trump said that no additional tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese products will be applied for the  time being   Also  the economies will surely work a deal  To top it  six weeks after Huawei was blacklisted by the White House  Trump took a complete U turn  He said that the U S  companies  can sell their equipment to Huawei   This development certainly eased trade dispute since it was one of the major flash point in the conflict 
Potential Winners as U S  China Work Out Trade Truce
A truce between two of the world s largest economies has alleviated risks in the equity market for now  A full blown trade war would have had rippling effects on the global economy growth  casting a pall over businesses  Let us now look at stocks that have benefitted from the easing trade tensions 
Industrials Tread Higher
As mentioned earlier  progress in trade talks has helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average cement the best June gain since 1938  And the biggest gainer among all the Dow components will certainly be Boeing  NYSE BA   After all  the aerospace giant sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers 
And how can we forget that China had threatened to impose tariffs on several American products  including airplanes if there is no trade truce  Such a move could easily affect Boeing s 737 800  737 700 and 737 900 ER models  But  with tariff scares behind us for now  Boeing has ample reasons to rejoice 
Tech Stocks Make Merry 
Within the Dow  Intel  NASDAQ INTC  in particular is expected to gain immensely  And why not  Intel more or less generates bulk of its revenues from China  and it s more than what the semiconductor company makes in the United States  China  in fact  heavily relies on U S  chipmakers  while semiconductors make up one of its largest import categories in terms of value  Hopes of abatement in U S  China trade tensions provided strength to the chip sector 
Elsewhere in the chip sector  shares of KLA Tencor  NASDAQ KLAC   Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  and Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU  ended in the positive territory 
The broader tech sector has also a lot to gain from reduced trade war fears  The components of the SPDR Technology Select Sector had seen significant amount of revenues coming from China in recent years  In fact  China is in the second place in terms of revenue generation  behind the United States 
5 Top Gainers
As trade war worries dissipate and broader markets move north  investing in stocks from the aforesaid sectors making the most of the recovery seems judicious  We have  thus  selected five stocks that can make the most of the encouraging trend  These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

10716,232231,ROP,5 Winners As U S  China Agree To Resume Trade Talks,opinion,The United States and China have agreed to hold off new tariffs  sending the stock market higher  In fact  receding possibility of any collateral damage from the trade war helped industrial and technology stocks gain in particular  Thus  investing in such stocks seem to be a wise move for now What s Driving the Markets The broader stock market recently enjoyed a healthy run  with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing its best June in more than 80 years  The blue chip index rose 7 2   according to Dow Jones Market Data  Also  the S P 500 and Nasdaq notched record June returns No doubt  the rally was partly supported by Fed s easier monetary policy stance along with the U S  China trade truce  U S  President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met over the weekend at the G 20 summit in Japan  where they have mutually decided not to impose tariffs against each other s commodities Trump said that no additional tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese products will be applied for the  time being   Also  the economies will surely work a deal  To top it  six weeks after Huawei was blacklisted by the White House  Trump took a complete U turn  He said that the U S  companies  can sell their equipment to Huawei   This development certainly eased trade dispute since it was one of the major flash point in the conflict Potential Winners as U S  China Work Out Trade TruceA truce between two of the world s largest economies has alleviated risks in the equity market for now  A full blown trade war would have had rippling effects on the global economy growth  casting a pall over businesses  Let us now look at stocks that have benefitted from the easing trade tensions Industrials Tread HigherAs mentioned earlier  progress in trade talks has helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average cement the best June gain since 1938  And the biggest gainer among all the Dow components will certainly be Boeing Company   NYSE BA    After all  the aerospace giant sells about a fourth of its commercial aircraft to Chinese customers And how can we forget that China had threatened to impose tariffs on several American products  including airplanes if there is no trade truce  Such a move could easily affect Boeing s 737 800  737 700 and 737 900 ER models  But  with tariff scares behind us for now  Boeing has ample reasons to rejoice Tech Stocks Make Merry Within the Dow  Intel Corporation   NASDAQ INTC   in particular is expected to gain immensely  And why not  Intel more or less generates bulk of its revenues from China  and it s more than what the semiconductor company makes in the United States  China  in fact  heavily relies on U S  chipmakers  while semiconductors make up one of its largest import categories in terms of value  Hopes of abatement in U S  China trade tensions provided strength to the chip sector Elsewhere in the chip sector  shares of KLA Tencor Corp  NASDAQ KLAC     Lam Research Corp  NASDAQ LRCX     and Micron Technology  NASDAQ MU   Inc   ended in the positive territory The broader tech sector has also a lot to gain from reduced trade war fears  The components of the SPDR Technology Select Sector had seen significant amount of revenues coming from China in recent years  In fact  China is in the second place in terms of revenue generation  behind the United States 5 Top GainersAs trade war worries dissipate and broader markets move north  investing in stocks from the aforesaid sectors making the most of the recovery seems judicious  We have  thus  selected five stocks that can make the most of the encouraging trend  These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   manufactures and sells

10718,232233,ROP,5 Top Ranked Winners From S P 500 s Record Busting 1H19,opinion,U S  stocks ended the first half of the year on an encouraging note  with both the Dow and S P 500 notching up record gains  Broader benchmarks also created new milestones during the month of June  which helped to push year to date gains into record territory A strong U S  economy seems to have negated most investor concerns during the period  Robust fundamentals were supported by the Fed  which stepped in to allay investor concerns at several points  Recently  the central bank indicated that it is likely to take a softer view on rates as the year progresses Meanwhile  trade talks are set to resume following a meeting between presidents Trump and Xi at the G20 summit in Japan  The prospect of a near term trade deal and a rate cut later this year are likely to boost investor sentiment  This is why it makes sense to invest in S P 500 stocks  which registered strong gains during the first half of the year S P 500  Dow Create New Milestones  Economy ShinesIn June  the S P 500 gained 6 9   its best return for the month since 1955  The broader benchmark is also up 17 4  year to date  its best gain for the period since 1997  The Dow posted its best June gains since 1938  adding 7 2   The blue chip index also increased 14  over the first half of 2019 But the path of such gains was not altogether smooth  Trump s trade tactics led to heavy losses in May  During the month s opening days  Trump threatened to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese goods  spreading panic among investors  He went on to engage in a trade skirmish with Mexico and then issued an order effectively barring Huwaei sales  Predictably  the S P 500 closed the month 6 6  lower  Ultimately  the economy came to Wall Street s rescue  lending a hand to deal making  The total value of deals jumped 20  from last year to hit  1 1 trillion  This is the first time ever that domestic deal volumes have exceeded  1 trillion during the first half of a year  Fresh data shows consumer spending and income exceeding estimates  which likely means that the trend will continue Rate Cut  Trade Deal Crucial for Future GainsThe key to future gains lies with the Federal Reserve and presidents Trump and Xi  June s gains were largely a product of indications from the Fed that it was likely to adopt a softer policy approach later this year  The central bank said that it would  act as appropriate  to preserve the current economic momentum  In the process  they have raised hopes for a July rate cut significantly Meanwhile  presidents Trump and Xi agreed to restart trade talks after their meeting at the G20 summit in Japan last week  Trump also said no new tariffs would be levied on Chinese items  Further  he agreed to ease restrictions on Huwaei  in order to cool down trade tensions  Trump is likely to hold off from fresh tariffs until presidential elections are concluded in 2020 Our ChoicesThe S P 500 posted record gains during the first half of 2019  boosted largely by a strong U S  economy  A softer policy stance from the Federal Reserve has also enthused investors and the central bank s actions are largely responsible for June s strong gains  Given that there is a strong chance of a near term rate cut even as trade tensions decline  gains are set to continue in 2H19 Investing in S P 500 stocks which registered searing gains in 1H19 looks like a prudent option  We have narrowed down our search based on a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and other relevant metrics  You can see  Chipotle Mexican Grill   NYSE CMG    together

10770,232285,ROP,Enersys  ENS  To Increase Thin Plate Pure Lead Capacity,opinion,"Enersys   NYSE ENS   recently announced plans to increase its Thin Plate Pure Lead  TPPL  capacity over the upcoming three years  Per the company  its efforts of spending more than  100 million of additional capital and a projected 15  increase from persistent focus on Lean principles will expand TPPL capacity by more than  500 million on an annual basis 
In addition to these  the company intends to continue with efforts of commercialization for GreenSeal Bi Polar battery technology  Notably  the technology was licensed from Advanced Battery Concepts  LLC   ABC    The GreenSeal technology enables Enersys to perform manufacturing process efficiently and reduces production costs 
The technology reduces lead content  increase cycle life by about 300  compared with standard lead batteries  boosts battery performance  enhances power density as well as lowers recharge time  Notably  the technology s backward compatibility feature with most applications made it an appropriate choice for EnerSys 
Our Take
Of late  EnerSys  motive power product line is experiencing weakness  primarily on account of ERP implementation issues in the American region  In addition  the company s reserve power product line is experiencing weaker demand as several telecom customers in the United States deferred expenditure on legacy networks  We believe that persistent softness in any of the product lines business will weigh on the company s financials in the upcoming quarters 
Although the company has been making multiple long term investments to boost growth  higher spending on new products development and system enhancements such as SAP  salesforce and success factors are also weighing on the bottom line  In the past six months  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock has declined 20 5   compared with the  s growth of 3 3  

 
Moreover  rising cost of sales is a major concern for the company  Evidently  the metric increased 14 7  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  ended Mar 31  2019   despite cost reduction initiatives  Further  the company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices  especially that of lead 
Key Picks
Some better ranked stocks from the Zacks  sector are Chart Industries  Inc    NASDAQ GTLS    Eaton Corp  plc   NYSE ETN   and Roper Technologies  Inc    NYSE ROP    While Chart Industries sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Eaton and Roper carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Chart Industries surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 16 56  
Eaton outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 1 88  
Roper exceeded estimates in each of the preceding four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 8 43

demand to support construction activity and oil and gas infrastructure are acting as catalysts  The company expects momentum in these end sectors to continue through the balance of the year  Additionally  the company s focus on commercializing innovative products and cost cutting initiatives is likely to stoke growth  Lincoln Electric has increased investment in research and development  and continues to roll out several solutions in the automation solutions market  These product launches are likely to aid growth  The company is also preparing for the launch of its new additive services business which will position Lincoln Electric as a manufacturer of large scale 3D printed metal spell parts  prototypes and tooling for industrial customers  This is likely to be a growth driver for Lincoln Electric  It also continues to invest in long term strategy for automation in support of its 2020 strategy initiatives  Active on the Acquisition Front In January 2017  Lincoln Electric completed acquisition of Air Liquide  PA AIRP  Welding  a subsidiary of Air Liquide  The buyout has enhanced the company s global specialty consumables portfolio and extended channel reach for equipment systems and cutting  soldering and brazing solutions in Europe In December 2018  Lincoln Electric acquired Inovatech Engineering Corporation and Coldwater Machine Company to boost automated cutting solutions  In January 2019  Lincoln Electric acquired the soldering business of Worthington Industries Inc   WOR  to enhance the company s product portfolio  accelerate growth in the retail channel and aid Harris business In April 2019  Lincoln Electric completed the acquisition of Baker Industries  a provider of parts  fixtures and custom tooling for automotive and aerospace markets  Recently  the company entered into an agreement to purchase an additional 49 6  interest in Askaynak  a leading Turkish producer of welding consumables and equipment  The company currently holds a 50  stake in Askaynak  which it had secured in 1998  Askaynak is a supplier and manufacturer of welding consumables  arc welding equipment  including plasma and oxyfuel cutting equipment  and robotic welding systems and generated approximately  70 million in annual revenues  Near term Headwinds Sales growth is likely to be impacted in 2019 owing to the ongoing volume compression in International Welding segment on account of the ongoing Air Liquide integration  Further  weak European demand particularly in Italy and France remains a concern for the segment  Further  weak automotive end market  which generates around 17  of the company s revenues  will dent the company s top line Raw material inflation will remain a headwind in 2019  Although Lincoln Electric continues to announce new pricing actions  margins will be impacted   Given its focus on innovation as a key value proposition  Lincoln Electric continued to increase investment in product development with higher year over year R D spending  Though this has long term benefits  it will impede margins in the near term  Share Price Performance  Shares of the company plunged 12 8  over the past year compared with the  s decline of 10 9  Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider Lincoln Electric currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the  sector are DMC Global Inc    NASDAQ

sales were up 3  year over year to  7 3 billion  primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization offset by unfavorable currency translation impact  Operating profit at the segment

volumes  Construction   Forestry sales increased 11  year over year to  2 99 billion from the prior year quarter  aided by the Wirtgen acquisition  higher shipment volumes and price realization

10827,232342,ROP,5 Blue Chip Stocks To Buy As  Trump Put  Negates Trade Fears  ,opinion,Heightened trade tensions between the United States and China led to heavy losses for U S  equity markets last week  For the S P 500 and Nasdaq  it was the worst week of the year  However  a strong rebound occurred on May 10  after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that the ongoing talks have been constructive  His views were shortly echoed by a tweet from President Trump In fact  market watchers are betting that the so called  Trump Put  will prevent an equity market collapse  This essentially means that Trump is mindful of the pressure his protectionist tactics place on the economy and financial markets  This is why he retreats from seemingly non negotiable positions whenever downside risks get out of hand At the same time  this perception prevents investors from panicking beyond a point  allowing Trump to engage in his characteristic brinkmanship  This means that markets still retain upside but established names could outperform lesser known peers  With their large capital base and strong reputation  blue chips may prove to be the best option for investors in the months ahead Markets Rebound on Trade Deal Hopes  Worries RemainOn May 10  the Dow closed the day more than 100 points higher  This represents a massive rebound from the 358 point plunge that the blue chip index suffered after tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese goods increased after midnight  The S P 500 ended a four day losing streak while the Nasdaq closed marginally higher The rebound was initially triggered by comments from Steven Mnuchin  who categorized the ongoing trade talks as  constructive   His views were bolstered by a tweet from President Trump which boosted stocks to session highs  Trump echoed Mnuchin  adding that his relationship with president Xi remains strong  Trump also said trade negotiations are set to continue Does the  Trump Put  Reduce Downside Risk Several analysts believe that Friday s equity market recovery is wholly attributable to the  Trump put   A put is a kind of option which allows investors to limit their losses  For instance  fixing a put strike price of  20 on a stock purchased for  30 a share limits losses to no more than  10 per share Trump has indicated time and again during his presidential term that he will play a similar role for the equity markets and the economy  While he adopts seemingly non negotiable positions  especially on trade  the U S  President retreats whenever downside risks seem to be getting out of hand For instance  stocks were in free fall at the end of last year with recession risks looming large  Then  early this year  constructive U S  China trade talks reinvigorated equity markets  In particular  a meeting held in the Oval Office on Feb 22 sparked off a furious market rally  which has boosted stocks by nearly 15  so far this year However  there is a flip side to this argument  Since investors believe that Trump will curb market losses beyond a point  stocks tend to limit losses even when near term risks  such as trade tensions  heighten  This allows Trump to take an even tougher stance on prickly issues This was clearly illustrated by comments made by the U S  President on the morning of May 13  Trump tweeted once again that China  broke the deal  and  tried to renegotiate   He also asserted that the United States is  where we want to be  on trade negotiations with China Our ChoicesSeveral market watchers think that President Trump will not allow downside risks for the markets and economy to get out of hand  This is exactly why he steps from seemingly non negotiable positions when a collapse looks imminent However  this could also allow him to engage in unnecessary brinkmanship on such sensitive issues  Investing in blue chip stocks during a volatile period looks like a smart option  We have narrowed down our search based on a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and other relevant metrics

markets and the economy  While he adopts seemingly non negotiable positions  especially on trade  the U S  President retreats whenever downside risks seem to be getting out of hand For instance  stocks were in free fall at the end of last year with recession risks looming large  Then  early this year  constructive U S  China trade talks reinvigorated equity markets  In particular  a meeting held in the Oval Office on Feb 22 sparked off a furious market rally  which has boosted stocks by nearly 15  so far this year However  there is a flip side to this argument  Since investors believe that Trump will curb market losses beyond a point  stocks tend to limit losses even when near term risks  such as trade tensions  heighten  This allows Trump to take an even tougher stance on prickly issues This was clearly illustrated by comments made by the U S  President on the morning of May 13  Trump tweeted once again that China  broke the deal  and  tried to renegotiate   He also asserted that the United States is  where we want to be  on trade negotiations with China Our ChoicesSeveral market watchers think that President Trump will not allow downside risks for the markets and economy to get out of hand  This is exactly why he steps from seemingly non negotiable positions when a collapse looks imminent However  this could also allow him to engage in unnecessary brinkmanship on such sensitive issues  Investing in blue chip stocks during a volatile period looks like a smart option  We have narrowed down our search based on a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and other relevant metrics

cost inflation and pulling down margins of several U S  manufacturing companies  As a matter of fact  the uncertain demand environment for industrial manufacturing products created by the trade

11129,232644,ROP,Near Term View Bleak For Industrial Manufacturing Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that are engaged in producing a wide range of industrial equipment tools Some of these companies sell power transmission products  bearings  engineered fluid power components and systems  industrial rubber products  vapor abrasive blasting equipment  vehicle powered truck refrigeration systems  adhesive  gel coat equipment  flow control components  safety products and linear motion components in the market  In addition to these  industrial manufacturing companies reconstruct and assemble pumps  valves  speed reducers and hydraulic motors These companies provide services to original equipment manufacturing  OEM  as well as maintenance  repair and overhaul  MRO  customers  These end users belong to different types of industries  such as mining  oil and gas  forest products  agriculture and food processing  fabricated metals  chemicals and petrochemicals  transportation and utilities Here are the industry s three major themes  Technological advancement in manufacturing processes has been key to driving demand in the industrial manufacturing industry  Also  the Republic led government s emphasis on infrastructure development  impetus to streamline business regulations  spur in new construction and remodeling activities and growing popularity of e retailing has been adding strength  Further  the government s corporate tax overhaul enacted in December 2017 was welcoming  This move has left unused corpus for companies to be utilized for growth investments  Over the last three years  the industry s revenues witnessed a CAGR of 4 3   Weakness in the broader market took its toll on the industry  To begin with  a protectionism policy  imposition of import tariffs  of the Trump government has strained trade relations with foreign nations  especially with China   Also  inflationary pressure and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies are hurting margins  Companies in this industry are constantly looking for innovative techniques  involving highly sophisticated equipment for manufacturing processes  Naturally  demand is generally high for skilled labor  which due to the current shortage has been a disturbing factor  The tight supply of skilled labor is also spiking wage rates in the market  To add to the woes  problems within the trucking industry   like shortage of truck drivers and soaring truck fuel surcharges   are a concern for U S  manufacturers  These supply side challenges have resulted in lead time expansion and elevated freight charges  These setbacks may continue to aggravate costs and mar profits of industrial manufacturing companies in the near future Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak

of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry s rank has remained in the bottom half of the rank list for majority of the past eight weeks The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of disappointing earnings prospects for the constituent companies in aggregate

11130,232645,ROP,Roper Technologies  ROP  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Roper Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ROP that show why this industrial equipment maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For ROP  shares are up 3 79  over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing   General Industrial industry is up 1 33  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 8 85  compares favorably with the industry s 0 1  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Roper Technologies have risen 29 4   and are up 25 89  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 14 83  and 13 3   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ROP s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ROP is currently averaging 374 948 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with ROP 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ROP s consensus estimate  increasing from  12 19 to  12 29 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ROP is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Roper Technologies on your short list ",2019-04-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/roper-technologies-rop-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200403637,200403637

11202,232717,ROP,Roper Technologies  ROP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 35 billion  up 10 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Roper Technologies 
For Roper Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Roper Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Roper Technologies would post earnings of  2 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 09  delivering a surprise of  5 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Roper Technologies doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/roper-technologies-rop-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200379530,200379530

11224,232739,ROP,5 Top Stocks To Gain From Escalating Trade War Tensions,opinion,U S  President Trump has threatened to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods  while Beijing warned it would retaliate  This has heightened the trade spat between the two of the world s largest economies  Investors  naturally  have turned nervous as earnings of companies could be at risk in the event of a global trade war But there are some companies that might benefit  Among these are producers of goods that do limited business in China  have solid growth narratives and their promising outlook remains unfazed by the change in tariffs  Thus  investing in such winners at times of a trade war will not be a bad proposition Trump Ups the Stake in Trade WarThe chances of a trade clash between Washington and Beijing intensified after Trump instructed the U S  Trade Representative s office to figure out  200 billion in imports from China for additional tariffs of 10   He added that the United States may impose tariffs on another  200 billion provided the Asian nation retaliates Last week  Trump threatened to impose a 25  tariff on  50 billion Chinese imports  The tariffs will be passed in two phases  More than 800 Chinese exports  worth  34 billion  will be subject to tariffs beginning in July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later Trump said that  the United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world  and that the U S   will continue using all available tools to create a better and fairer trading system for all Americans  The tariffs are intended to force China change its unfair practices with respect to technology and innovation  But regrettably China is hell bent on increasing its tariffs on  50 billion worth of U S  exports  read more    Global Fund Managers Turn to AlibabaTrade wars are headwinds for companies as these erode profit margins and affect the overall economy  Thus  this

giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited   NYSE BABA    primarily  because of its domestic exposure The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26 7  compared with the  industry s

long term growth narrative will also not be affected by a trade war  Notable  among them are Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL    Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   and Axon Enterprise  Inc    NASDAQ AAXN    Google s growth is dependent on an uptick in digital advertising  since the search engine controls more than 40  of the U S  digital ad market  Google s focus on smart home technology  cloud data centers and automated driving drives the company s earnings  All these areas are unlikely to be affected by a trade war        Similarly  Facebook s growth is mostly in digital advertising  Facebook controls 20  of the U S  digital ad market  while Instagram controls another 5   Needless to say that digital advertising industry is hardly affected by the implementation of tariffs Axon Enterprise sells an array of digital solutions including cloud data storage systems and mobile video apps to law enforcement agencies throughout the world  Such agencies are in desperate need of a technology makeover  which gives the stock a solid growth narrative In fact  shares of Alphabet  Facebook and Axon Enterprise rose 2 1   1 3  and 2 7  on Jun 18  respectively despite Trump s threat to escalate the trade fight with China Why Thinking Small is Not the Only Thing to Do Now In the wake of Trump s tariff announcement  investors seem to be shifting into small cap stocks  And why so  This is because such stocks tend to have higher proportion of domestic sales compared to large caps  But  in reality  the difference isn t much  Per data from FactSet Research  small caps stocks in the Russell 2000 index derive 20 6  of their revenues from outside the United States  while stocks from the broader S P 500 derive 30 3  Satellite player Harris  electrical equipment maker Hubbell  seller of lighting equipment Acuity Brands  aerospace and defense players KLX and L3 Technologies  Inc    NYSE LLL    conglomerate Roper Technologies  Inc    NYSE ROP    and factory control specialist Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK  derive a meagre 10  of revenues from China  per UBS Goldman stated that CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX    CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS   Dollar General Corp  NYSE DG   Public Storage  NYSE PSA   Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  derive 100  of their sales from the United States  Intuit Inc    NASDAQ INTU   is another company that derives 95  of its sales from the country  Goldman added  Hence  it s quite natural that these companies stand to gain the most as trade war escalates  After all  their profits aren t getting eroded due to

under tremendous pressure this year so far  partly due to rise in bond yields  But as the markets are plagued by trade related uncertainty  defensive stocks are moving north  After all  such stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the broader market  Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from utilities and consumer staples Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity  gas and water are essentials  Food  beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations A notable company from the   CenterPoint Energy  Inc  s   NYSE CNP   expected growth rate

Outlet also carries a Zacks Rank  2 Domestic Producers Outperform MultinationalsDespite escalating trade concerns  domestic producers remain fairly immune  This is because such stocks have high domestic exposure in terms of revenue generation  which shields them from the aftermath of international disputes  On the contrary  trade issues are headwinds for bigwigs as these erode overseas profits One such domestic player as per Goldman is Roper Technologies  Inc    NYSE ROP    The conglomerate derives a meagre 10  of revenues from China  The company s expected growth rate for the current quarter is 20 5  compared with the  industry s estimated rally of 5 8   Roper Technologies has a Zacks Rank  2 Companies with Solid Growth Narratives Emerge WinnersNot all multinationals  though  are bearing the brunt of escalating trade tensions  Notable  among them are Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Axon Enterprise  Inc    NYSE X    This is because their long term growth narrative will not be affected by a trade war  And why so  Google s growth is dependent on an uptick in digital advertising  while Facebook s growth is also mostly in digital advertising space  Needless to say that digital advertising industry is hardly affected by the implementation of tariffs Axon Enterprise  in the meantime  sells an array of digital solutions including cloud data storage systems and mobile video apps to law enforcement agencies throughout the world  Such agencies are in desperate need of a technology makeover  which gives the stock a solid growth narrative and

it  the company has 40 stores in China and operates services such as the App store and Apple Music Not to forget  Apple is dependent heavily on its suppliers  The iPhones are assembled in China by

11227,232742,ROP,Roper Tech  Best Performing Dividend Aristocrat For Past 2 Decades ,opinion,"Roper Technologies Inc  NYSE ROP  has been the best performing Dividend Aristocrat over the last couple of decades  However  Roper is not your typical dividend growth stock  In fact  in many ways I believe the company is better thought of as a growth stock  Nevertheless  growth is a great asset to possess in every investor s toolbox  Thanks to the power of compounding  it s hard to lose money over the long run when investing in a consistent above average grower  Roper Technologies Inc  is a classic example 
In the FAST Graphs analyze out loud video below  I will provide a by the numbers look at Roper Technologies Inc s fundamentals  My objective will be to clearly illustrate where and how its performance has been generated  Although this is not a household name  it s a very interesting company that turns most of its operating cash flow into free cash flow thereby providing it a consistent engine for growth 
Measuring Performance without Simultaneously Measuring Valuation Is a Job Half Done
Dividend Aristocrats are typically thought of as superior dividend income generators  However  many of them have also outperformed the S P 500 on a capital appreciation basis as well  Since the beginning of 1999  approximately 75  of the Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed the market over the long run solely on a capital appreciation basis  However  100  of the Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed the S P 500 on a total dividend income paid basis over that time frame  Therefore  it should be obvious that high quality blue chip dividend paying stocks tend to be better than average long term investments 
Moreover  from a total return perspective  there are numerous Dividend Aristocrats that have produced double digit total returns since 1999  while the S P 500 has only averaged a 6  annualized total return  However  Roper Technologies Inc  has outperformed all others by a significant margin  On the other hand  this best performing Dividend Aristocrat also offers the lowest current yield than any of its counterparts  Perhaps even more interestingly  this Dividend Aristocrat has been one of the fastest growing  but not the fastest growing Aristocrat 
The point I m driving at is that when evaluating performance  it s very important to recognize and understand precisely how that performance was generated  Over the years as a value investor  I have emphatically stated many times   measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  
Over normal times  or when the market is behaving rationally  long term performance will primarily be a function of how well the business performs on an operating basis  In other words  there is an indisputable long term correlation between business results and stock price movements  Additionally  if the company pays a dividend  dividends will also be related to the company s operating achievements 
On the other hand  when the market is behaving in an irrational manner or during abnormal times  long term performance can be skewed by either overvaluation or undervaluation  I believe it s critically important that investors understand how valuation has impacted the performance on their individual stocks as well as their overall portfolios  This clarity of understanding will mitigate irrational fear in a bear market or investor complacency in a bull market like we have been experiencing recently 
FAST Graphs analyze out loud video  Valuing Roper Technologies Inc  in Multiple Ways
There are numerous ways to examine and then ascertain the fair value of a business public or private  I am often asked what I think is the best metric to use when trying to determine fair value  My answer to this question is simple and straightforward  I believe that investors should evaluate any stock they are examining over as many valuation metrics as they can  Therefore  my stock answer is to utilize every valuation resource at your disposal 
On the other hand  there are often certain metrics that apply best to specific companies  In the case of Roper Technologies Inc   I believe the best metric to evaluate valuation with is EBITDA  As I will illustrate in the video portion  Roper Technologies Inc  is unique in that the vast majority of its operating cash flow is free cash flow 

Summary and Conclusions
if you judge a stock investment solely on its historical price performance  it becomes very easy to overlook important reasons why the performance has occurred  If significant overvaluation is involved  you can fall into a complacency trap and ignore the risks that you are facing going forward  In contrast  if significant undervaluation is involved  you can easily see risk when in fact opportunity is being manifest  Consequently  the moral of the story is to make sure you measure fundamentals relative to recent price action  It is only through an evaluation of understanding of both the true insight can be had

government s announcement of the U S  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed last December  Soon after that  fears of inflation and imposition of import tariffs of 25  on steel and 10  on aluminum stalled the positive momentum  Then  the recent joint attack by the United States  Britain and France on Syria rocked the world  leaving many pondering over its possible after effects Notwithstanding these issues  equity investors must closely follow the financial releases for the first quarter of 2018  Though results of some banking stocks failed to impress the market  we believe that important releases

11247,232762,ROP,5 Income Plays For 25 More Years Of Dividend Growth,opinion,"Have you always wanted to buy a safe stock like Coca Cola  NYSE KO  and get rich from it like Warren Buffett 
It s doable  But most investors  live in the past  and fixate on dividend track records rather than a payout s forward prospects  And looking ahead is the key to yearly gains of 10   15  or even 20  or more with dividend aristocrats 
Let s look at Coke  which achieved its dividend royalty status in 1987  its 25th straight year with a dividend hike   The firm hit its coronation with a head of steam  rewarding investors with a 362  payout hike in just five years  from 1986 to 1991   Its stock price raced to keep up with its dividend  rising 234  over the same time period 
Great Dividend Growth  Great Returns 
It didn t really matter if you bought shares before or after the company was officially a dividend aristocrat  The driving factor for profits was the dividend s velocity   it was moving higher quickly  so its stock price followed 
Fast forward to the last five years  and we see that Coke s youthful exuberance has slowed considerably  The firm still hikes its payout every year  but it s a slower climb   totaling 45  over the past five years  Which means its stock price merely plods along too   25  in five years  
Average Dividend Growth  Average Returns 
Why is Coke s dividend slowing down  Simple   just look at the top line 
Shrinking Business is Bad for Payouts
It sounds obvious  but income investors often wade so deep into the dividend weeds that they ignore obvious cues   such as shrinking sales 
Let s add Coke s top line into the last chart  and we ll see that the fact that the payout is growing at all is an act of financial wizardry 
Shrinking Sales Slow the Dividend 
Coke s top line has shrunk by 22  over the last five years  Which makes its dividend growth quite the feat 
Contrast this with the 1986 to 1991 period  when the company was younger and still growing  It boosted its sales by 30  over that time period 
Of course it s possible to grow payouts faster than profits and sales  In fact  this is what often happens with dividend payers  But even the most gifted managers can only squeeze so much in payouts from a shrinking pie  It s better to focus on businesses with the winds at their backs 
And That Can Include Spry Aristocrats  Too
In a minute  we ll discuss five Dividend Aristocrats that have years and even decades of profitable runway ahead 
Coke s future business prospects don t pass my taste test  Consumers are turning away from its core product of sugary beverages  The company knows this  and is expanding into other segments such as health and energy beverages   but it s forced to pay up for hot products 
 Which is why I m actually worried that Coke could be the next GE  It s following a similar problematic path   a pricey acquisition binge to patch its leaky sales bucket  
We re better off focusing on companies that are generating sales and profit growth organically  From there  we choose the firms that are financially fit enough to dish an increasing amount of their profits back to their shareholders every year 
That s how you buy the best dividend aristocrats  those that will keep their titles for years and even decades ahead  Here s a five pack with well positioned businesses for 2018  2028 and 2038 and beyond 
Medtronic  NYSE MDT  Dividend Yield  2 2 
Medtronic  MDT  is a medical device company that has its hands in numerous areas  About 35  of its revenues come from its cardiac and vascular group  a third from minimally invasive therapies  a quarter from restorative therapies and the remaining 6  from its diabetes group 
At the ground level  that means Medtronic makes devices such as insulin pumps  aortic stents  heart valves  electrosurgical instruments  tracheostomy tubes and surgical imaging systems 
The view from 10 000 feet is incredible  Healthcare costs have been rocketing unchecked seemingly forever  and the aging of the baby boomers is only helping to drive up demand for these life lengthening products  These trends aren t stopping anytime soon  with healthcare costs expected to climb 5 5  annually between 2017 and 2026  when they re expected to reach  5 7 trillion 
The company s most recent quarterly report exemplifies Medtronic s continued growth  including a 10  top line boost from its cardiac and vascular products  Net sales overall were a little slow  growing 1 2  to  7 4 billion  but they did beat estimates  More importantly  analysts expect the bottom line to grow in the high single digits for at least the next five years 
MDT also is generously expanding its dividend  which has grown by 64  since 2014  The company s projected profit growth  as well as a payout ratio of about 39  of this year s expected profits  means Medtronic should have plenty of ability to improve its dividend in the years and even decades ahead 
Becton  Dickinson and Company  NYSE BDX  Dividend Yield  1 3 
Becton  Dickinson  BDX  is another medical device company that  like Medtronic  spans numerous healthcare needs  Becton s product lineup covers areas ranging from anesthesia delivery  diabetes care and cervical cancer screening to infection protection  molecular diagnostics and specimen collection 
It s also one of the few companies that can actually claim to have swallowed up a fellow Dividend Aristocrat 
Near the end of 2017  Becton  Dickinson completed the acquisition of C R  Bard  itself a medical tech company that specialized in vascular  surgical and oncology products  among others  The deal is expected to  generate low single digit accretion to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2018  and high single digit accretion in fiscal year 2019  
As a result  Wall Street is high on Becton  Dickinson s prospects for the years ahead  Analysts project average annual earnings growth of 14  for the next half decade  including a 16  bump in 2018 
Meanwhile  BDX should extend its 46 year dividend growth streak sometime later this year  Since 2014  the payout has plumped up by a healthy 38   and there s ample room to continue considering a meager 27  payout ratio based on 2018 s projected profits 
Becton  Dickinson  BDX   A Healthy Health Care Dividend Raiser 
Praxair  NYSE PX  Dividend Yield  2 1 
Praxair  PX  is proof of the concept that  boring is beautiful  
This is an industrial gases company that produces carbon dioxide  argon and oxygen  among other common gases  not to mention other specialty gases  mixtures and even handling equipment  In fact  Praxair even goes a step further by providing whole management and delivery systems  doing everything from cleaning to leak detection to inspection 
The beauty of Praxair is that industrial gases tend to be critical to operations but also a small portion of costs  Meanwhile  the company deals in contracts that are up to 20 years in length  meaning that it has some extremely established customers it can rely on to keep driving cash flow 
At the moment  Praxair is working on asset sales to facilitate its planned merger with German chemical giant Linde Group AG  The marriage should create  1 2 billion in annual cost and capex synergies and efficiencies 
PX is a newcomer to the Aristocrats  joining Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP  and A O  Smith  NYSE AOS  in 2018 after   Expect it to keep up its membership well into the future  with analysts expecting double digit annual profit growth for the next five years at a minimum 
3M  3M Company  NYSE MMM  Dividend Yield  1 9 
Yes  I m well aware that 3M  MMM  doesn t exactly look like its sterling self right now  After all  the name behind Post it Notes  Scotch Tape  Thinsulate and Nexcare healthcare products is coming off a rough first quarter earnings report in which it guided both its full year organic growth rate and profits lower 
But take heart 
3M shares are now off nearly 14  in 2018   one of the largest pullbacks in MMM in years  That gives investors the chance to jump into one of the most successful industrial companies on the planet for   well  at just less than times forward earnings  not exactly a bargain  but a more reasonable price than investors have been offered for some time 
3M  MMM  Hits a Bump in the Road   Not a Mountain 
3M  after all  offers more than 55 000 products that cover everything from adhesives to dental implements to fire protection to car care  3M generally benefits from a growing global economy  and its outstanding product diversification means that if one area slumps   
Despite the Q1 warning  analysts still are expecting 9  plus annual profit growth on average for the next five years  Meanwhile  MMM just celebrated its 60th consecutive dividend increase   a 16  improvement that keeps 3M among the ranks of the longest serving Dividend Aristocrats 
Ecolab  NYSE ECL  Dividend Yield  1 1 
Ecolab  ECL  is one of the   serving boring but vital functions while mostly keeping out of the public eye  But while most consumers haven t heard of Ecolab  they ve certainly benefited from its products 
ECL is responsible for keeping the power on  keeping the water flowing and keeping everything you come in contact with clean 
Ecolab s Nalco Water division provides water treatment technologies for large scale industries such as refining and petrochemicals  This helps companies save money by conserving water and energy  plus keeps them in line with ever changing environmental regulations  but also helping them save money by conserving water and energy  Ecolab also dabbles in everything from kitchen equipment repair to dishwashing solutions to pool and spa maintenance  for customers ranging from businesses to schools to government organizations 
Ecolab generates more than  1 billion in free cash flow every year  and the company is modeling as much as 16  earnings growth next year  while analysts are looking for a 15  pop  In fact  they re pretty bullish on the company s prospects even further into the future  with Wall Street s pros looking for 13  annual bottom line growth from now through 2023 
That  as well as a conservative 30  payout ratio  should keep the dividend hikes going well past Ecolab s 26 year increase streak 
How to Retire on 8  Dividends Paid EVERY MONTH
Dividend Aristocrats like 3M and Ecolab are impressive dividend growers  but a portfolio too reliant on Aristocrats will leave your retirement portfolio in haggard shape  In fact  with an average yield of less than 2   the Aristocrats deliver less income than the 10 year T note 

However  I have a  that not only will pay you 4 times more  but will pay you 3 times more often 
When you retire  chances are you ll be relying heavily on dividend income to get you through your regular expenses  the house  the car  power   you name it  But while most publicly traded companies tend to pay dividends out quarterly  your bills sure aren t quarterly  They come every single month  rain or shine 
That s why monthly dividend stocks make so much sense for long term retirement planners  A reliable stream of income that doesn t vary from month to month allows you to budget with precision  And with the right plan  you can collect  3 000 plus in dividends every single month   and do it with a smaller nest egg than even the suits at Merrill Lynch say you need to retire well 
My  checks off every box investors need from retirement 

Monthly income to use against your monthly bills 
Dividends large enough to allow you to live off investment income entirely  That means no selling your stocks and shrinking your nest egg  which ultimately shrinks your regular dividend paycheck 
Better returns on any dividends you choose to reinvest  If you don t need the income from your portfolio right away  you don t have to wait every three months to put dividends to work   you can sink them back into new investments just about every 30 days 

These monthly dividend payers include a few picks that have remained mostly under the radar despite their high payouts and general quality  For instance  this portfolio includes an 8 7  payer trading at a bizarre 5 3  discount to NAV  and a steady Eddy high yielder that barely blinks when stocks plummet

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ROP due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Roper Technologies Beats on Q1 Earnings  Ups  18 ViewRoper reported first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of  2 61 per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 49 and improved 24  on a year over year basis Adjusted revenues of  1 2 billion rose 9  year over year  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 16 billion  Organic revenues grew 6   while acquisitions divestitures contributed 1  to the top line growth The company enjoyed exceptional operational execution and broad based growth in all its segments  The company s software and network businesses maintained the momentum and the product businesses delivered robust growth as well as strong operating leverage Segment DetailsFor the quarter  Medical   Scientific Imaging revenues increased 5 2  year over year to  366 3 million  while RF Technology revenues surged 12 1  from the year ago quarter to  481 6 million Industrial Technology revenues increased 17 8  year over year to  216 1 million  Also  revenues from Energy Systems   Controls grew 10 7  year over year to  138 5 million Adjusted gross margin expanded 30 basis points  bps  to 62 5  in the quarter Segment wise  Medical   Scientific Imaging  Industrial Technology and gross margins contracted 100 bps and 50 bps  respectively  However  RF Technology and Energy Systems   Controls gross margins expanded 410 bps and 40 bps  respectively GuidanceBuoyed by the robust performance  Roper Technologies raised 2018 guidance  The company expects adjusted earnings between  11 08 and  11 32  up from the previous range of  10 88  11 20 For second quarter 2018  Roper Technologies projects adjusted earnings between  2 65 and  2 71 per share 
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower 
Roper Technologies  Inc  Price and Consensus   VGM Scores
At this time  ROP has an average Growth Score of C  a grade with the same score on the momentum front  Charting a somewhat similar path  the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side  putting it in the bottom 40  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Zacks  style scores indicate that the company s stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  Interestingly  ROP has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-05-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-roper-technologies-rop-down-17-since-its-last-earnings-report-200317762,200317762
11250,232765,ROP,Roper Technologies  ROP  Set To Acquire PowerPlan For  1 1B,opinion,"Roper Technologies   NYSE ROP   recently announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire PowerPlan   a major provider of software and solutions from private equity firm  Thoma Bravo  This  1 1 billion all cash deal is expected to close in the second quarter 
PowerPlan is a provider of software solutions for asset centric businesses  This Atlanta  GA based company s well recognized software platform  which integrates detailed financial and operational data  helps in the optimization of customers  financial performance and reduces compliance risk 
Existing Business Scenario
Roper holds a dominant position in most markets where it operates  Additionally  the company has an optimum mix of highly engineered  niche oriented products that helps it to gain market share  Although Roper operates in a cyclical business environment  its diversified revenue stream has helped the company to counter the headwinds  We believe that Roper s innovative product pipeline will be a major catalyst over the long term 
Moreover  the company s unique asset light business model allows it to remain less dependent on large scale production equipment  This enables the company to remain profitable even when sales decline during recession  Notably  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company has gained 7 9  in the past six months  outperforming the  s increase of 0 5  

Roper s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to strengthen its business and gain market share  In this regard  the ConstructConnect and the Deltek buyouts are worth mentioning as these acquisitions have reinforced the company s software and network businesses  We believe that the successful integration of the acquisitions should supplement Roper s top line performance  moving ahead 
Other Stocks to Consider
Some other top ranked stocks from the same space are Graco Inc    NYSE GGG    IDEX Corp    NYSE IEX   and Nordson Corp    NASDAQ NDSN    While Graco sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   IDEX and Nordson carry a Zacks Rank of 2  You can see  
Graco surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 12 8  
IDEX outpaced estimates in the preceding four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 3 1  
Nordson exceeded estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 3 9

11258,232773,ROP,4 Future Dividend Aristocrats With 87  Upside,opinion,"What s the best way to add the consistent income growth of the Dividend Aristocrats to your portfolio without paying the  royalty premium  of these popular  well covered stocks 
Buy  em while they re young 
Right now  there are a handful of stocks I want to show you today that are knocking on the door of Dividend Aristocrats membership  We re talking only one to three years shy of the 25 year benchmark of consecutive annual dividend increases 
That means they still boast more than two decades  worth of higher payouts  which is plenty of proof that they ve got bulletproof financials and put shareholders  interests on a pedestal 
These stocks usually boast more upside than their more experienced counterparts  too  Let s consider the performance of the three newest Aristocrats   Praxair  NYSE PX   Smith AO Corporation  NYSE AOS  and Roper Technologies Inc  NYSE ROP  over the past few years  They ve delivered total returns  including dividends  between 36  and 87  
Fresh Faced Dividend Aristocrats Deliver Returns Up to 87 
Today  there are a handful of Aristocrat hopefuls that are close to the royal court  Two of them have potential similar to what we ve seen out of A O  Smith and Roper Technologies   which means they could quickly double from here 
But not all inductees are buys   I ve also identified two almost Aristocrats that we should avoid 
Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS Dividend Yield  3 1 Dividend Hike Streak  24 years
Essex Property Trust  ESS  is about to become a rarity  The apartment real estate investment trust  REIT  is just a year away from becoming only the second REIT in the Dividend Aristocrats   Federal Realty Investment Trust  FRT  is currently the only real estate play in the 53 member group   Such an announcement likely will come in February 2019  
Essex  which manages multifamily apartment communities in the West Coast   including Southern California  Northern California and Seattle   went public in 1994  but has been in the real estate game since 1971  Essex s geographic concentration means the REIT has been  and will continue to be  a beneficiary of the boom in technology  in fact  the headquarters of the 10 biggest publicly traded tech companies by market capitalization are all located within Essex s markets 
This REIT may be putting together an impressive dividend growth streak  but that s not because actual business growth is anywhere near  mature   The company s funds from operations  FFO  have exploded by nearly 380  over the past decade  And Essex kept its growth story going in Q1 of this year  recording 5  FFO growth  raising its full year FFO growth forecast   and  of course  expanding its dividend by 6 3  
Essex Property Trust  ESS  Is Riding Tech s Coattails to Riches
It s not often that a REIT deserves to be called  exciting   but Essex is worthy 
Realty Income Corp  NYSE O Dividend Yield  5 Dividend Hike Streak  24 years
Realty Income  O  has staked its reputation to its dividend  which admittedly has a pretty impressive track record  The self proclaimed  monthly dividend company  has paid 574 consecutive monthly dividends  increased its payout for 82 consecutive quarters  and boasts 4 7  compound annualized dividend growth since its 1994 IPO  Moreover  like Essex  the company is just one year away from Dividend Aristocracy 
No one is questioning Realty Income s legitimacy on the dividend front  It s for real 
However  even Realty Income s impressive dividend growth and elevated income level   at 5   O shares are yielding near the high end of their five year range   isn t enough reward for  
Realty Income  O   A Good Yield  But at What Price 
  and even though it has lost a quarter of its value since then  I still don t like the value prospects here given the harsh realities Realty Income faces 
That s because Realty Income is a retail REIT  and thus is in Amazon s crosshairs  Sure  some of its tenants include the likes of LA Fitness  no threat from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   and FedEx  NYSE FDX   FDX  which actually benefits from Amazon at the moment   it also leases out single tenant properties to the likes of Walgreens  WBA  and Kroger  NYSE KR  that absolutely are in the path of the e commerce wrecking ball 
Realty Income might not lose you money in the next few years  but it ll face an uphill climb to cover any significant ground 
Five percent remains respectable today  It puts the stock s payout on a perch just above the safest fixed income investments  like Treasuries  
But is 5   enough compensation given that O s property holding are shakier than ever  I m not sure  As a retail landlord  it s a crapshoot every month as to which rents are going to get paid   and 
Instead of gambling on O  I d prefer to bet on surer things   like bonds that will actually rise in value as rates continue to climb 
Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST Dividend Yield  0 9 Dividend Hike Streak  24 years
Close your eyes and think about a stock that is trading near all time highs  has ripped off 152  gains in five years and has generated double digit annual profit growth for the past half decade 
Open your eyes  What did you imagine  A hot chip stock  Maybe a defense contractor or a biopharma play 
Nope  Those stats belong to discount retailer Ross Stores  ROST  
Wait  Seriously 
It seems almost unimaginable to be bullish about brick and mortar retailers given that looming Amazon threat  But there are a couple of exceptions  and Ross Stores   which has 1 409 stores across 37 states  the District of Columbia and Guam   is one of them 
Ross delivers brand names at deep discount prices  even undercutting rival TJX Companies Inc  NYSE TJX  TJ Maxx brand by about 33   That s enough to keep people coming through its doors even as customers flee other brick and mortar outfits  The company actually recorded 4  same store sales growth last year   a figure that would make most other fashion retailers chartreuse with envy 
Better still  Wall Street s pros are modeling 10  annual profit growth for the next five years  Moreover  the company has put up 165  dividend growth over the past five years but still has a payout ratio of less than 20  
Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD   JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP  and Macy s Inc  NYSE M  are toast  But Ross Stores looks like the truth 
International Business Machines  NYSE IBM Dividend Yield  4 2 Dividend Hike Streak  23 years
International Business Machines  IBM  has done at least one thing right this year  It got the sales monkey off its back  In January of this year  the company reported a modest 4  year over year improvement in revenues   good enough to snap a 22 quarter streak of sales declines 
But Big Blue remains a big disappointment 
Dividend Growth Doesn t Matter If Everything Else Is Plunging
IBM shares have essentially been dead money for a decade as the enterprise tech fell behind in the race to the cloud and spent years trying to catch up  Admittedly  IBM at least has its head in the right place  focusing on the cloud  cybersecurity and data analytics  but its lousy push off the starting blocks really set the company back 
The most recent quarter wasn t exactly encouraging  While IBM did beat on the top and bottom lines  profit margins were helped by a one time tax gain and  backing that out  weren t exactly up to snuff  Moreover  revenues from its so called  strategic imperatives   those growthier cloud and data initiatives  among others  merely met expectations  discouraging analysts 
Also disappointing was IBM s dividend increase  which came in at less than 5    one of its cheapest hikes in years  A plateauing dividend is often a problematic sign 
How to Retire on 8  Dividends Paid EVERY MONTH
Relying on dividend growth from the likes of IBM will leave your retirement portfolio in tatters  In fact  even relying on Dividend Aristocrats in general could be dangerous   with an average yield of less than 2   the Aristocrats deliver less income than the 10 year T note 

However  I have a  that not only will pay you 4 times more  but will pay you 3 times more often 
When you retire  chances are you ll be relying heavily on dividend income to get you through your regular expenses  the house  the car  power   you name it  But while most publicly traded companies tend to pay dividends out quarterly  your bills sure aren t quarterly  They come every single month  rain or shine 
That s why monthly dividend stocks make so much sense for long term retirement planners  A reliable stream of income that doesn t vary from month to month allows you to budget with precision  And with the right plan  you can collect  3 000 plus in dividends every single month   and do it with a smaller nest egg than even the suits at Merrill Lynch say you need to retire well 
My  checks off every box investors need from retirement 

Monthly income to use against your monthly bills 
Dividends large enough to allow you to live off investment income entirely  That means no selling your stocks and shrinking your nest egg  which ultimately shrinks your regular dividend paycheck 
Better returns on any dividends you choose to reinvest  If you don t need the income from your portfolio right away  you don t have to wait every three months to put dividends to work   you can sink them back into new investments just about every 30 days 

These monthly dividend payers include a few picks that have remained mostly under the radar despite their high payouts and general quality  For instance  this portfolio includes an 8 7  payer trading at a bizarre 5 3  discount to NAV  and an 8 5  payer that not 1 in 1 000 people even know about 
Because these big dividends compound quicker  they ll turbocharge your net worth and allow you to enjoy the retirement you ve worked so dearly to reach  Don t delay

11268,232783,ROP,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Colfax  CFX  Stock For Now,opinion,We have issued an updated research report on Colfax Corporation   NYSE CFX   on Feb 20  Exposure in emerging markets  focus on innovative products and buyouts gains will benefit Colfax in the years ahead  However  industry competition  rising costs and expenses remain prime concerns Colfax carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  4 1 billion Colfax s financial performance was better than expected in two of the last four quarters and in line with expectations in the other two quarters  Average earnings surprise was a positive 4 74   Its Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  2 12 for 2018 and  2 36 for 2019  representing growth of 2 9  and 3 5  from their respective tallies 30 days ago Below we briefly discussed the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring ColfaxBuyouts Keys to Expansion  Over time  acquired assets have helped Colfax leverage benefit from easy penetration into unexplored markets and expanded product offerings  In 2017  TBi and HKS were added to the company s portfolio  While TBi is a leader in robotic torch technology  HKS is a developer of advanced process analytics and sensors  Since these were acquired  the buyouts have been strengthening the company s welding process analytics and robotic welding torches operations in the Fabrication Technology segment  In addition  acquisition of Siemens AG s Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH business has strengthened the company s Howden trading platform Notably  acquired assets increased the company s revenues by 2 7  in 2017 Long Term Growth Potential Solid  Colfax s focus toward the expansion of existing platforms and gaining exposure in new ones will work in its favor in the years ahead  Its two solid platforms are Fabrication Technology and Air   Gas Handling  These businesses have been serving customers in the oil   gas  general industrial  mining  marine and many others end markets  Also  the company is working hard on improving its operations in emerging markets including China  India  Brazil and others Over the long run  three to five years   the company anticipates organic growth in the range of 1 2  above GDP and segment margins in the mid teens level Impressive Projections for 2018  For 2018  Colfax anticipates that its Fabrication Technology business will gain from new products and its initiatives directed to improve customer service and operational efficiency while its Air   Gas Handling business will improve on the back of investment in growth markets and restructuring initiatives Adjusted earnings per share in the year are anticipated to be within the  2 00  2 15 range  increasing from  1 74 recorded in 2017  Organic revenue growth is predicted to be flat to up 2  Factors Working Against ColfaxRising Costs   Expenses  High Debts Remain Issues  Colfax is currently dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses  In the fourth quarter of 2017  its cost of sales grew 7 8  year over year while selling  general and administrative expenses expanded 17   Margin profile was weak in the quarter as gross margin slipped 20 basis points  bps  year over year and adjusted operating margin fell 200 bps  Moreover  the company s long term debt balance at the quarter end was approximately  1 1 billion  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs and expenses and high debt levels can prove to be detrimental to the company s profitability in the quarters ahead Threat From Industry Competition and International Expansion  Colfax s Air and Gas Handling business faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses  Also  other companies operating in the welding space provide stiff competition to its Fabrication Technology business In addition  international expansion has exposed the company to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues  Also  as the company has to procure raw materials from suppliers both in the United States and international markets  it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations associated with policies and issues of the source countries Headwinds From Global Uncertainty  End markets served by Colfax are highly susceptible to global economic conditions  Lower level of industrial activities and difficult financial conditions in countries  where the company operates  will adversely hurt its sales  earnings and cash flow Share Price Performance   Key PicksIn the last three months  Colfax s shares have lost 9   underperforming 3 3  gain recorded by the  Some stocks worth considering in the industry are Applied

11272,232787,ROP,Here s Why You Must Hold On To Altra Industrial  AIMC  Stock,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Altra Industrial Motion Corporation   NASDAQ AIMC   on Feb 26  Strengthening of the end markets  focus on cost control and buyout gains are likely to benefit the company in the quarters ahead  However  industry competition  rising costs and expenses remain its prime concerns The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  1 3 billion Altra Industrial s financial performance was better than expected in three of the last four quarters and below expectations in one quarter  Average earnings surprise was a positive 11 13   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings is pegged at  2 44 per share  representing 5 2  growth from the tally a month ago Below we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring Altra IndustrialLong Term Growth Potential Solid  Altra Industrial s focus toward penetrating into the new and unexplored markets and expansion of existing ones will work in the stock s favor  The company s three business segments   Clutches   Brakes  Electromagnetic Clutches   Brakes and Gearing   serve various end markets including energy  general industrial  material handling  metals  mining  special machinery  turf and garden and transportation Also  measures undertaken to control costs and improving the margin profile will work in its favor  Per these restructuring and cost saving strategies  the company intends to lower the strength of its facilities by 20 30  and improve its supply chain worldwide In the long term  the company anticipates revenue growth in excess of the Gross Domestic Product while it aims to expand its operating margin by 150 basis points on strategic pricing Buyouts   Key to Expansion  Over time  acquired assets have helped Altra Industrial leverage benefit from easy penetration into markets and expanded product offerings  In December 2016  the company acquired Stromag   a well known tailored engineered solution provider for customers in various markets   from GKN  LON GKN  plc  The buyout added Stromag s products including clutches and brakes  flexible couplings  limit switches and friction discs to the company s portfolio  Notably  synergistic benefits from the Stromag acquisition contributed 20 3  to net sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 Impressive Projections for 2018  Altra Industrial Motion anticipates gaining from improvements in the majority of the end markets  especially in turf and garden  material handling  metals and mining plus a solid product portfolio The company s net sales are anticipated within  895  915 million range in 2018  above  876 7 million generated in 2017  While non GAAP earnings are projected at  2 30  2 43 per share  up from  2 05 in the previous year  Estimated tax rate of 25 27  will result in cash benefits of  3 7 million Factors Working Against Altra IndustrialRising Costs   Expenses Remain Issues  Altra Industrial is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses  In the fourth quarter of 2017  its cost of sales grew 31 8  year over year while selling  general and administrative expenses rose 18 7   Moreover  research and development expenses increased 38 5   Margin profile was weak in the quarter as gross margin slipped 120 basis points  bps  year over year and non GAAP operating margin fell 30 bps  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs and expenses can be detrimental to the company s profitability in the quarters ahead Industry Competition and International Expansion  Altra Industrial faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses  Also  difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services  apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market might hurt the company s competitive edge  In addition  global expansion has exposed the company to risks arising from negative movements in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues  Also  as the company has to procure raw materials from suppliers in both domestic and international markets  it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations associated with policies and issues of the source countries Headwinds From Global Uncertainty  End markets served by Altra Industrial are susceptible to global economic conditions  Lower level of industrial activities and difficult financial positions in countries wherein the company operates  are likely to affect its sales  earnings and cash flow In the last three months  Altra Industrial s shares have declined 5   underperforming 4 6  gain recorded by the it belongs to

meaningful buyouts are key drivers for the company  On the flip side  cost and debts  as well as risks related to international operations  remain concerns The company  with a market capitalization of approximately  7 9 billion  carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Below  we briefly discussed the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring NordsonShare Price Performance and Earnings Estimates Revision  Nordson s financial performance was better than expected in three of the last four quarters and in line with expectations in one quarter  Average earnings surprise was a positive 3 91  In the last three months  the company s shares have yielded 6 9  return  outperforming 1  decline of the  Underpinning the favorable sentiments reflects positive revisions in earnings estimates for the stock  In the last 30 days  five brokerage firms have raised estimates for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019  Currently  the stock s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  6 33 for fiscal 2018  ending October 2018  and  7 05 for fiscal 2019  ending October 2019   representing the growth of 0 8  and 2 8  from their respective tallies  30 days ago Near  and Long Term Growth Potential Solid  Nordson operates through three business segments   Adhesive Dispensing Systems  Advanced Technology Systems and Industrial Coating Systems   largely minimizing its risks of loss from poor performance of any single group  Also  a vast customer base in various end markets  including packaging  non wovens  polymer processing  products assembly  electronic systems  fluid management  test and inspection  container coating  curing and drying systems  liquid finishing and powder coating  is beneficial  Moreover  the company s commitment toward rewarding shareholders through dividends will continue building positive sentiments  In August 2017  the company hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 11  For second quarter fiscal 2018  the company anticipates sales to increase in the range of 9 13  year over year  including the 7  contribution from buyouts and 5  from favorable foreign currency movements Over the long term  2018 to 2023   the company anticipates revenue growth to be roughly twice the global GDP percentage while aiming to improve its operating margin in excess of revenue growth percentage Buyouts   Key to Expansion  Over time  acquired assets have helped Nordson penetrate into the new and unexplored markets and expand operations in existing ones  In calendar 2017  the company acquired certain assets of ACE Production Technologies  Inc   100  shares of Plas Pak Industries  Inc   InterSelect GmbH and Advanced Technologies business of Vention Medical  All these assets have strengthened the company s businesses under Advanced Technology Systems segment Further  the company acquired Sonoscan  Inc  in January 2018  while its subsidiary   Nordson ASYMTEK   added the PCP product lines of Infiniti Dosing o m s  to its portfolio in the same month  The

approximately  1 258 8 million while exiting the quarter  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs and expenses  and huge debt levels can be detrimental to the company s profitability in the quarters ahead Threats From International Expansion  Global expansion has exposed Nordson to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies  Also  uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served can severely impact the company s businesses  Notably  the company has operations in more than 35 countries with manufacturing facilities in the United States  the People s Republic of China  Germany  Mexico  Netherlands  Thailand and the United Kingdom Industry Competition  Nordson faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses  Also  difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services  apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market  might hurt

11276,232791,ROP,Gain Exposure To Industrial Machinery With These 5 Stocks,opinion,The U S  market is abuzz with President Trump s import tariffs on steel and aluminium and its subsequent impact on various industries  Evidently  domestic steel and aluminium producing companies will emerge as prime winners while those using these metals as raw material and relying heavily on imports will likely lose  Industrial machinery  we believe  will likely feel the heat of the import tariffs in the form of higher production costs and rise in competitive threats from international players Despite these possible headwinds  we believe that the country s industrial machinery has strong growth potential and offers solid investment options for investors seeking exposure in the space  Before proceeding further  we like to mention here that industrial machinery is grouped under   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors Industrial Products   At the ApexLast year  the sector gained 18 6  while it has rallied roughly 0 9  in the last three months  The industrial stocks  performance has been impressive in the fourth quarter of 2017  Earnings in the quarter grew 34 8  year over year while revenues increased 14 5   Both earnings and revenue beat in the quarter came in at 83 3  Currently  the sector is in the top 6   holding the first position among all the Zacks sectors  This clearly shows that the majority of the industries within this sector performed well in the past few months and looks poised for growth in the coming quarters  Per the  report dated Mar 7  earnings for industrial stocks are projected to grow 23 7  in the first quarter of 2018 while sales are likely to increase 12 3  Currently  the machinery industry dealing with material handling products and electrical products is in the top 2  of the 265 industries comprising the Zacks sectors while those dealing with construction and mining equipment and thermal products are in the top 5  Other machinery industry that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipments is in the top 14   industrial electronics in 22   industrial tools and providing related services in 11  and companies serving general industrial purposes in 30  Going by the Zacks rule  we see that machinery sub industries mentioned above  fall in the top half  These sub industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry What s Driving Industrial Machinery We believe that healthy domestic requirements and strong export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country  Per the U S  Census Bureau report  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 11 4  year over year in January 2018 led by growth in orders for farm  construction  mining  industrial  material handling and metal working machineries Also  the country s industrial production increased 3 7  year over year in January driven by impressive growth in mining  manufacturing and utilities output  The latest report issued by the Institute for Supply Management reveals that Purchasing Managers  Index or manufacturing index grew roughly 2 9  in February over the previous month  We believe that these economic indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry Also  the U S  machinery companies will gain from the implementation of the government s  1 trillion investment plan for infrastructure improvement  strengthening housing market and new job additions  Moreover  efforts aimed to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery

for 2018 and  8 39 for 2019  representing growth of 5 6  and 4 9  from their respective tallies  60 days ago Near  and Long Term Growth Potential Solid  Illinois Tool Works operates through seven business segments   Test   Measurement and Electronics  Automotive OEM  Polymers   Fluids  Food Equipment  Welding  Construction Products and Specialty Products   largely minimizing its risks of loss from the poor performance of any group  Also  a vast customer base in various end markets  including automotive original equipment manufacturer  automotive aftermarket  general industrial  commercial food equipment  construction and others  is beneficial  Moreover  its 80 20 business process will help it achieve higher operating margins  better capital efficiency and solid return on invested capital For the first quarter of 2018  the company anticipates GAAP earnings to be  1 80  1 90 per share  Organic revenues are expected to grow 3 4  in the quarter  For the full year  GAAP earnings guidance has been increased to  7 45  7 65 per share  reflecting 40 cents growth at the mid point  The increase reflects the positive impact of tax rate cuts to 25 26  and forex gains Over the long term  2018 to 2022   the company anticipates organic revenue growth to be 3 5   operating margin to be in excess of 25   incremental margin to be 35  and earnings per share to grow 8 10  in each year  Also  after tax return on invested capital is projected to be above 20   Free cash flow will likely be more than 100  of the net income Capital Allocation Strategies  Illinois Tool Works follows sound capital allocation strategies  under which it makes meaningful acquisitions for business expansion  invests for the enhancement of its organic growth and rewards shareholders handsomely Over time  acquisitions have helped in the development of the company s core segments while creating new platforms for expanding long term growth opportunities  Since it got acquired in July 2016  the Engineered Fasteners and Components business has strengthened the company s Automotive OEM business The company remains committed toward returning value to shareholders  It raised quarterly dividend rate by 20  in August 2017 and intends to increase the dividend payout rate from 43  to 50  of free cash in August 2018  Earlier  the company expected the dividend rate increment in 2020  However  this increment is still subject to the company s board approval Factors Working Against Illinois Tool WorksThreats From International Expansion  Global expansion has exposed Illinois Tool Works to risks rising from adverse movements in foreign currencies  Also  uncertainties in economic growth of the countries served can severely impact its businesses  Its products are sold in 56 countries  Notably  it sourced nearly 56  of its revenues from its international operations Huge Debts Raise Concerns  Illinois Tool Works  long term debt was approximately  7 5 billion exiting the fourth quarter of 2017  We believe  if unchecked  huge debt levels will increase its financial obligations and hence  prove detrimental to its profitability Industry Competition  Illinois Tool Works faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses  Also  difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services  apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market  might hurt its competitive edge Some key players in the industry  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   are Applied Industrial Technologies

11286,232801,ROP,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Caterpillar  Stanley Black   Decker  Deere  Roper Technologies And Rockwell Automation,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 4  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Industrial Machinery  including Caterpillar  Inc    NYSE CAT    Stanley Black   Decker  Inc    NYSE SWK    Deere   Company   NYSE DE    Roper Technologies  Inc    NYSE ROP   and Rockwell Automation Inc    NYSE ROK   Industry  Industrial MachineryLink  The cyclical nature of industrial machinery demand is benefiting from the synchronized global growth backdrop  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  recently raised its outlook for the global economy  with the financial institution anticipating the world economy to grow 3 6  in 2017  It expects 2 2  rise in advanced economies and 4 6  growth in emerging nations  Global output is projected to increase 3 7  in 2018  including 2  growth for advanced nations and 4 9  improvement for emerging countries We believe that continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery  Moreover  healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations  especially in emerging countries  are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment  Further  need for better infrastructure and residential and non residential spaces require heavy construction machineries Machinery stocks are broadly grouped under   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The sector has performed well  yielding a solid return of 18 3  year to date  This outpaces growth of 16 9  recorded by the S P 500 and roughly 13 2  by the NYSE Composite Among the S P 500 members  the top five industrial machinery gainers since the beginning of the year include Caterpillar  Inc   Stanley Black   Decker  Inc   Deere   Company  Roper Technologies  Inc  and Rockwell Automation Inc Industrial Machinery  DescriptionIndustrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks  It measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below The United States  The country s industrial production increased2 9  year over year in October driven by impressive growth in mining  manufacturing and utilities output  In September  industrial production increased 1 6  year over year In addition  a few indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry  Per the U S  Census Bureau report new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 6 4  in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction  mining  industrial  material handling and other machineries Also  the job market showed strength  with the recent data indicating 261 000 new job additions in October  Average of new job additions in the last three months was 162 000  accounting for hurricane affects   The unemployment rate dropped 10 basis points  bps  to 4 1   Also  the country s GDP has advanced 3  in the July September quarter We believe that implementation of the Trump government s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks  Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets in the country  To continue supporting the growing economy  the Federal Reserve has hiked its interest rates twice this year while another one might be expected in December The IMF projects the U S  economy to grow 2 2  in 2017 and 2 3  in 2018  These estimates represent increase of 10 bps from the previous projection for 2017 and 20 bps for 2018 Japan The country s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels  an aging population and huge public debt Also  the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3  rise in national sales tax in April 2014 However  strengthening exports driven by rise in automobile and electronic shipments have supported the country s annualized GDP growth of 1 4  in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter  In addition  we believe that initiatives to improve wages are likely to spur domestic demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country s favor in the quarters ahead According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders  an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months increased 4 7  in third quarter 2017  However  the same is predicted to be quite different in the fourth quarter  with total machinery orders likely to decline 1 9   Core orders are expected to fall 3 5   orders from manufacturing clients will likely drop 9 4  and that from government clients might decline 3 3  The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 1 5  for 2017 and by 10 bps to 0 7  for 2018 China China s GDP grew 6 8  from the year earlier period in the third quarter  However  this improvement was slightly below 6 9  registered in the previous quarter as a rise in retail sales and higher exports were partially offset by weak expansion in infrastructure investments The country s industrial production improved 6 6  year over year in September on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors  offset by weakness in the mining sector  Industrial production in October grew 6 2  For 2017  the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6 5   We believe that implementation of the government s plan to spend more than  2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020 will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6 8  in 2017 and 6 5  in 2018  up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates India The country is currently witnessing the after effects of some major reforms  demonetization and goods and services tax   implemented in the trailing 12 months  These economic decisions along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth going forward A favorable domestic job market  low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans  infrastructure investments  healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination The country s industrial production decelerated to 3 8  in September 2017  having expanded 4 5  in the previous month  Production suffered from weakness in mining and electricity outputs  In the first half of fiscal 2017  ended September   industrial production expanded 2 5  year over year According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 6 7  in 2017 and 7 4  in 2018  down roughly 50 bps and 30 bps from the respective previous estimates Brazil One of the major road blocks for the Brazilian economy are the political uncertainties which have gripped the nation  somewhat jeopardizing its growth opportunities  Corruption charges against its president are believed to be one of the reasons behind the country s poor investment grade ratings  Moreover  low private investments  inadequate infrastructure and still a high unemployment rate of 12 4  are other major hurdles Partially negating the impact of these aspects  growth in export demand and efforts to implement a new pension reform targeting the curbing of public debt are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy  Also  falling inflation have prompted the countries  Central Bank to ease interest rates  Notably  the interest rate has been lowered by 75 bps in October  this being its ninth consecutive rate cut since October 2016 In addition  the country s industrial production has been encouraging since the beginning of the year  Per the latest data  industrial production in September grew 2 6  from the year ago comparable month The IMF expects the country s output to grow 0 7  in 2017  reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast  Also  growth projection for 2018 has been increased by 20 bps to 1 5  Eurozone The region  amidst all the political uncertainties  is showing slight improvement in export demand and labor markets  The region s GDP has improved 2 5  year over year in third quarter 2017 while industrial production has improved 3 3  year over year in September  The unemployment rate at September end was 8 9  versus 9  at the end of the previous month The region s GDP when compared with the previous quarter inched up 0 6  versus 0 7  recorded in the second quarter  Industrial production  on a month on month basis  fell 0 6  in September The IMF

economic contraction occasioned by euro zone debt and fiscal issues  again   This has put most of the 17 members in the EMU in or near recession  China  which is a major importer of goods and materials from emerging market countries  has also seen its economy slow  The U S  is not alone in feeling the impact from this as it plods along with slow growth  high unemployment and home prices still weak Clearly  the industrial sector feels the pressure from all these issues Approaching ETFsWe offer general guidance that average investors can utilize without too much trading and is reasonably effective  We do this by using a technical view of conditions from monthly chart views  Simplistically  we recommend longer term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month  simple

performance differences with enhanced  index related ETFs like PRN and FXR  indicate the need for more trading from our view  This may also mean enhanced returns for those willing to trade just a little more It s good to see a small cap sector like PSCI gain more investor acceptance with AUM growing substantially just over the past quarter There is a lot to choose from in terms of indexes linked to industrial sector ETFs  Some are passive and duplicative relatively  It s essential to remember it s really a game of battleship for sponsors seeking to be first to a sector space or just being competitive in the space  This is their business interest apart from your investment interest  You should always ignore their interests and align your choices with what serves your objectives best New ETFs from highly regarded and substantial new providers are also being issued  These include Charles Schwab s ETFs and Scottrade s Focus Shares  which both are issuing new ETFs with low expense ratios and commission free trading at their respective firms  These may also become popular as they become seasoned  As stated with other sectors  remember ETF sponsors must issue and their interests aren t aligned with yours  They have a business interest and wish to have a competitive presence in any popular sector ETF DigestI Exchange Traded Funds for the Global

11351,232866,ROP,Weekly Preview  Focus Shifts From Earnings To Economy,opinion,In the upcoming week  the focus of markets will gradually shift from earnings to the economy  especially later in the week  as key reports including the ECB rate decision and the U S  Non Farm Payrolls report are expected to be released   Key Earnings In the coming week  key earnings from Facebook  FB   Time Warner  TWX   MasterCard  MA   Visa  V   and Newmont Mining  NEM  will be in focus FacebookFacebook is expected to report first quarter EPS of  0 126 vs   0 09 a year ago on Wednesday  May 1  Revenue is expected to come in at  1 44 billion for the quarter compared to  1 058 billion in the same period a year ago Analysts at Wedbush weighed in on the stock ahead of the release   We expect Q1 results at or above consensus  Our current estimates are for revenue of  1 43 billion and EPS of  0 10  compared to consensus of  1 44 billion and  0 12  respectively  The company did not provide guidance   We expect top  line growth to be driven by mobile ad revenue  up 100  q o q to over  300 million in Q4 12  and a slew of targeted ad initiatives  including Custom Audiences and Facebook Exchange   FBX    After launching last September  FBX served nearly 1 billion impressions from over 1 300 advertisers per day by December  EPS growth will likely be driven by operating expense below the levels implied by management   We do not expect management to provide additional FY 13 guidance  On its Q4 12 results call  management cautioned investors to expect opex to increase by   50  in FY 13  We have modeled slightly below this level  as we believe the company has more control over expenses than revenues  By providing such high  level guidance  management provides itself with the flexibility to still deliver a positive earnings result through opex control even if revenue lags expectations   Maintaining our OUTPERFORM rating and our price target of  35  Our price target reflects a value of  60 per MAU at Facebook s peak MAU level with a conservative monetization assumption of  1 per MAU per month for five years  Time WarnerTime Warner is expected to report first quarter EPS of  0 744 vs   0 682 a year ago on Wednesday as well  Revenue is expected to come in at  7 126 billion compared to  6 979 billion in the same period a year ago The analysts at Wedbush also weighed in on this stock ahead of the earnings   For 1Q  we maintain our  0 75  Street   0 74  estimate  as we believe a solid ad market performance at least offset mild box office disappointments  Although we trim our 1Q film estimates  we expect any resulting EBIT shortfall to be offset by Networks  where we believe ad trends have been fairly good   We expect TWX to reaffirm 2013 guidance of low double digit EPS growth  For 2013  we remain comfortable with our assumption that Turner can gain share in a U S  cable ad market tracking to be up  4   and maintain our subscription revenue growth estimate of 6    Raising 12 month price target to  63 from  60 on updated sum of the parts valuation  risks  Our revised SoTP analysis  reflecting a reduced conglomerate discount on account of TWX s plan   announced in March   to split off publishing by year end  supports our PT  MastercardMastercard is expected to report first quarter EPS of  6 17 on Wednesday vs   5 36 a year ago  Revenue is expected to come in at  1 933 billion compared to  1 758 billion in the same period a year ago Analysts at Sterne Agee weighed in ahead of the earnings   With intra quarter data points trending largely as anticipated  we are expecting in  line results for 1Q13  Our EPS estimate of  6 12 is  0 06 below consensus  Foreign currency could have a slightly higher impact than we are modeling  but overall  we are not expecting any major surprises with the results   We will be watching MA s debit volume closely as it appears that Visa is starting to win back some of its lost share  We will also be interested to hear MA s views on the Visa Chase partnership   We recently downgraded MA shares to Neutral from Buy based on  1  the valuation  which we now view as fair  21x 2013E EPS  and in line with where we expected the stock price to reach  and 2  a general lack of positive catalysts in the business   On the margin  we believe that some relative momentum has shifted to Visa and MasterCard faces tougher comps over the next few quarters as it grows over prior debit wins  In addition  we do not see any substantial upside to consensus EPS expectations  VisaVisa is expected to report EPS of  1 81 for the first quarter on Wednesday vs   1 49 a year ago  Revenue is expected to be  2 852 billion compared to  2 547 billion in the same period a year ago The analysts at Sterne Agee also weighed in on Visa ahead of its earnings as well   Visa is scheduled to report F2Q13  March  results on May 1 after the close with a call at 5 00 pm EST  With card volume data points largely as anticipated during the quarter  we are expecting generally in line results and believe that Visa will reiterate its FY13 guidance   We forecast F2Q13 EPS of  1 81  in line with consensus  and revenue of  2 846bn  just below consensus of  2 852bn  We forecast some margin compression from stepped up advertising and marketing spend   March quarter card data trends appear in line  showing a little catch up in March after a weaker than expected February  but strong January  Major card issuers reported average volume growth of 8  y y in the quarter  down from  11  in the December quarter  We had anticipated some slowing at the start of the year due to the increased payroll taxes this year and the delay in Federal tax refunds   We recently downgraded Visa to Neutral from Buy as shares approached our prior  175 price target  We now view the shares as fairly valued and expect the shares to perform in line with the S P 500 over the coming months  Our positive fundamental view on Visa remains unchanged as we still view the stock as the single best long term way to play the secular growth in electronic payments  Newmont MiningNewmont Mining is expected to report first quarter EPS of  0 77 vs   1 14 a year ago on Monday  Revenue is expected to fall to  2 29 billion from  2 683 billion in the same period a year ago Analysts at Deutsche Bank commented on the stock ahead of the earnings   We expect Newmont to report 1Q13 adjusted diluted EPS of  0 75   32  QoQ   35  YoY  on lower volumes  both gold and copper   lower gold prices and higher cash costs  DBe EPS is 4c below FactSet consensus of  0 78   10c in past 2 weeks   However  we estimate a potential miss to DBe EPS of 8 10c based on production and sales figures released by Newmont on April 17th  with gold sales volume of 1 1m oz which were  7  lower than DBe   Newmont recently announced next quarterly dividend of  0 35 share   18  QoQ  payable on June 27th  If gold prices average  1400 1499 oz in 2Q13  dividend for 3Q13 would decline further to

11352,232867,ROP,Bulls All Dressed Up  But Might Have No Place To Go,opinion,"Stock market bulls made a valiant effort to fight off another looming correction last week  The economy is showing strong signs of recovery  the Fed remains confident enough to continue its stimulus tapering  and attractive alternative investments to the U S  stock market seem scarce  Yes  bulls are all dressed up for more fun times  However  the technical picture paints a different story  at least for the near term  So don t back up the truck just yet  Caution is in order 
Thursday showed improving manufacturing data  personal income and spending  Friday s Government Employment Situation report showed that 288 000 joined the payrolls  University of Michigan Consumer Confidence jumped to the highest level since last July  Oil and gas are plentiful  The US dollar is relatively weak  helping the multinationals  earnings  Pending home sales rebounded in March  the first increase in nine months  Global hot spots  e g   Ukraine  Iraq  Afghanistan  continue to push global investors into the U S  The 10 year Treasury yield continued to fall  closing Friday at 2 58   And as discussed below  Sabrient s fundamentals based sector rankings are bullish 
Indeed  the CIO of the California State Teachers  Retirement System has stated that the nation s second largest public pension fund can t figure out where to invest  183 billion outside of U S  equities  Even though stocks might be getting fatigued  the firm sees few attractive alternatives in which to invest 
So  the setup is clear for an improving economy and growing GDP  But that doesn t mean the stock market will continue to go straight up from here  Near term technicals are worrisome  margin debt has reached an all time high  and trading volume in highly speculative penny stocks has soared to new highs 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed last week at 12 91 and remains firmly below the 15 threshold  indicating low investor trepidation about their stocks  But from a contrarian basis  it is once again oversold and ready to spike up at any time  Buy to open call volume on VIX futures is near record levels  meaning that the  smart money  has taken on a risk reduction mindset that makes the major resistance levels hard to crack 
My view is that the market is poised to endure a significant pullback soon before hitting new highs later in the year 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 188 06  which is up nicely from last week and appears to have negated the head and shoulders pattern  However  this doesn t mean that all is well again in Whoville  Thursday and Friday were uninspiring  and Friday s candlestick looked quite bearish    a red engulfing pattern with a long upper shadow  Overhead resistance is strong  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic all appear to be rolling over  and there is a gap up on April 16 from about 184 that will act as a magnet to be filled and tested  Minor support sits nearby at 187  but the 50 day simple moving average is likely the first level of strong support  near 186   followed by the convergence of gap support at 184 with the 100 day SMA  Below that is the bottom of the long standing uptrend  currently near 180  and then the 200 day SMA  around 178  

The broad market indexes have struggled to break through strong round number resistance  including the S P 500 at 1 900 and the Wilshire 5000 at 20 000  Also  the Russel 2000 and Nasdaq are struggling from far below their March highs 
Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The  Outlook Score  employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a  Bull Score  and  Bear Score  for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well   safe havens   when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology remains in first place with a robust Outlook score of 87  Industrial stays in second place with a 58  Technology generally displays solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a reasonable forward P E  the highest return ratios  and positive sentiment among Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates   although insider sentiment is only moderate  insider buying activity   Industrial displays a good forward long term growth rate  solid return ratios  and strong sentiment among sell side analysts  Energy and Financial round out the top five 
2   Telecommunications returns to the cellar with an Outlook score of 0 as it is at or very near the bottom in every factor in the model  It is joined in the bottom two once again by Consumer Services Discretionary with a score of 13 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Technology is the leader at 59  while Utilities is by far the laggard with a low score of 43  In fact  Utilities is the only sector scoring below 50 this week  The top bottom spread 16 points  reflecting relatively low sector correlations on particularly strong market days    although it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the  all boats lifted in a rising tide  mentality that we saw during 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities continues to increase  this week scoring 74  which means that stocks within this defensive sector have been the preferred  safe havens  on weak market days  Technology scores the lowest at 45  The top bottom spread is a robust 29 points  reflecting very low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology displays the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Telecom is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities is the leader solely on the strength of its Bear score  but Energy is close behind as it now displays solid Bull and Bear scores  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Consumer Services scores by far the lowest  indicating general investor avoidance during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  this week s Outlook rankings still look bullish  with five of the top six sectors also displaying high Bull scores  the exception is Utilities   Notably  the Bull score for Energy has transitioned to the higher end  so this sector now can be considered in the bullish camp once again 
These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Industrial sectors are relatively undervalued  while Consumer Services and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look   
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  Industrial  and Energy in the prevailing bullish climate   In this particular model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is still above its 50 day simple moving average while also remaining above its 200 day SMA  
Other ETFs that are ranked high by our algorithm from the Technology  Industrial  and Energy sectors include PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio  PSI   SPDR S P Transportation ETF  XTN   and PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration   Production Portfolio  PowerShares Dynamic Energy E P  PXE  
For an  enhanced  sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Technology  Industrial  and Energy  some long ideas include Zillow Inc  Z O   SanDisk Corp  NASDAQ SNDK   Roper Industries  NYSE ROP   Middleby Corp  NASDAQ MIDD   Valero Energy  NYSE VLO   and Whiting Petroleum  WLL   All are ranked highly in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top quintile of our   which is a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you are more comfortable with a neutral bias  the model suggests holding Technology  Industrial  and Utilities  On the other hand  if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Energy  and Consumer Goods Staples

Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Roper Technologies is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  Roper s  is  1 00   This is because the company s Most Accurate estimate is  2 02 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  2  A favourable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our 
Zacks Rank  Roper currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates 
Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Roper Technologies Zacks Rank  3 and  1 00  ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat Roper Technologies  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   What is Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
Roper s unique asset light business model helps it to remain less dependent on large scale production equipment   The asset light business model helps Roper to generate strong cash flow quickly 
Furthermore  Roper holds a dominant position in most of the markets where it operates  The company has an optimum mix of highly engineered  niche oriented products  which help it to gain market share  We believe that large project wins and strong order trends will drive the top line in the long run 
We note that Roper has delivered an average positive surprise of 0 92  in the trailing four quarters  Moreover  the stock has outperformed the Zacks  industry on a year to date basis  While the industry gained 10 9   the stock returned 18 3  
However  the company s business has been affected by weakness in the oil and gas sector  Sluggish global macroeconomic conditions also remain concerns 
For the first quarter of 2017  Roper Technologies expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of  1 92    2 00 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may consider as our proven model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

For 2017  the company expects adjusted earnings per share in a range of  8 98  9 28  compared with  8 82  9 22 per share 
Our Take
Roper s unique asset light business model helps it not only to remain less dependent on large scale production equipment but also to generate strong cash flow quickly 
Furthermore  Roper holds a dominant position in most of the markets where it operates  The company has an optimum mix of highly engineered  niche oriented products  which help it to gain market share  The acquisitions of Deltek and ConstructConnect and winning New York City s MTA project are significant positives  The company s strong dividend policy is also an added positive 
However  the company s business is affected by weakness in the oil and gas sector  Sluggish global macroeconomic conditions also remain concerns Stiff competition from the likes of Applied Industrial Technologies  Inc    NYSE AIT    Barnes Group Inc    NYSE B   and Chart Industries Inc    NASDAQ GTLS   is an added concern 
We note that Roper underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year  The company s shares have increased 23 59   compared with the industry s gain of 29 94  during the period 

Currently  Roper has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

segment basis  I ll then turn the call over to Rob to review our full year financial results  Then I ll walk us through the full year details and next year s outlook on a segment by segment basis  followed by our consolidated full year and Q1 2020 guidance  I ll conclude with a brief summary  prior to turning the call over to your questions  Next slide  please  Q4 for Roper was a very solid quarter  Revenue grew 1  organically and came in at  1 4 billion with positive organic growth in three of our four segments  and this was largely based on the strength of our software franchises  our medical product and RF product businesses and Neptune  As a partial offset to this growth  we did see our short cycle industrial and upstream oil and gas businesses decline as expected in the quarter  However  margin performance for the quarter was really fantastic  Gross margins grew 60 basis points to 64 1  and EBITDA grew 4  to  518 million  which represented an EBITDA margin up 37   a record for Roper Also in the quarter that s grew 5   And our free cash flow of 453 million was 32  of revenue  that three cash flow of 32  of revenue for the quarter  This margin performance in the face of short cycle industrial and oil and gas headwinds is a perfect proof point regarding Roper s business model  one that is comprised of niche oriented businesses with highly variable cost structures that have aligned management teams and incentive systems that enable nimble and swift execution based on the prevailing market conditions  Performance across the enterprise is excellent this year  I would like to thank each of our business leaders and all of our employees worldwide for another record performance for Roper  Thank you  Also  and importantly  we ve successfully completed the divestiture of Gatan in October of last year  In combination with the sale of the camera businesses earlier in the year and this year s  2 4 billion of capital deployment  our portfolio has been meaningfully improved to continue our long term cash flow compounding  Also  during the fourth quarter  we ve spent time with each of our businesses in person discussing their long range strategy and focusing on where each business plays  how they will compete and win and discussing market trends  customer behaviors and competitive activity Then we talked to each businesses enablement and execution of strategy and conclude with a discussion regarding each of our businesses activities regarding talent development  We are all encouraged by these planned reviews and our businesses  orientation toward investing in both product and channel opportunities to drive sustained long term and CRI accretive growth  Next slide  please  Turning to our fourth quarter P L  We saw revenues increase to  1 4 billion  which was a 2  increase and 1  on an organic basis  As mentioned on the prior slide  gross margins expanded 60 basis points to 64 1   and EBITDA margins grew 100 basis points to a record 37  in the quarter  Finally  our DEPS grew 5   All in all  a very strong quarter  Next slide  please  As we turn to our fourth quarter segment results  I ll start with our Application Software segment  Revenues for the segment were  411 million or plus 2  on an organic basis  EBITDA came in at  164 million or 40  margin We continue to see strength across the group of Application Software companies  especially at Aderant  Data Innovations and Strata  Deltek also had a strong quarter highlighted by continued double digit actually high teens ACV bookings growth  Revenues for Deltek were a touch light of our expectations due to a few larger GovCon prospects opting for Deltek s staff ITAR compliant solution and a handful of perpetual opportunities sliding into 2020  As we reported for several quarters  Deltek s growth is quite balanced across our GovCon and professional services market and the business continues to perform exceptionally well versus the competition  The segment EBITDA margin performance for this quarter was stunning  improving 190 basis points  Great job by the teams  Now turning to our network segment  We saw fourth quarter revenues increased to  431 million or an increase of 3  on an organic basis  Importantly  our software businesses in this segment grew organically 6  in the quarter  and the growth was quite broad based As a partial offset  We saw Transformers revenue decline a bit based on project timing associated with a few non New York City projects  For the quarter we saw segment Eva da margins increased 80 basis points to 45 5   For our Measurement   Analytical Solutions segment  revenues increased 1  organically to  388 million  Growth in this segment was driven with continued gains at Neptune and broadly across our medical product businesses  Neptune did a nice job clearing the majority of the backlog associated with their newer residential static water meter and our medical products businesses continued to compete and win in the marketplace  Relative to our short cycle industrial businesses  they modestly declined in the quarter but managed margins extremely well  And finally  as we turn to our Process Technologies segment  we saw this segment declined 6  on an organic basis  with revenues of  170 million  Margin performance was quite strong with EBITDA margins coming in at 38 7   This quarter s segment performance was expected as we saw pressure in our upstream businesses  Also expected  CCC posted continued gains in the quarter With that  I ll now turn the call over to our CFO to walk you through our consolidated annual results  Rob Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Neil  Good morning  everyone  So turning to Page eight and looking at our full year income statement performance  Full year organic growth for 2019 was 3   which was at the low end of our initial organic guidance against a difficult comp of 8  organic growth in 2018  Total revenue growth was also 3   We had a one point FX headwind and also the impact of the acquisition as well as the divestiture of our Scientific Imaging businesses taken at hand within the year  Our two segments that are primarily software  Application Software and Network Software   Systems  both finished in line with our initial guidance with mid single digit organic growth for the year  For our largest product segment  Measurement   Analytical Solutions  our medical products businesses and Neptune had another very strong year of organic growth  While we did have some declines in our short cycle industrial businesses  which lowered the overall organic growth of the segment to 2  for 2019 Lastly  our smallest segment  Process Technologies  declined 4  organically for the year  in line with our initial guidance  and that was primarily due to the weakness in upstream oil and gas as we had expected  As Neil mentioned  for the fourth quarter  we really had outstanding margin execution by our business leaders throughout 2019  driving very strong operating leverage  while we re continuing to invest for future growth  If you look at the margins    gross margin for the year  up 70 basis points to 63 9   EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points  up to a record 35 8   and that drove 7  EBITDA growth for the year  Our tax rate was lower in 2019 at about 19   So you add all that up  we had double digit adjusted DEPS growth of 10  up to  13 05 for the year  So really  overall  a very strong year for Roper  Next slide  So looking at our full year cash flow performance  As Neil mentioned  in the fourth quarter  we did have  453 million of free cash flow  which is a very strong 32  of revenue On a full year basis  we exceeded  1 5 billion  which was a 5  increase over prior year  And it s worth noting  many of you are probably on our call in January 2017  just three years ago  when we proudly announced that we had exceeded  1 billion in cash flow for the first time  Well now only three years later  we ve eclipsed  1 5 billion for the first time  So at Roper  cash does remain the best measure of performance  Next slide  So speaking of cash as the best measure of performance  The next slide is a look at our multi year EBITDA growth and cash flow compounding  So if you look at the period from 2016 to 2019  both EBITDA and free cash flow compounded a very strong 14   So when we think about cash conversion  a metric we like to track internally here is EBITDA to free cash flow  This seems especially relevant as investors have been moving away from P E toward metrics closer to cash  such as the EV EBITDA  However  for many companies  EBITDA does not consistently convert to free cash flow at high levels For Roper  it absolutely does  For this period  2016 to 2019  while our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings has been consistently well above 100   ranging from 105  to 120   free cash flow to EBITDA has also been very consistent  between 73  and 76   This is driven mainly by our asset light business model with our low capital needs and negative working capital  So as we look forward  our working capital position will continue to become more negative  as you ll see on the next slide  and that will further increase our ability to convert EBITDA to free cash flow at very high levels  Next slide  So turning to the asset light business model slide  maybe our favorite slide  Aided by the Gatan divestiture that we completed in the quarter  we ended the year at negative 5 3  net working capital as a percentage of revenue This record result actually includes receivables as you can see close to 18   which quite honestly is a little bit higher than you would normally like to see driven largely by the timing of collections  person transport projects and some product revenue that came in late in the quarter  So we certainly expect those people to be collected here early in 2020  and that number should improve moving forward  But even with the receivables number slightly higher  that negative 5 3  represents an 800 basis point improvement over the past three years  really tremendous performance in terms of working capital  And of course  the big driver of that is our deferred revenue  Deferred revenue increased nearly  350 million over this period  driven by organic growth in our software businesses  as well as our recent software acquisitions that come in at very attractive working capital levels  So in summary  from a working capital perspective  At a record negative 5   we exit the year better positioned than ever before for future cash flow compounding  Next slide  So looking at the balance sheet  if you look at our full year results  if I look at December  19 compared to December  18  net debt is actually down  12 million Now at the same time period GTM Eva does a 119 million and we end the year with our gross debt to EBITDA at 2 7x and our net debt to EBITDA at 2 4x  Largely due to the proceeds from our successful Gatan divestiture  we ended the year with a total cash balance of  710 million  with approximately  400 million in the U S  This is not the norm for us  Now  200 million of this cash will go toward paying the Gatan taxes due at April  But if you look at the cash balance  if you look at our revolver  which is now  2 5 billion revolver fully undrawn  very attractive capital market conditions  which we took advantage of in August  And certainly  we have the capability as we move forward to access the capital market  We are incredibly well positioned to take advantage of a very high quality pipeline of acquisition and opportunities in 2020 So with that  I ll turn it back over to Neil to review our 2019 segment performance and 2020 outlook Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Rob  Let s turn to the full year 2019 highlights for our Application Software segment  For the year  revenue came in at  1 589 billion  which represented an increase of 4  on an organic basis  And EBITDA was  636 million  an increase of 10  versus the prior year and EBITDA margins were 40   Deltek turned in a great year  Revenues increased mid single digits on an organic basis  and this growth was balanced across both markets  GovCon and Professional Services  as well as across the perpetual and SaaS offerings  Also during the year  Deltek s product and solution portfolio was meaningfully enhanced  On an organic basis  the company released an ITAR compliant GovCon SaaS offering and started gaining meaningful traction with its VantagePoint product  the company s newer professional services SaaS ERP solution In addition to this organic innovation  Deltek on boarded and integrated 2 acquisitions  ComputerEase and Avitru  both targeted to meaningfully enhance our architectural engineering and construction offer  Aderant had a stellar year  This time last year  we ve talked about product innovation and Aderant  specifically about three newer SaaS products  Based on the market traction of these products  especially their e billing and mid laws SaaS solutions and combined with Aderant s continued ability to take share in the large law space  Aderant posted double digit organic growth in the year  Also  in the fourth quarter  we acquired Bellefield Systems for Aderant  which enhances their SaaS solutions targeting the front office of law firms  specifically focused on professional service automation  compliance and timekeeping  As we turn to PowerPlan  we saw double digit increases in their recurring revenues in the year  These recurring revenue increases were offset by expected declines in their service revenue which were largely tied to leased accounting product implementation sold and delivered throughout 2018  Strata continues to be a star within Roper  having tremendous organic growth gains this year again To remind everyone  Strata is our SaaS software business that helps hospitals have better visibility to their financial operations  both costing and revenue  Strata solutions better enable hospital executives to plan and run their hospital operation  Also in the quarter  Strata launched a new product  a new data product called StrataSphere  Today  about 25  of U S  hospitals  operational and financial data runs through Strata s products  StrataSphere is designed to normalize this data set and provide Strata s customers with AI enhanced insights into the data and content across various customer cohorts  It is very early days for this product  but the team is very excited to partner with our customers to fully develop the product s potential  Within our lab software business  Sunquest  our U S  focused business  continues to face the same competitive headwind throughout the year  which we expect to persist into 2020  However  much of this headwind was mitigated by continued organic gains at Data Innovations and CliniSys  Finally  before turning to the segment s 2020 outlook  we wanted to highlight that CBORD had a great year with very strong organic growth and even better cash performance As for the outlook for this segment  we d expect to see mid single digit organic revenue growth with broad based growth contributions across the segment  It s worth noting Deltek s momentum entering this year based on their recent double digit bookings increases  Next slide  please  For the year  revenue for our Network Software   Systems came in at  1 539 billion  which represented an increase of 5  on an organic basis  And EBITDA was  681 million  an increase of 17  versus prior year  and EBITDA margins were an amazing 44 3   During 2019  we successfully completed the acquisitions of Foundry and iPipeline  While still early  both are off to a great start and have very solid growth contributions planned for 2020  Both management teams have welcomed the Roper approach and are excited to be part of our enterprise  On an organic basis  DAT had a truly amazing year  Their growth has been multifaceted with meaningful contributions coming from expansions to their core freight match network and growth and their rate data offering  MHA had a great year as well Their growth was a function of continued competitive strength and near 100  customer retention  combined with adding several new contracted pharmaceutical products to their portfolio  In addition to a very solid financial year  the company executed a precedent succession in a near perfect manner  ConstructConnect had a good year as well  Much of 2019 was focused on launching their new integrated SaaS solution  which they did quite well  ConstructConnect has seen increased ARPU  or revenue per user  from new customers as these contractors are seeing more value in the integrated bid management and project estimating solution  iTrade was fantastic in 2019  Rob and her team did a tremendous job driving very strong renewals  adding several new customers and positioning the product portfolio for continued long term network expansion  Finally  TransCore s year was highlighted by their high profile and large contract win with the New York City congestion pricing infrastructure project  As we turn to the outlook for next year    for this year  we see mid teens organic growth for this segment Within this outlook  we see mid single digit plus organic growth for our network software businesses and very strong organic growth for TransCore on the back of the New York City congestion pricing projects  For the first quarter of this year  we expect to see mid single digit organic growth for this segment  Excluding TransCore  we expect low single digit growth for the first quarter  given a very challenging Q1 comp for MHA  Specific to TransCore  now that the New York City project details are coming more into view  we expect the majority of TransCore s growth to occur in Q2 through Q4  though the timing of project revenues will be difficult to forecast with precision  given that we are in the early stages of this large New York City project  Next slide  please  For the year  revenue for our Measurement   Analytical Solutions segment came in at  1 596 billion  which represented an increase of 2  on an organic basis  And EBITDA was  541 million  a decrease of 4  versus the prior year  but EBITDA grew 2   excluding divestitures  EBITDA margins were 33 9  For the year we saw strong execution across our medical product businesses  and total this group grew high single digits organically for the year  Within the medical products businesses  NDI was the star for 2019  This business grew double digits on the back of very strong adoption of both their electromagnetic and optical precision measurement and guided solutions  Verathon growth in 2019 was driven by meaningful and successful product launch of a single use bronchoscope and new product extensions across the full GlideScope product family  Both of which we introduced on this call a year ago  In addition  2019 is the year that is marked by Verathon s reoccurring consumables revenues becoming larger than their capital based product revenues  For these reasons  this business is very well positioned for continued strong growth in 2020 and for many years after  Finally  in the medical products group  CIVCO grew nicely again based on market adoption of their ultrasound guidance and infection control products  Neptune for the year grew mid single digits  Importantly  Neptune saw nice increases in their residential static ultrasonic water meter products In addition  Neptune made very nice game that our innovation lab relative to the larger gauge commercial and industrial static meters  we continue to feel very good about how Neptune is position to compete and win in the marketplace  Turning to our shorter cycle and industrial businesses  These businesses performed very well in 2019 amid challenging end market conditions  As we all know  the market conditions changed meaningfully in the second quarter of the year  While these businesses did decline a bit in the year  their early recognition of the changing market conditions and their corresponding expense management was well executed  Of note and of importance  we did see some moderation of their declines in the most recent quarter  Also during the year  we successfully exited our Scientific Imaging and Gatan businesses and generated  1 2 billion of pre tax proceeds  As we turn to 2020  we see this segment growing mid single digit organically based on continued strength in our medical products and Neptune franchises  We further expect to see continued industrial declines in the first half and return to modest growth in the second half  largely based on easing 2H comps Next slide  please  For the year  revenue for our Process Technologies segment came in at  653 million  which was a 4  organic decline for the year  EBITDA was  238 million  a decrease of 4  versus the prior year  and EBITDA margins was 36 4   Our upstream oil and gas businesses declined high single digits in the year due to the deteriorating market conditions that we discussed throughout the year  However  our CCC business continues to perform well based on the competitive strength in winning virtually all of the new LNG construction projects  In addition  CCC s strategy of increasing their intimacy with their core customers is yielding nice system replacement opportunities  Cornell executed at a very high level throughout the year  They saw a very strong growth across virtually all of their end markets  with particular strength in their ag market offering  In addition  Cornell saw strength across their aftermarket parts business for much of the year  These strengths were offset by declines in their rental markets All in all  another solid year for Cornell  Finally  we saw EBITDA margins expand across this segment  These businesses increased margins in the face of very uncertain and declining market conditions  This is possible given the very high variable cost nature of the businesses  which provide our business leaders the ability to take cost out extremely fast once weakening market conditions are observed  There is no better example of nimble execution than this  Also  and to this end  we discussed how PAC and CCC had new Presidents onboarded in 2019  Each of these new teams performed exactly as we would have hoped  swiftly  nimbly and with conviction  As we look to 2020  we see this segment declining mid single digits based on the continued assumptions of upstream oil and gas market difficulties  However  comps do ease in the second half  Next slide  please  Now turning to our 2020 full year guidance  We are establishing our 2020 full year adjusted DEPS guidance in the range of  13 30 to  13 60  with organic revenue growth in the range of 6  to 7  This organic revenue growth range includes the impact of TransCore s growth associated with their New York City congestion pricing project  Excluding TransCore  organic growth for the enterprise is expected to be in the 3  to 4  range  For the full year  we expect our tax rate to be approximately 22   For Q1  we expect adjusted DEPS to be in the range of  2 94 and  3 per share  To remind everyone  last year s Q1 had a  0 41 tax benefit  Further  and as discussed earlier  we expect the majority of TransCore s growth to occur in Q2 through Q4  Next slide  please  As we look back on 2019  we re very pleased with our results and our strategic process  We continue to see strength in our niche market strategy and governance model that promotes nimble local execution  EBITDA for the year increased 7  to  1 93 billion  and EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to 35 8  Adjusted DEPS increased 10  to  13 05 per share  Free cash flow increased to  1 44 billion and was an astounding 27  of revenue  Specific to our portfolio of businesses  we meaningfully improved our business mix  We deployed  2 4 billion toward software acquisitions led by Foundry and iPipeline  We also exited our imaging and Gatan businesses  Finally  I m very pleased with the improvements we made across the enterprise relative to talent  I feel fantastic about the team in Sarasota  In addition to the existing team  during the year  we onboarded 2 group executives  Satish and Harold  This team is executing at a very high level  and I m excited for the future  Also  there are meaningful improvements across our business units in terms of the talent offense they are deploying  We re playing the long game  and I fully expect our talent focus to pay dividends in the years to come  As we turn to 2020  we are super well positioned  First  we expect to deliver fantastic organic growth for the year that will be broad based across our software platforms  Neptune  medical products  RF products and TransCore The growth in these parts of our businesses will meaningfully outpaced market weakness across our short cycle industrial and our only gas related businesses  Relative to future capital deployment  we are very offensively positioned to execute our M A strategy  The sale of Gatan  our attractive August bond issue   0 drawn on our  2 5 billion revolver and a building cash balance  has our balance sheet wonderfully well positioned  We continue to be very active evaluating new capital deployment ideas  and our pipeline is quite full with high quality opportunities  We will continue to be very disciplined and hold true to our CRI based principles  and we are optimistic for a successful year of capital deployment  Now as we turn to your questions  I want to remind everyone that what we do is very simple  We compound cash flow by operating a portfolio of businesses that have leading positions in niche markets that have the proven ability to generate increasing cash flow as their businesses expand  We provide our business leaders with Socratic coaching about what great looks like while driving long term CRI accretive growth with particular emphasis focused on strategy  operation  innovation and talent development Our business leaders understand that success in our culture is based on their ability to compete and win for talent and to compete and win for customers that  in turn  allow us to compete for and win shareholders  To this end  we incent our management teams based on growth  And based on these factors and perhaps most importantly  we have a culture that is rooted in the principles of mutual trust and transparency  And finally  we take the excess free cash flow that is generated by our businesses and deploy it to buy businesses that have better cash returns than our existing company that  in turn  help accelerate our cash flow compounding  It is these simple ideas that deliver powerful results  We appreciate your time this morning Now let s turn the call over to your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets Deane Michael Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everyone  Because the New York City congestion tolling project is such a high profile installation for you all  I d be interested in hearing some more color on how this installation compares to the others that you ve done in  let s say  London and Stockholm  Just from a sense of degree of difficulty of the installation  is there any  like  new software  New camera systems  Or is this basically similar to what you ve done in these other successful installations Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Sure  Deane  So let me first start by saying the congestion pricing infrastructure in those other 2 cities is not us  So those are not our projects  That said  the technology that s being used in the New York City project is  for the most part  the exact same technology that s been used in any of our larger tolling infrastructure projects  It s the same core hardware  It s the same core software  Certainly  there ll be some tweaks that are needed in the software for the specific application that s being used by MTA in this instance  But the scale of this project is not actually close to the largest that we ve deployed  So the team feels quite confident in the technical ability to do it  Further  our customer  MTA has been    is a great partner  And all the sort of the process steps to be able to construct in New York City have largely already been approved  And so it really is just down to executing the project over the course of this year Deane Michael Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  and then just some more color on the expected    the margin progression for 2020 for the project  It looks like it s starting more into the second quarter  But typically  do you see lower margin early in the project  on the installation  more upfront costs  and just    and then higher margin in the back quarters  Just what s the expectation here  the base case Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  Deane  I think that s right  I think you re just getting started with the project here in the first quarter  So we think you d assume you d have a little bit less    well  we know we have a little bit less revenue recognition  probably a little bit lower margin  and as we move on throughout the year  both of those will increase quite a bit Deane Michael Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGot it  and then just last one for me on Deltek  Could you just provide some color or context around the pushouts on the perpetual deals  You said it got pushed into 2020  Is this a first quarter or second quarter  And just what are the    some color around the customer decisions there Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerSure  so a couple of things on Deltek  We talked about how their bookings  on an ACV basis  we re quite strong all year  with strength ending the year in the high teens in Q4  So the competing and winning in the marketplace has remained robust throughout the year  Specific to the revenue recognition  it s really a combination of 2 things here in Q4  being    one is  the company has announced its intention to release an ITAR compliant version of their cost point product  which is the GovCon ERP product  which really essentially enables that product to be hosted in the cloud and deploy it in the SaaS environment  So there are a couple of deals signed in Q4 taking advantage of that offering And so that s a great trend for the business because the recurring revenue will increase quite meaningfully as that becomes more    gains more traction  That  combined with the fact that a couple    a handful of meaningfully sized perpetual deals pushed  And so if in the hypothetical world  if the ITAR compliant SaaS product was not there  likely  these customers would have bought perpetual version  And then Deltek s would have been right in line  So it s really a combination of the SaaS offering gaining traction and a couple of deals pushing into the first or second quarter next year Deane Michael Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you OperatorAnd your next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer    AnalystThank you Good morning  as you re positioning for substantial allocation as you referenced a few times for this year  Just curious  look back at a few of the larger ones  iPipeline  Foundry  PowerPlan  around management retention  other key metrics on onboarding and anything in particular around those recent deals that s evolving  How you evaluate trade offs with new opportunities as you re kind of shopping criteria evolves over time Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerSo the criteria for capital deployment really has not changed that much  It s always been rooted in finding businesses that have better cash returns than our existing  Over the arc of 20 years  that s gone from industrial products to medical products  the more software  The second criteria is always having a management team that is fundamentally focused on building the business versus transacting  And then finally  businesses that share the characteristics that all 45 of our businesses do  right  niche  leadership position  ability to invest in themselves to grow  high recurring revenues  high gross margins  etc So those criteria have not changed at all and it won t change going forward  The recent acquisitions that you referenced  certainly the ones really from Deltek  ConstructConnect  Aderant  PowerPlan  Foundry  iPipeline  the larger ones from  16 forward  have met all those criteria  and the businesses are performing at or maybe modestly above our initial expectations Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer    AnalystOkay  And then just curious  in the pipeline  the more actionable end of it as you see it  what s kind of the mix between bolt ons versus platform opportunities Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  The vast majority of our deployment will be on platform ideas  Occasionally  we ll do bolt ons or tuck ins as they strategically warrant in the business  It s not a budget  If you just look over our arc of time  about 10  of the capital deployed  it s been in bolt ons  but it s just been a by product of how it s unfolded  It s certainly not a budget or a planning number going forward  But my bid will be somewhere in that plus or minus ballpark Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer    AnalystGotcha  Thank you Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerWelcome OperatorAnd your next question will come from Robert McCarthy with Stephens Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystGood morning  everyone  The first question I have is free cash flow as a percentage of sales for Process Technologies  Do you happen to have that metric or that percentage Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerWe don t  The free cash flow number is a corporate number with all the corporate interest tax  etc   So we don t look at it in that way  I would say the business level cash flow  So if you look at sort of EBITDA to revenue  subtracting their capex is pretty darn close to their EBITDA because the capex is not a big number  And then from a working capital perspective  there s not huge movement there  So it s still a very high number  I can t give you an exact free cash flow number for that OK Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystOkay  But it screens very well in free cash flow by definition then Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerAbsolutely Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerAbsolutely  Indecipherable Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystOkay  fair point  And then if you look at your outlook  excluding the drag from process  what do you think you would have grown this year organically Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerSo process for the year was minus 4   So you re talking 12  of the company  So we would add a    probably a point or 2  just doing the math at the top of my headRobert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystAnd then in 2020  probably something similar or even higher  Right Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerThat s right Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystOkay  And then moving on to TransCore  From that perspective  could you just remind us to level set our expectations in the out years  How you re thinking about the initial deployment revenue and then conceptually the step down from there  just so we get our modeling directionally correct in the out years Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  So there s the 200 or so incremental revenue this year  And then there will be some recurring from the project  probably in the  50 million to  60 million range into next year and then into the next several years  So that would then leave the rest of TransCore  and a lot of other projects we re working on  to pick up some of that slack  which they re working hard on already today Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystRight  And then last question is really around M A  Obviously  I think Danaher announced today decent results after a preannouncement  and then I think rebaseline for more    even more favorable financing environment for underwriting one of the deals  So clearly  a pretty attractive environment  which you alluded to on the call in terms of the capital markets and debt for funding these deals  And you talked about the mission bolt ons  I mean  you look at Neptune  good growth  a great franchise  There is a sense that the smart metering  while albeit at a low rate of growth  maybe in the low single digits  could be very sustainable for a long period of time  And there is some sense that transmission and distribution spending could be entering a higher level of visible spending just given PG E and some of the return profile of AMI  Is it possible for you guys to think about building around that more than software  Is the utility end market an attractive space  Or how would you think about that Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  So Neptune  as you know  is 100  focused in the water meter business  and that s where they re going to be  They re not going to stray to gas or electric meters  And more importantly  it s really water meters in North America  where pressure rates are higher than the rest of the world  So it s a pretty complicated device metering application  both mechanical and ultrasonic  So the company is going to stay focused there  That said  the company now for at least three years has been investing in its software applications and capability because now the readers are being read more frequently And so there s more use cases that are being developed about what you do with that data around leak detection or shutoff or whatever our customers ask for  Neptune is working to build  The shutoff is a hard case  but leak detection is a good case  for instance  in terms of value to the end user  So they    to that end  they opened an innovation center three years or so ago in Atlanta to attract better talent than they could in their existing locations in more rural Alabama  So it s been a part of the strategy  and I suspect it will remain part of the strategy for quite some time Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystI don t want to wear out my welcome  Thanks for the questions Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorYour next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan  Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystHey guys  good morning  You mentioned PowerPlan saw some solid growth in a part of its business  What did ultimately PowerPlan grow for the year in total Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Yes  PowerPlan for the year was down a little bit  We think it will be up in 2020 full year  including the first quarter Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  And then ConstructConnect as well  did that grow this year Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerIt did Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  it grew in 2019 Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystIs that like low singles or something like that or Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerCorrect Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  low single Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  And then lastly  just for the    just for modeling purposes  I know you have the Gatan sale headwind on revenue next year  What are the    what s the carryover acquisition related tailwind that we should add to kind of that organic growth outlook  So on a reported basis Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  So I ve got    so from an EBITDA standpoint  there s about  70 million of EBITDA from the acquisitions  That s an add and then you take away about  50 million of EBITDA from Gatan  So it s a net around  20 million of EBITDA Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystAnd then on sales Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  On sales  it s going to be    I don t have the exact number  I ll have to follow up with you on that  but it s going to be roughly    you have it  Shannon Shannon Rory    Vice President of FinanceYes  It nested on 0 Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  It nested 0 on revenue Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    Analyst0 on    0 carryover with    including Gatan Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  Yes  Because the Gatan is a lower margin Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  And then  sorry  one last one  Just on first quarter organic  you mentioned that there is some TransCore impact  because you talked about first quarter growth in that segment  ex TransCore  I guess  ex TransCore in the first quarter  is it two to three  one to two  Or is it not even that  like  meaningful on an enterprise basis Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerIt s not too meaningful  There s some incremental revenue from TransCore there in the first quarter  But it s not a big add to the first quarter  And as I think you know  Q1 last year was at 6  organic  So they re really    it s just a matter of the comps  If you look at the software businesses  for example  it s just the comps that the    is the only difference as we move forward throughout the year Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thanks a lot  Appreciate OperatorYour next question will come from Richard Eastman with Baird Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystYes  Good  Good morning  Thanks for the questions  I m just could you possibly just give some commentary around the profit associated with the MTA contract  And then what s    what might be the cadence there  I mean  is that a    just an EBIT or EBITDA contribution from that contract  And is it    does it scale up meaningfully as the revenue grows there  Or is    just some feel for what that could add  so I can get kind of a sense per share on a quarterly basis  given our revenue assumptions Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  So I think as you re aware  the TransCore business margin is below the Roper average  And so this business is going to be in that range  And I think the margins do improve after the first quarter moving forward  Exactly how linear that s going to be  is difficult to predict  as Neil mentioned  given what goes on with the project  but it certainly will get a little bit better after the first quarter  and it s probably going to be relatively consistent throughout the rest of the year as our    is our best estimate as we sit here today Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystSo OK so it comes in at TransCore s average contribution Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerCorrect Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerThat s correct Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerThat s correct  And it ll be a little more profitable in the back three quarters in the first quarter  but it s not something where it s breakeven Q1  10  Q2 and 40  in Q4  It s not anything like that at all Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystAnd you referenced this just a couple of minutes ago  I think somebody asked a similar question around    so  200 million is still the right expectation around year one this year  and then I think on a previous call  it was maybe  50 million to finish off the project in year two  But then the other  250 million of the contract essentially was year s three to seven on a service contract  Is that still kind of roughly the schedule Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  That s correct  Yes  so there s like  what we ve said  50 million recurring after 2020 goes on for five years  and we would hope it would go on many years after that as you get a chance to renew the maintenance part Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystRight  Okay  And then just a second follow up question around Roper s core EBITDA  Fantastic year from the margin perspective for the full  19  The puts and takes here  maybe a little bit around MTA contract as well as your commentary around a minus mid single digit growth for the Process Tech piece of the business in  20  What might be a reasonable assumption in basis points for targeted EBITDA margin expansion for Roper in  20  Would a reasonable target be 50 or Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes so    Yes  No  I think embedded in our initial guidance as it normally is  is that EBITDA margins will be roughly flat year over year  There s maybe a little bit of an increase  But certainly  the TransCore project is a negative  And then some declines in those more cyclical businesses is generally a negative to your margin  And the flip side of that is excellent growth at the software businesses  which is a net positive  And if you add all those things together  our initial signs model has the EBITDA margins about flat year over year  and we ll work to do a little bit better than that Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystOkay  And then  if you mind  could I just sneak one more in  please  Just the transportation business within network software  that    the freight matching business is just another tremendous year in a tough    fairly tough trucking industry  I guess  if you will  Is that a countercyclical business as things get tough in the trucking industry  we re looking to optimize our assets there by matching freight  And just maybe explain that business a little bit and then maybe what the prospects are for  20 Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerSure  I ll take that one  Rick  So first  DAT  let s define what they are  It s full truckload  spot market North America freight match  right  So it is a niche industry  There s captive  there s contracted and there s spot markets  But what we have observed here over the last really two or three years with DAT is their network strength  right  it s a    their relative market share is three ish versus their competitor  right  So their network is 3x the size their next largest competitor  That network strength has proven to play well when the trucking markets are super hot and when they weak  So step back from that  why is that  right  So if you re a carrier  and it is a very hot market  The carrier is going to want to be very selective in their routes  Maybe they re going from Kansas City  Chicago  and they want to go right back to Kansas City So they re going to be a network participant to be able to select specifically what they want  So you see active participation  And then conversely  the brokers are looking for the capacity  When things lighten up  the truckers are looking for work  right  So they become less selective  And so the value proposition of participating in the network on both sides of the network in both market conditions tend to be quite robust Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystOkay  And outlook for  20  I mean  do we kind of sustain the current growth rate  Or do we settle down  It s just there s    it seems around the fringes  there s more competition in that space  but you guys have maneuvered quite well there Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  There is    there really isn t more competition in the freight matching space  That said  this company has done so well for a number of years  We do expect the growth to moderate a bit in 2020 Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerJust based on the activity in the market is the only thing driving that Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerThat said  we expected this business to moderate for the last few years as well and they ve outlasted our expectations Richard Eastman    Baird    AnalystOkay  very well  Thank you OperatorAnd your next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThanks a lot  maybe just trying to keep my questions a little briefer  Maybe starting with the software as a service model  You ve spent some time in the prepared remarks discussing that  Just wondered with that strength in Q4  what s the overall scale of your SaaS business now within Roper  And relating to the profitability on that  I think in Q2  you d had a SaaS kind of mix surge and that had hurt margins in Application Software  Q4  it seems like SaaS did very well again  and may be contributing positively to the margin mix  So maybe help us understand the margin dynamics as that SaaS share of sales expands Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  So we re still about even in between the SaaS revenue and the traditional on prem license maintenance revenue within our software businesses  And from a margin perspective  there really isn t that large of a difference in terms of EBITDA margin between those 2 business models for our businesses  It s    where the variability happens  as Neil mentioned  is when you get a new license win in a quarter  all that revenue is recognized immediately  If you get a new SaaS win in a quarter  that revenue is recognized over the next 12 months and beyond  So that s the only difference  But from a margin standpoint  there isn t a lot of change within the 2 models Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think the 2Q point you re referencing is Deltek had 2 very large perpetual deals in 2Q of  18  which drove outsized margin and that s very specific  So it s a very hard comp coming over in 2Q of  19  if my memory serves correct Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystAnd then maybe for Neil  You mentioned talent development in your prepared remarks  Maybe expand a little bit what you re hoping to see from those group executive roles this year  And also  I think  a bit more of a push on organic growth is under way at Roper  In that context  maybe just if you could highlight what the R D spending was in 2019  I know we ll see it in the K  but maybe how you see the cadence of R D developing Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerSure  All right  If these are short questions  Julian  and I d hate to hear a long one  So I ll try to hit the talent  the group  the organic and the R D  So I ll hit the organic first  So we said that it s my intention objective to position the company  reporting of my businesses to execute our organic growth strategy that s been a little bit better in the past  That said  this is going to take time because we want to do it structurally  We want to do it    we re playing the long game  And importantly  we re going to only do it to the extent that CRI accretive  And so this is going to take a long time  And success  by the way  is measured by 50 or 100 basis points more of organic growth  not doubling the organic growth profile because these businesses are built for defensibility  yet we haven t met a Roper business that s optimized its organic growth algorithm  And so we believe there s long term  I ll emphasize long term  potential there  Now we re going to do that through the group executives  engaging with our teams  principally on three things  how to develop strategy  how to execute strategy and how to run a talent offense And so we can spend more time later sort of unpacking that because it s a passion of ours here to do that  But we believe sort of the right strategy with the right strategic enablement  with putting the right field    the right team on the field  will yield great results for our shareholders over a long arc of time  Specific to your R D spend  In 2020  for the software businesses  but basically both software segments  We re planning on 70 or 80 basis points more spend in R D  So when you multiply that through  it s  20 million or  25 million of incremental spend in R D relative to the revenue and that sort of spread across where the best opportunities are in each one of the businesses  And that    we d expect that pace to    I can t tell you if it s that exact number of basis points each year  but expect that number to continue to increase over time as it naturally does in software businesses  And that is embedded in everything Rob mentioned earlier about margins being flat for the year and margins that    everything he talked about  So that s my view on your question  and happy to follow up as needed later Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystRight  Thank you OperatorYour next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  Good morning  everyone  So Neil  you mentioned the headwinds in Sunquest continuing into 2020  Can you just elaborate a little bit more on whether    what kind of impact it s going to have 2020  And specifically  whether    what you re doing to mitigate some of that within Sunquest Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  So the headwind is the same headwind the business has experienced for quite some time  It s    it is  unfortunately  like slow motion and tectonically playing out because our customers  when they make a decision to leave three years ago  It takes them three years to leave  And so there s no new information  It s just taking this time to play out  The mitigating fact is we ve decided  is we continue to invest in the products of this business  right  So we ve invested in internationalization of the product  We are investing in the molecular genetic capabilities  We re investing in the integration of the fluid tissue and genetic molecular labs  and that continues and will continue  And so it s    we just have to let this one competitive headwind play itself out of the course of the next year Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Got it  And then just a real quick one  On ComputerEase and iPipeline  the growth expected for 2020  is it supposed to be similar to the organic growth for the rest of the segment Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerYes  Well  yes  I think when we announced iPipeline  we felt really good about that being a high single digit organic grower  and nothing has changed to our opinion on that Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd ComputerEase Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  that s a smaller add on to Deltek  And it s probably mid single digit organic grower or maybe better Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  thanks  guys OperatorNext question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystThank you  Good morning  I promise  I will be brief  Just on TransCore  back to that  I just want to understand how the cash flow actually works on the project  Would you expect to receive ratable cash flow because you re doing the work  Or would this be a very back end loaded  And maybe even kind of a 2021 kind of cash event for the business Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerThat sounds like the same questions we asked our management team during this project run out  So we do feel that    we do feel the cash flows to be pretty well aligned with our earnings on the project  We ve worked hard with that  We have a great partner that s working with us to make sure that  that happens  And so we do feel good about the cash coming in sort of in line with the EBITDA  Now certainly  you could see some payments in 2021 after the project is ended  So we ll see what happens  but we re working hard to make sure the cash comes in on time Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystAnd just on Neptune  is there anything programmatic going on in 2020  Big localities or anything that s driving the business  Or it s just kind of more steady as she goes kind of penetration push Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerSteady as she goes  Neptune s strategy has been actually focused on the medium and smaller municipalities  That s what their strength has been and will continue to be Jeff Sprague    Vertical Research    AnalystRight  Thank you Joe Giordano    Cowen    AnalystOur next question will come from Joe Giordano with Cowen  Yes  Good morning  So just on TransCore  what s the risk that  that deal leads into  21 that the deployment actually takes longer or it gets started late Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerIt s already started Laurence Neil Hunn    President And Chief Executive OfficerIt s already started  Yes  So the    it s a big project  It s got some complexity associated with it  So it certainly has a possibility of some of that bleeds into 2021  That said  let me be very clear  our customer has told us the infrastructure needs to be ready by December 31  2020  And that s the project plan  That s the resources that are being deployed because that will then  in turn  enable the MTA to decide when and how they want to introduce the tolling  So our part of the project is to be completed by the end of the year per our customers  demand Joe Giordano    Cowen    AnalystOkay  fair enough  And then how should we think about    absent forward M A that I m sure you ll do  but if we just strip that out  how do we think about the forward margin opportunity in the application network  Like how much of a drag on margins are the current new    relatively new business in there  And just how should we think about the floor opportunity to expand from already pretty high levels Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  So I wouldn t view the new businesses as a drag at all  I mean  they re all generally in line with the margins    EBITDA margins  right  Yes  I m always speaking in terms of EBITDA margins and Shannon is correcting me    sometimes correcting me that the analyst think in terms of OP a lot of times  But from an EBITDA margin perspective  very consistent and there s no reason why they should go backwards  As Neil mentioned  I mean  we re always spending a lot in R D  We re growing R D  and you    and it s easy to do that when you have businesses that come in at a high contribution margins  There s plenty of dollars to invest in R D and talent and people and everything  and that s really how these businesses grow  So we re continuing to do that  So I wouldn t see any sort of a margin headwind for these businesses any time into the future Joe Giordano    Cowen    AnalystHow should we think about them expanding  Like just normal kind of just capturing an incremental on the growth  Is there like Zero Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  It s incremental on the growth  right  I mean  when you have EBITDA margins in that 40  range  that s a very healthy software business that continually invests to grow  So I think that if it expands  great  but it s really about growing more at current margins Joe Giordano    Cowen    AnalystYep  fair enough  Thank you OperatorAnd your next question will come from Robert McCarthy with Stephens Robert McCarthy    Stephens    AnalystMy questions have been answered  Thank you Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerOh  you re welcome OperatorAnd your next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystHey  guys  sorry  just a quick follow up  Anything moving around on like cash conversion  I know that with the TransCore deal coming through  maybe it s a bit of a different cash profile early on  Anything    any dynamics there we have to be aware of for cash conversion or cash margin in 2020 Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  No  Thanks  Steve  for the question  I was preparing for it  I m glad you got back on and asked  Yes  No  we definitely feel free cash flow    Yes  No  I think if you look at our overall guide  free cash flow should grow double digits based on our guide in 2020  And then  obviously  as we do acquisitions  that should be further accretive to that  So that s sort of how we see it as of today  So no  there s no headwinds on cash flow Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystI guess  your free cash flow this year grew a little bit less than that  What is the    is there anything unique kind of year to year that drives an acceleration of that Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerYes  So what balances around  right  so if you re looking at conversion to adjusted net earnings  what balances around the most is tax payments and cash tax versus GAAP tax  And so that s been a headwind the last couple of years with a lot more cash tax payments  And also  as I mentioned in the scripted comments around TransCore  it didn t have a very good cash year around some projects last year  and then some of the product businesses weren t great  So I think as we sit    from a working capital standpoint  I think that we ve got some additional room to improve  And so then that will be beneficial to cash flow next year and beyond  Everything else is very structural from a high cash conversion standpoint Steve Tusa    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thanks a lot  Appreciate it  Thank you Robert Crisci    Executive Vice President And Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorAnd that will end our question and answer session for this call  We now return back to management
