healthcare stocks looks like a smart strategy for 2019 2018 s Challenges Leave Sector Largely UnscathedSeveral roadblocks confronted healthcare this year and most of them had to do with the Affordable Care Act  ACA   The Trump administration has been trying to replace and repeal Obamacare since it began its term  And it succeeded to some extent this year  removing the individual mandate as part of its well received tax cuts The abolishment of the individual mandate led a federal judge in Texas to declare that the ACA was unconstitutional  However  the law will remain in force until the time

Healthcare was a key issue for Democrats during this year s mid term polls and their House victories illustrate its emotive power among voters Also  2018 was witness to heated mergers and acquisitions activity  Aetna  NYSE AET   sealed a  70 billion merger with pharmacy major CVS Health   NYSE CVS    Meanwhile  Cigna   NYSE CI   acquired Express Scripts  NASDAQ ESRX   for  54 billion These developments illustrate a trend which seeks to reduce healthcare costs by creating a single entity which offers both medical and drug benefits  The trend is likely to continue next year  invigorating the sector with further mergers and acquisitions activity Overall  2019 is likely to be another year filled with innovations and new technologies  Players from outside the sector are also likely to step into the healthcare space  This is more than evident from the efforts of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    JPMorgan   NYSE JPM   and Berkshire Hathaway  to provide healthcare benefits to 1 million

2728,224243,CPSI,Is Computer Programs And Systems  CPSI  A Good Value Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Computer Programs and Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CPSI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Computer Programs and Systems has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 16 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Computer Programs and Systems  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 39 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Computer Programs and Systems has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Computer Programs and Systems stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Computer Programs and Systems has a P S ratio of about 1 2  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 9 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  CPSI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Computer Programs and Systems currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Computer Programs and Systems a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Computer Programs and Systems is 1 1  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 0  which is far better than the industry average of 12 2  Clearly  CPSI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Computer Programs and Systems might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D  This gives CPSI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 11 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 16 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Computer Programs and Systems  Inc  Price and Consensus    This positive trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineComputer Programs and Systems is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 31   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Computer Programs and Systems Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-12-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-computer-programs-and-systems-cpsi-a-good-value-stock-200371563,200371563
2729,224244,CPSI,Bull Or Bear  Your Investment Strategy For 2019,opinion,"The longest bull market in history has taken both experts and novices by surprise  So every now and then  there is this conversation about the possibilities of a recession and what we should do to prepare for it  There have been many such conversations through 2018  but a recession never materialized  as the market and the government appear to have gotten smarter at aversion  Or at least at ensuring that earlier indicators won t be valid this time around 
Take the lead indicator yield curve inversion for example  In an expanding economy  government bond yields surpass short term yields because of greater optimism about the future  When short term yields exceed long term yields  the inversion is an indication of uncertainty about the future 
But monetary policy has effectively kept long term rates low so bond yields remain attractive and spending by both the government and corporations can continue  Still  the gap between 10 year and 2 year yields continues to narrow  indicating that a bear market may be in the offing 
Another indicator is a pickup in M A activity  which is a typical occurrence toward the end of the business cycle  But M A has been robust in the last few years with no signs of a bear market  The last year has seen a fresh spate of activity  but since companies aren t in distress  this may or may not be a valid signal 
The story appears even more positive if you consider the high yield spread  which is the difference between the yields in below investment grade corporate debt and  risk free  U S  Treasurys  When the economy is strong  the gap spread is typically smaller as the risk of doing business is relatively low 
As recession fears near  however  opportunities shrink and it becomes harder to do business  As a result  companies need to pay more for significantly riskier ventures  The high yield spread has risen during the last two recessions  but as the chart below shows  it remains at acceptable levels right now 
 

 
An increase in weekly jobless claims  first time claims for state unemployment benefits  is another strong and obvious indicator of a recession  But while jobless claims increased in the last week of the year  it makes sense to study the trend rather than what happened in a single week 
And despite the usual ups and downs  weekly jobless claims continue to trend down steadily since the last recession  Other than the record low unemployment rate  lower taxes and lower oil prices continue to support consumer liquidity   

 
Persistently declining stock or index valuations can also indicate a broader market slowdown  The following table shows sector valuations for the historical period wherein downward pressure across sectors is apparent  But significant declines  of 20  or more  are seen in less than half the sectors 
Moreover  the bigger sectors  medical  technology  finance  are holding up better  indicating some positive sentiment around growth  Oil Energy and Transport sectors are borderline cases 

 
As detailed in the current   total Q4 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up 11 8  from the year ago quarter on revenues that are expected to be up 5 6   This however is down from  15 9  growth expected at the start of the quarter and further declines can t be ruled out 
The negative revisions trend is widespread  with estimates for 15 of the 16 Zacks sectors coming down during the quarter  The Conglomerates  Construction  Energy and Consumer Discretionary sectors have seen the biggest downward revisions while Transportation continued to benefit from lower oil prices 
Investment Strategy for 2019
The mixed signals in the above message means that while we don t need to bail out of the market right away  or at all   a defensive strategy may be the best way to go 
The first leg of that strategy is a focus on Zacks Rank  1 stocks  since the rank has historically outperformed the market by a wide margin 
At the onset of a recession  it is better to get into defensive sectors  but as evident from the above  it is the growth sectors that are holding up relatively better in the current environment 
So finding stocks like inTest Corp    NYSE INTT    TiVo Corp    NASDAQ TIVO   and Diodes Inc    NASDAQ DIOD   in the Technology sector that offer growth at attractive valuations may be a good idea 
Finance is another area with plenty of opportunities  So stocks like Macro Bank   NYSE BMA    Victory Capital Holdings   NASDAQ VCTR    Marcus   Millichap   NYSE MMI   or The Progressive Corp    NYSE PGR   are worth buying 
Growth opportunities abound in the medical sector  but BioTelemetry   NASDAQ BEAT    Vericel Corp    NASDAQ VCEL    Vanda Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ VNDA   and Computer Programs and Systems   NASDAQ CPSI   stand out  A value pick like Bausch Health Cos   NYSE BHC   is also worth considering 
Utilities and Business Services are good defensive sectors but there are fewer opportunities  So Steelcase   NYSE SCS   and Information Services Group   NASDAQ III   are the only ones catching the eye 
Conclusion
The bears may not have taken over yet  but there are strong enough signs that they may not be too far away  So the strong economic growth  healthy labor market  low inflation and interest rates  and GDP growth that are the hallmarks of a bull market may gradually give way  Let s hope for the best and prepare for the worst

2744,224259,CPSI,4 Undervalued MedTech Stocks To Consider Amid Volatility,opinion,The U S  medical device industry has exhibited strong and sustainable growth of late due to an aging population and increasing incidences of chronic and lifestyle diseases  The industry has also benefited from the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence  AI  and big data applications  upbeat consumer sentiment and rising business investments Further  a rise in middle class income has persuaded people to choose better healthcare standards  Moreover  the recent uptrend in projected growth of the Medical Device industry can be attributed to the two year suspension of the 2 3  Medical Device tax in January  Elimination of the tax will result in huge savings for the medical device players  in turn compelling them to focus on innovation Undoubtedly  the sector appears to be in the pink of health  Per consulting specialist Emergo  the U S  medical device industry was valued at  147 7 billion in 2016 and is projected to grow significantly through 2019 to  173 billion PwC observes that 2018 will be a year of resilience for the U S  healthcare industry  The industry is likely to revamp its operational efficiencies to improve performance and offset risks  like  natural disasters  cost pressures  to name a few  This may spur health organizations to seek out greater cross sector collaboration  make new strategic investments and create efficiencies External Uproars Making the Outlook BleakWhile MedTech does appear to be sound health  it isn t resilient to macro issues  The ongoing U S  China trade war is one of the primary macros issues which is likely to act as a dampener for the industry  Trump has identified 10 sectors for imposition of higher tariffs and Healthcare  including medical equipment happens to be one of those  Investors will be wary of investing in these sectors at the moment and consequently  these are likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute According to data provided in an article by Christian B  Jones in mondaq  MedTech firms in the United States currently sell medical devices worth  4 7 billion annually to China  while it imports medical devices worth  5 billion from China  U S  exports of medical devices last year totalled  52 billion  resulting in worldwide trade surplus of  1 billion  Needless to say  the medical device fraternity is extremely apprehensive regarding the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade Meanwhile  the recently concluded summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un  has garnered a lot of positivity in the United States  With the two presidents signing a historic agreement to completely denuclearize North Korea  chances of a nuclear invasion

5 Stocks with Upgraded Broker Ratings Worth Betting on Now
It s not easy for an individual investor to pick stocks on his own and gain from it  given several fundamental and technical aspects that need to be considered for spotting potential winners  This is where expert advice comes in handy 
As brokers are in direct communication with companies  they have deeper understanding about them  Hence  following what majority of brokers are saying about a stock can help one understand its potential easily      
Additionally  they analyze fundamentals of a company and place them against the current economic backdrop to understand out how the stock will fare as an investment  Further  brokers have a deeper insight of the overall industry and economy 
Specifically  brokers analyze a company s publicly available financial statements  attend conference calls and communicate directly with top management  They even talk to customers to understand what they like or dislike about the products and services offered by the company 
Therefore  there s comprehensive research behind the rating of a broker on a company s stock  Naturally  when an analyst upgrades a stock  one can easily rely on it 
Nonetheless  it s not wise to solely depend on broker upgrades to build an investment portfolio  One must also take into consideration certain other factors to ensure steady returns

2751,224266,CPSI,Have The Markets Changed ,opinion,Questions we are commonly asked are  Have the markets changed  Is it different this time  Have advances in technology made it so the average trader does not have a chance anymore These questions are easy to answer  and with complete certainty  No Free markets behave the same as they did 200 hundred years ago  The same as they did 40 years ago  They same as they did in the bull market of the 1990s  They are the same today  and will be the same in the foreseeable future Why  Because free markets are never static  Because they always CHANGE  They are subject to the buying and selling of millions of participants  each with his or her own viewpoint and   or expectations Any analyst can  predict  a rally or a decline and have a chance of being correct  But try and repeat the feat with consistency The only thing you can absolutely count on is change  Markets will advance  Markets will decline If you have a trading system that is specifically designed to  use  change  you can take advantage of the market  changes  and make money Changes will not impact negatively on you if your strategy for handling them is actually based on them  If your buy and sell signals are created by the ups and downs of the market itself Predicting The Market s FutureIf change is the only  certainty  looking forward  then how can one predict  forecast  the market s future That is the point   No one  can predict  with any certainty  the market s direction  But while no market forecast can be guaranteed  change  is  guaranteed One thing we can be sure of  if your plan is to just buy and  hope   you will be in for some very unsettling times The markets will have incredible moves in the future  both  up   as well as  down   You will be ecstatic during rallies  and upset and worried during declines  and likely depressed and fearing each day during the inevitable bear markets that  will  occur in the future  Sound like talking in circles  Not all    Let s tie it all together If change is inevitable  the only certain way to profit from the markets is to follow a plan that is  based  on change  That actually works  because  changes occur  Because change is inevitable Advancing  and declining  markets that last months and often much longer are called trends  Look at the last 200 years of market history and you will see that it was in a  trend   one way or the other  most of the time We follow trends  No matter how ridiculous those trends appear to be at the beginning  and no matter how extended or how irrational they seem at the end  we follow trends But Hasn t Technology Changed The Playing Field Some would argue that today s markets are different  Technology has given select traders an edge that takes away from the average person s ability to profit Buy and sell programs  moving massive amounts of stock  take advantages of fluctuations in prices that no individual can hope to master In fact they  create  fluctuations in prices  For every 10 traders with a computer program saying buy  there are 10 other traders with computer programs saying sell No matter what you do  No matter what the experts do  No matter what the computer generated programs do  Markets go through different stages  accumulation  advance  distribution and decline Prices Will Go Up  Down Or SidewaysOne absolute can be taken as gospel  Prices must either go up  down or sideways  One of these three outcomes will occur    change is inevitable No advances in technology  no leaps of modern science  no radical shifts in how we see the markets will ever alter this fact Thus a market timer does not need to predict the future  or even attempt to predict it  A timer only needs to know the rules of the game and abide by them  If the market goes up  be long  If the market goes down  be short or in cash And very importantly  if you can react properly to  changes  in price  you can profit Strategy Based On ChangeTrend followers are always poised to jump on board the next unexpected major move in the markets  and to profit from it While some people focus on the past results of a trading system to gauge its success  and others only think about what happened last month  Both are wrong A great trend following system adapts to and uses change  The  future  is its most important ally A good trend following strategy lets profitable positions continue  while quickly exiting positions that go against you Human NatureThere are always fears that trend following may not work in the future or that the markets have changed and trend following is not the way to go This fear is strongest after a drawdown or during unprofitable sideways markets Get used to it  They happen Then along comes another big move in the markets  Market timers who follow trends  again  make big profits and everyone s belief in trend following is restored But those who dropped by the wayside are still on the outside looking in  trying to understand how to generate profits  After trend followers lock in a nice gain  those who left may even climb on board and try trend following again But human nature is fickle If the markets are going sideways and current trading is not going well  alternatives begin to look better and better Untested or insufficiently tested methods may be implemented in an effort to turn things around  Of course  such acts of desperation rarely work  Market timers should be suspicious of the urge to change  made during emotional periods  after market moving news events or in the midst of a drawdown

2752,224267,CPSI,Ahead Of Options Expiration  Watch For The Rumors,opinion,This Friday is the monthly options expiration for January  Often  many traders experience a lot of volatility during the four trading sessions leading up to the expiration  These sessions will be filled with rumors plus countless upgrades and downgrades  Some of the chatter may be true  however  most will not  That s just one of the ways large institutions move stocks in their favor Institutional MovementWhy would they do that  It s simple  the large market moving institutions know that most retail options traders are simply buying call and put options on the near term expiration  The retail options trader does that because they re cheap  You see  the further out the option is in time  the more expensive it is for the trader  On the flip side  the closer the option is to the expiration date the cheaper it is  So  the institutional traders will try and figure out the imbalances in the near term expiration and move the equity in the opposite direction of the majority small retail options traders  For example  if there are a lot of call options bought in a particular stock by a large amount of retail traders  large institutions will drive stocks in the opposite direction and make those options expire worthless or out of the money  That type of action happens during the third week of every month  How do the institutions know what the small retail options trader is betting on Simple  they watch the options chain with sophisticated computer programs to see where the small number of contracts are bought  Large institutions buy thousands of contracts at a time  while the small retail trader buys between one and twenty contracts  Believe it or not  it s not too difficult for them to do  Once they see a large imbalance in a particular equity  they take that stock in the opposite direction  Just look at how many bullish call options there were when Apple Inc   AAPL  was trading over  700  Soon after that high print  it rolled over by more than 200 points to  505 a share  It is safe to say that those call options expired worthless   So expect the rumore to fly this week  On Monday there were rumors about Apple Inc  Dell Inc   DELL  and Hewlett Packard Company  HPQ  just to name a few  Other leading equities that tend to be volatile during the week of options expiration include First Solar  Inc   FSLR   Green Mountain Coffee Roasters  Inc   GMCR  and Netflix  Inc   NFLX  Beware The Upgrade  Downgrade Traders should also watch for upgrades at highs and downgrades at lows by major banks and brokerage firms  This is another common way the large institutions move stocks in the direction they are betting  Traders should always be on guard this week as options expiration approaches ,2013-01-14,Nicholas Santiago,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/ahead-of-options-expiration,-watch-for-the-rumors-150813",150813
2753,224268,CPSI,Picking Stocks  Validea Offers A Refreshingly Different Approach ,opinion,IntroductionIt is well documented that picking individual stocks is not a good bet  1  Market prices do a pretty good job at reflecting all available information  and when new information becomes available  you are not likely to be able to act on it before others  And having more than one stock in your portfolio reduces risk  That is why most people use investment vehicles that include a number of stocks  e g   mutual funds or indices that reflect a group of stocks  e g   ETFs But there remain a lot of stock pickers  I am one of them  I enjoy beating the market as I did in 2012 with Brookfield Asset Management  BAM  35    I talk less about picks that don t do so well  e g   my purchase of Allied Irish Banks  AIB  before the Irish banking collapse in the second half of 2008  But rational or not  stock picking continues  and for those of you that do it  I urge you to take a look at Validea The Evolution of ValideaJohn Reese  its founder  has an undergrad degree from MIT in electrical engineering  where he got involved in its Artificial Intelligence Lab  and an MBA from Harvard Business School  John became interested in investing  who were good at it and why  He ended up writing a book about them    The Guru Investor  How to Beat the Market Using History s Best Investment Strategies   In it  he describes the investment strategies of each of his gurus  Benjamin Graham  John Neff  David Dremen  Warren Buffett  Peter Lynch  Kenneth L  Fisher  Martin Zweig  James O Shaughnessy  Joel Greenblatt  and Joseph Piotroski Reese took it further  drawing on his background in artificial intelligence at MIT  he developed computer programs modeling the strategy of each guru  And Validea uses these programs to  pick stocks  for each guru  Of course  they are only Reese s interpretation of how  his gurus  would pick stocks  but it does make interesting reading  Reese added two other computer generated gurus models to those listed in the book  Validea s Momentum and Motley Fool  A spokesman for Validea explained why these were added   One of the side benefits of both the Fool and the Momentum models is that they are growth and momentum based  which is nice because it offers a little style diversity from the value oriented approaches of most of the models on the site  Validea started in 2003  and the web site provides detailed performance data on all his gurus  stock picks since then  Table 1 provides the performance data on the gurus for the periods  since inception  2008  and the last five years  The Validea Hot List  ten stocks that rate highest among all gurus  is also included Table 1    Validea Guru PerformanceThere are several points worth noting Since inception  only two gurus  Piotroski and Neff  have not beaten the S P while the performance of 3 gurus and the Validea Hot List have more than doubled it 2008 has been included as a year as a reminder of just how bad things got  The S P fell almost 40   At the time  I estimated global capital losses at  52 trillion which is extremely significant when you consider 2008 GDP was  61 trillion  The cutback in investment and consumption expenditures resulting from such capital losses pitched the world into recession  2008 was not a good guru year  only 5 of the 12 guru portfolios and the Hot List did less badly than the S P In the most recent four years  the S P 500 barely outperformed Piotroski  Neff  and Validea  Momentum   It did significantly better than Zweig  The remaining gurus and the Hot List outperformed the index Table 2 provides selected financial statistics on the guru portfolios  The EPS growth of most portfolios is notable  The annual turnover rates are high inasmuch as the portfolios are  rebalanced  every month  Such high rates are a bit out of character for Reese who preaches a long term perspective for investors  Table 2    Guru Portfolio StatisticsManaged FundsReese also has funds he manages for investors  Their performance is presented in Table 3  Since inception  all of the managed funds have beaten the S P benchmark  In the last four years  all but the International Fund have beaten the benchmark Table 3    Validea Managed Fund PerformanceSelected statistics for the managed funds are presented in Table 4  The averages are quite similar to the guru portfolios except for the turnover rates  The Hot List Fund is managed in the same manner its guru equivalent Table 4    Managed Fund StatisticsOn the Validea web site  you can get complete current and past performance data on all guru investment portfolios  The site also allows you to enter the ticker symbol of any stock that is of interest to find out how each guru rates it Peter Lynch   An AsideI was growing up in Boston when Peter Lynch took over Fidelity s Magellan Fund  FMAGX   What Lynch did with it was amazing  From 1977 until he  retired  in 1990 at 46  Magellan s value grew at a 26 4  annual rate versus the S P 500  13 3    When Lynch took over  Magellan s assets were under  100 million  When he retired  they exceeded  100 billion  I remember him saying once in an interview  Buy what you know about  If you are a housewife  look around when you are shopping and invest in products you like   Reese documents Lynch s interest in and use of the P E G ratio  I remember that Lynch as not so much a stock picker as an industry picker  If he liked an industry  he would instruct his buyers to purchase  the Industry  The Hot List NewsletterEvery 2 weeks  Validea puts out the  Hotlist News Letter   Reese starts it by writing an excellent round up and interpretation of economic data  In fact  his summary along with the Treasury s Monthly Statistics and The Economist are my primary sources of economic information  In his February 15th newsletter  he pointed out that the Labor Department just revised US private sector 2012 job growth upward by 335 000  meaning the US economy added 2 25 million jobs in 2012  He also research findings that indicate people who check their portfolios often do not do as well as those who check their portfolios less frequently  He also indicated his top guru portfolios grew by 13 3  annually since 2003 while the S P 500 has only gained 4 5   He then looked at the percentage of up days for his guru funds relative to the S P 500  They were very similar  Guru up days   52   S P up days   48   The conclusion  don t get diverted by good or bad days   all investments many of both The other interesting feature of the Hot List newsletter are the  Current List    top 10 stocks picked by the gurus   and the  Watch List    the next 10 guru stock picks  These stock picks are always worth considering  The Current and Watch List are presented below ConclusionsAs indicated at the outset  picking stocks is a losing game for most individuals  But if you believe you are special  the exception to the rule  you should take a look at Validea  Am I recommending that you use Validea to pick stocks  No  but I do think that looking at their Hot List Newsletter every so often is very worthwhile  I have been reading it for last decade

2754,224269,CPSI,Precious Metals Stocks  A Cold Hard Look At The Unfolding Carnage,opinion,Before we look at the charts tonight I just want to make it perfectly clear that I m not a gold basher or wish for bad things to happen to the precious metals complex  I first found the bull market in the precious metals stocks in the spring of 2002 after having the ride of a lifetime trading the tech stocks up until the spring of 2000 where I cashed out based on a particular chart pattern that told me to either expect a decent consolidation period to begin or it was the end of one of the greatest bull markets in history  It didn t take long to see a major top had formed and the place to be was on the sidelines  During that great run in the late 1990 s the precious metals stocks were not even close to being on my radar screen  It wasn t until I looked at a long term chart for gold  in the spring of 2002  that I seen a beautiful inverse H S base that I couldn t ignore  I didn t know anything about the precious metals stocks at that time but with that beautiful H S base I knew some of the precious metals stocks had to have a bullish look to them as well  I learned about the little juniors that everyone  who was connected to the precious metal complex  were talking about  This was game on for me and I have traded exclusively in the precious metals complex for the last eleven years  The chart patterns that gold  silver and the HUI created during their bull market were some of the most beautiful patterns a chartists like myself could ever expect to see  The reason I m telling you this is because what the precious metals charts have been showing me is that  like the 1990 s bull market  the precious metals complex has topped out and is now in a confirmed downtrend  How long and how far down this complex will go is any bodies guess  All I know for sure is the 13 year uptrend has topped and is now making lower highs and lower lows which is by definition a downtrend  I hope when you finish reading this article you will have a crystal clear picture of the bull market and the top that has been in place for some time now Now I would like to show you some charts of the HUI using it as a proxy for the big cap precious metals stocks  We will start out with the very short term look and work our way out to the beginning of the bull market that began in 2001 or so This first chart for the HUI is a 30 minute look that shows the latest consolidation pattern that has formed since the top last fall  This consolidation pattern I call an expanding falling wedge  because the top and bottom blue rails are widening and falling  It started out as a small triangle  labeled with the red numbers and has morphed into its current form  Most chartists won t recognize some of my chart patterns and will tell me to go back to charting school to learn the right way to chart  I have been doing this for 35 plus years using the Edwards and Magee Technical Analysis of Stock Trends as my charting bible  I have taken what they have given me and added my own unique style that you will recognize when you see a Rambus Chart I won t get into the details right here just to say when I build out a consolidation pattern I need to see an even number of reversal points  such as 4  6  8 or more for it to be valid  A top or bottom needs to have an odd number of reversal points to make a reversal pattern  As you can see on the chart below the HUI is working on its 4th reversal point to the downside  The pattern won t be complete until the bottom blue rail is hit and at that point I can call it a consolidation pattern  Right now it s still in the developmental stage  The heavy blue trendlines shows what I think will end up being that bearish expanding falling wedge consolidation pattern when it s all said and done as I will show you further along in this article Lets now look at a daily chart to put our little bearish expanding falling wedge into perspective  What you will also see on this daily chart are three more consolidation patterns that you won t see most chartists use but they are just as valid and useful as any other traditional consolidation pattern  Also what makes the HUI so negative looking is each consolidation pattern is sloping down into the downtrend  Under normal conditions  in a downtrend for instance  a small flag or wedge will slope up against the downtrend  When I see a consolidation pattern sloping in the same direction of the trend  it tells me the price action is in a hurry to go to the next level and when I see one form after the other in a series that tells me all hell is breaking loose What I have shown you on the charts above is only the tip of the iceberg that just shows the right shoulder of a massive H S topping pattern  Many times a consolidation pattern can be made up of several smaller patterns that ends up creating the finish product  This next chart is a long term daily chart for the HUI that shows the massive H S top formation  What I would like you to note is the 11 point diamond reversal pattern that makes up the head portion of the massive H S top  As I mentioned earlier in this article some of the chart patterns you see will only be found at Rambus Chartology Let s look at a few weekly charts to gain a little more perspective in what has and is happening with the precious metals stocks  This long term weekly chart shows the big H S top that has reversed the uptrend that started off the 2008 crash low  This weekly chart is a cleaned up version  of the many looks this H S top has  so you can see it in all its glory  There is an important feature on this chart that happened about 2 months ago when gold and silver broke below their 20 month rectangles  that we ll discuss at a later date  and that is the big halfway gap  brown shaded area  Most have forgotten about that gap but it s going to play a big role in the price action going forward as the HUI was unable to close it  There is another important feature on this weekly chart and that is the 2008 H S top that most missed at the time  You can t believe the amount of flack I took when I called that top  It was pure blasphemy to call a top in the HUI  How dare some one say something like that  When you say something the gold bugs don t like you had better have all your ducks lined up because if your wrong your going to be a dead duck  Fortunately for me things worked out and I was spared to chart another day Early in this article I said the precious metals complex  stocks and metals  produced some of the best looking chart patterns a chartists will see  Below is another long term weekly chart for the HUI that shows the beginning of its bull market and four beautiful consolidation patterns that formed until the 2008 H S top called for an end to that leg of the bull market  Note the move out of each blue consolidation pattern that was an impulse leg higher  That is what a true bull market looks like  One consolidation pattern followed by an impulse move up followed by another consolidation pattern until a top is finally found and a well need rest takes place Symmetry plays a big role in how I view a chart especially in fast moving markets  This next chart shows the reverse symmetry that is taking place to the downside that is reversing the rally off the 2008 crash low  The two black rectangles are exactly the same size in height and width  I don t know if the reverse symmetry down will be perfect and reach the bottom in October of this year but so far it has proven to be dead on the money since I first built this chart back in January of this year  Only time will tell but so far so good I would like to show you another form of symmetry that has to do with the halfway gap I showed you earlier and how it may play a big role moving forward  If that gap is truly a halfway gap  that shows up in the middle of a strong move  it will be confirming the October time and price objective that I showed you on the chart above  This time we are using two black rectangles that are exactly the same height and width that I m measuring the halfway gap with  Again I don t know how it will play out but so far its been working out better than I had expected when I first built this chart  As long as nothing is broken there is no need to fix it  So we ll just have to see how it plays out  It is uncanny how one can come up with a time and price objective using two completely different methods  Sometimes the markets are stranger than fiction as you well know I would like to leave you with one last chart that doesn t have anything to do with the precious metals stocks  At the beginning of this article I said there was a chart pattern that formed at the end of one of the greatest bull markets of all time  I know when some of you read that you were probably thinking ya right this guy is full of himself calling a top to an 18 year bull market  I only bring this up because chart patterns can give you the clearest view of the markets of any discipline I know  There are excellent Elliot Wave guys and cycles guys and many other forms of analysis that work very well for those that truly understand what they are doing  Charting gives me a way to follow the price action  and done correctly  keeps me out of trouble as so many in the precious metals complex are finding out again  I m still amazed at how such an old school of charting the markets competes right up there with the best computer programs that are trying to get an edge on you Below is the weekly chart for the COMPQ that gave me one of the biggest clues of my life that it was time to really consider what was happening at the time  For those of you that traded during the tech bubble you know how super bullish the hype was and how hard it was to emotionally distance yourself from all the noise  Can we say the same thing about the precious metals complex right now  Only time will tell  All the best Rambus,2013-06-20,David Tablish,https://www.investing.com/analysis/precious-metals-stocks:-a-cold-hard-look-at-the-unfolding-carnage-172189,172189
2755,224270,CPSI,Semiconductors Get Slammed As Investors Scramble To Protect Profits,opinion,"Volatility continues to increase in the stock market and many of the leaders are breaking down  In particular  semiconductors took a rather big hit when one of the bellwethers warned of weakening global demand  Nevertheless  despite the significant headwinds  I do not think this spells the end of the bull market  But the technical damage to the charts is severe  particularly to the small caps  which are in full blown correction mode  The large caps must show leadership and rally immediately    or it will put at risk the critical and widely anticipated year end rally 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market overview 
So far in October  the market already has seen five days with moves greater than 1   which is as many such days as we saw in the prior five months combined  Jeff Macke observed in Yahoo  Finance that nearly one third of every trading day in the month of October since 1970 has seen 1  movements  up or down  including the infamous Black Monday of 1987  Heck  even the great Wall Street Crash of 1929 commenced in October 
No  weakness in October is not unusual  and this year in particular  because it has been so long since the broad market has pulled back in a meaningful way  I see it as a welcome cleansing that should validate some key support levels  wring out some excesses and overbought technical conditions  and establish a base from which to kick off the highly anticipated year end rally 
Germany announced on Monday that factor orders fell  5 7   which heightened fears among an already fearful investor community that Europe is worse off than thought  But then on Wednesday  the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its best percentage gain of the year when the FOMC minutes expressed concern about the strong dollar and global economic weakness  which suggested that interest rate hikes are still a long ways off 
But then Thursday brought the worst daily point drop of the year  and the NASDAQ Composite endured its worst week since 2012  The NASDAQ started last week up  7 1  year to date  but fell  4 7  to finish the week up only  2 4  YTD  while the mighty NASDAQ 100 fell  4 2   bringing its 2014 gain down to  7 4   The Dow Industrials is back to breakeven for the year  and the S P 500 is clinging to a  3 2  gain after losing  3 2  last week alone  For its part  the Russell 2000 small cap index is now in full fledged correction mode  down  9 5  for the year and  13  from its July recovery peak 
So  what s really going on  Well  for all the flailing about and gnashing of teeth throughout the investment community  let s keep in mind that the S P 500 has not experienced a  10  pullback in over three years  while historically  such pullbacks tend to occur at least once every year  and  5  corrections typically occur three times a year 
I believe what we are enduring is a simple case of weak holders bailing out  of momentum riders locking in profits for fear of riding their positions back down to breakeven or losses  Nobody enjoys that  so these bearish events can become self perpetuating  With visions of prior selloffs  no one wants to be the guy left holding the bag while others tell tales of getting out just in time 
Technology    particularly the chip sector    took a direct hit to the chin late last week  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell  7  on Friday to a six month low  This all resulted from a warning on Thursday afterhours by Microchip Technology  NASDAQ MCHP  that sales in the most recent quarter will fall shy of previous guidance and that an industry correction has commenced  largely due to weak demand in China  Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  also cut its third quarter guidance citing lower than expected demand  MCHP is known as the proverbial canary in the coal mine because  unlike most chipmakers that report sales to distributors  many of whom may be building inventories   MCHP only reports revenue that has been sold from distributors to global customers  The bad news sent investors scrambling to protect profits in the strongest performers  including some of Sabrient s favorites like Skyworks Solutions  NASDAQ SWKS   NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI   Broadcom  NASDAQ BRCM   and RF Micro Devices  NASDAQ RFMD   all of which fell precipitously on Friday 
Is this it  then   i e   the end of the bull market that has been driven by Fed liquidity  as the Fed pulls the last bit of its quant easing off the table  I still say no  I believe this economic recovery has legs on its own  and it only requires a gut check and some renewed investor confidence to rejuvenate the bullish conviction that has suddenly disappeared 
There are headwinds  to be sure  The Fed is widely expected to announce the official end to QE3 on October 29  Over the past five years since quant easing began  the correlation between growth in the Fed balance sheet and S P 500 performance has been close to 1 0  Although some commentators are predicting that a new round of stimulus will be necessary sometime next year to support the economy  investors certainly aren t counting on it now  With liquidity plateauing  corporate stock buybacks and IPOs that have been supportive of equities are expected to slow 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  spiked above 20 for the first time since early February and closed Friday at 21 24  The VIX hit a low of 10 32 back on July 3  so it has more than doubled in the three months since then  In my article last week  I noted that 50 day SMA was crossing up through the 200 day SMA  which is bullish for VIX but bearish for stocks  From a historical perspective  VIX often hits a peak in October  Nevertheless  it remains well below the 40 level that it reached in October 2011  and recall that at the height of the financial crisis in 2008  VIX spiked above 80  In fact  the 19 20 level is its five year average 
Most of the world is struggling to get their economies on track  Global economic growth and inflation are both lower than anticipated for this stage of the recovery  given the broad focus among central banks on stimulus and liquidity  which means there is little hope for deleveraging anytime soon and the ratio of global debt to GDP continues to climb 
But overall  the bull case remains compelling for the next few years  The economic recovery continues to gain traction  with an expectation of  3  GDP growth  Mid term election years are typically bullish  and the holiday season usually fosters bullish sentiment  Interest rates remain low  and the Fed stands ready to support the economy as needed  Remember  although the Fed is nearly done with injections of newly minted cash  maturing securities still will be reinvested rather than unwound  And corporate earnings reports are expected to be strong 
Q3 earnings season is now underway  and according to Capital IQ  S P 500 companies are expected to post  7  earnings growth and  4  revenue growth  in aggregate  But even if Q3 earnings growth is indeed robust  all eyes will be on forward guidance and any words of caution or lack of visibility  like we heard from MCHP   After all  nearly half of S P 500 earnings come from foreign markets  Moreover  weakness in commodities and many fixed income instruments appear to be sending out recessionary signals 
The 10 Year U S  Treasury bond yield closed Friday around 2 3   which is once again down significantly from the prior week  It is the low for the year and its lowest close since June 2013  which was the middle of its big spike upward   This should come as no surprise given the global flight to safety and the extremely low rates of comparable 10 year government bonds in Germany and Japan  Looking forward  there is little reason to expect a sudden spike or rapid march higher any time soon  helping provide equities with the fuel to outperform 
So  I still expect the stock market to get its act together and finish the year a good bit higher    although I am not so confident anymore that it will be able to achieve new highs  The fundamental story for U S  equities might be somewhat less attractive than it was a few months ago  but it is still better than the alternatives 
Nevertheless  it seems time to walk away from speculative bets and perhaps even from simple passive investing in broad indexes  Instead  the time is ripe for selective buying of high quality companies with market dominant positions  Some of these top firms have been hit the hardest lately in the wave of fear based profit taking  But those with the strongest market position  solid cash flow  and lower debt levels will be back  Given the prevailing market conditions  elevated fear and volatility   investors must avoid the speculative stocks  especially those with high short interest    rather than benefiting from short covering  they have been the biggest underperformers during this bout of market weakness 
SPY chart review 
Another highly eventful week from a technical  chart  standpoint  Small caps are a disaster  Large caps are barely holding on  Blue chips in the Dow Industrials are back to breakeven year to date  And the NASDAQ 100  which had been holding up the market  finally succumbed last week  As for my weekly read of the SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY   it closed last Friday at 196 52  which is down over  3  from the previous Friday  Wednesday s big bounce was encouraging  but the bears would not back down  After all  this is finally their moment in the sun  Now the critical 200 day simple moving average is being tested as SPY closed Friday right on top of it  Notably  the bottom of the minor bullish rising channel  since April  came into play again  like it did the previous week   but this time it failed  and the lower trend line of the major and long standing rising channel from November 2012 came into play  and it  too  has failed    at least so far  we will see if it confirms on Monday 

After this test of the 200 day SMA  next support level is all the way down at 185  which is a previous level of resistance turned support  Oscillators RSI and Slow Stochastic are again in oversold territory after bouncing somewhat on Wednesday  while MACD is extremely oversold and due for a bounce 
Notably  if you look at the weekly chart of the SPY  not shown   I mentioned in last week s article that it has consistently found support at the 20 week exponential moving average  which is the center line of the Bollinger Bands    and a crossing below the 20 week is an indication of a trend reversal  This didn t quite happen the previous Friday  but last Friday it finally closed firmly below the 20 week EMA  This is quite bearish  and bulls need to reverse it immediately  If the failure is confirmed  the next test of support is the 50 week SMA around 188 
The small cap iShares Russell 2000 ETF  ARCA IWM  has become ridiculously oversold  which serves to illustrate that having oscillators at extremes is not a guarantee of an imminent reversal  Also  the NASDAQ 100  which is tracked by the PowerShares QQQ Trust  NASDAQ QQQ   has been showing impressive relative strength this year compared with all the other major indexes  but even it closed well below its 100 day SMA on Friday 
Latest sector rankings  
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF   Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ   and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
   Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology still holds the top spot with the same Outlook score of 87  The sector displays relatively solid scores across most factors in the model  including solid Wall Street analyst sentiment  despite getting hit with more downward revisions to earnings estimates   the strongest return ratios  a good forward long term growth rate  and a reasonable forward P E  Healthcare is in the second spot this week with a score of 68  displaying solid analyst sentiment  a good forward long term growth rate  decent return ratios  and good insider sentiment  open market buying   In third is Financial  followed by Industrial and Utilities 
2   Consumer Services Discretionary stays in the cellar this week with an Outlook score of 23  despite the highest long term forward growth rate and good insider sentiment  Telecom once again is also in the bottom two  Energy and Materials are the sectors getting hit the worst by sell side downward earnings revisions 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Healthcare again displays the highest score of 65  while Telecom is the lowest at 51  The top bottom spread is now 14 points  reflecting elevated sector correlations on particularly strong market days recently  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the all boats lifted in a rising tide mentality that dominated 2013  Also displaying strong Bull scores are Technology  Financial  Industrial  and Consumer Services Discretionary  which are all economically sensitive sectors that should indeed have the highest Bull scores in a healthy market 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities continues to see its score rise  reaching 65 this week  as one would expect for this traditionally defensive sector  Thus  Utilities stocks have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Energy continues to display a low score of 45  but after such a tough week  it is Technology that scored the lowest with a 45  The top bottom spread is now 20 points  reflecting low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  Also displaying strong Bear scores are Consumer Goods Staples and Healthcare  which along with Utilities are traditionally defensive  or all weather  sectors that should have the highest Bear scores in a healthy market 
5   Technology still displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  followed closely by Healthcare  while Telecom is the worst  followed by Energy  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Healthcare is the leader  followed by Utilities  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Energy is the worst  indicating general investor avoidance during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings still appear slightly bullish to me  The top four sectors are all economically sensitive  or in the case of Healthcare  all weather   and also display the highest Bull scores  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors 
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   maintains its neutral bias this week  and it still suggests holding Technology  Healthcare  and Financial sectors  in that order    Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules based trend following standpoint because SPY is below its 50 day simple moving average while remaining above its 200 day SMA    although just barely   
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Healthcare  and Financial sectors include First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  FirstTrust NQ Technology Dividend  NASDAQ TDIV   Market Vectors Bank   Brokerage ETF  NYSE RKH   and Market Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF  NYSE PPH  
For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Technology  Healthcare  and Financial sectors include Computer Programs and Systems  NASDAQ CPSI   QUALCOMM  NASDAQ QCOM   Shire plc  NASDAQ SHPG   Allergan  NYSE AGN   Citigroup  NYSE C   and Discover Financial Service  NYSE DFS    All are highly ranked in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top two quintiles  lowest accounting related risk  of our   a k a   EQR   a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you think the market has begun a bullish reversal and you prefer to maintain a bullish bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding the same three in a different order  Healthcare  Technology  and Financial  in that order   But if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Healthcare  and Consumer Goods Staples  in that order  
IMPORTANT NOTE   Some readers have been asking for more specifics on how to trade our sector rotation strategy based solely on what I discuss in my weekly newsletter  Thus  I feel compelled to remind you that I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if the model was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral bearish bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

2760,224275,CPSI,Nasdaq Composite Closes At Record High  5 Top Ranked Picks,opinion,On Jun 14  the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite index scaled a fresh high at closing  Yesterday s rally can be attributed to strong showing by media  telecom and tech stocks fueled by market anticipation of mega merger deals  This also highlights the gradual fading of investors  apprehensions regarding the trade and geopolitical issues  which was the primary reason behind severe market volatility in the last three months On Jun 12  the favorable verdict regarding unconditional merger of AT T  NYSE T  and Time Warner by a U S  district court opened the floodgate of mergers and acquisitions  M A  in the integrated telecom tech media industry  The market is rife with speculations of similar deals  consequently propelling major media and telecom stocks  Market watchers consider this as further evidence of upbeat sentiment about the economy With investors finally coming out of broad based market fluctuations  it will be prudent to invest in tech stocks that are part of the Nasdaq Composite Integration of Telecom Cable TV Media  A Survival StrategyFierce competition from tech behemoths has completely altered the market landscape  compelling telecom  cable TV and media operators to band together in order to survive  Vertical integration of distribution and content creation will create a unique platform to serve any sort of communications  broadcasting along with a vast area of entertainment industry In order to derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform  telecom  cable TV and media operators are aggressively penetrating the digital advertising technology market  Currently  tech behemoths like Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Twiter are major beneficiaries of digital advertisements M A to Provide Economies of ScaleThe merger between AT T and Time Warner poses a fresh challenge to the likes of Alphabet Facebook and Twitter which dominate the online advertising space  If AT T now decides to combine it broadband  mobile and online video streaming services with Time Warner s films  television shows and sporting events  it will be capable of becoming a serious threat to tech companies   Court s approval of AT T Time Warner deal immediately triggered a merger battle between Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  and The Walt Disney for majority assets of Twenty First Century Fox  Moreover  stocks prices of other major media companies like Disney  CBS  Viacom and Discovery Communications  NASDAQ DISCA  also increased as all of these became lucrative takeover targets Stock prices of telecom giants like Verizon  AT T  Comcast and Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  also increased as these potential acquirers of media companies will have a highly diversified business model and significant economies of scale if these buyouts take place Our Top Picks  With U S  economic growth being the sturdiest since recession  unemployment at an 18 year low  and both consumer and business confidence at high level despite the ongoing trade conflict  it makes sense to ride out the amazing growth momentum  At this stage  investment in Nasdaq stocks with strong earnings momentum will be lucrative option We have narrowed down our search to five stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and

2776,224291,CPSI,Get Ready For The Gold Rebound Before It Is Too Late  Marshall Auerback,opinion,While timing exactly when the rebound will happen is impossible  Marshall Auerback  director of Pinetree Capital  believes now is the time to pay the gold market renewed attention  In this exclusive Gold Report interview  he explains why the gold market is more interesting than in the recent past and shares what he would do if he were chairman of the Federal Reserve   The Gold Report  Marshall  in a July 12  2012  post on the Pinetree website  you suggest that some central banks may have forward sold their gold against their initial positions  thereby eliminating them altogether  Can you tell us more   Marshall Auerback  I have seen these central banks in action and have met with people from several of them  They would contend it was their obligation to maximize the yield on any of the assets they had in their reserves  including gold   Back when gold was in the low  300s ounce  oz   the Bundesbank considered gold nuclear waste from the old gold standard era  There are some suggestions  based on Roger Lowenstein s work  that the Bank of Italy lent out some of its gold to long term capital management as a funding source  The point is that these banks have been a major source of flows into the market  These flows have had the same impact as de facto sales  in that they make available gold to the forward market and help fill the gap between supply and demand   This is significant that the Bank for International Settlements has talked about reclassifying gold for commercial banks from a Tier 3 to a Tier 1 asset  which effectively means that gold will have 100  weighting  as opposed to 50   This reflects a change in how the official sector views gold   The second phenomenon is what has been happening in the Eurozone  A fiat currency is vaporizing before our eyes  A number of central banks hold a substantial amount of euros in their foreign exchange reserves that may be worth nothing  Some central banks may have gold holdings  but not as much as they claim  because of forward sales  There is most likely a structural short in the market from the central banks   A decade ago  the mining companies would have been selling forward production  and the private sector would have had the structural short position  Today  nobody is selling forward gold because companies are much more optimistic about the price  and nobody wants to borrow it right now  As usual  the central banks are on the wrong side of the trade   TGR  Are you willing to speculate about which central banks are shorting gold   MA  From what I have heard  it would not surprise me if the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of Italy have done it  The Bank of Spain and the Bank of Portugal have sold a lot of their gold and may be lending the rest  also the Bundesbank   A lot of these sales took place many years ago when the price of gold was  500 1 000 oz  My point is that the actual holdings these banks retain are much smaller than what appears on their balance sheets  Of course  they would want to get that gold back to spare the embarrassment if the euro blows up  This is why I have suggested that even if there is one more selloff in gold  the declines will be cushioned because the central banks will be bidding to buy back what they sold forward   TGR  Could this information create a spike in the gold price   MA  Many thoughtful people would see the demise of the euro as very bullish for gold  along with the possibility of higher inflation in China and all of the qualitative easing introduced by the Federal Reserve lately  Yet  gold has gone nowhere   If one measures the position of traders reports on the Comex and then factor in that the Over the Counter market  OTC  is about 5 10 times the size  the net long position of speculative interest in gold is huge  That said  net positions have been reduced substantially in the past several months several hundred tonnes would be my guess and yet the price hasn t declined that much  which suggests that there is a bid in the market  The official sector  perhaps   I would say there could be another 400 500 tons liquidated  which would easily be absorbed by the central banks  Ultimately  this slow  ticking time bomb will resolve itself with a much higher gold price   TGR  Is Pinetree Capital increasing its overall exposure to gold equities due to your theory   MA  I think we have increased it from a few years ago  but I do not know if my theory has had an impact   Our general feeling at Pinetree that gold is slowly being re monetized has driven our investment decisions  Relative to the metal  gold equities are at such valuation extremes that it makes it a much more compelling valuation relative to copper  iron ore or some of the base metals  But we ve been bullish on gold since the early 2000s  based on the positive supply demand fundamentals  All of those factors are part of the decision to increase our overall exposure   TGR  How much of Pinetree s resource pie was dedicated to gold based equities on March 31  2012  versus March 31  2011   MA  We remain at 40 45   The percentage is much more significant than it was two years ago  We have been bullish on gold since we started investing back in 2002  However  it is important to point out that we are talking about shifts within valuations relative to copper and iron ore   TGR  How do you explain the recent disconnect between the performance of gold and gold equities   MA  One reason is the very strong rally in 2010  When you have a strong rally  a digestive process seems to follow  The market gets loaded up with paper and it takes 18 24 months to resolve before a new cycle starts  At this point  a lot of paper has been digested and the sellers have mostly gotten out of it   There also is increasing resource nationalism  Mines operating in politically sensitive jurisdictions have been derated for that reason   In addition  gold has been securitized  Ten years ago  we didn t have a gold exchange traded fund as such  A lot of people simply buy these synthetic indices instead of junior stocks  But once you get a strong rally in the gold price  people inevitably come back   Finally  there are liquidity preferences  People tend to buy the bigger stuff first and if the rally sustains itself  as I think it will  they will move into the smaller stuff   TGR  When do you anticipate that rebound   MA  Autumn would be my guess  sometime in the next three or four months   Initially  market volatility will increase fairly dramatically  You might get one more sharp spike to the downside  as the result of euro related selloffs and the drive for dollars  These movements start with what I call the  algo monkeys   traders whose computer programs use algorithms to trade mechanistically  independent of any kind of fundamental backdrop   I expect a substantially higher gold price four to five months from now  A year from now I would not be surprised to see gold above  2 000 oz   TGR  You also are a proponent of further public sector deficit spending to create jobs and reduce private sector debt   MA  Yes  and it has nothing to do with Keynesianism  it is Accounting 101  In any accounting period  total income in an economy must equal total outlays  and total savings out of income flows must equal total investment expenditures on tangible assets   The financial balance of any sector in the economy is simply income minus outlays or its equivalent  savings minus investment  Any sector  whether it be the government  external  import export  private household or businesses sector  can run a deficit or a surplus  In aggregate  they all have to balance  but any one can run a deficit providing someone else is prepared to run a surplus   If the private sector  in the aftermath of the recession  is trying to pay down debt and re establish a level of savings  you have to prevent a major contractionary spiral  That means either substantially increasing exports or running a larger government deficit  The latter facilitates private sector deleveraging and helps sustain economic growth by putting a floor on demand   Everyone who promotes cutting back public spending is effectively advocating private sector debt  A private sector debt bubble got us into this mess  not profligate government spending   TGR  You have accused Ben Bernanke  chairman of the Federal Reserve  of  talking out of both sides of his mouth   What would you be doing if you were in his shoes   MA  The first thing I would do is be honest  Mr  Bernanke has quite rightly warned of the dangers of the U S  falling off a fiscal cliff at the end of 2012 if there is no agreement between both houses of Congress and the president to prevent  1 trillion  T  in budget cuts  and I applaud him for that   But then he goes on to say  longer term  we have to pay down these bills because they are fiscally unsustainable  I think that is totally wrong  Fiscal sustainability is a meaningless concept  A country that issues its own currency and issues debt in a free floating  nonconvertible currency can always create more of its currency to sustain its spending  Mr  Bernanke should be honest about this but central bankers always emphasize the virtues of monetarism  There is no evidence that their tools work  The impacts of monetary policy  as opposed to fiscal policy  are much more diffuse  It is akin to doing surgery with a butcher s knife rather than a scalpel   TGR  Do you advocate targeting certain areas of the economy versus broad based bond buying   MA  Bond buying via quantitative easing accomplishes nothing  It simply constitutes an asset swap on the Fed s balance sheet  When the Fed buys a bond  it replaces the bond with reserves in the banking system  You are swapping something that yields 2  with something that yields 0 25  at current rates   There is nothing inherently inflationary about the process  as it is only spending per se that creates inflation  and that assumes that we are at full real resource usage   Monetary policy per se does not contribute to overall increases in aggregate demand or spending power  There is actually an argument that it reduces it  because as you are presumably helping borrowers  you are robbing savers and pensioners of income by keeping rates low   I think it is more important to get money into the hands of regular individuals so they can spend  A lack of spending power is creating the conditions for sluggish economic growth   TGR  What would you do besides being honest   MA  I would like to see the federal government implement more New Deal style programs  as we had under the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps  I would have a government job guarantee  JG  program as a permanent feature of government spending  to act as a buffer stock the way gold did under the gold standard system  Government as employer of last resort would not be introducing another element of intrusive bureaucracy into our economy  but simply better utilizing the existing stock of unemployed  now dependent on the public purse especially the chronically long term unemployed   The current system we have relies on unemployed labor and excess capacity to try to dampen wage and price increases  however  it pays unemployed labor for not working and allows that labor to depreciate and develop behaviors that act as a barrier to future private sector employment  Social spending on the unemployed prevents aggregate demand from collapsing into a depression like state  but little is done to enhance future growth and demand  which can be done via the JG program by providing them with employment  greater education and higher skill levels   The JG program would allow for the elimination of many existing government welfare payments for anyone not specifically targeted for exemption  and would command greater political legitimacy  as society places a high value on work as the means through which individuals earn a livelihood  Minimum wage legislation would no longer be needed  as it would be established via the JG  Labor would welcome the safety net of a guaranteed job  and business would recognize the benefit of a pool of available labor it could draw from at some spread to the government wage paid to JG employees   Additionally  the guaranteed public service job would be a counter cyclical influence  automatically increasing government employment and spending as jobs were lost in the private sector  and decreasing government jobs and spending as the private sector expanded  It would therefore remain a permanent feature of our economy  in effect acting as a buffer stock to put a floor under unemployment  while maintaining price stability whereby government offers a fixed wage  which does not  outbid  the private sector  but simply creates a stabilizing floor and thereby prevents deflation   When the private sector wants to retrench  the government would step in and offer jobs at a certain rate for anyone willing and able to work  That would resolve this old canard about how much unemployment is voluntary versus involuntary  The point is  not to outbid the private sector for workers  but to keep workers trained and working until the private sector is ready to hire  Otherwise  capacity restraints appear much earlier among the long term unemployed because their skills erode substantially   I also would introduce revenue sharing with the states so they would not have to use the contractionary fiscal policies that they are introducing now  This would be done on a per capita basis for all 50 states   In addition  I would like to see large infrastructure projects undertaken  All you have to do is drive through New York City to realize that  1T could be spent revising that city s infrastructure alone  That would generate growth  employment and higher incomes  and you would have a substantially lower public deficit as a result   My point is that you do not want credit based policies  You want policies that increase employment and income   TGR  Are Western economies headed for another recession inside of two years   MA  They could be if the mania for fiscal austerity  particularly in Europe  continues  What is happening in Europe is misconceived and destructive  If you are in a hole  the first rule is to stop digging  The risk of the U S  falling off a fiscal cliff is reduced if Obama is re elected   And while it has slowed down  I see signs that China is responding with another big ramp up in fiscal expenditures  through state sponsored  fixed investment projects that are financed through expansion of bank credit and money   The Shanghai Securities News reported that China s four biggest banks issued around  50 billion  B   about  8B worth in new renminbi loans in the first half of July  That is double the same period in June  The article also suggests that China has been speeding up infrastructure  project approvals  spending subsidies and offering tax breaks for smaller businesses  This is significant because some fairly pronounced domestic inflationary pressures remain in China  Renewed money and credit expansion will increase the rate of growth of nominal incomes  and that will go more into price inflation  as opposed to real growth  which has been the case in the past   TGR  With everything we have talked about in mind  is this the time to invest in high risk mining projects   MA  We are closer to an inflationary inflection point than a lot of people realize  In addition to what I ve described in China  you have the dynamic of a possibly evaporating euro  You have political pressures in Japan for a monetary policy that pursues a positive inflation target  Eventually  the Fed will try another gimmick to shift private portfolio preferences toward assets like gold   Add all of those things together  and you have a very gold friendly environment   At first  this will manifest itself in demand for the bigger companies  but many of the smaller companies have very compelling valuations  I look at them as long day  gold call options   Timing the entry points is never easy  but I think we are closer to the beginning of the end of the down cycle  The gold market is more interesting than it has been in three or four years  Now is the time to pay it renewed attention   TGR  As of March 31  Pinetree owned 15 5M shares of Apogee Silver Ltd   APE TSX V  with about 625 000 more shares set to expire on May 12  Why such a large position   MA  Apogee continues to advance its silver project in Bolivia with a feasibility study due to be concluded by the end of 2012  which will include an updated mineral resource estimate  It also recently acquired the Cachinal silver property in Chile  which will provide further resource growth and geographic diversification  The realities in terms of political risk vary on a company by company basis and Apogee appears to have the support of local communities  which is critical to operating in most jurisdictions   TGR  One of Pinetree s largest positions in the precious metals space is Gold Canyon Resources Inc   GCU TSX V   As of March 31  2012  you held 10 288M shares  Gold Canyon recently raised  15M in a bought deal offering  Raising that kind of cash is no easy task today  Why are institutional investors so bullish on this junior   MA  Its success raising money indicates that Gold Canyon has the makings of a world class deposit  Its significant moves in the past few months have not been reflected in the stock price because of market conditions   The recent stepout holes and intercepts of depth show that Gold Canyon has really only scratched the surface  There is a lot of prospectivity here  Because of prevailing current market conditions  you get a fairly well defined area  along with a lot of free optionality  The initial resource of 4 million ounces  Moz  gold equivalent is just a start  The next resource update should show significant growth   TGR  Do you believe Springpole will become a gold mine   MA  The company has recently added a team of mine builders to the board with the addition of Troy Fierro and Richard Hall  who have the ability to push the project forward  We do not foresee adverse surprises and believe the project has an above average probability of going into production   TGR  Pinetree has positions in other small cap precious metals companies  including Prodigy Gold Inc   PDG TSX V  and Unigold Inc   UGD TSX V   Could you tell us about them   MA  Prodigy is a very good example of the risk reward of the junior gold market  The first preliminary economic assessment  PEA  outlined a pre tax net present value of 8  of  709M  The company recently raised more than  40M at  0 80 share and  0 95 share in flow through capital  despite trading below  0 60 share  The market cap is around  160M   Prodigy s deposit is in a very stable jurisdiction  I do not see the Ontario government expropriating assets  and Wawa is as safe as any place in the world right now  It has infrastructure nearby  The deposit is unlikely to provide any great technical challenges  For whatever reason  it is underappreciated  A new resource and PEA expected later this year will probably provide near term catalysts to give the stock good momentum  Prodigy is a standout among its peers   Unigold has multimillion ounce potential at its Neita project in the Dominican Republic  a jurisdiction that may not be as politically stable as Wawa  Ontario  but there have never been any signs of problems  It is in a very attractive mineral belt that hosts the 25 3 Moz Pueblo Viejo deposit  a joint venture between Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  and Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE    Recent drill results at 77 meters showed 3 81 grams per ton gold  It is increasingly rare to find a combination of those grades and widths  This could be another world class deposit  It has a very large drill program planned and plenty of cash  Unigold can continue to drill and maintain its stepout program  I think its near term catalysts will lead to a significant value rerating   TGR  But the deposit is right on the border with Haiti  Any concerns there   MA  Not really  Haiti certainly has suffered many human tragedies and natural disasters  but there has never been an indication that it is hostile to mining interests or foreign investment   TGR  Market conditions have taken a negative turn this summer  What s your advice to retail investors today   MA  Patience  patience  patience  To acquire strategic positions in this market sector  you have to get in early and sometimes sit with your positions  It can be very frustrating  and you cannot time these things perfectly   Markets tend to gap up very dramatically  sometimes on very limited volumes  We would rather be in position when the move comes  People know that when they invest with us  they will be getting the full  maximum leverage  We are not trying to be market timers  We may be a little bit in the relative valuation business  in terms of preferring one sector to another  as we do with gold right now   When you have good macro combined with strong valuation considerations  it is a good time to invest over any sensible medium  to long term timeframe   TGR  Marshall  thank you for your time and insights   As Pinetree Capital s corporate spokesperson  Marshall Auerback is a member of Pinetree
