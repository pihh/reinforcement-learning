Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund Inc   NASDAQ CUBA  has been going absolutely crazy  Since President Obama announced diplomatic relations with Cuba  this stock has gone from 7 00 a few days ago to almost 15 00 on Tuesday  That s more than 100  in a week  I don t want you getting hardwired with this one  so keep an eye on Tuesday s low at 12 1 4  because beneath that is reversal  It closed at the 14 00 level  so it may take a run to 15  and even as high as 16 17 18  but be very careful 
GoPro  Inc   NASDAQ GPRO  had a reversal of late  It was down two days in a row  and then back up on Tuesday  It went through the declining topsline  but there s lateral resistance and moving averages up there  It s going to have to make a move above the 64 1 2 area to prevent a reverse  The target is set at 70 72  but a reversal will take out the low at 53 1 2 where it could be very dangerous 
XPO Logistics  Inc   NYSE XPO  did well on Tuesday  up 1 62  or 4   on 827 700 shares traded  Looking at the chart  you can see a V bottom  and the extension  or what we call a right handed platform that was broken out  Look for it to get up to 47  which is the next target

11099,232614,CYTK,2 Hot Stocks To Buy While The S P And Nasdaq Take A Rest,opinion,"Although the main stock market indexes have been in pullback mode the past few days  overall market conditions remain bullish 
As such  the current pullback presents a lower risk buying opportunity for top stocks and ETFs that have been showing relative strength with tight chart patterns 
Two such swing trade buy setups we are stalking for potential buy entry in The Wagner Daily over the coming days are biotechnology firm Cytokinetics Incorporated  NASDAQ CYTK  and software development company Rubicon  RUBI  
Let s take a quick look at why these equities may be excellent stocks to buy in the coming days 
Small cap poised for big breakout  CYTK 
CYTK is a small cap biotech stock that is setting up for a base breakout from a first stage base  Take a look 

CYTK grabbed our attention when it gapped sharply higher about three weeks ago  on volume that was more than 400  greater than the stock s average daily volume  see black rectangle on the chart  
Since then  CYTK has been trading in a tight  sideways range above its 50 day moving average  with both the 10 and 20 day moving averages sitting above the 50 day moving average 
The combination of the high volume gap  price action above 50 day MA  and the 20 day MA trading above 50 day MA means the stock possesses 3 of the  
If the price of CYTK rallies above the March 4 high  marked by the horizontal line   the stock could attract enough buying interest to enable it to break out above its tight  three week range 
If CYTK meets our exact criteria for buy entry  we will buy the stock with reduced share size because it is not an A rated setup 
Liquidity in this small cap stock is also a bit on the light side  which we compensate for by lowering our share size 
Crossing The Rubicon Pro  NYSE RUBI 
To    means to pass a point of no return 
Given the solid  earnings driven breakout from a first stage base two weeks ago  it indeed appears The Rubicon Project  RUBI  has definitively passed the point of no return  to its prior trading range  
After gently retracing from the February 25 high of its recent breakout and trading in a tight range for more than a week  the 10 day moving average has caught up to the price 
As with the CYTK setup  the stock also shares the key breakout attributes of a high volume gap  trading above the 50 day MA  with the 20 day MA above the 50 day MA 

For this momentum trade setup  we are looking for potential buy entry on a slight pullback from the March 4 move  the price must drop to the exact buy limit order listed in today s in order to trigger the trade  
RUBI is not an A rated stock  but does have strong revenues and two quarters in a row of improving EPS growth 
Although we are primarily technical traders  most leading stocks in the market share these two fundamental traits 
Key Support Levels To Watch  S P 500 
Our rule based trading system forces us to focus much more on the performance of leading stocks  rather than the price action of the main stock market indexes 
Nevertheless  because we are trend traders  it is always beneficial to make sure the broad based indexes remain healthy as well  put the wind at your back  
Despite the substantial pullback of the past few days  the S P 500 technically remains healthy 
As shown on the chart below  the benchmark index bounced off near term support of both its 20 day MA and prior highs yesterday  March 4  

Given the bullish intraday price reversal that converged with two near term support levels  the March 4 low of 2 087 now becomes a key price level to watch 
If the 2 087 support level fails to hold  next support is near the 2 065 level  which represents convergence of the rising 50 day moving average and the 10 week moving average  similar to 50 day moving average  
As long as the S P 500 remains above that 2 065 level and leading stocks continue to hold up  the current pullback in the market must be viewed as a buying opportunity 
Having an objective  rule based market timing system  such as   is a great way to ensure you remain positioned to take advantage of profitable opportunities when the time is right  and on the sidelines otherwise  ",2015-03-05,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-hot-stocks-to-buy-while-the-s-p-and-nasdaq-take-a-rest-244031,244031

11139,232654,CYTK,5 Tiny Biotech Stocks With Superb Growth Potential ,opinion,Market watchers still quibble over whether the equity market entered bear market territory or underwent a correction in year end 2018  But there is little debate over the fate of pharma stocks during this period  The sector plummeted last fall with the SPDR S P Biotech ETF  NYSE XBI  falling 35  from the peak achieved in September  This is a bear market in no uncertain terms However  biotech got off to a far better start this year  with the XBI up 17 7  year to date  A spate of deal making revived the sector in January  marked by some of the largest mergers in the history of the industry While the specter of pricing pressure hangs over biotech  the sector retains the ability to provide outsized gains  For investors with a substantial risk appetite  biotech retains the promise of strong returns in 2019  This is why it makes sense to pick up strong  cheap performers from the sector  priced below  10  2019 to Witness Spurt in Deal MakingEarlier in January  Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY   announced it was purchasing Celgene   NASDAQ CELG   for  74 billion in a cash and stock deal  The very next week  Eli Lily   NYSE LLY   said it was acquiring cancer drug marker Lexi Oncology   NASDAQ LOXO   for  8 billion  This continued last year s trend of frenetic deal making  Notably  Takeda Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TAK   acquired Shire for  8 billion And healthcare sector deals are likely to increase 7  over last year to  331 billion in 2019  This prediction was made in a report issued jointly by Oxford Economics and Chicago based law firm Baker McKenzie  This is a welcome change from the 5  decline experienced last year  It also does not include the deals involving Eli Lily and Bristol Myers Squibb Pricing Pressure Likely  Ability to Boost Gains RemainFollowing the recent mid term elections  frenetic legislative activity is being witnessed on the pricing pressure front  At this point  it seems that Democrats and Republicans may yet make common cause on the issue  However  the Trump administration s proposal to crack down on pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs  could spare the pharma industry some blushes Ultimately  the industry will have to learn how to survive in an increasingly cost conscious environment  However  pharma companies that are able to produce truly innovative treatments retain the potential of generating outsized profits  This is because they are able to erect formidable competitive moats in the process Further  any positive data on drug trials and approvals creates significant excitement and could boost the pharma stock in question considerably  At the same time  several sector members are small cap stocks in terms of market capitalization  Their small size and low float provide them with the ability to surge in the event of any positive news Our ChoicesAfter a disastrous end to 2018  pharma stocks have started the New Year on a considerably strong note  A flurry of deal making in January has boosted the sector and M A activity is likely to remain strong through most of the year  While the specter of pricing pressure remains  the sector retains the ability to deliver outsized gains This is why it makes sense to invest in select biotech stocks  which aren t a pinch on your pocket as they are trading below  10  We have

11140,232655,CYTK,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  BioDelivery  Cytokinetics  Celldex  Aduro And Aeterna,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  February 14  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  BioDelivery Sciences International  Inc    NASDAQ BDSI    Cytokinetics  Inc    NASDAQ CYTK    Celldex Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ CLDX    Aduro Biotech  Inc    NASDAQ ADRO   and Aeterna Zentaris Inc    TO AEZS   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog 5 Tiny Biotechs with Superb Growth PotentialMarket watchers still quibble over whether the equity market entered bear market territory or underwent a correction in year end 2018  But there is little debate over the fate of pharma stocks during this period  The sector plummeted last fall with the SPDR S P Biotech  NYSE XBI  ETF falling 35  from the peak achieved in September  This is a bear market in no uncertain terms However  biotech got off to a far better start this year  with the XBI up 17 7  year to date  A spate of deal making revived the sector in January  marked by some of the largest mergers in the history of the industry While the specter of pricing pressure hangs over biotech  the sector retains the ability to provide outsized gains  For investors with a substantial risk appetite  biotech retains the promise of strong returns in 2019  This is why it makes sense to pick up strong  cheap performers from the sector  priced below  10  2019 to Witness Spurt in Deal MakingEarlier in January  Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  announced it was purchasing Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  for  74 billion in a cash and stock deal  The very next week  Eli Lilly  NYSE LLY  said it was acquiring cancer drug marker Lexi Oncology for  8 billion  This continued last year s trend of frenetic deal making  Notably  Takeda Pharmaceuticals acquired Shire for  59 billion And healthcare sector deals are likely to increase 7  over last year to  331 billion in 2019  This prediction was made in a report issued jointly by Oxford Economics and Chicago based law firm Baker McKenzie  This is a welcome change from the 5  decline experienced last year  It also does not include the deals involving Eli Lily and Bristol Myers Squibb Pricing Pressure Likely  Ability to Boost Gains RemainFollowing the recent mid term elections  frenetic legislative activity is being witnessed on the pricing pressure front  At this point  it seems that Democrats and Republicans may yet make common cause on the issue  However  the Trump administration s proposal to crack down on pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs  could spare the pharma industry some blushes Ultimately  the industry will have to learn how to survive in an increasingly cost conscious environment  However  pharma companies that are able to produce truly innovative treatments retain the potential of generating outsized profits  This is because they are able to erect formidable competitive moats in the process Further  any positive data on drug trials and approvals creates significant excitement and could boost the pharma stock in question considerably  At the same time  several sector members are small cap stocks in terms of market capitalization  Their small size and low float provide them with the ability to surge in the event of any positive news Our ChoicesAfter a disastrous end to 2018  pharma stocks have started the New Year on a considerably strong note  A flurry of deal making in January has boosted the sector and M A activity is likely to remain strong through most of the year  While the specter of pricing pressure remains  the sector retains the ability to deliver outsized gains This is why it makes sense to invest in select biotech stocks  which aren t a pinch on your pocket as they are trading below  10  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics BioDelivery Sciences International  Inc  is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of treatments in the areas of pain management and drug addiction BioDelivery Sciences has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The company has expected earnings growth of 68
