21548,243063,AOSL,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Alpha And Omega Semiconductor,opinion,"Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited   NASDAQ AOSL   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for AOSL broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 29  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for AOSL stock 
If that wasn t enough  AOSL isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  2 estimates have been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for AOSL  You can see

21553,243068,AOSL,5 Tech Stocks To Buy As Sector Rallies Strongly,opinion,"After riding high on a spectacular Apple Inc    NASDAQ AAPL   fueled rally  tech stocks declined on Friday  However  this was a departure from the trend of strong gains that the sector has been enjoying during the current quarter  Concerns about the valuation of defensive stocks have led to a movement into more aggressive options over this period 
Safer options have also lost their luster given the optimism about a rebounding economic growth and increasing chances of a rate hike  Given the current market situation  such gains are likely to continue by and large going forward  This is why it makes sense to opt for tech stocks at this point 
Apple Gains on iPhone 7 Launch
News that the first set of iPhone 7 were sold out globally helped Apple s shares jump 3 4  to  115 57 on Thursday  its highest close since December  The iPhone maker registered its first four day winning streak with successive gains of more than 2  since Apr 2009  The broader Technology Select Sector SPDR  gained 1 6   the highest among the S P 500 sectors 
Shares of the iPhone maker slipped marginally on Friday  losing 0 1   However  it still managed to register its sharpest product launch related gains since 2011  Over the week  the stock managed to gain 11 4   These were its largest weekly gains since Oct 2011 
Tech Gains from Sharp Rotation
Cyclical and relatively less popular categories  such as technology and finance  have recently found favor with the markets once again  One of the reasons behind this is heightened concerns about the valuation of traditionally defensive sectors such as telecom and utility 
These sectors had become popular at the beginning of the year following fears over the global growth outlook  Consequently  shares of telecom and utilities companies had gained more than 20  up to August  However  these sectors have lost more than 7  and 5   respectively since the beginning of August 
Growing signs of an imminent rate hike and indications of a domestic economic recovery are among the other reasons for the renewed popularity of more aggressive options  Taken together  these factors have led to a rotation into traditionally riskier but currently more reasonably priced options 
Our Choices
Fears about the valuation about traditionally defensive options have led to the renewed popularity of tech and finance stocks  Indications of a rate hike later this year and a pickup in economic growth have also powered gains for these stocks 
Tech stocks have also received impetus from recent Apple fueled gains  Picking stocks from this sector looks like a good option at this point  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult

21556,243071,AOSL,5 Top Ranked Breakout Stocks Offering Formidable Returns,opinion,Seeking out breakout stocks is probably one of the most favored techniques among active investors  The logic behind this kind of stock selection is to determine those are trading within a narrow band  These stocks are to be bought as soon as they move above this channel and sold when they fall below  In case a stock moves above this band  it usually gains momentum At the same time  market watchers warn against incorrectly timing such a move  This is because there is a significant risk of identifying stock movements as breakouts even when this is not the case  However  when utilized judiciously  this strategy yields formidable gains  which is the reason why it remains popular Zeroing in on Breakout Stocks In order to select the right breakout stock one has to first calculate its support and resistance level  A support level is the lower bound for stock movements while a resistance level refers to the maximum price which it trades within over a considerable period In other words  the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level  which means most traders are willing to sell it  At the resistance level  most traders are willing to go long on the stock  which means that they would like to add them to their portfolios  The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or those that have just broken above the resistance level Has a Breakout Really Occurred The central risk which accompanies such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For breakout to actually happen  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends  The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive    Current Price  52 Week High greater than or equal to 0 9  Stocks which are trading 90  close to

21589,243104,AOSL,5 Stocks With Favorable Liquidity Ratios For High Returns,opinion,"A company s liquidity position indicates its financial health  Companies that effectively meet debt obligations by converting their assets into liquid cash and equivalents are expected to offer healthy returns  
However  high liquidity alone does not imply that a company is financially strong  It may also indicate that the company is inefficient when it comes to utilizing its assets  Thus  one should also consider efficiency level in addition to liquidity to avoid selecting companies that have a weak financial position 
Measures of Liquidity 
Liquidity ratios   current  quick and cash   are the popular indicators of liquidity levels  Favorable liquidity ratios may help an investor to identify a company s capability of converting its assets to meet its debt obligations  While current ratio or working capital ratio seeks to measure a company s potential to meet its short  as well as long term debt obligations  a company s quick ratio or acid test ratio or quick assets ratio indicates its capability of meeting only short term debt obligations  This is why current ratio takes current assets relative to current liabilities into consideration  while quick ratio is a ratio of current assets excluding inventory to current liabilities 
On the other hand  the most conservative of the liquidity ratios  cash ratio aims to measure a company s potential to pay its current debt obligations by converting its most liquid assets  In order to achieve its objective  cash ratio only considers cash and cash equivalents relative to current liabilities  Though a higher value of these ratios may indicate that the company has a good financial position  significantly high values may signal that the company is inefficiently utilizing its assets  Hence  companies with liquidity ratios between 1 and 3 are considered to have favorable liquidity levels       
Screening Parameters
Besides considering ideal ranges of liquidity ratios  we have added asset utilization to our screening parameters with an objective to screen efficient stocks only  Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four quarter average of total assets  It is considered to be one of the popular means of identifying efficient companies   
In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have added our proprietary  to the screen with an objective to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too 
Current Ratio  Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable  significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency      
Asset utilization greater than industry average  Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company s efficiency

21596,243111,AOSL,3 Reasons Why Alpha   Omega Semiconductor  AOSL  Is A Great Momentum Stock,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on Alpha   Omega Semiconductor  Ltd    NASDAQ AOSL   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for AOSL s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for Alpha   Omega SemiconductorA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 2 8  compared to an industry average of  1 2    AOSL is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for Alpha   Omega Semiconductor While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of AOSL  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 55 3  to 10 3  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a  significant gain  Clearly  AOSL is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors ALPHA OMEGA SEM Price   AOSL Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with AOSL as of late too Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 1 estimate has moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago AOSL was expected to post a loss of 5 cents per share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of 7 cents for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have AOSL as a security with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum Score of  B   So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep AOSL on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Tale of the Tape  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-09-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-alpha---omega-semiconductor-(aosl)-is-a-great-momentum-stock-200152183,200152183

21673,243188,AOSL,Infineon  FIDO Certified Bluetooth Solution For More Security,opinion,"Premium German semiconductor maker Infineon Technologies AG   OTC IFNNY   recently pioneered the development of Fast IDentity Online   FIDO   certified Bluetooth low energy  BLE  reference solution that can be used as wireless authentication tokens  This will likely help the company bolster security and efficiency of Internet of Things  IoT  applications which currently forms the backbone of the contemporary digitized society 
FIDO is an industry consortium that develops security standards for authentication  thereby eliminating the risk of frauds  Infineon s latest offering will allow users to avail these tokens together with their password  thereby securing and authenticating their online actions  To connect an authentication token to mobile and wireless applications that does not have USB support necessitates the use of BLE as a communication protocol 
Infineon s FIDO BLE reference design is powered by an  Infineon Secure Element  chip that can execute fast cryptographic operations  A FIDO certification will allow manufacturers of connected security devices to assimilate FIDO Universal 2nd Factor  U2F  standard with any BLE transceiver seamlessly  Given that over 60  of all online breaches stems from weak passwords  a certified reference solution for FIDO BLE is the need of the hour for clients who value security  FIDO standards have already been implemented by major companies like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   DropBox and GitHub
