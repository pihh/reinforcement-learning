129976,351491,CDNS,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  NVIDIA  Photronics And NXP Semiconductors,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 2  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    Photronics  Inc    NASDAQ PLAB   and NXP Semiconductors N V    NASDAQ NXPI   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  4 Chip Stocks to Gain from China s Reliance on U S  TechChip stocks witnessed a strong rally in 2019  largely driven by investors  optimism over a U S  China trade deal  This is because these companies have considerable exposure to the world s biggest chip market   China In addition  developments in the semiconductor industry last year brought the significance of U S  chip enabled products to the forefront for many crucial Chinese tech products and supply chains These developments coupled with an improving U S  China trade ties are bound to drive the semiconductor industry American Chip Design Tech is Paramount for China  Here s WhyA major factor driving the importance of U S  technology for China is the country s reliance on specific American technologies for its supply chains To look at this arrangement closely  one may note that the development of these supply chains requires tools that produce the hardware and software that design the integrated circuits that essentially make computer chips function  Therefore  the functionality of China s entire technology intensive supply chains comes down to the operations in the American chip design tools industry It is imperative to consider the significance of global semiconductor firms  and more specifically  American chipmakers here  This is because the chip design tools industry is dominated by just four U S  based companies  namely  Synopsys  NASDAQ SNPS   Cadence Design  NASDAQ CDNS  Systems  ANSYS and Mentor Graphics  These four companies control 90  of the world market  as of 2018   according to S2C data Semiconductor Stocks at the ForefrontThis dependence on prominent U S  chipmakers naturally brings semiconductor stocks to investors  watch list  Since chipmakers comprise the majority of top U S  companies with revenue exposure to China  these are most sensitive to the upcoming U S  China trade agreement The much awaited phase one U S  China trade agreement is set to be signed on Jan 15  which promises to de escalate the tariff war  The deal is also expected to protect U S  intellectual property and drive penetration of U S  companies into the fast growing Chinese markets According to Evercore ISI  China accounted for 35  of global semiconductor sales in 2018  Therefore  with de escalation in the U S  China trade war  one can anticipate a possible rally in semiconductor stocks in the near future as demand for chip enabled products gain traction in both the countries Second  semiconductors form an integral part of almost every crucial  in demand tech product at present  These chip enabled products infiltrate everything  including those under the tariff fire right now  The upcoming U S  China trade deal is likely to help in that aspect as well 4 Chip Stocks to Buy in 2020 We have chosen four semiconductor stocks that

130048,351563,CDNS,Cadence Design Systems  CDNS  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Cadence Design Systems  NASDAQ CDNS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 21  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 51 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 1  
Revenues are expected to be  574 77 million  up 7 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cadence 
For Cadence  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 66  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Cadence will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cadence would post earnings of  0 53 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 57  delivering a surprise of  7 55  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cadence appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cadence-design-systems-cdns-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200473186,200473186

What s Next for Cadence 
While Cadence has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Cadence was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

130051,351566,CDNS,Cadence  CDNS  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Cadence Design Systems  NASDAQ CDNS  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Cadence is 14 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 17 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 7 3  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Cadence has an S TA ratio of 0 9  which means that the company gets  0 9 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 66  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Cadence looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 9  this year versus the industry average of 5 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Cadence have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Cadence has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

130087,351602,CDNS,Why Cadence  CDNS  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Cadence Design Systems  NASDAQ CDNS   which belongs to the Zacks Computer   Software industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7 77  
For the most recent quarter  Cadence was expected to post earnings of  0 53 per share  but it reported  0 57 per share instead  representing a surprise of 7 55   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 50 per share  while it actually produced  0 54 per share  a surprise of 8  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Cadence  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cadence currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 66   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-09-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cadence-cdns-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200469555,200469555

What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 22  2019  Cadence reported EPS of  0 57 versus consensus estimate of  0 53 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0 23  
For the current fiscal year  Cadence is expected to post earnings of  2 13 per share on  2 32 billion in revenues  This represents a 13 9  change in EPS on an 8 59  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 29 per share on  2 47 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 7 51  and 6 18   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Cadence may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Cadence has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 35 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 45 9X versus its peer group s average of 25 1X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 3 24  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Cadence currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Cadence fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Cadence shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come ",2019-07-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cadence-cdns-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200444743,200444743

4 GARP Stocks to Scoop Up for Maximum Returns
Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains  This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount 
The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on 
That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing 
GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value Metrics
The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing  Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on 
Growth Metrics
Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy 
Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan 
Value Metrics
GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered 
Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term

Analyst Blog 5 Stocks that Surged in 3 Months   Still Holds PotentialThe last three months were quite eventful for Wall Street  Overall  the stock market continued its bull run buoyed by strong economic data that confirmed the U S  economy s solid footing  However  volatility reared its ugly face again In the last week of March  the stock market was in turmoil due to the yield curve inversion between the 10 year and 3 month U S  Treasury Notes  Finally  volatility returned in May once trade negotiations between the United States and China halted  just when the parties were about to strike a deal Wall Street Tumbles as Trade War ResurfacesOn May 10  the U S  government hiked existing tariff rates to 25  from 10  on  200 billion of Chinese exports  In 2018  the Trump administration imposed 25  tariff on  50 billion of Chinese goods  Moreover  President Trump threatened to levy 25  tariff on another  325 billion of Chinese goods  Total amount will surpass China s yearly export to the United States Consequently  the three major stock indexes    the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite    plunged 2 1   2 2  and 3   respectively  in the week ended May 10 Concerns

projections Investment management firm Morgan Stanly estimated a 0 3  drop in Chinese GDP and 8 12  erosion of emerging markets valuation if the United States hiked tariffs  Barclays  LON BARC  predicted that the new tariffs will hurt 3 5  of Chinese exports and 0 5  of its GDP The United States will also bear the brunt of tariffs  China is the largest trading partner of the United States  A weak economy in China  the largest market for high tech products  will generate headwinds for U S  technology companies Moreover  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries  Tariffs will raise the cost of these products making it very difficult for businesses to formulate long term plans 5 Stocks Moving HigherThe recent

130212,351727,CDNS,HP Boosts Multi Function Print Suite With Latest Launches,opinion,"Hewlett Packard   NYSE HPQ   expands its Large Format print portfolio with the launch of HP DesignJet T1600 and T260 and HP DesignJet XL 3600 multifunction printers  MFP   The company also added HP PageWide XL 3900 printer to its production portfolio 
The company further introduced HP DesignJet T100 and T500 to complement smaller workspaces which require faster data and mobile communications 
Reportedly  the app based and cloud connected multi function printer portfolio has been designed for the architecture  engineering and design community 
Per management  Hewlett Packard is leading the transformation in Large Format printers for small to medium size businesses  With the latest product launches  the workplace printing experience is likely to get as smart and easy as it is at home 
Further  these innovative launches coupled with the company s transition to services are expected to help it reinvent the print segment and deliver long term growth opportunities 
A Look at HP s Printing Segment
Hewlett Packard has been focusing on its profit generating Printing Business for some time now  The segment is driven by growth in hardware revenues  increase in unit share and progress in contractual offering 
In the last reported quarter  total hardware unit sales of Commercial Hardware  which consists of Office Printing Solutions  Graphics Solutions and 3D Printing grew 2   while revenues from the same rose 5   Both revenues and unit sales of Consumer Hardware  which includes Home Printing Solutions  grew 2  in the prior quarter 
However  disappointing Supplies revenues is an overhang on the Printing business  Supplies revenues declined 3  due to weakness in EMEA where it fell 9  
Rising macro uncertainties and the price sensitivity among customers are undermining the company s high margin Printing business  Moreover  change in customer purchasing behavior with more commercial customers buying items online  is an overhang on HP s Supplies share 
On the last earnings call  management further highlighted that all commercial customers are purchasing supplies online and the company has a lower market share in that space as compared to its share of traditional commercial resellers and in store retailers 
Further  given the high inventory and pricing issues  the company expects sales for the Printing segment to decrease over the rest of the year 
Nonetheless  the company s focus on product innovation   differentiation are likely to trigger demand for its Printing products in the market HP Inc  Revenue  TTM

130240,351755,CDNS,Market Braces For Tariff Deadline ,opinion,"Who wouldn t love getting a beautiful letter 
	The market certainly appreciated that President Trump received one from China President Xi Jinping  Stocks reversed their latest selloff upon hearing the news  but still finished lower for another session as the tariff deadline approaches 
	The Dow lost 0 54   or nearly 140 points  to 25 828 36  but it had been down as much as 450 points earlier 
	The S P slipped 0 30  to 2870 72  while the NASDAQ shed 0 41  to 7910 59  These indices also recovered adequately from sharper declines in the morning 
	The trade issue has dominated this week  especially since a deal appeared to be right around the corner as recently as this past weekend  Then the President threatened to hike tariffs after China  broke the deal  by walking back many of their concessions 
	Now the NASDAQ heads into Friday s session with a loss of more than 3  for the week  while the other two major indices are off by about 2 5  
	So here we go 
	If there are no breakthroughs in negotiations  the tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods will more than double to 25  from 10   The President will also consider 25  tariffs on additional products 
	That s where the  beautiful letter  comes in  The market may not believe a deal is coming in the next few hours  but enough progress could potentially be made to again delay increasing the tariffs  So its encouraging to have a correspondence from your adversary that stresses  coming together  
	And Trump himself stated that a deal was still possible 
	So we re still trading on headlines and statements at the moment  but there will be some real news on this issue in the next few hours  Either the tariffs go up at midnight followed by retaliation from China  or they don t 
	We will get a definite answer on that trade question soon  which would mark a rare moment of certainty in this conflict 
	The answer could also decide the direction this market takes for the foreseeable future  Today s Portfolio Highlights Counterstrike  It looks like Stamps com Inc   STMP  doesn t have an answer to losing its deal with USPS  That s why Jeremy shorted the stock back in March  Since then  the company cut its guidance once again  sending its share price into a tailspin  With market uncertainty on the rise  the editor thought this was a good time to short cover STMP and bank a profit of 58 1   Meanwhile  though Jeremy is extremely pessimistic that any kind of trade deal will ever get done  there s always a chance of some good news  The ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  UVXY  double leverage hedge was the perfect choice for a rough week like this  but the editor doesn t want to get greedy in such unpredictable times  Therefore  he sold two thirds of the position for return of 28 7  in 1 just week Options Trader  Sometimes you ve just got to take the money and run  Case in point  shares of Copa Holdings  CPA  soared on Thursday after this transportation company reported an earnings surprise of nearly 30   But Kevin can t forget how much this stock dropped in the weeks before the report  and he s not very thrilled with its outlook  The editor decided to get out of CPA by removing the bull call spreads he added in January  The portfolio sold to close the 2 Aug 90 Calls AND bought to close the 2 Aug 100 00 Calls  The spreads brought a nice return of 53  Surprise Trader  It may not feel like it right now  but the market is still near all time highs despite the recent trade inspired selloffs  As a result  Dave thinks that the investment managers are set to report solid quarters  With a positive Earnings ESP of 4 4  for the quarter coming after the bell on Monday  Legg Mason  LM  is one of those companies that looks poised for success  The editor added LM on Thursday with a 12 5  allocation after removing a couple positions  including Cadence Design Systems  NASDAQ CDNS  for a return of 5 9  in less than a month  Read the full write up for more on this new buy

by strong economic data that confirmed the U S  economy s solid footing  However  volatility reared its ugly face again In the last week of March  the stock market was in turmoil due to the yield curve inversion between the 10 year and 3 month U S  Treasury Notes  Finally  volatility returned in May once trade negotiations between the United States and China halted  just when the parties were about to strike a deal Wall Street Tumbles as Trade War ResurfacesOn May 10  the U S  government hiked existing tariff rates to 25  from 10  on  200 billion of Chinese exports  In 2018  the Trump administration imposed 25  tariff on  50 billion of Chinese goods  Moreover  President Trump threatened to levy 25  tariff on another  325 billion of Chinese goods  Total amount will surpas China s yearly export to the United States Consequently  the three major stock indexes    the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite    plunged 2 1   2 2  and 3   respectively  in the week ended May 10 Concerns

weak economy in China  the largest market for high tech products  will generate headwinds for U S  technology companies Moreover  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products

130273,351788,CDNS,5 Tech Stocks To Buy On Possible US China Trade Deal,opinion,On May 2  CNBC reported that the United States and China may jointly declare the much awaited trade deal by this weekend  President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping could sign the deal later that month or the first week of June In this regard  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Beijing last week  As a follow up to the procedure  Chinese vice premier Liu He will likely visit Washington in the week of May 6  for the last round of negotiations  Notably  on Apr 4  President Trump twitted that a trade deal with China is possible in the next four weeks National Security Concerns Dominate Trump s DecisionThe Trump administration is gravely concerned about China s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier in the fields of high tech sophisticated products  The implementation of tariffs stems from the Trump administration s concern that China is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft On Mar 27  Reuters reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a range of issues including the protection of U S  intellectual properties to resolve the trade disputes  On Apr 4  White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow claimed that China has acknowledged for the first time that the United States has legitimate and genuine concerns about IP theft  forced technology transfer and cyber hacking by Chinese companies Trade War Upsets Global EconomyOn Apr 9  the International Monetary Fund reduced its global economic growth forecasts for 2019  The new growth projection is 3 3  compared with 3 5  in January and 3 7  in October  For the IMF  the prevailing trade conflict between the United States and China is the key concern for the global economy Wall Street witnessed extreme volatility throughout 2018 primarily owing to trade related issues  However  U S  stock markets turned around impressively since the beginning of 2019 once positive trade related developments started Technology Sector to Benefit MostChina is the largest trading partner of the United States  A strong economy in China  the largest market for high tech products  will give U S  technology companies a solid boost  Moreover  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries In 2018  the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinese imports worth  300 billion in two phases  Most of these products are from the high tech industrial sectors  U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move  which pushed up prices of high tech equipment and several electronics products An end to the U S  China trade spat is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  the repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods should raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants  Moreover  clinching a lasting agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for the home grown tech behemoths Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be prudent to invest in technology stocks  We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks each carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  
5 Tech Stocks to Buy on Possible U S  China Trade Deal
On May 2  CNBC reported that the United States and China may jointly declare the much awaited trade deal by this weekend  President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping could sign the deal later that month or the first week of June 
In this regard  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Beijing last week  As a follow up to the procedure  Chinese vice premier Liu He will likely visit Washington in the week of May 6  for the last round of negotiations  Notably  on Apr 4  President Trump twitted that a trade deal with China is possible in the next four weeks 
National Security Concerns Dominate Trump s Decision
The Trump administration is gravely concerned about China s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier in the fields of high tech sophisticated products  The implementation of tariffs stems from the Trump administration s concern that China is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft 
On Mar 27  Reuters reported that China has made unprecedented proposals on a range of issues including the protection of U S  intellectual properties to resolve the trade disputes  On Apr 4  White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow claimed that China has acknowledged for the first time that the United States has legitimate and genuine concerns about IP theft  forced technology transfer and cyber hacking by Chinese companies 
Trade War Upsets Global Economy
On Apr 9  the International Monetary Fund reduced its global economic growth forecasts for 2019  The new growth projection is 3 3  compared with 3 5  in January and 3 7  in October  For the IMF  the prevailing trade conflict between the United States and China is the key concern for the global economy 
Wall Street witnessed extreme volatility throughout 2018 primarily owing to trade related issues  However  U S  stock markets turned around impressively since the beginning of 2019 once positive trade related developments started 
Technology Sector to Benefit Most
China is the largest trading partner of the United States  A strong economy in China  the largest market for high tech products  will give U S  technology companies a solid boost  Moreover  China plays the role of a low cost supplier of intermediary products and other inputs to high tech U S  industries 
In 2018  the Trump administration levied tariffs on Chinese imports worth  300 billion in two phases  Most of these products are from the high tech industrial sectors  U S  companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move  which pushed up prices of high tech equipment and several electronics products 
An end to the U S  China trade spat is likely to restore Chinese and global economic growth  which in turn will create demand for high tech U S  products  Likewise  the repeal of tariffs on Chinese intermediary goods should raise the profit margin of U S  tech giants  Moreover  clinching a lasting agreement with China  which will strictly protect U S  intellectual properties  will be immensely beneficial for the home grown tech behemoths

Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains  This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount 
The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on 
That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing 
GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value Metrics
The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing  Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on 
Growth Metrics
Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy 
Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan 
Value Metrics
GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered 
Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term

This maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 13 92  
For the most recent quarter  Cadence was expected to post earnings of  0 48 per share  but it reported  0 52 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 33   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 41 per share  while it actually produced  0 49 per share  a surprise of 19 51

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Cadence has an Earnings ESP of  0 50  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 22  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

130362,351877,CDNS,S P Approaches New Highs After Crossing Above 2900,opinion,"You couldn t have asked for a better start to earnings season  especially since this one is expected to be the weakest in years  We enjoyed a strong quarterly report from the country s biggest bank  which helped to jolt a seemingly sedated market out of its haze and into a solid rally to finish the week 
	Along the way  the S P finally surpassed 2900 and is now under 1   or less than 30 points  from an all time high 
	Investors breathed a sigh of relief when J P  Morgan reported strong first quarter results  which included earnings that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 14   The stock was up 4 7  today  It s only one report out of thousands that will be released in the coming weeks  but it provided a good first impression to a nervous market 
	By the way  Disney didn t report earnings today  but the entertainment juggernaut was still a major factor in the market s strong session  It released the price for its soon to be launched streaming service Disney   and the  6 99 month price tag is quite a deal compared to Netflix s recently increased price of  13 month  The stock jumped more than 11 5  
	The major indices were also jumping on Friday  which was a fun change from its comatose like state for most of this week  The Dow advanced 1 03   or nearly 270 points  to 26412 30  but the index was just short of a weekly gain by declining 0 1   The best weekly performance came from the NASDAQ  which advanced approximately 0 6  after today s gain of 0 46  to 7984 16 
	The S P  though  made the biggest statement as it crossed back over 2900  It advanced 0 66  today to 2907 41  marking a weekly increase of around 0 5   The index s all time closing high is just under 2931 from late September  right before things got all serious due to the correction 
	Yeah  we re  this close  to completely filling in the hole from that severe pullback  which apparently hit bottom on Christmas Eve  We should be there in no time if today s session is foreshadowing earnings season as a whole  However  that s a big if  Let s just be happy with this beginning and then take it one report at a time  Today s Portfolio Highlights  

Value Investor  It was a big day for the portfolio on two fronts  First of all  Tracey added Zacks Rank  2  Buy  IT services company DXC Technology  DXC  and Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  office furniture maker Herman Miller  MLHR   The former name gives the portfolio exposure to technology  while the latter offers exposure to the consumer and the hot jobs market  Both stocks remain cheap despite double digit improvements so far in 2019  DXC pays a dividend yielding 1 2  and should see an uptick in earnings growth due to its recent acquisition of competitor Luxoft  MLHR pays a dividend that yields 2 3  and just reported third quarter results that beat on both the top and bottom lines 
	Secondly  this portfolio owns the two hottest stories of the day  Disney  DIS  and JP Morgan  JPM   Mickey s company jumped 11 5  in the session as the price for its upcoming and long awaited streaming service was finally released  and it will be way less than Netflix  When Disney  launches later this year  it will cost just under  7 per month or just under  70 per year  which comes to a little over  5 80 per month   DIS was easily the best performing stock of the day among all ZU names 
	Meanwhile  JPM was the big earnings report of the day  as the banking giant kicked the season off with better than expected quarterly results  The stock advanced 4 7  on Friday and also made the top movers of the day  JPM is now up 27 7  in the portfolio  while DIS is right behind with a gain of 24 5  since inception  Healthcare Innovators  Life expectancy is on the rise  and so is the amount of medicines taken by the aging population  Juggling various prescriptions can be confusing and even dangerous  Tabula Rasa Healthcare  TRHC  is a small cap medical IT player that helps patients  doctors and pharmacies cross reference prescription complications to provide the best care with fewer risks  Needless to say  there s a lot of potential for this company s products and services  which is why sales are expected to grow 40  this year to  285 million  Several analysts expect even more beyond that  Kevin had this stock on his watchlist for a while and today he finally decided to add it  Read the full write up for a lot more on TRHC  including a look at what several firms think about its potential Surprise Trader  If you re a big fan of the old saying  slow and steady wins the race   then you should take a look at Cadence Design Systems  NASDAQ CDNS   This computer software company has taken the Tortoise s advice and been slowly marching upwards since the start of the year  Dave likes that its part of a space in the top 4  of the Zacks Industry Rank and that it has a positive Earnings ESP for the quarter coming on Monday  April 22nd after the bell  For his third pick over the past three days as we begin a new earnings season  the editor added CDNS on Friday with a 12 5  allocation  Learn more in the full write up TAZR Trader  Some folks think that  bigger is better   while others believe that  good things come in small packages   For today at least  you can put Kevin into the latter camp regarding his addition of SYNNEX  SNX   This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  is a technology and consulting firm that creates customized IT systems software solutions for corporations  In other words  it shares the space with the giant Cognizant  NASDAQ CTSH   However  the editor notes that SNX has a much better valuation and stronger sales  which means it has more potential moving forward  Kevin added the stock with a 10  allocation today and thinks it could hit  120 by June  Read the complete commentary for more

130363,351878,CDNS,Cadence Design Systems  CDNS  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cadence Design Systems  NASDAQ CDNS  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  567 11 million  up 9 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cadence 
For Cadence  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 50  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Cadence will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cadence would post earnings of  0 48 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 52  delivering a surprise of  8 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

4 GARP Stocks for a Winning PortfolioInvestors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount  GARP investing employs popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  and price to book value  P B  ratio   to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing  Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsBoth strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer

Ameritrade Holding Corp    NASDAQ AMTD   GARP Stocks to Scoop Up for Maximum ReturnsGrowth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains  This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing GARP Metrics   Mix of Growth   Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing  Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis  These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on Growth MetricsBoth strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E ratios compared to value investors  it avoids companies with extremely high P E ratios  Moreover  the price to book value  P B  ratio is also considered Using the GARP principle  we have run a screen

It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Cadence Design Systems currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if CDNS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For CDNS  shares are up 1 75  over the past week while the Zacks Computer   Software industry is down 1 76  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 18 06  compares favorably with the industry s 1 64  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Cadence Design Systems have risen 46 75   and are up 56 06  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 9 13  and 4 73   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to CDNS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  CDNS is currently averaging 2 217 723 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with CDNS 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost CDNS s consensus estimate  increasing from  1 95 to  2 04 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that CDNS is a  1  Strong Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of B  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Cadence Design Systems on your short list ",2019-03-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cadence-design-systems-cdns-is-a-great-momentum-stock-should-you-buy-200398728,200398728

130552,352067,CDNS,Cadence Design Systems  CDNS  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cadence Design Systems  NASDAQ CDNS  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of hardware and software products for validating chip designs is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 1  
Revenues are expected to be  550 82 million  up 9 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cadence 
For Cadence  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cadence will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Cadence would post earnings of  0 41 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 49  delivering a surprise of  19 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Cadence doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cadence-design-systems-cdns-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200386952,200386952

   NASDAQ ASYS    Cadence Design Systems Inc    NASDAQ CDNS   and Citrix Systems Inc    NASDAQ CTXS   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Best Ranked Liquid Stocks for Impressive ReturnsThe liquidity of a company often indicates whether its business is going in a profitable direction  It primarily indicates a company s capability to meet debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents  These stocks have always been in demand due to their potential to provide maximum returns However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio  It measures current assets relative to current liabilities  This ratio is used for measuring a company s potential to meet both short  and long term debt obligations  Thus  a current ratio   also known as working capital ratio   below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets  However  a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio Unlike current ratio  quick ratio   also called  acid test ratio  or  quick assets ratio    indicates a company s ability to pay short term obligations  It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities  Like the current ratio  a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable Cash Ratio  This is the most conservative ratio among the three  as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents  and invested funds relative to current liabilities  It measures a company s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets  Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials  a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization So  a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company s financial condition And that s what we re screening for today For the rest

Liquid stocks have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns  However  one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks  While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers  it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently Hence  one may

good financial shape  It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly  Hence  a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal Quick Ratio  Unlike current ratio  quick ratio

130709,352224,CDNS,Here s Why Small Cap ETFs Are Underperforming,opinion,"U S  small caps have been continuously lagging their large cap counterparts this year  Although small cap stocks have had a disappointing earnings season  large cap stocks have been gaining on strong earnings  currency effects and higher growth prospects  internationally  Small cap stocks on the other hand are more domestically focused 
The largest small cap ETF tracking the Russell 2000 index  iShares Russell 2000 ETF is up 0 05  so far this year  while the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  is up around 11

Trump s failure to pass the Healthcare bill has raised concerns amongst investors about his ability to pass the tax reform  Tax cuts will be highly beneficial to small caps as they are not subject to different tax regimes owing to their domestic focus and thus end up paying higher taxes  read
