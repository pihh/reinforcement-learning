29983,251498,CSII,Bruker Rides On Robust NANO   CALID Groups  Recent Buyouts ,opinion,"On Feb 25  we issued an updated research report on Bruker Corporation   NASDAQ BRKR    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company s Scientific Instruments segment has been performing well  driven by strong results from NANO and CALID groups 
In 2018  the Bruker Nano Surfaces group  which includes Bruker s atomic force microscopy product  reported high single digit revenue growth  Growth was driven by solid academic markets and strong industrial research demand for advanced X ray and Nano Materials Analysis products 
This apart  acquisitions like Anasys and JPK  completed in April and July 2018  respectively  also contributed to the segment s top line  Nano Surfaces and Nano analysis revenues increased in 2018 with organic growth supplemented by these two acquisitions 
The year 2019 is expected to be no exception in terms of revenue growth 
In mid December 2018  NANO closed the acquisition of Alicona Imaging  a provider of optical metrology products for lab and production applications  which will start to contribute to the group s results from the beginning of 2019 
The CALID Group is also delivering well with impressive full year revenues in high single digits  Growth was driven by mass spectrometry and molecular spectroscopy businesses  The company eyes the benefits of its life science mass spec portfolio transformation and expects further growth in 2019 and beyond as recently launched products like timsTOF Pro and the new scimaX MRMS ramp up its product menu 
On the flip side  Bruker conducts 80  of its business in the international markets  As a result  adverse currency fluctuations may weigh on profits  Also  headwinds like unfavorable economic conditions and an intense competition pose threats to the stock

Exelixis  Inc   NASDAQ EXEL  has had a fantastic move  having gone from 3 1 2 to 11  and change  formed a wedge  broke back out  and on Monday  it was up 44 cents to 11 44  or 4   on 7 4 million shares  That s the best volume on an up day in a couple weeks  It looks like that if it could get through the spike high at 11 66  we may be looking at 12 3 4 13 short term 
Nektar Therapeutics  NASDAQ NKTR  advanced 57 cents to 17 83  or 3 3   on 785 097 shares traded on Monday  That was the best volume in two weeks  I m convinced that when this one does go  it s going to spike up to 20  and then maybe get to 22 1 2 23  the near term targets  Look for it to break out of the 18 range  and watch it from there

30392,251907,CSII,Amarin Reports Solid Vascepa TRx Growth  Stock Holds Its Ground,opinion,Last week was quite decent for Amarin Corporation  AMRN  investors  who saw a 6  rally last Friday in reaction to the company s Q1 2013 financial results  Of particular interest was the continued growth in Vascepa  icosapent ethyl  capsules  which were approved for hypertriglyceridemia patients with 500  mg dL concentration in mid 2012  The launch at the end of January 2013 went surprisingly well  although it seems that Wall Street is still underwhelmed by the numbers that have been posted up to this point   In the first quarter of 2012  or the quarter ended March 31st  2013  Amarin reported  2 34 million in product revenues  although the company mentioned  2 9 million of deferred product revenue that will contribute to revenues in Q2 2012 results which are due in August 2013  The company s total prescriptions have been growing consecutively each month The finalized figures from Amarin are in line with analyst expectations and third party prescription data  and represent a slow but steady grind upwards for Amarin Vascepa  Additional analyst estimates suggest that Amarin will operate at total losses of  220 M for the fiscal year of 2013  and similar figures in 2014 given that the company will prepare for and execute Vascepa s launch into the ANCHOR indication in early 2014   Vascepa is on track to meet analyst expectations of   80M in total revenues for 2013  although we may see some surprises with the drug s overall trajectory after copayments are reduced by Vascepa s move into Tier 2 coverage  Since it is designed to be a long term primary care drug that is meant to improve cardiovascular function over more drawn out periods of time  cost related issues are expected to play a very important role in this drug s eventual success or failure  Lovaza  which generally costs between  280 520 per month  depending on the insurance   should also have problems justifying its price premium   The ANCHOR indication  which is a nickname for the hypertriglyceridemia indication for patients with triglyceride levels between 200 500 mg dL  is far larger than the MARINE indication  500  mg dL  which Vascepa current markets into  The sNDA that was submitted for Vascepa in the ANCHOR indication was confirmed with a PDUFA goal date of December 20th 2013   It s generally agreed that Amarin would have an extremely difficult time targeting a patient population that is about ten times to size of its current  4 million target population  which is why there are renewed expectations of a big pharma buyout or partnership with Amarin in the near future  Having said this  many analysts expect Vascepa sales to jump significantly in 2014 due to indication expansion for a drug that should be well established at that point  This implies that Amarin should be able to reduce SG A expenses and realize profits in 2015  or even the end of 2014 depending   The relatively neutral Q1 results may have caused some disinterest amongst the short sellers  who have already made large profits since Q4 2012 when the company initially announced its intentions to market Vascepa in the MARINE indication without a partner   Despite the potential of Vascepa   particularly after an indication expansion  the expectation is that Amarin s  202M in cash and cash equivalents will not carry the company quite far enough to realize a profit before a forced financing  even assuming that Vascepa continues to grow with consistency  Although the company was able to raise money last December in a non dilutive financing  a public offering may hold more appeal for Amarin later on   depending on the situation  Another likely option is an offering of convertible notes   Without any known catalysts before the PDUFA goal date for the ANCHOR indication  other than the FDA s NCE designation  which has yet to happen  investors should find a way to gauge Vascepa sales as we wait for Q2 2013 results  which will finalize the impact that Vascepa s shift to tier 2 coverage will have on TRx ,2013-05-13,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amarin-reports-solid-vascepa-trx-growth;-stock-holds-its-ground-166728,166728
30459,251974,CSII,Amarin Stays Rangebound  Prescriptions Stagnate,opinion,Amarin Corporation  AMRN  has been struggling a lot lately as retail channel prescription data for its EPA capsule Vascepa imply that the drug is starting to slow down its momentum in the MARINE indication  hypertriglyceridemia patients with  500 mg dL   While the company has seen significant progress since the launch of the drug in January  it is still not causing any excitement in an investor base that wanted to see a big pharma buyout of the company ever since the company reported successful Phase III results  Despite the incredible strength of the broader market and the biotech sector in particular this year  AMRN is down 14  YTD as of the time of writing  Since the company released Q1 2013 financial results  as discussed in a recent note   the company rallied all the way to  8 00 share before continuous selling brought shares back to the  7 00 per share level  We also have yet to see the FDA make a decision regarding the NCE  New Chemical Entity  status of Vascepa  which will have a profound positive negative impact on the value of Vascepa as a product and possibly on the chances for Amarin to receive an attractive partnership or buyout offer from a larger pharmaceutical company  CEO Joe Z s commentary seems to suggest that a partnership is needed prior to the prospective launch of Amarin into the ANCHOR indication due to the sheer number of sales reps that the company would need to market into such a huge primary care indication  although details are scare for the time being  Additionally  the market seems disinterested in more recent news which would normally generate some buying interest despite the mediocre market performance of Vascepa in its current disease indication  For instance  the market seemed to gloss over the recently released new data from the MARINE ANCHOR Phase III trials that shows statistically significant reductions in Apolipoprotein C III  Apo C III   which is a lipoprotein that serves as a biomarker for poor cardiovascular health  This bodes well for the REDUCE IT Phase III trial  which will transition Vascepa into a hypertriglyceridemia therapy into a preventative cardiovascular risk therapy that can be combined with standard statin regimens  But in general  we haven t seen anything new with Amarin or Vascepa that should change one s opinion on the stock quite yet  The market seems much more preoccupied with oncology drug developers who will be presenting at ASCO 2013   the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting that will be held Chicago between May 31st and June 4th  2013  This generally explains why AMRN has been more of a trader s stock than an investor s stock  making exaggerated movements in reaction to news that has little implications on the long term health of Amarin  Despite the volatility  Amarin seems to favor trading ranges which is why the company may be a good candidate for options trades that favor sideways trading within a predetermined ranged  As mentioned in other notes  Amarin has a PDUFA goal date of December 20th 2013 for the sNDA that will significant expand the size and scope of Vascepa s target indication  If Vascepa sales move in line with analyst expectations  which should ultimately approach   80M in sales revenues for FY 2013  we may see continued sideways trading in the stock as the market waits for further developments  One particular strategy that takes advantage of neutral sentiment is the  Iron Butterfly  strategy  where one writes an at the money call and an at the money put while buying an out of the money call and an out of the money put  This could be very profitable  although the trade would likely go sour in the event that the FDA issues a decision on Vascepa s NCE status in one of its Orange Book updates  The same would also be true if the company announced any kind of partnership or acquisition offer  although a complete lack of any official information on this topic has pushed away would be M A speculators  Amarin  on the whole  seems to have fallen out of favor in the biotech investment community  This may change as we head closer to December 20th  or after an unexpected announcement   but without a tangible piece of news that can positively affect Vascepa s sales figures or its financial valuation don t expect much more than a continuation of what we ve seen this year ,2013-05-24,Myriad Equity,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/amarin-stays-rangebound,-prescriptions-stagnate-168261",168261
30460,251975,CSII,Two Companies Worth An Investor s Look,opinion,There are many different types of investment strategies and opportunities in the market if you are willing to take time and search for them  When I look through companies I look for two types  A large company with good growth potential  To define this  I look at revenue and EPS growth and I want to see at least 5 years of growth  For smaller companies I look for technology that has the potential to help a company grow and then I want to see if it has a good growth plan in place to increase its revenue As I scan through the medical industry  I have discovered two companies that are very diverse that I believe warrant and investor s time and effort to delve deeper into  PLC Systems  PLCSF OTC US  is one  and the other is ResMed  RMD   Let s take a look at these two companies and what type of opportunities they present to an investor PLC SystemsPLCSF  OTC USMarket Cap  7 04 millionPrice  0 11Who is PLC Systems PLC Systems  Inc  is a medical technology company specializing in innovative technologies for the cardiac and vascular sectors  It develops and manufactures medical devices and related products for the treatment of severe coronary artery diseases in a surgical laser procedure Main Product to WatchRenalGuardThis product was designed to eliminate contrast dyes that may be toxic to the kidneys when patients undergoing cardiac and imaging procedures may be  at risk   This damage can lead to Contrast Induced Nephropathy  CIN   a form of acute kidney injury CIN is a form of acute renal failure caused by exposure to high contrast media during image guided cardiology and radiology procedures  This has posed a problem for patients that are at risk because of renal insufficiency where the kidneys don t work properly The iodine based radio contrast media  or dye  used to facilitate the capture and display of x ray images  post a challenge to the kidneys which are responsible for filtering and removing waste from the body  Patients who have a pre existing or impaired kidney function are more susceptible to the toxic effects of the dye The procedure is based on something called the PRINCE study  which is a study that supports the theory that creating and maintaining a high urine output through the kidneys allows the body to quickly eliminate contrasts which naturally reduces toxic effects RenalGuard uses a  loop diuretic  that s prescribed by a doctor which induces a high urine output  Urine output is then measured and replaced with an equal volume of sterile saline  The results here are two eliminate the risk of under dehydration which can lead to increased risks MarketsArtech  the distributor for the company in Italy  accounts for about 50  of its sales presently ACIST Medical Systems has been brought on as an exclusive distributor for France and Germany which are the largest markets in Europe  This company is a subsidiary of worldwide leader in diagnostic imaging and contrast agents   the Bracco GroupIn March 2012 PLC announced they received approval to sell RenalGuard in Brazil and  through their Brazilian distributor  DISCOMEDAlso in March 2012 PLC received approval for sale of RenalGuard in IsraelJapan could be the next major international market but not until at least late 2013 or sometime in 2014  following completion of the proposed 60 patient study and regulatory approval in that country As you can see  the company continues to expand internationally  In the United States it is still going through clinical trials with the FDA Revenue ProjectionsThe projected revenue numbersfor this company look good in the next few years  While most sales come from consoles  consumables that service the installed base should continue to grow as the console base grows Revenue in 2013 is projected to be  1 6 millionRevenue in 2014 is rejected be  3 millionRevenue in 2015 is projected to be at  5 7 million which includes a midyear entrance into the United States market Why Be Interested in this Stock Not only does this company have a good product that is a necessity in renal care for a large number of patients  but timing is everything  The product is well received and the company is just branching out into other global regions A small ticket stock of this nature has the ability to grow as it continues to move into new regions and investors have the opportunity to grow right along with it  If the revenue projections hold  this is a good  ground floor  growth stock to move with ResMedMarket Cap   6 73 billionPrice   47 22Who is ResMed RMD develops  manufactures  and markets medical products that manage respiratory disorders associated with sleep disorder breathing  Their products are distributed through 70 countries around the world Main Product to Watch  The Quattro Full Air Mask  This mask will be the lightest full air mask coming out on the market weighing in at just 3 3 ounces  This makes it 45  lighter than the leading selling mask today  the Mirage Quattro mask  This mask will be very popular because it s also simple and has four pieces washing clean  For things like sleep apnea  positive airway pressure treatment is highly effective and has been chosen as the  treatment of choice   This type of treatment involves wearing a mask connected to a small airflow generator that delivers air at positive pressure Providing different treatments and products for sleeping disorders is a huge market  It has been estimated that 20  of all adults have some sort of sleeping disorder which would put it on par with diabetes and asthma as one of the most widespread disorders on the planet  Of this 20   a number of different sleeping orders have been identified SDB  sleep disorder breathing  is identified the simple things like snoring and  sleep suffocation  experiences OSA  obstructive sleep apnea  is more prevalent and is described as a collapse of the upper airway despite ongoing effort CSA  Central sleep apnea  is considered a lack of breathing and lack of effort as well as other forms of mixed apnea Why Be Interested in this Stock 73 consecutive quarters of revenue growthGross margin is at 62 4 Sustained EPS Growth 5 yr CAGR of 20 5 yr Net Income Growth of 19  CAGRAs I have stated earlier  the core market is another reason to consider investing in this company  With 20  of the population dealing with sleep disorders  13  mildly and 7  severely   there is a large resource that has yet to be tapped into  Among the conditions in society that lead to the sleeping disorders are things like drug resistant hypertension 83   obesity 77   congestive heart failure 76   and type II diabetes 72   just to name a few  This market will continue to grow and not go away  It has been proven that treatment saves money  At Waste Management  WM  when employees were treated under occupational health and safety for sleeping conditions  they experienced a 37  reduction in medical costs for those who are treated the first year  With results like this the industry is not going away and ResMed is well ingrained in the occupational health and safety arena  as well as CPOD in cardiovascular issues related to sleep problems This company has a track record of consistent earning metrics  and I believe that is a core conviction that investors should take a look at  The whole  sleep disorder breathing  market that this company has been pioneering may just be coming out of its infancy stage  There is much more opportunity for growth for the company and the market In SummaryBoth these companies  PLC Systems and ResMed  look like companies with good opportunities for investors  The companies are different sizes and the opportunities look good for different reasons  PLC Systems is a small company that investors who are interested in getting in on  ground floor opportunities  and growing with the business need to look at  It is opening up new markets  and just moving into the United States with its RenalGuard product soon and revenue is expected to triple in the next 2 to 4 years  ResMed is a larger established company with a track record of solid earnings growth that could make a good investment for an income investor Both companies are worth your time and effort to do further research  and if you are one of the types of investors that I have described here  I would encourage you to look deeper into these companies Disclosure  I have no positions in any stocks mentioned  and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours  I wrote this article myself  and it expresses my own opinions  I am not receiving compensation for it  other than from Seeking Alpha   I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in

30463,251978,CSII,ISIS Rally Continues On Phase II Data,opinion,ISIS Pharmaceuticals  ISIS  saw significant attention after the FDA approved the apo B inhibitor Kynamro  mipomersen   despite some hesitance from the FDA Advisory Committee meeting that was held in October 2012  The concerns were primarily related to lesions that were discovered in patients undergoing clinical testing of the drug and the toxicity of the drug  which is why the drug seems to be incapable of European approval  Also problematic for the homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  HoFH  indication is the sheer success of Aegerion s  AEGR  Juxtapid  lomitapide   which is significantly more expensive at  295k versus  176k but has better efficacy data   Although Kynamro is a strong asset that constitutes a large chunk of ISIS  valuation  at least 40 50  if based on analyst revenue estimates for the next few years   investors are also seeing a lot of potential in the company s platform technology  RNA inhibiting antisense molecules are difficult to use on patients due to their size and instability  which makes ISIS  success with Kynamro all the more impressive  Going forward we are hoping to see similar results in the rest of ISIS  huge pipeline  which includes over a dozen partnered compounds   Despite a strong selloff in the broader markets this morning  which hit high volatility biotechnology stocks particularly hard   ISIS is up 16 5  at the time of writing and climbing on detailed data released from a Phase II study of ISIS APOCIIIRx in patients with high triglycerides  TG between 200 and 500 mg dL  and type 2 diabetes  What was particularly impressive was the 88  reduction in Apoc III and the 72  reduction of triglycerides  plus a 40  increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol with no rise in low density lipoprotein cholesterol  which adds more data to confirm not only that this particular drug is extremely potent but that ISIS  platform is working as intended   ISIS APOCIII is being developed as treatment for patients that are at  very  high risk of cardiovascular disease development and pancreatitis  For patients with extremely high triglyceride levels   500 mg dL  there are very limited treatment options at this point  which allows ISIS APOCIII to target a niche market that is comparable to the HoFH market that is being fought over by Kynamro and Juxtapid  A lack of alternative treatment options may also allow ISIS to market this currently unpartnered drug at a very high price  which may allow the company to swing into EPS positive territory by 2017  These data may also entice another big pharma partnership  which means royalty payments and reduced R D expense   Going into the last five months of 2013 we are also looking for data from the CRP inhibitor ISIS CRP Rx  which is in Phase II trials for rheumatoid arthritis  This compound is in another highly lucrative indication  and also remains unpartnered up to this point  This adds more upside potential to ISIS  although investors should note that ISIS has had a tremendous run throughout the last 7 8 months and has a much less favorable risk reward as the company prepares to take the aforementioned compounds into Phase III development ,2013-06-25,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/isis-rally-continues-on-phase-ii-data-172674,172674

30494,252009,CSII,The Market Awaits Financial Results From Nanosphere s Gram Positive Test,opinion,The biotech company Nanosphere  NSPH   which develops and markets their proprietary Verigene System  doubled in value throughout the last twelve months due to a bunch of positive developments  Especially great for the company s long term prospects was the FDA approval of their Gram Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test  BC GP   which allows very fast detection of bacteria that can cause fatal infections in patients One of the exciting traits about this new diagnostic test is that it can detect markets that indicate that the bacteria in a patient s bloodstream are resistant to methicillin oxacillin and vancomycin  Hospitals have had an especially hard time dealing with these  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  is one particularly prominent bacteria that has proven to be extreme dangerous  and is one of the many microbes that can be detected and identified with the Verigene System The FDA approval of the microbe diagnostic led to substantial appreciation in Nanosphere stock after the initial press release on June 27  2012  NSPH rallied from  1 91 share to  3 41 share by July 9th  While the stock has not been able to consistently hold on to all of its gains at this point  there is no question that the market sees major potential in rapid diagnostic tests to prevent dangerous microbial infections The Verigene system is also used for a host of other diagnostic purposes  The company has a strong presence in cardiovascular risk factor identification   especially through the detection of genes that are associated with thrombosis  or blood clot formation   For instance  the company sells Verisign detectors that can quickly find traces of the F5  F2  and MTHFR genes which are all linked to higher incidence of thrombosis They also sell detection for the CYP2C19 gene  which produces an enzyme that metabolizes a whopping 15  of prescription medications and has important physiological applications for patients on anti consultants  proton pump inhibitors  anti platelet drugs  and even anti depressants  Since these are all very common  Nanosphere should have no shortage of target patients for their CYP2C19 gene detecting Verigene systems The financial prospects for the company could also become quite outstanding in 2013  Nanosphere already has triple digit sales growth  and is expected by analysts to nearly triple its total revenue for fiscal year 2013  This is based on the roughly  5 5 million in sales revenue it will have for FY 2012  and the possible  20 8 million it will have next year  This enthusiasm seems to be largely based on Verigene s prospects in microbial gene detection While the company is already being pumped by the analysts  it seems that the market is hesitating on a few factors  Perhaps the most obvious concern is related to the ability for Nanosphere to breach  20 million in revenue in 2013 At this point  the company hasn t released any actual data on gram positive sales  which puts virtually everyone in the dark about the figures from Verigene s most exciting target market  While Nanosphere has potential to expand Verigene s indications in coming years to include more microbes and other human genes that could benefit from rapid identification  NSPH could have trouble if the gram positive market does not meet our expectations  It s also worth noting that short interest has declined significantly in recent months  which introduces the possibility of a milder bear raid on any piece of bad news  On the bright side  NSPH will be trading significantly higher if the analysts are right  I would expect the stock to be north of  4 share if it gets on track for  20 million in sales revenue from fiscal year 2013 The next quarterly earnings release is in early February  so there is still a bit of a wait left ,2013-01-06,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-market-awaits-financial-results-from-nanosphere’s-gram-positive-test-149748,149748
30495,252010,CSII,Arca Biopharma Rallies On New Plans For A Phase III Trial,opinion,Arca Biopharma  ABIO  was a very boring ticker in 2013 until the company provided an update on a proposed clinical trial for a trial fibrillation for the company s flagship drug Gencaro  bucindolol hydrochloride  after the closing bell on January 29th   The market s response was overwhelmingly positive  which was shown as ABIO closed over 73  higher the next day  Yet another day later  the stock almost broke  1 share  although it seems that a good number of investors brought the price of ABIO back down to earn with profit taking pressures  Why is this phase III trial so exciting   Well  for one thing  Gencaro is just about the only thing that ABIO shareholders could get excited about since it s the only compound in the company s pipeline  Secondly  it targets a large number of patients with its intended indication  atrial fibrillation  which makes its market capitalization of   10 million quite cheap at first glance   The proposed phase III adaptive design trial  which is now called the GENETIC AF trial  will have 620 patients  The intention is to compare Gencaro to metoprolol CR XL for the prevention of atrial fibrillation for patients that already have cardiovascular conditions  in this case  heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction  HFRF    What I think is particular interesting is the genetic component of the trial  Patients that are tested to be homozygous  having 2 copies of 1 gene  for the beta 1 adrenergic receptor gene make up the entirety of the trial s population  They did this because it was shown in another clinical trial  the  BEST  trial  that these patients in particular had the best responses to Gencaro in the prevention of atrial fibrillation  Luckily for Arca  about 50  of the US population has this genotype  which means that Gencaro could target a truly enormous patient population if it managed to reach the drug market   There are about 2 3 million adults in the United States with atrial fibrillation  with a heavy skew towards the elderly population   Arca Biopharma estimates 2 7 million  This means that Gencaro  at its very best  could target about 1 4 million adults if its indication were restricted for use in patients that are homozygous for the beta 1 adrenergic receptor  On top of this  the prevalence of atrial fibrillation as a whole is expected to increase dramatically throughout the next few years due to an aging population  This is an enormous patient population for a company worth  10 million   If you look at the volume and price action in ABIO throughout the last few sessions  one can infer that there is major interest in the stock from a large number of buyers who seem to be chasing the  catalyst potential  of Gencaro s new phase III trial  You can also see that this rally was marred by substantial profit taking on Friday  February 1st   although this seems to be a temporary stall in a larger trend  ABIO looks like it wants to break  1 share  although there are also quite a few things to worry about going forward   For one  investors should take into consideration Arca s intention to secure financing for this phase III  which means that they will have to either form a partnership with another pharmaceutical company or perform an equity financing  This means that shareholders might see their ABIO get diluted in the near future   never a pleasant process for those who are involved  Also  while the formation of a partnership between Arca and another company may be good for the short run  t could cut into the market potential for the drug drastically depending on the terms dictated in any contracts that are signed   Overall  I think ABIO is your typical run up play  The company s valuation is extremely low right now  which reduces the downside risk dramatically in the long run  The catch is that the company may be quite cash strapped as it attempts to finance a 620 patient phase III trial  so financing in the near future is something that must be done  I think there is a high chance that ABIO will do an equity financing  which means that the stock is almost guaranteed to drop after the announcement  Investors may want to wait for this event prior to buying into ABIO ,2013-02-06,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/arca-biopharma-rallies-on-new-plans-for-a-phase-iii-trial-154158,154158
30496,252011,CSII,Orphan Drug Mania  Amicus Migalastat HCl ,opinion,Orphan Drug Mania  Amicus Migalastat HCl I m going to be taking a look at orphan drugs and their underlying companies all throughout the month of February  which will result in a number of write ups with one specific theme  orphan drug investing  In the US  Orphan drugs are drugs that target diseases that affect less than 200 000 people  Europeans use an incidence rate threshold  which is 5 10 000  Orphan drugs are given certain benefits to encourage their production  including extended exclusivity periods on the drug market  7 in the US and 10 in Europe   These can be attractive investments due to their pricing power  extended market exclusivity  and their generally easier approval process  A Brief Overview Of Amicus   Fabry Disease The last time I took a look at the orphan drug specialist Amicus Therapeutics  FOLD   we were all waiting on the phase III results for their flagship drug Migalastat HCL  which was formerly known as AT1001 and or Amigal   This is a treatment for a very rare disease known as  Fabry Disease   and also makes the drug an orphan drug  Fabry disease is one of the many progressive genetic diseases is caused by a mutation which causes a deficiency in a vital protein   in this case in an enzyme that are used to metabolize lipids  Fabry disease is also known as  alpha galactosidase A deficiency   which names the specific enzyme that is missing due to the genetic mutation in these patients  Since Fabry patients have a mutated form of this enzyme  they are basically unable to process lipids as they are meant to  which leads to severe problems  Excessively high levels of lipids are extreme dangerous to many of the body s systems  but this is particularly true of the cardiovascular system  Ultra high lipid levels due to a deficiency of alpha galactosidase A causes symptoms in patients from an early age  with worsening conditions going into adulthood  Patients at the ages of 30 45 generally begin to see worsening function of the kidneys or the heart  which can lead to strokes and organ failure  Fabrazyme  agalsidase beta  Patients who have the disease do have a treatment option   an alpha galactosidase replacement therapy called Fabrazyme which is being marketed by Genzyme   a subsidiary of Sanofi  SNY   Fabrazyme drew recent attention due to its recent rise in sales volume after years are subpar performance  An article from 2012 on FiercePharma outlined just how well Fabrazyme has been performing  In Q3 2012  Genzyme reported an impressive total  87 million  which is  118 million using the very latest EUR USD rate   The United States made more than half of this revenue  which isn t surprising because of how lucrative the US market is with our health insurance system  Amicus Analysis  the fun part  FOLD  with a market capitalization of about  190 million after its drop in December 2012  is discounting the potential of a successful Fabry disease treatment by a decent amount  especially when you add in the value of the remainder of its pipeline   Why has it gotten cheaper  Again  we go back to points outlined in my previous article on FOLD  FOLD was trading in a predictable trading range for most of 2012 until phase III results for migalastat HCl were released  At the end of the last article  I mentioned the following   Top line results for Study 011 are due before the end of this year  which means that we could see the press release any day now   Because of the huge reaction that Wall Street had to other clinical trial data releases for orphan drugs this year  there is expectation that positive top line results from Study 011 could cause a massive rally based on the notion that orphan drugs with successful phase II III results have extremely high chances of approval   I was right about the  huge reaction  to the phase III data that was ultimately release for migalastat  although I was expecting better results than what we got  Because of that phase III trial  FOLD dropped from  5 77 share on December 19th all the way to  3 06 share the next day  This is a 47  drop that occurred in a single trading session  which is quite a traumatizing thing to see  This   which details the top line results from migalastat s phase III trial   Study 011  explains how the primary endpoint was specified as a 50  or greater reduction in kidney insterstitial capillary GL 3 after the 6 month treatment period for migalastat  GL 3 is the name of the glycolipid that is accumulated within blood vessels in patients with Fabry disease  and its buildup in the kidneys looks a bit like this   A  Baseline biopsy  pre treatment  GL 3 is present near endothelial nuclei and around the perimeter of the capillaries   B  Post treatment biopsy  Capillaries are clear of GL 3  magnification of A and B  100 objective      41  of the migalastat arm was able to demonstrated over 50  reduction in GL 3 in the kidneys versus 28  of the placebo arm  although this was not statistically significant  p  3  because of the large number of patients who were not evaluable  The overall percentage change in GL 3 in the migalastat arm  after 6 months  was 41  while the placebo arm s was 6   This shows that migalastat seems to work  although it wasn t proven with statistical significance with current data  I think that this can be fixed if the company lowers the bar for migalastat s 6 month performance and makes the trial bigger  Also  since migalastat is not a simple hormone replacement  and works through a different mechanism   I think that the FDA might have some lenience on the drug  The FDA has also indicated that it will consider 12 month results for a potential FDA approval  which indicates that this trial may add more to a migalastat NDA submission than the market originally thought  This should be further discussed in a presentation that Amicus will be making at the Lysosomal Disease Network WORLD Symposium  LDN WORLD  event in Orlando  Florida between February 12 15  Since further analysis on patient renal function will be addressed  I think we could see some interesting news  Conclusion There s no doubt that FOLD has been a terrible investment in the last few months  but migalastat might recoup the losses  and then some  if the clinical trial situation can be turned around  This is hinged around the success of the secondary endpoints in Study 011  which should be further analyzed very soon  At the same time  there are risks involved  Clearly there is some question about the efficacy profile of migalastat  which should naturally keep FOLD away from inflated price for quite some time  There is also the fact that Amicus has partnered with GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  for the development of migalastat  which means that the company is limited to the drug s market potential within the United States alone  This means that they will only be able to target about 3 000 patients  Still  this can be a surprisingly big market if you consider how much pricing power Amicus has with a necessary Fabry treatment ,2013-02-06,Myriad

30498,252013,CSII,Pozen  An Undervalued Investment And Catalyst Trade Opportunity,opinion,It s not too often I come across a small cap biopharma that I think might make a nice longer term investment  Most small cap biopharmas burn a ton of cash on development treatments for such ailments as cancers  Hepatitis  and rare diseases  In this article  I would like to talk about the company Pozen  POZN   which I feel is a good longer term speculative investment  and a good trade with near term catalysts coming up  Pozen reminds me of another company I came across in 2011  Antares Pharma  NASDAQ  ATRS  which I made a substantial investment in  but have since sold for an 80  gain in 14 months  Antares is not a typical biotech that develops drugs to treat rare diseases such as the ones mentioned above  Rather  the company aims to take existing treatments and make them better via subcutaneous self injections  When I first bought Antares  the price was around  2 20 a share  Within one year  the stock nearly tripled  hitting a 52 week high of  5 58  before settling back to where it trades today  in the high  3 range  Antares looks to have a bright future ahead of it  Like Antares  Pozen takes existing drugs and seeks to make them safer and better   more tolerable  Today  I will look at the management  pipeline  upcoming catalysts  partnership potential  and noteworthy financial items for Pozen  ManagementOne reason Pozen reminds me of Antares is because of the strong management with strong backgrounds     is President  Chief Executive Officer  and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pozen  Prior to founding the company in 1996  Dr  Plachetka has held many high level positions in the pharmaceutical industry  Most notably  he had a nine year career at Glaxo Inc  where Dr  Plachetka held various executive positions including Director of Cardiovascular Clinical Research and led the U S  development program for Imitrex   Trandate   and a thromboxane antagonist  Mr  Plachetka is the firm s biggest shareholder holding   He is also responsible for bringing Liz Cermak on as the firm s Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer  A former Worldwide Vice President for Johnson   Johnson  Liz has served in a variety of senior leadership roles across the pharmaceutical  consumer products  and health management businesses  She has over 25 years  experience in the healthcare industry  The CEO s heavy ownership stake is one of the reasons why I believe the management team is extra focused with added incentives to perform well for its investors  The scenario arguably communicates a direct sense of personal accountability towards building shareholder value for investors in the company  The more that CEO is able to create shareholder value  the more he will ensure his own compensation and benefits  The value of the management s approach has been proven with its success in gaining FDA approval of two self invented products  One of these products is Treximet  developed with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  in June 2003 for the acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults  In what I feel is a very smart move  Pozen  and milestone payments covering Treximet sales in the United States to a financial investor for  75 million in November  2011  On the surface  this may not mean much  However  once I looked deeper  I noticed how the company is piggybacking the product by retaining exclusive U S  rights to develop and market a lower dose sumatriptan and naproxen combination  MT400   This is the same combination used in Treximet  Effectively  the company raised  75 million while potentially having virtually the same product in development  A pipeline chart later in this article will show the MT 400 drug in Phase III development  As a result of the Treximet decision  it is over one year later and the company has remained shareholder friendly by achieving a strong cash position while avoiding dilution  As of the end of Q3  2012  Pozen had approximately  92 million in cash and short term investments  The dilution alternative to raise cash was one annoyance I had with an otherwise strong Antares management team as they did a cash raise last year that I felt was unnecessary at the time  but might ultimately be the best course of action for them moving forward  Upcoming CatalystPozen plans on filing an NDA  for its first PA product PA32540  which is a combination of 325 mg aspirin and 40 mg time released omeprazole  better known as Prilosec  originally created by AstraZeneca  NYSE  AZN   From the company s website     Pozen s active PA product portfolio is focused on designing cost effective  integrated aspirin therapies that enable the full power of aspirin by reducing its potential gastrointestinal  GI  damage  The PA product portfolio has the potential to benefit millions of Americans who use daily aspirin to treat cardiovascular disease  osteoarthritis  and other diseases   PA32540 is designed to be a GI safer form of aspirin to be administered orally once a day  at a   PA32540 prevents secondary cardiovascular disease in patients at risk for aspirin associated gastric ulcers  Last week  the company  the combined results of two Phase III studies of PA32540   According to the studies  in the post hoc analysis of subjects with a history of transient ischemic attack  TIA  or stroke  long term  6 months  treatment with PA32540  compared to EC ASA  325 mg   was associated with a significantly reduced rate of endoscopic gastroduodenal ulcers  2 0  vs  12 4  respectively  p 0 005   and study discontinuation due to adverse pre specified upper GI events  0  vs  8 0  respectively  p 0 006   The incidence of adjudicated major adverse cardiac events was similar for PA32540  2 9   and EC ASA  325 mg   4 4     Mark J  Alberts  MD  UT Southwestern Medical Center  Dallas  Texas remarked   Discontinuation of aspirin therapy is often due to the adverse GI effects of aspirin  In these pivotal studies  PA32540 was associated with a significantly lower rate of treatment discontinuation than aspirin alone  Patient adherence to aspirin therapy saves lives  as aspirin discontinuation increases the likelihood of potential adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events   In an  written by analyst Jason Napodano for Propthink  he writes   Amazon com sells a 500 tablet bottle of 325 mg aspirin for  11 00  or 2 2 cents per day  One can also buy 42 20 mg tablets of OTC Prilosec  omeprazole  for  23 95  or around 57 cents per pill  To re create Pozen s PA 325 40  a patient would spend approximately  1 16 per day  taking two Prilosec pills plus an aspirin    The above clearly demonstrates why it would be beneficial to choose Pozen s drug over taking aspirin and Prilosec separately   it would cost less at 1 dollar a day for a patient to buy PA32540 verses buying both drugs separately for  1 16  Additionally  PA32540 is time released and contains a dose specific solution in one pill where patients need not to worry about mixing both medications to get the desired result  Partnership PotentialThe above referenced article goes on further to note that the PA platform might be worth as much as  400M in sales per year globally  with the company receiving at least a  30M upfront payment from any potential partner  With an NDA filing expected in April the company s  before the filing  I expect Pozen s stock price to increase significantly in the short term  A partnership can spark a stock price depending on the details of the transaction  Generally  it shows that the development of a drug will be expedited and the potential is going to be greater because of more power and resources behind it  Last year  Sunesis Pharmaceuticals  SNSS  gained 15  on a day when it  a partnership with Royalty Pharma  Royalty Pharma agreed to pay Sunesis  25 million if the company is successful developing its lead product candidate Vosaroxin  which is an anticancer quinolone derivative class of compounds that have never used to attempt to treat cancer  In the time since  Sunesis has seen a stock price increase of well over 100  from  2 87 to  6 18  Pozen is already partnered with such pharma giants as GlaxoSmithKline  Johnson   Johnson  JNJ   and AstraZeneca  which shows Pozen s management has experience with gaining partnership deals with large pharmas  PipelineThe graphic below shows the rest of Pozen s marketed and pipelined solutions  It is worth noting that the company has other solutions that will also see NDA filings within the next year FinancialsPozen was profitable for the first two quarters of 2012  before showing a loss in the last two quarters of the same year  This was in part due to less than expected sales from Vimovo  which is partnered with AstraZeneca  AstraZenca may have priced Vimovo too high at  4 a day  causing the drug to lose market acceptance  However as Jason Napodano reported in his article  AstraZenca may become more aggressive in its price point for the drug  Furthermore  AstraZeneca has filed Vimovo in 80 countries  receiving approval in 60 countries  and is currently launched in 40 countries  This leaves about 40 countries left for approval and roll out of the drug  which will equate to more revenue for Pozen moving forward   The stock price and volume have been increasing steadily over the last two weeks or so  With nearly 6 4  of the float held short  Pozen makes for a decent short squeeze candidate  Institutional ownership is high  especially for a stock selling in the high  5 range like Pozen  With a market cap of  173 06M  I believe that Pozen is undervalued by about  100M when considering the market opportunity for its PA platform  40 more countries to roll out Vimovo  and the likeliness of a partnership for PAPA32540 which as already mentioned  should net at least a  30M upfront payment   From the chart above  the stock looks to be finally reversing the extended down trend it has been in since May of last year  It appears to me that catalyst traders and investors are accumulating the stock  With the NDA filing for PA32540 expected in April  and the likeliness of the company gaining a significant partnership with the drug before then  a short term price appreciation to the  6 50 range looks to be in short order  Price target opinions   6 50 to  6 75 in the short term as a catalyst trade  and a one year target price of  10  Pozen just might be a very good stock to buy and hold for the long term  which is a rare thing for small cap biopharmas  Disclosure  I am

30499,252014,CSII,Amarin Stagnates Despite New Attention From The Market,opinion,It seems that the market s attention is once again turning to Amarin Corporation  AMRN   which has recently launched the much anticipated prescription omega 3 hypertriglyceridemia drug Vascepa into the United States  Sales revenue is expected to become grow impressively over time because of the improved safety profile that Vascepa offers when compared to the current leader of the market  Lovaza   marketed by GlaxoSmithKline  GSK   Lovaza is an extremely successful drug  which boasts annual revenues of over  1 billion in the US alone  and over  400 million abroad   Given its current valuation of   1 3 B  the market is generally saying that Amarin won t even be able to match Lovaza s sales  Despite the big potential of the drug  it seems that the market still can t get over the fact that Amarin has not been acquired  Recall that in 2012  the AMRN investment community was utterly obsessed with the notion that there were buyers lined up to partner with  or buy the company outright  There were very big rumors about Teva Pharmaceuticals TEVA  and AstraZeneca  AZN  in particular  which were rumored to be some of Amarin s most interested potential acquirers  It was due to this intense M A speculation that I decided to purchase some AMRN for myself  with the intent to reap options premiums from the call options buyers who were expecting a buyout of AMRN north of  20 share in the near future  This was driving call options premiums through the room  and it ended up being a gold mine for those who expected AMRN to be acquired at a later date  like myself   Unfortunately  all good things come to an end  This was the case for the M A speculation over Amarin  especially after the company s  on December 6th 2012  which unveiled the company s plans to raise  100 million to basically prepare for the launch of Vascepa  Amarin also finalized their plans to hire a few hundred people for their Vascepa sales force for the marketing of Vascepa under the MARINE indication  What exactly does that mean  Well  let s just put these indications for Vascepa in an easy to understand format  MARINE Indication  Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia  high triglyceride levels  for patients over 500 mg dL ANCHOR Indication  Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia for patients over 200 mg dL REDUCE IT Indication  Treatment for  cardiovascular risk  In 2012  Vascepa was FDA approved for the MARINE indication  which means that it can be prescribed for adult patients with excessively high triglyceride levels  Excluding off label usage  this means that doctors use it only for patients with extremely high triglycerides  Only a small fraction  about 10  of the 40 million hypertriglyceridemia patients or so  reach that particular threshold  This also means that MARINE indication matches the indication that was given to GlaxoSmithKline s Lovaza  Things get more exciting for Amarin in the future because of the potential approval for the ANCHOR indication  which is scheduled to have its sNDA submission before the end of this month  This means that AMRN investors will have a PDUFA action date look forward to in December 2013 or early 2014 that could expand Vascepa s target market to about 40 million adult patients  far exceeding the reach of Lovaza   If Amarin receives this FDA approval  I think AMRN could move substantially higher although it will certainly be less than 900  upside   I d say 200  at best   Down the road  we also have the REDUCE IT trial which can expand Vascepa s potential into the overall  reduction of cardiovascular risk  area  This means that many of the patients that are on statin therapy for cholesterol  hyperlipidemia  might be taking Vascepa as well as a preventative medicine  Overall  while AMRN investors wait for the establishment of the PDUFA date for the FDA s decision on the ANCHOR indication there are other factors which could move the stock significantly this year  AMRN seems to have dropped 30  permanently following the equity financing press release mentioned earlier  which is ultimately a result of the mentioned  fizzling out  of M A speculation over AMRN and the big skepticism that the market is placing on Amarin over its ability to launch a drug into a huge and competitive market by itself  I think that Vascepa sales could help mitigate some of this skepticism given that they have a fast enough growth rate  I also want to mention that the lack of an NCE decision over Vascepa is another lingering topic from 2012 that has yet to be addressed  An NCE means the difference between 3 and 5 years of exclusivity for Amarin s Vascepa  although it s also worth mentioning that the extensive patent protection that Amarin has layered over Vascepa could make the NCE decision a moot point  these patents last until 2030   I would encourage anyone looking for a long term holding in the pharmaceutical industry to at least consider Amarin  although it s important to be aware of the risks surrounding this stock as well  As we ve seen with Vivus   NASDAQ  VVUS  launch of Qsymia last year  healthcare reimbursement issues can be crippling to a drug s sales figures  It s also true that large pharmaceutical companies are simply more efficient at drug launches  which puts Amarin at a disadvantage in many ways  Nonetheless  I think AMRN has significant downside protection due to the fact that M A speculation for the stock is somewhat dead  and investors are pricing Vascepa to be worth only a fraction of what Lovaza is  I don t think that Amarin has become a less attractive acquisition target either  in fact  I d say the opposite   and I think that an NCE decision could definitely result in an unexpected  sudden acquisition from a larger pharmaceutical company sometime this year  We ll have to see  Disclosure  I am long AMRN  and continue to sell covered calls against the position  I d also encourage investors who are looking to perform heavy due diligence on Amarin to consider points brought up against Vascepa by competitors  See an interview with Omthera Pharmaceuticals  CEO  Jerry Wisler on

30500,252015,CSII,Did We Overshoot Expectations In the Obesity Drug Space ,opinion,After seeing relative underperformance of the two most prominent plays on the obesity drug space   Arena  ARNA  and Vivus  VVUS  throughout the first quarter of 2013  there has been talk about a potential  overshooting of expectations  for this new drug indication  While Wall Street was more comfortable with its optimistic valuation of ARNA and VVUS last year after we saw semi unexpected FDA approvals for Belviq  lorcaserin  and Qsymia  phentermine and topiramate ER   a dismal US launch of Vivus  Qsymia is leading many to believe that this drug market is much smaller than we thought Initially  many analysts made their sales projections based on the sheer number of Americans who are classified as  obese   which is technically defined through the BMI scale which simply divides someone s weight by their squared height  This was combined with arbitrarily defined penetration rates for the drug  which presumed that a certain percentage rate of physicians would prescribe a given obesity drug to their patients With something like 1 3 American adults being considered obese by the BMI scale  and with hundreds of thousands of deaths per annum being attributed to obesity by the most prominent government and physician organizations  it seemed like a no brainer to imagine that the obesity drug space would also be enormous  Since Qsymia would be the first available prescription obesity drug available since the 1990 s  wouldn t it be expected to become an instant blockbuster with multibillion dollar sales potential each year The bullish thesis makes sense from a common sense perspective  but Qsymia s performance since its launch in September 2012 has really shaken the faith that investors once had in this emerging drug indication  In addition  the European Medicines Agency seems hesitant to introduce obesity drugs to its population In its Q4 2012 earnings release  which can be found here   Vivus reported only  1 97 million in revenues for the quarter ended December 31  2012  This was offset by the company s  50 3 million budget for SG A  selling  general   administration  expenses and ultimately brought Vivus  losses to  56 3 million It s not fair to make a final judgment call on Qsymia  but the initial results are far from impressive and favor the argument that the obesity drug space might be significantly smaller or more elusive than we expected  Qsymia s  1 97 worth of quarterly revenue needs to expand drastically to justify the current valuation of the company at   1 2 billion  Even after a recent rally  VVUS has been brought down an additional 12 2  since the start of 2013 on the modest performance of its flagship drug  and its dismal chances at European approval Having said that  there are other factors that could turn the obesity drug space around after the introduction of Arena s Belviq  While Qsymia s efficacy profile is considered top notch in this space  it introduces cardiovascular risk factors on its label  Since obese patients are much more exposed to cardiovascular risk factors than most  I find it very possible that Qsymia sales are being thwarted by physician concerns on patient safety Due to this  I think Belviq  which is seeing a delayed launch due to some temporary government related factors  will give us a better read on the market potential of the obesity indication due to its relative safety  I also believe that the differential between the market value of Arena and Vivus are directly attributable to the respective  physician friendliness  of the Belviq and Qsymia alone So did we overshoot our expectations in the obesity drug space The answer seems to be yes based on what we know so far  although Belviq has a chance to disprove this conclusion given that it has a well orchestrated launch ,2013-03-18,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/did-we-overshoot-expectations-in-the-obesity-drug-space-159273,159273

30548,252063,CSII,3 Small Cap Biopharmas With Upcoming Catalyst Events,opinion,Alexza Pharma  ALXA  Alexza engages in the research  development  and commercialization of novel proprietary products for the acute treatment of central nervous system conditions worldwide  Its product candidates are based on a proprietary technology  the Staccato system  which vaporizes an excipient free drug to form a condensation aerosol that  when inhaled  allows for rapid systemic drug delivery  The company s lead product candidate includes Adasuve  Staccato loxapine  for the acute treatment of agitation in adults with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder  The first catalyst event for Alexza is a decision on its Marketing Authorization Application  MAA  submitted to the European Medicines Agency  EMA  for Adasuve  This decision is scheduled for the middle of December  2012  The second catalyst event for the company is Adasuve  s Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  date of 12 21 12  which is the bigger catalyst driver  In May of this year  Alexza  a Complete Response Letter  CRL  from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application  NDA  for Adasuve inhalation powder    5 mg and 10 mg  In the CRL  the FDA   During a recent inspection of the Mountain View  CA manufacturing facility for this application  our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility  Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved  The CRL went on to state that discussions can continue on the proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy  REMS  after the response to the action letter has been submitted  The CRL also contained comments on Alexza s draft product labeling  The company now believes there is a substantial agreement with the FDA on the REMS and product labeling  Senior Vice President of R D Jim Cassella   The issue that the FDA noted was an inspectional issue  so that was the only thing really in the letter  We addressed the issues with the CDRH reviewers who had raised the issue and then we responded to their questions  We resubmitted the NDA  which is basically a labeling resubmission  so there is not a lot of work left to do  We believe that we have addressed the inspectional issues and we have resubmitted an advanced draft of the label and we have probably a little bit of work left to do on some of the REMS documents  Since there was no clinical or safety issues identified  and no other deficiencies outlined in the CRL  Adasuve has a good chance at approval this go around in my opinion  Manufacturing  labeling  and REMS can be dealt with    efficacy and serious safety concerns cannot  Alexza has a very small float of which over 17  of it is held short  An FDA approval for Adasuve would likely cause a short squeeze  It s a good bet the smarter shorts will be covering their positions as we draw close to both catalyst event dates  Again  if safety and efficacy issues were the main concern here  then I could understand shorts holding their positions  However  this is not the case  Recently  we saw a 200  jump in Acadia Pharma s  ACAD  stock price when its drug Pimavanserin showed positive Phase III clinical results  Pimavanserin is designed for the treatment of Parkinson s disease psychosis  Adasuve is similar to Pimavanserin in that both are designed to treat  disorders  and both drugs saw initial failures  Also  Acadia still needs to engage in another clinical study for Pimavanserin  so there still remains considerable uncertainty in Acadia  On a related note  I feel Acadia is overvalued at its current price level and there remains too much downside risk at this time for me to consider it a good long trade investment  I would not be surprised to see a double of the company s stock on FDA approval  However  there is considerable risk for traders and investors holding through the PDUFA date  If the FDA rejects Adasuve again  it s likely Alexza as a company will not survive because they will simply run out of cash  At the very least  the company would have to engage in dilutive financing to survive  While I believe this will not occur  it s wise to consider this possibility  Alexza was beaten down after its last CRL  but since then it has begun to reverse leading into the December PDUFA date  The stock is wedged between two trend lines and poised to break out as sentiment remains strong  There is a psychological support level at  5 00 and the stock could break out to test the  6 00 level it touched earlier this year or perhaps even higher  With a market cap of around  80M  I strongly feel Alexza is undervalued at this time  My price target opinion before the PDFUA date is  6  If approval is confirmed   12 share is my expectation  Amicus Therapeutics  Inc   FOLD  focuses on the discovery  development  and commercialization of orally administered  small molecule drugs for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders and diseases of neurodegeneration  Its drugs are known as pharmacological chaperones  which selectively bind to the target protein  enhance the stability of the protein  help it fold into the three dimensional shape  as well as allowing proper trafficking of the protein  This increases protein activity  enhances cellular function  and reduces cell stress  In its Fabry program  the company is investigating the use of AT1001 to bind to destabilized   galactosidase A enzyme    GAL  and thereby restore its intended biological function  A potentially big catalyst coming up for Amicus is the release of the phase III 011 six month results related to its medication for Fabry disease  This is a disorder caused by the deficiency of an enzyme called   galactosidase A    GAL   Reduced or absent levels of this enzyme s activity leads to the accumulation of a complex lipid in the affected tissues  including the central nervous system  heart  kidneys  and skin  This accumulation is believed to cause the various symptoms of Fabry disease including pain  kidney failure  and increased risk of heart attack and stroke  There has been historic difficulty in finding successful treatments for rare genetic diseases  If Amicus can show successful phase III data here  it could be quite a breakthrough in the treatment for Fabry s disease  On 9 6 12  Amicus issued a  to update the screening profiles related to the 011 study  which is one of two ongoing Phase III studies of migalastat HCl monotherapy being conducted by the company and GlaxoSmithKline  GSK   The updated screening profiles included the following  A total of 180 Fabry patients  60 males and 120 females  were screened for Study 011  Prior to screening  sites used genotype information when available to enrich Fabry patients with amenable mutations who were more likely to be interested in participating in the study Approximately 86   154 180  of patients screened had missense mutations  compared to a current estimate in the Fabry population of approximately 60   Approximately 88   136 154  of those patients  or 76  of patients screened  had alpha galactosidase A mutations amenable to migalastat HCl monotherapy  and were potentially eligible for enrollment Approximately 50   67 136  of those patients  or 37  of all patients screened  enrolled in Study 011 upon meeting all entry criteria  including  1  na ve to ERT or had not received ERT for at least 6 months prior to study entry  2  genetic mutations amenable to chaperone monotherapy and  3  for study purposes  urine globotriaosylceramide  GL 3  levels at least four times the upper limit of normal at baseline The primary endpoint in Study 011 is a change in interstitial capillary GL 3  as measured in a kidney biopsy at six months versus baseline  The six month primary treatment period in Study 011 was completed in the second quarter of 2012 and the six month follow up period is expected to complete in   Amicus and GSK will also un blind and analyze data from the primary six month treatment at this time  Currently  both companies remain blinded to all results  Also of significance  on November  8  2012  the company  additional preliminary results from an open label Phase 2 drug interaction study    to evaluate a single oral dose of migalastat HCl  150 mg or 450 mg  co administered with enzyme replacement therapy    in males with Fabry disease  In a poster at the   Dr  David G  Warnock  University of Alabama Birmingham  presented results from all 12 patients in the migalastat HCl 150 mg dose group  Based on the bullish move the stock has been making lately  I think it s possible the release of the expected December data comes before the middle of the month  If the results prove to be positive  I expect the stock to be at least double its current price for a couple of factors  GlaxoSmithKline owns 20  of Amicus  It s a good bet in my opinion that Glaxo will acquire the rest of Amicus if the clinical trial results prove to be positive  Fabry s is a rare disorder  and Amicus s Chaperone technology is cutting edge in my opinion  which if confirmed  would be worth a lot of money  Even if Glaxo does not acquire Amicus  with 20  interest in the company  Glaxo has a significant vested interest in seeing Amicus succeed Amicus has a small trading float of around 24 42M  with a market cap coming in at  290 76M  As mentioned prior  Acadia Pharma recently saw its stock price move up 200  on positive results from its Phase III drug study  Acadia s drug is nowhere near the worth of Amicus s in my opinion  yet Acadia has a current market cap of  304 05M with a larger trading float of around 40M shares In 2001  two  were released which attempt to replace the deficient enzyme by means of infusion  The drugs are expensive  with an annual cost of approximately  per patient  it s estimated about 10 000 people suffer from Fabry s disease globally  Insurance companies normally cover treatments for rare diseases such as Fabry s  so this is also a big positive for both Glaxo and Amicus  For a big pharma such as Glaxo  it always comes down to making big money   period  Glaxo would not be involved with Amicus and own 20  of the company for any other reason  Amicus also has other drugs in earlier clinical development  which adds further speculation value to the company in my strong opinion   Amicus recently bounced off of a support level at  4 25 with conviction  and since then the stock has gained significantly leading into its crucial Phase III data release  The stock needs to consolidate here at the 61 8  retrace point a bit but is setting up for the next leg higher to the  6 60 range  possibly even before the data is released in December  My price target opinion for Amicus  Over  10 a share on positive Phase III 011 data   12 to  14 on potential Glaxo acquisition  Arena Pharmaceuticals  ARNA  Arena engages in discovering  developing  and commercializing oral drugs that target G protein coupled receptors in the therapeutic areas of cardiovascular  central nervous system  inflammatory  and metabolic diseases  Since the  of its weight loss drug Belviq in June  the stock has fallen from a yearly high of  11 39 to  7 21  a fall of 37   I feel long term investors have excellent value here at its current price level of around  9 a share  The focus on Arena should now be on potential top line growth from its strong clinical pipeline  Because Arena will likely receive a large amount of cash from Belviq sales  I believe it is a strong speculative bet that management will re invest this cash into its pipeline  This would gain leverage for the company in any potential deal with a large pharma partner for any of its pipelined drugs which are  APD811  An orally available agonist of the prostacyclin receptor is intended for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  or PAH  In December 2010  Arena initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of APD811  The company believes the results of this early stage clinical trial suggest APD811 has the potential for once daily  oral dosing  APD334  A potential oral treatment for a number of conditions related to autoimmune diseases  including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis  APD371  For the potential treatment of pain  The analgesic effects of CB receptor agonists are well established in the scientific literature  GPR119  A novel pharmaceutical target for discovering orally available small molecule agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes  Temanogrel  An inverse agonist of the serotonin 2A receptor intended for the treatment of arterial thrombosis and other related conditions has completed Phase 1a and Phase 1b clinical trials  In my opinion  if Arena can get the first weight loss drug approved since 1999  the company can get others approved in time as well  Also  if the company can manage its money correctly  it can become a large pharma within 3 to 5 years  similar to how Jazz Pharma  JAZZ  has grown in a little over 3 years from   to a current stock price of  53 58 a share  However  TheStreet com  as a sell with a ratings score of D   One area they are negative on is poor profit margins from the company  I find TheStreet s rating system to be insufficient at best concerning developmental small cap companies  Of course Arena is going to have poor profit margins    it does not have Belviq out on the market yet  The drug  to consumers through a doctor s prescription in early 2013  Arena also  to receive  65 million before the end of 2012 from its marketing partner Eisai following the Drug Enforcement Agency  DEA    which does not include any of the revenue under marketing agreement with Eisai such as product sales of the drug  Arena is more of a speculative long term investment than just a trade  so I will not engage in any chart analysis for the stock  My 3 to 5 year price target opinion for Arena  barring a market crash  is  25 to  45 a share  Disclosure  I am long ALXA  FOLD  I wrote this article myself  and it expresses my own opinions  I am not receiving compensation for it  I

30610,252125,CSII,Cardiome Shares Remain Low On Merck s Abandonment,opinion,Earlier in the year  specifically on March 19th 2012  shares of Vancouver based Cardiome Pharma Corp  CRME  dropped from  1 93 share or so to   88 share in reaction to a press release regarding their partnership with the pharmaceutical giant Merck   Merck was to officially discontinue development of the oral version of Cardiome s flagship drug vernakalant  which left the IV formulation  referred to as vernakalant IV in the release   Merck apparently made the decision based on the regulatory environment  and the projected development timeline of vernakalant oral   While there were some beneficial effects of this partnership termination  like significantly reduced development expenses and cash burn for Cardiome Pharma  investors did not like the fact that oral vernakalant was out of the picture   According to CEO Doug Janzen s statements  vernakalant oral also had a well established profile for both efficacy and safety  As a long term prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation  both Cardiome and the market seem to agree that an oral formulation would have been superior  Not only do oral formulations of drugs not have to deal with the invasiveness of IV formulations  but patients  and doctors  find them much easier and more convenient to administer  Whether or not Merck made the  right  decision is very debatable up to this point  For now  vernakalant oral is stuck in phase II development unless something can finance its progress later on   Vernakalant IV has already been approved in Europe and Latin America and is marketed under the name BRINAVESS  Merck held commercial rights to this drug until September 26th 2012  when global marketing and development rights were returned to Cardiome   presumably after Merck did a bit more of their own research on the cardiovascular drug market   While investors seemed to like the idea that Cardiome had regained the rights to its drug  the fact that Merck was so unimpressed by its prospects that it decided to basically dump the drug from its pipeline this year does bring up some concerns that should be considered by anyone that is considering an investment in this biotech stock   While the prospects of any drug are never completely black or white  it s important to realize that Merck must have seen something wrong  or at least lacking  with vernakalant  On the bright side for Cardiome  the patient population that could be using the drug as a long term treatment to prevent atrial fibrillation is enormous  Cardiome s research suggests that one out of every three patients admitted to hospitals for cardiac arrhythmia have atrial fibrillation    Going forward  vernakalant has two major obstacles towards achieving its true potential  First is its troubled attempt at approval in the United States  Recall that vernakalant was put on clinical hold as far back as October 2010 by the FDA in the middle of its Phase III ACT V trial  which should bring up some concern on the drug s safety and long term chances of US approval The second is the fact that small pharmaceutical companies have big trouble with the marketing of drugs   especially those that target enormous drug markets  While Cardiome could theoretically do well by selling vernakalant IV by itself  Merck s resources would have been extremely helpful   Another indirect consequence of the misfortune that Cardiome has seen this year is related to its actual stock price  NASDAQ listing qualifications indicate that its stocks have to be above  1 share to prevent delisting  Cardiome is only trading at   50 share as of yesterday s closing bell  even after a substantial rally caused by a settlement of its debt obligations to Merck that was caused by the return of commercialization rights to vernakalant   As dismal as the situation seems for Cardiome at this point  there is some hope of redemption for the stock  CRME would react quite well to news that the FDA removed its clinical hold on vernakalant IV  There is also a small chance that vernakalant could be scooped up cheaper by another pharmaceutical company that is willing to save Cardiome Still  the takeaway is that CRME seems very risky even though the stock has fallen so far  It s in danger of a reverse stock split in the near future too  which is generally bad for shareholders due to negative perceptions that develop about biotech stocks that have to perform those reverse splits to regain NASDAQ compliance ,2012-12-19,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cardiome-shares-remain-low-on-merck’s-abandonment-148292,148292

30629,252144,CSII,Three BioPharmas With Upside Potential,opinion,With some added confidence shown by investors yesterday  it s a good time to look at some  risk on  small cap bio pharma stocks that I feel offer good upside for both swing trades and longer term holds  However  with the looming  fiscal cliff  approaching and no clear agreement in Washington  the market might still see some additional selling pressure  BG Medicine  BGMD  BG Medicine engages in the discovery  development  and commercialization of novel cardiovascular diagnostics to address unmet medical needs  The company markets the BGM Galectin 3  a diagnostic test for measuring galectin 3 levels in blood plasma or serum for use in patients with heart failure  These are sold to hospitals and clinics in the United States  as well as through distributors in certain countries in Europe  It is also developing CardioSCORE  a cardiovascular diagnostic test designed to identify individuals at high risk for near term cardiovascular events  such as heart attack and stroke  and galectin 3 test for a second indication to identify individuals at risk for developing heart failure  such as patients who have suffered a heart attack  as well as patients suffering from hypertension or diabetes  It has strategic collaborations with Abbott Laboratories  ABT  to develop and commercialize galectin 3 assay kits and related control kits and calibrators  In the  dated November 13  2012  BG Medicine  Inc  announced financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30  2012 and provided a business update  Included in this business update  the company announced a new commercial strategy to speed the adoption of its cardiovascular diagnostic tests    the BGM Galectin 3 test and the CardioSCORE test  In the release  the company announced a strategic reorganization in its research and development department moving toward a more commercially oriented role in support of studies designed to further differentiate and support the BGM Galectin 3 and CardioSCORE tests in the marketplace  As a result of this strategic reorganization  eleven positions in early discovery research were eliminated on November 8  2012  As a result of the strategic reorganization  the company will record one time severance costs of approximately  150 000  which will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012  Further  the company estimates that it will generate savings of up to  1 2 million in 2013  After this strategic reorganization  the company will have 26 full time employees  President and CEO of BG Medicine Eric Bouvier remarked  We have taken a series of important steps over the past year to realign BG Medicine into a more commercially focused company  capable of playing a larger role in facilitating the market adoption of our innovative cardiovascular diagnostic tests  The steps outlined today represent the culmination of our efforts to transform BG Medicine  Taken together  these actions place us in a much stronger position to control our own destiny and drive our own commercial success  In July 2012  BD Medical  the filing of a 510 k  Pre market Notification with the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for regulatory clearance of the Abbott Architect galectin 3 assay  which is used with Abbott s fully automated Architect immunochemistry instrument platform  In August 2012  Abbott received a letter from the FDA regarding its 510 k  notification that requested additional information and Abbott is undertaking activities to respond to the FDA  In addition  BD Medical expects Abbott to begin marketing an automated version of the test in the EU under a CE Mark in late 2012 or early 2013  In May 2012  a 510 k  was submitted by the company to extend the labeling indication for the BGM Galectin 3 test to include individuals in the general adult population who are at risk for developing heart failure based on elevated levels of galectin 3  In July 2012  a letter from the FDA regarding the 510 k  notification requested additional information  including information regarding the clinical validation study and additional analytical study data  A response was submitted to the FDA in November 2012  If BD Medical obtains clearance in the United States for this additional indication  the company expects the potential market for the BGM Galectin 3 test to increase significantly  On November 15th  company officer Bancel Stephane purchased 100 000 shares for approximately  126 000  Obviously  this is a bullish sign when an insider buys a block this large with their own money  Tackling some of the cost issues the company has as BG is looking to do  is clearly a step forward  The chart above shows a very oversold condition  but the stock showed signs of turning around yesterday as the volume and stock price moved up  The RSI is finally starting to turn up along with the MACD  so it looks to me we have seen a bottom here  so I consider this a nice pinch chart bottom bounce trade    at the very least  With a current market cap of  23 58M  a strong partnership with Abott Labs  and speculative longer term value  BG Medicine seems ridiculously undervalued and oversold to me  My short target opinion  one day to three months  is between  1 45   1 55 a share  My long term target opinion here is not certain at this time    not until we see how the company executes its new business plan  Arena Pharmaceuticals  ARNA  Arena engages in discovering  developing  and commercializing oral drugs that target G protein coupled receptors in the therapeutic areas of cardiovascular  central nervous system  inflammatory  and metabolic diseases  Since the approval of its weight loss drug Belviq in June the stock has fallen from a yearly high of  11 39 to  7 21  a fall of 37   I feel long term investors have excellent value here at its current price level  The focus now on Arena should be the potential top line growth from its strong pre clinical pipeline  Because Arena will likely receive a large amount of cash from Belviq sales  I believe it is a strong speculation bet that management will re invest this cash into its pipeline  gaining leverage in any potential deal with a large pharma partner for any of its pre clinical pipelined drugs  Arena had some interesting things to say about its long term goals in its presentation at the Lazard Capital conference   We have a  significant market opportunity   for Belviq  worldwide it s 0 5 billion individuals that are classified as obese  So it s a significant market opportunity for us  We actually are very much ready for the launch  We ve delivered we announced in our last 10 Q launch supply to Eisai  So we delivered uh  11 6 million worth  It s a portion of the launch supply  So we ll be ready to launch as soon as we get DEA scheduling  So in terms of looking at further down the economics at  250 million in net sales  we ll get 31 5  of that  from its partner Eisai  which is about  80 million plus that threshold we achieved some purchase price adjustments as well as some milestones which another  55 million take on top of that when we get DEA scheduling is another  65 million  So if I do my math right that s an excess of  200 million on their first  250 million of sale  So it makes significant opportunity for us  In terms of other opportunities we just announced last week a nice collaboration with the South Korean company Ildong but we received a  5 million upfront payment great economic service as well first dollar on net sales is at 35  and that will ramps up to 45  on net sale  In terms of other areas that we are moving forward with the European strategy  We did file in the EU in March of this year  I can t believe it s for this year but and so we founded the 120 day questions and we are hopeful to get a decision on that in first half of 2013 probably behind that is actually Switzerland as well which is where our manufacturing facility is The chart above shows a nice symmetrical triangle setting up for Arena  The MACD and RSI indicate that this new leg up still has a lot of steam left to go higher  The catalyst trading is pretty much done in Arena  so the stock has been seeing a steady decline  hot money exiting  smart money accumulating  Although still speculative  Arena might just be a great long term investment if it manages its money correctly  Belviq sales could open the door for Arena to potentially become a full fledged pharma within the next three to five years  I believe the stock price could reach near  20 or so in the next two years    if again  managed correctly  My short term  one day to three months  target opinion for Arena is  10  My long term target opinion is  30 dollars    three years  Antares Pharma  ATRS  Antares engages in the development and marketing of self injection pharmaceutical products and technologies  and topical gel based products  It offers Vision Tjet reusable needle free injectors that deliver precise medication doses through high speed pressurized liquid penetration of the skin without a needle  The Vibex disposable pressure assisted auto injector devices that are used for the controlled pressure delivery of drugs into the body utilizing a spring power source  disposable pen injection systems  which are needle based devices designed to deliver multiple drugs by injection through needles from multi dose drug cartridges  Antares expects to file an NDA for Vibex MTX in February of 2013  but I believe the NDA filing to be as early as December of this year  based on the company s prior history of under promising and over delivering  The company recently announced positive results from an open label  randomized  crossover study comparing the systemic availability of MTX Medi Jet to oral methotrexate  MTX  in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis  RA   This study was designed to compare the relative systemic availability of MTX following oral administration to subcutaneous  SC  self administered MTX using the Medi Jet device  Patients were assigned to one of four dose levels of MTX  10 mg  15 mg  20 mg  and 25 mg  Results showed that the systemic availability of methotrexate following oral dosing plateaus above 15 mg  Following administration of MTX with Medi Jet  the systemic availability increased proportionally at every dose  which will extend the range of exposure compared to patients receiving oral therapy  Historically  parenteral MTX use has been limited in clinical practice for several reasons including the inconvenience of weekly injections by a healthcare professional  and or the challenges associated with teaching patients with impaired hand function  safe and sterile self injection techniques  To address these issues  the easy to use  single use MTX Medi Jet auto injector was developed to optimize the clinical benefit of MTX  leading to cost effective treatment outcomes  VIBEX QS T For Testosterone Replacement TherapyQS T is potentially the first self injectable testosterone product for men suffering from symptomatic testosterone deficiency  Low T   Most of this market currently is made up of gel treatments  which most men really do not like  I am sure many of you have seen the commercials on TV advertising these testosterone gels  Rx s for current treatment options equal two thirds topical gel testosterone and one third intramuscular injections  and according to recent reports  U S  sales of testosterone replacement therapies exceeded  1 6 billion  in 2011  5 6 million Rx s  Studies have shown that gel patients do not achieve adequate absorption or therapeutic response  injection patients bear the cost and inconvenience of in office injections every two to four weeks Physicians surveyed believe self injection will improve patient compliance and deliver sufficient serum testosterone levels  according to the company The New VIBEX QS is particularly well suited for use with highly viscous drugs such as testosterone  Novel spring mechanism   up to a 1 ml capacity   highly compact device This combination drug device product is in pre clinical development  expected to go to market in 2015 2016 In early October  Antares engaged in a secondary offering at  4 00 to fund development of the above mentioned products    the company raised  47M in total  Antares now has an abundant reserve of over  70M in cash  so I would expect its Q4 2012 earnings call to show a profit from its royalty based revenue it primarily receives from Teva Pharma  TEVA  for Tev Tropin  Tjet  and reusable hGH    in which Antares receives strong margins on device sales  and mid to high single digit   royalty on overall product sales  Antares has two single shot disposable auto injectors  One is Epinephrine  N A  rights  and the other is an undisclosed product  U S rights  in which it receives margins on device sales along with mid to high single digit   royalty on overall product sales The chart above indicates that Antares has seen a double bottom bounce  The MACD and RSI are trending upwards  and with a little bit more volume  Antares could be seeing the  4 dollar range soon  In my opinion  investors and traders should look at both short and longer term fundamentals for Antares  especially the longer term ones for the company  My short term  one day to three months  target opinion for Antares is  4 before the end of the year  and near  5 by February of next year  My long term target opinion is  12 a share    three years  Disclosure  I am long BGMD  I wrote this

30630,252145,CSII,Even As Impatience Grows  Amarin Likely To See NCE Designation,opinion,As one of the most watched names in the biotech sector  it s difficult for the market to ignore any news about Amarin Corporation  AMRN  and their ultra refined  fish oil  product Vascepa  Although it s been referenced as a  fish oil pill  by a large number of sources  there s a little more to it  Vascepa is a  96  eicosapentaenoic acid  EPA  pill  which is manufactured in a specific process that has been patent protected by Amarin  This isn t your ordinary over the counter fish oil pill  although the FDA has been unsure as to whether or not it is a unique enough derivative of fish oil to be considered a  New Chemical Entity   or NCE   The controversy over the NCE decision has been a big factor in recent Wall Street bearishness over Amarin  on top of a reduction in the intense M A speculation that has surrounded the stock all year  It s apparent that many analysts were expecting some sort of partnership between Amarin and a larger pharmaceutical company for the marketing of Vascepa right after  or soon after  the FDA approval for the drug  Vascepa was approved on July 26th 2012  which means that the company hasn t officially announced a deal of any kind after almost three months  Analysts like Wedbush claim that the likelihood of a partnership or acquisition is diminishing as time goes on  although many AMRN investors remain focused on the market potential for Vascepa and the possibility that Amarin is being very stubborn with its pricing during any talks that may occur behind closed doors  Although the speculation over Amarin  and Vascepa  deal activity is mostly based on just rumor  at this point   there are a few things we can observe about the situation  According to company statements  we know that Amarin would definitely prefer to initiate a strategic partnership for Vascepa  or an outright sale of the company itself in the near future rather than an lone entry into the triglyceride lowering drug market  Entering the market alone would require Amarin to hire a competent sales team that could cut into competing market share quickly enough to justify the company s valuation  The hypertriglyceridemia  high cholesterol  drug market is currently dominated by GlaxoSmithKline s Lovaza  which generates roughly  1 billion in annual revenue  Lovaza capsures are also derived from fish oil  specifically the omega 3 fatty acids   but the key difference with Amarin s Vascepa has to do with cholesterol  Lovaza lowers triglyceride levels  but actually raises  bad cholesterol   DHA   or Docosahexaenoic acid  levels in patients  since Lovaza itself contains DHA  This is essentially a trade off between one negative and another in the world of cardiovascular health  and makes Lovaza an easy target for a less dangerous drug that can match its performance with triglyceride level reduction  In clinical trials  Vascepa was found just as capable at lowering triglyceride levels while demonstrating the ability to actually lower DHA bad cholesterol levels in the bloodstream  This not only makes Vascepa a superior option for doctors that have patients with high triglyceride levels  but presents the opportunity for Vascepa to be marketed as a bad cholesterol lowering drug  Possibilities for Vascepa to become a cholesterol drug too are being explored in phase III trials  called  REDUCE IT   which some Amarin investors are extremely optimistic about   The triglyceride related takeaway is that Vascepa s domination of Lovaza s current market share  due to Lovaza s flaws  should be as easy as shooting fish in a barrel  no pun intended   Updates on Vascepa s NCE status  other than Amarin s announcement of indecision by the FDA  have been nonexistent until last week  Last Thursday  October 18th    Dr  Marvin Goldenberg published a  that claimed that the FDA considers Vascepa a New Chemical Entity based on the fact that its exact composition  96  EPA and no DHA  unlike Lovaza  was never submitted to the FDA for NCE consideration  This is not an official decision  but you can clearly see from last Thursday s  October 18th  trading that this was the green light confirmation that many investors needed to buy shares of Amarin  If you look at the chart  you can see that AMRN gave back all its gains on October 19th  but judging by the extremely bearish activity we saw in the broader market that day we can infer that AMRN selling was not reflecting news that the NCE status was in jeopardy again  At this point Vascepa looks much more likely to see NCE designation  which guarantees five  instead of three  years of exclusivity once it hits the market and increases the attractiveness of Amarin as a buyout target  Trade accordingly ,2012-10-28,Myriad Equity,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/even-as-impatience-grows,-amarin-likely-to-see-nce-designation-141445",141445
30631,252146,CSII,Did Shares Of ISIS Finally Bottom Out ,opinion,Shares of Isis Pharmaceuticals  ISIS  are finally bottoming out after last week s drop  which began on October 16th in reaction to documents that outlined the topics that would be discussed at the advisory committee meeting  on October 18th  regarding the NDA of Isis  flagship product  The market certainly didn t like the idea that FDA is worried that ISIS s cardiovascular drug KYNAMRO  mipomersen  could bring up concerns about its safety profile   especially since there s reason to believe that the drug may increase the risk of cancer in patients KYNAMRO is a first in class antisense drug that lowers cholesterol  which acts through a very unique mechanism that hasn t been targeted before within the cardiovascular drug space  According to company statements  KYNAMRO has met the primary  secondary  and tertiary endpoints in four clinical trials in the treatment of high cholesterol levels  and offers an alternative method for cardiologists to target the huge pool of high cholesterol patients  The problem is that KYNAMRO has a few intrinsic flaws that may prevent it from being able to compete with the major drugs that have already taken over the cholesterol treatment space  The biggest cholesterol lowering drugs are known as  statins   which include the record breaking and mega blockbuster Lipitor  atorvastatin  and Crestor  rosuvastatin  KYNAMRO  unlike its statin competitors  doesn t come in pill form and actually requires injections  The drug is waiting on an NDA that was submitted back in May  which set a PDUFA action date of January 29  2013  The advisory committee meeting that was held on October 18th came to a final vote of 9 to 6 in favor of approval  although it s important to note that this is actually a weak victory for Isis  Although the majority of the panel did in fact recommend the drug  and while headlines imply that the FDA is favoring approval for KYNAMRO  I would have a hard time trusting the narrow margin of victory There is a lot of reason for the FDA to send a complete response letter  CRL  instead of an acceptance letter to Isis on the PDUFA date in 2013  Perhaps the most important factor is the existence of a large number of highly effective and well tolerated cholesterol treatments already in the market  Since the demand for cholesterol reducing medication has been met by a big selection of statins  and other classes of drugs  the FDA can essentially conclude that there really isn t an unmet demand for KYNAMRO s prospective users  The FDA can afford to be very cautious regarding KYNAMRO  which means that there will be a lot of emphasis on the drug s potential to induce tumor growth when it comes time to evaluate the NDA Also note that while the world marketing rights for KYNAMRO were already sold to Genzyme Sanofi in 2008  Isis can still benefit significantly from milestone payments  Isis received a sum of  25 million just from its NDA submission  and is set to receive more on an FDA approval  ISIS shareholders are clearly looking for an FDA approval for KYNAMRO at this point The inherent risks brought about by KYNAMRO were already known to investors prior to October 16th  when the FDA brought up concerns again  but they weren t considered nearly as big of a threat until this point  We knew that KYNAMRO causes elevated levels of certain enzymes in patients  livers  but the severity of the risk is quite ambiguous due to some other factors brought up by the panel  This includes the scrutiny that was placed on the KYNAMRO arm in the latest phase III trials  specifically on patients  livers Still  the FDA generally leans towards the side of caution  If the FDA ends up being cautious with Isis Genzyme s NDA submission for KYNAMRO  they will reject it ask Isis to perform additional safety studies on KYNAMRO that can specifically address the concerns brought up about liver toxicity and tumor development  So  don t be too shocked if we see a rejection on January 29th  If KYNAMRO actually does get approved  however  the market would be shocked and ISIS would likely see immediate 30  gains  and then some  ,2012-10-28,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/did-shares-of-isis-finally-bottom-out-141446,141446
30632,252147,CSII,Investigation Leaves ABIOMED Shareholders Uncertain And Vulnerable,opinion,A lot of uncertainty is currently priced into shares of the cardiovascular medical device company ABIOMED Inc   ABMD   which saw a 31 3  drop on November 1st in reaction to its second quarter earnings report  for fiscal year 2013  released on November 1st  2012  The company posted record earnings and double digit revenue growth relative to the numbers posted in Q2 2012  as well as some developments in its product portfolio  It wasn t disappointment in the financial data tor the operational hat caused the post earnings selloff though   it was the disclosure of an investigation by the US Attorney s Office for the District of Columbia regarding the marketing and labeling of their flagship Impella 2 5 device Investigations centered around pharmaceutical and medical device companies  flagship products are very frightening to investors  and it causes prolonged damage to share prices when considered serious enough  We saw something similar occur with Questcor  NASDAQ  QCOR  after an 8 K filing made on September 21st  which dropped shares an extra 20  after it had already suffered a massive selloff on Aetna s healthcare reimbursement policy  Their flagship product  H P  Acthar gel  was also being investigated for potentially illegal marketing and labeling practices which would artificially increase sales figures Impella has a medical device product line that falls into two major platforms   the Impella platform and the AB platform  Impella is a catheter based  percutaneous platform that includes the Impella 2 5 catheter introduced in June of 2008  which is small enough to reach the left ventricle of the heart through the femoral artery  The other Impella catheters  Impella 5 0 and Impella LD  were cleared in 2009 followed by an automated controller cleared in 2010  The AB platform is an artificial heart that allows for greater patient mobility  There is also the upcoming Symphony device which is intended to improve circulatory system function  although it has not been cleared by the FDA yet Impella platform revenue in the second quarter brought in a total of  32 8 million  representing a whopping 88  of the company s total sales revenue of  37 3 million  At a profit margin of 14 7   including tax expense   this brings total earnings to  5 5 million per quarter  The stock prices in a continuation of the double digit sales growth that Impella has been seeing since FDA clearance  although news of the investigation does make things more complicated for investors The seemingly permanent 30  drop in shares of ABIOMED equates to a rough discount of  230 million on the market capitalization of ABIOMED  which implies that the market is considering this to be a fair cost for the potential risks that ABIOMED faces with the litigation fees and possible lawsuits filed against them for improper marketing and labeling of Impella 2 5  Until the investigation is halted  or until it leads to additional action  I expect that the associated uncertainty will keep some pressure on ABIOMED due to the extreme sensitivity that the company s earnings and valuation have to Impella s performance in the medical device market ABIOMED is seeing general upward trend in short interest after a huge short covering rally that occurred in early February 2012 due to a stellar Q3 2012 earnings report  I would expect to see higher short interest in reaction to the Impella 2 5 investigation  which was disclosed after October 31st  the last time that NASDAQ released short interest   although it s not clear how long these positions will have to wait to hear more news about the district attorney s investigation  This is also true for investors and traders who are holding ABIOMED stock  Even if the company s financial data remains strong  the market will question the long term sales growth of the Impella system  the bulk of the company s valuation  so long as there is reason to believe that their marketing and labeling practices may have been illegal ,2012-11-15,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investigation-leaves-abiomed-shareholders-uncertain-and-vulnerable-143655,143655

30638,252153,CSII,Trading The Triglyceride Players,opinion,After soaring about 120  higher since the start of the year  shares of the Irish pharmaceutical company Amarin Corporation  AMRN  are now trading in anticipation of the PDUFA action date of July 26  2012  That s the date the FDA will either approve or reject the drug AMR101 for the treatment of high triglycerides  Although it is arguable whether or not FDA approval has already been priced into AMRN shares  we do know that July 26 will be a major event for the stock  A rejection is not generally expected  although  15  of shares are short  indicating a significant amount of money betting on a surprise rejection Takeover SpeculationAdding to the enthusiasm over the company is Amarin s patent protection on its novel AMR101 compound  which was granted a few weeks ago by the USPTO  shares have tacked on  30  gains since   The patent is not set to expire until 2030  This has fueled a new round of takeover speculation from many analysts and continues to keep the stock in the limelight as the AMR101 NDA decision draws closer Despite the likelihood of a successful launch and the huge prospects of the massive triglyceride market  Amarin has become a rather expensive stock for what it is  Sitting at a market cap of about  2 1 billion    and with a significant fraction  or more  of AMR101 s value already priced into the stock    many would say that new buyers have missed the boat    even if we see FDA approval Other PlayersThis should lead investors to other high potential plays in the triglyceride drug market  One notable example that has recently emerged is Neptune Technologies   Bioressources  which is a more obscure pick capable of tapping the same demographic in the nutraceutical industry  This is a company that is developing NKO   Neptune Krill Oil   which is very similar to AMR101  it s 95  EPA without DHA refined from fish oil   NKO contains both of the Omega 3 fatty acids known as EPA and DHA  docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid  Based on the company s claims  NKO has a few advantages against other similar compounds including its clinically proven effects on joint and brain function in addition to cardiovascular health and safety studies  Neptune has also released some good financial figures  In the last quarter of the company s fiscal 2012 year the company announced 15  year on year revenue growth and an astounding 136  improvement in net income  a total of  2 384 000 for the last four quarters  On top of NKO  Neptune owned pharmaceutical company Acasti is developing a compound known as CaPre for hypertriglyceridemia  which is in two phase 2 trials  The TRIFECTA study is the one to watch  since it was designed to focus exclusively on CaPre with regards to its effects in reducing triglycerides in blood plasma  For the most part  we are not worried about the safety data    it s about the efficacy and the supposed benefits it has on cholesterol levels So Called  Trifecta  DrugThe study was designed with three arms  two doses of CaPre versus a placebo  and has an estimated primary completion date of September 2012  What s most interesting to the market is that pre clinical studies implied that the drug induces lower LDL cholesterol levels  the bad cholesterol  and increases in HDL  the good one  on top of the intended reduction of triglycerides  No drug on the market has this  trifecta  of therapeutic benefit Time will tell whether or not CaPre can produce phase 2 studies that demonstrate the trifecta of therapeutic benefit  but until then we may see investors buying into Neptune simply due to its sales growth  It can also serve as a sort of substitute for Amarin s stock  which has become a bit expensive As of now  analysts are extremely bullish on Neptune  with some shooting as high as  10 30 share  a call by Roth Capital Partners   I expect the stock to rally until at least September 2012 based on its general undervaluation alone   6 share seems attainable if the broader market doesn t induce downward pressure in the biopharmaceutical sector When September does roll around  TRIFECTA data could induce significant rallying on CaPre related hype if the cholesterol side effect does show up again  This is one way that NEPT can reach the lofty price targets set by optimistic analysts  The other would be through more growth in the  nutraceutical  markets No matter how you slice it  NEPT looks like a strong buy and hold candidate that is extremely attractive on the meaningless dips  I m keeping the stock on my watchlist ,2012-07-12,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trading-the-triglyceride-players-129427,129427

science focused on the treatment of cardiovascular disease  The Company s product candidate is AMR101  an ultra pure omega 3 fatty acid  It is developing AMR101 for the treatment of patients with high

rumors and a huge FDA approval meeting  PDUFA  is due out July 26th  The vol is at a 2 year high  at least  I last wrote about AMRN on 4 25 2012  so  2 5 months ago   The stock was trading  10 05 and

Friday and with the impending FDA decision  100  vol and a  10 stock are no longer the story    it s a  15 stock with 130  vol that we re lookin  at now  You can access the original post in April on AMRN here Moving on to yesterday s action  let s start with the news  First  the takeover spec  then the FDA ruling  Then we can look at how the vol reflects both of these phenomena in distinctly different ways  Very  very cool News7 5 2012Rumor activity resumed yesterday on a soft note   Chatter circulated that AstraZeneca  AZN  could be interested in Amarin  AMRN  While many rumors circulate during the day  and the validity of the source of these rumors can be questionable  the speculation may increase volatility in the near term     Source  Provided by Briefing com   7 9 2012Shares  of AMRN  have been trading between  5 99 and  15 60 during the past 52 weeks  and are poised to trade higher as the company draws closer to an FDA approval decision for its prescription fish oil AMR101 on July 26th  2012  which I believe the FDA will approve AMR101 is an investigational ultra pure omega 3 fatty acid in a capsule  comprising not less than 96  icosapent ethyl  ethyl EPA  in a capsule  Amarin is developing AMR101 for the potential treatment of patients with very high triglyceride levels and high triglyceride levels  or hypertriglyceridemia  Triglycerides are fats in the blood

IV30    red vs HV20    blue vs HV180    pink  On the stock side  we can see how AMRN climbed abruptly in mid late Mar on takeover spec  That s what the first blog post focused on  At its peak  the stock popped  70  from that news  from   7 to   12   The stock came back down and settled at  10  ish   However  starting in late May  the stock has found legs to the upside again and is now trading above  15 On the vol side  we can see how the implied popped abruptly to triple digits in mid late Mar  see first blog for details  off of the takeover rumors  but then settled to the mid 70 s  But  since 6 20 2012  the IV30  has steadily but substantially increased from 63 98  to now over 133   That s a 108  rise in vol as the stock has risen 20  over the last three weeks  As I noted at the top of the article  the level of the implied now is well into new 2 year high territory  the prior high was 126   ish   Let s turn to the Skew Tab and we ll be able to see both the impact of the takeover rumors and the PDUFA date   decision We can see that Aug vol is well elevated to Sep  on all strikes  and Jul  for the ATM   In fact  the ATM vol in Jul is the lowest of the front three expiries  This elevated vol in Aug is a reflection of the risk inherent in the FDA decision  That vol will rise as we get closer tot he PDUFA date as long as  1  no news is broken early and  2  the PDUFA date remains in the Aug cycle  no delays  We can also see the incredible vol in the upside calls in Jul  In fact  the vol is at such a fevered pitch in the Jul OTM calls that they surpass the vol in Aug which has the PDUFA date  It s that reverse skew that reflects the risk of the takeover So  in English  what we see are two distinct vol phenomena    the risk of the FDA decision and the risk  potential  of the takeover  It s fascinating to watch the takeover spec given the fact that this firm has  0 in revenue yet is worth  2 billion in market cap  One might say that the FDA decision is a  big  one for AMRN   Finally  let s turn to the Options Tab  for completeness Across the top we can see the monthly vols are priced to 102 67   147 67  and 120 43  respectively for Jul  Aug and Sep  Keep in mind that Aug vol comprises of a month worth of days  or whatever   We re looking at a bunch of  normal  vol days  and one  huge  vol day  the PDUFA ruling   As we move through the  normal  days in Aug and approach the singular  huge  vol  the overall level of Aug vol will rise substantially  A very rough back of the envelope calculation shows me that the vol on the day of the FDA decision is priced at  500   that s assuming 100  vol is  normal    That doesn t mean Aug vol goes to 500   But you already knew that    right    Disclosure  This is trade analysis  not a

30698,252213,CSII,This Great Performing Stock Just Got A Lot Better,opinion,Not long after I wrote about this big health care firm   this stock began a nice hot streak  It s now up 31  in the past 12 months  compared with a 14  gain for the S P 500 during the same time  This is undoubtedly a great performing stock  But when I first suggested investing in this company  currently best known for its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira  I wasn t thinking much about what the stock might do in the next year or two  What I liked about it then  as I still do now  is how well it s likely to perform over a much longer time span    So even though the stock s already up 31   I think it has plenty more room to grow  In fact  I think it could easily rise another 50  during the next three to five years  I m talking about Abbott Laboratories  NYSE  ABT   I referred to Abbott Labs as a health care company instead of a pharmaceutical manufacturer  because it s more than just a drug maker    even though many investors probably only see it that way  Actually  Abbott Labs has so many irons in the fire that last November it announced it would split into two separate public companies  by the end of 2012  The plan is for the medical products segment to retain the Abbott Labs name  while the newly created research based pharmaceutical segment will be spun off to existing Abbott Labs shareholders  Both stocks will be publicly traded  Analysts project the medical products division to have  23 billion in sales  while the newly formed drug company should initially have  18 billion in annual sales  Abbott will be in charge of the company s medical devices  which include blood analyzers and other devices for use by diabetics  such as blood glucose meters  It will also make Abbott s line of nutritional products  such as PediaSure formula for children and Ensure nutritional drinks for older adults  It also has a new stent    a device that holds open blocked coronary blood vessels  The stent is already available in Europe and Japan and should soon be approved for use in the United States  The new pharmaceuticals company will own several patent protected blockbuster drugs    aside from Humira  which I mentioned earlier    including the HIV AIDS treatment Kaletra  and the cardiovascular medications Tricor and Trilipix  Together  these four medications currently account for roughly  11 billion in annual revenue  with Humira alone kicking in  8 billion   This accounts for almost 30  of the  39 billion in total revenue Abbott Labs generated in the past year  Splitting into two companies makes good strategic sense  While Abbott Labs has a very long history of success  it was founded in 1888   the two divisions that currently make up the company have evolved along very different lines  The pharmaceutical segment  while profitable  is more mature  domestically focused and noticeably slower growing  Indeed  management projects 3  4  annual growth in sales  at most  in the coming years  The medical device business  on the other hand  is poised for faster growth because of greater exposure to emerging markets like China and India  where demand for medical devices is growing 20  annually  compared with a only a 4  6  growth rate in the U S  and Europe  Once the split is complete  investors will have a choice   They can either own a dependable  slower growing drug stock that will likely pay a nice dividend  thanks to dependable cash flow  or a medical device health care stock with more prospects for growth  but a lower dividend  Risks to Consider  Though it has diversified  Abbott Labs still counts heavily on current blockbuster drugs for revenue  Keep in mind the danger of increased competition for Humira  but don t worry too much about it   Actemra  a newer drug developed by Roche  was recently shown in a study to be more effective for treating rheumatoid arthritis  It also goes off patent in the U S  in 2016 and Europe in 2018  The drug should still do well in the meantime  Besides  the new pharmaceuticals company could be bought out long before Humira loses patent protection  perhaps even right away The drug unit is adapting by developing new drugs with blockbuster potential  including several hepatitis C medications and a kidney disease drug  all of which have been performing well in clinical trials  Plus  new uses for Humira have been identified in the treatment of psoriasis and an intestinal condition called Crohn s disease  which should further propel global sales ,2012-03-22,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-great-performing-stock-just-got-a-lot-better-117853,117853

healthcare industry represents a significant opportunity for long term growth thanks to an aging population  However  there are also many challenges facing the industry due to high cost and regulatory scrutiny  Nevertheless  we believe the five candidates listed in this article are well positioned to be part of the healthcare solution rather than part of the problem  Although these are not your traditional healthcare companies  we do believe that they are well positioned to prosper during the forthcoming healthcare environment and challenges Therefore  we believe these companies possess the opportunity for above average long term growth of both capital and dividend income  As you review each company  note that several have just begun a dividend policy  Therefore  they do not possess long histories of dividend excellence that many dividend growth investors covet  On the other hand  due to their expected above average growth and above average market yields we believe that they do offer the potential for strong total returns  On the other hand  we believe their potential for an increase in dividend income stream is excellent as well  As always  we recommend you conduct your own

30762,252277,CSII,GNC  Health Products  Healthy Stock,opinion,The Overview   GNC Holdings Inc   NYSE    has seen its stock soar 37 3  YTD  significantly buoyed by its positive earnings for the first quarter of 2012  On April 25  GNC reported EPS of  0 60  beating estimates by  0 08  it also reported revenue of  624M  which beat analyst estimates by  38M and constituted a 23  increase YOY  Moreover  same store sales increased 15 8  in domestic company owned stores  representing the Company s 27th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth    However  GNC has not been without its share of negative developments  Recently  it has been adversely affected by the FDA s crackdown on supplements with the stimulant DMAA  which are bestsellers among fitness enthusiasts  DMAA is an ingredient which the FDA claims could lead to cardiovascular and blood pressure complications  GNC is currently facing a lawsuit concerning a DMAA based product and has recently seen the U S  military pull several DMAA based products from the GNC stores situated on military bases  Despite the controversy surrounding DMAA  GNC continues to sell DMAA based products     The Niche   GNC is a specialty retailer of health and wellness products that sells products made under its GNC proprietary brand as well as under third party brands  GNC products range from vitamins  minerals  and herbal supplement products to sports nutrition and diet products     One of the biggest appeals of GNC right now is its proprietary brand business  This business not only differentiates GNC from its competitors  but it also helps promote brand loyalty among customers who often cannot find the same products elsewhere in other vitamin health retailers  Moreover  GNC s proprietary brand business is extremely profitable  as GNC produces its own products and then sells them with much higher profit margins than simply selling third party brands  Thus  an extremely positive development in GNC s first quarter report was its announcement that sales from proprietary GNC brands accounted for nearly 60  of total sales  GNC President and CEO Joe Fortunato notes that the increase in proprietary sales  will increase our margins   One significant product driving this increase in proprietary sales is the Total Lean brand  which has found huge success in the weight management marketplace     Moreover  GNC has also distinguished itself from other competitors by also emphasizing the online experience  In its first quarter of 2012  GNC saw a 34 1  growth in sales from GNC com as the website remains a hit with a large segment of GNC s consumers  GNC is also aggressively cementing and expanding its presence online  on August 31  2011  GNC acquired LuckyVitamin com  a discount vitamin site  GNC s development of its online business is crucial because  as shown by the growth of such e commerce companies as Amazon com and eBay  more and more consumers depend on online transactions instead of visiting brick and mortar shops     GNC is broadening its presence through partnerships with other organizations and people as well  One of its most significant partnerships is with major drug store Rite Aid Corporation  NYSE     This strategic alliance  formed in 1999  has resulted in the creation of more than 2 125 GNC  store within a store  locations inside Rite Aid establishments as well as a line of vitamins and nutritional supplements called PharmAssure   More recently  in April 2012  GNC announced a partnership with Mark Wahlberg to develop  market  and sell a nutritional supplement line named MARKED  In May 2012  GNC became the presenting sponsor and exclusive sports nutrition provider to the 2012 ESPNHS Games  These partnerships and strategic alliances could prove to be extremely beneficial for GNC in the long run  not only increasing its presence in terms of store locations but also in terms of generating publicity    In terms of its niche in the stock market right now  GNC is currently positioned as a very favorable play on not only the health of the company  but the robustness of the vitamin sector  In fact  at its current PE of 23  GNC is more attractive than its competitor Vitamin Shoppe Inc   NYSE     which has a PE of 29 6  On May 17  Deutsche Bank actually downgraded Vitamin Shoppe to a Hold from Buy  one of the reasons was their belief that Vitamin Shoppe was trading at a premium multiple to GNC  a development which Deutsche Bank believed was unjustified    The Results   GNC is currently firing on all cylinders in terms of financial performance  Its EPS increased 82  YOY from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012  Moreover  in its last three quarters  GNC has reported an average EPS growth of 84   Estimate for the current quarter are strong and the consensus estimate is that GNC will report an EPS that constitutes a 33  YOY increase  From a broader perspective  GNC is expected to report an annual EPS increase of 38 41   which  if fulfilled  would mark the fifth consecutive year of annual EPS growth for GNC  In terms of profitability  GNC has a solid annual ROE of 20 1  and an annual Pre Tax Margin of 12 2   a bit on the low side     A not so stellar component of GNC s financials is its 3 Year Sales Growth Rate  which comes in at a paltry 9   However  sales seem to have picked up as of late  last quarter  GNC reported a 23  increase in sales YOY  Joe Fortunato has stated that sales from new products have exceeded historical rates  while cross selling has also increased  40  of customers that bought sports nutrition products also bought vitamins last quarter     The Verdict   Overall  GNC has a lot of positive factors going for it and its stock has significant upside potential  As for the recent DMAA controversy  JPMorgan analysts recently pointed out that DMAA only makes up only a mid single digit percentage of GNC sales and called the recent weakness in GNC stock a  buying opportunity   GNC has also experienced 3 consecutive quarters of increasing fund ownership and saw a 26  increase in fund ownership in its first quarter of 2012  I heavily recommend that prospective investors look more into GNC s operations and formulate their own decisions ,2012-05-26,George Liu,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/gnc:-health-products,-healthy-stock-124403",124403

30765,252280,CSII,Closer Look  Furiex s Big Bounce,opinion,After a total nose dive following the FDA s rejection of the alogliptin and fixed dose combination therapy alogliptin pioglitazone NDA that was filed by partner Takeda Pharmaceuticals  Furiex Pharmaceuticals  FURX  has recovered almost all its lost ground  I last covered Furiex mid April  and pointed out the importance of the FDA decision on alogliptin  The rejection came as a surprise to me due to the drugs  success in Japan It was probably a shocking event to Takeda and Furiex shareholders too  since the alogliptin products are currently being marketed successfully in Japan under the trade names NESINA  and LIOVEL   This rejection came despite a significant amount of data supporting the drug s safety like the recently acquired interim data of a cardiovascular outcomes trial  Still  Furiex and Takeda believe that alogliptin will not have any major problems being brought to the US drug market according to the company s statements While the complete response letter from the FDA regarding alogliptin and the fixed dose combination alogliptin and pioglitazone was disappointing  the alogliptin program remains on track in the other global markets  and we remain optimistic Takeda will be able to address the agency s requests    Fred Eshelman in the company s Q1 2012 press releaseIt s also worth noting that Mr  Eshelman has been a massive buyer of FURX stock  with over 1 4th of total shares  which are now worth almost  60 million  Alogliptin is a DPP 4 inhibitor that will be marketed as a type 2 diabetes treatment alongside standard recommendations of improved diet and exercise  Since the prevalence of diabetes in the United States is so extreme  with roughly 25 8 million  or 8 3  of the population according to CDC estimates   it is absolutely essential that Takeda and Furiex market their drug in the United States to realize the full sales potential of alogliptin The market realizes this too  which is why price action of FURX has been so focused on recent press releases  Even with the quickly expanding royalty income that Furiex is receiving from Takeda s marketing in Japan  the company is at an operating loss of roughly  9 5 million per quarter  A continuation of this trend would wipe out the remainder of the company s cash and short term investments  although the company has recently taken measures to bolster their balance sheet A big reason why investors have been able to shake off the alogliptin rejection in April is due to Furiex s newly acquired rights to the premature ejaculation drug Priligy  On May 14th it was announced that Eli Lilly subsidiary Janssen  LLY  as well as Johnson   Johnson s ALZA  JNJ  transferred worldwide commercialization rights to Furiex  In an effort to raise money immediately  Furiex turned around and sold commercialization rights to most lucrative territory outside of the United States for  15 million and  60 million in other potential milestone payments  Although Priligy is the only oral   on demand  premature ejaculation drug on the market now  the market seems to think that Furiex made a smart move given the financial stress induced by alogliptin s slow progress with the FDA But ultimately  it seems that Takeda will not fail to receive an NDA submission to the FDA  even if it takes multiple tries   This is another reason why investors have been able to shake off the NDA rejection in April  On top of fresh data developments in its clinical studies  Takeda will now be able to point to the acceptance of alogliptin s MAA  marketing authorization application  by the EMA  European Medicines Agency  as well as alogliptin combined with pioglitazone and metformin On a side note  the acceptance of alogliptin by the EMA triggered a  10 million milestone payment from Takeda to Furiex  which should provide a larger cushion as Furiex waits for a substantial source of revenue  Unfortunately  all of the easy money was already made following alogliptin s FDA rejection in April  and we need an FDA approval before we can expect real revenue for Furiex  especially since the company sold the rights to a lot of the territory that Priligy could have sold in   Furiex is worth buying on the big dips due to the raw prospects of alogliptin  although it might be a painful wait for actual sales revenue ,2012-07-10,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/closer-look:-furiex’s-big-bounce-129047,129047
