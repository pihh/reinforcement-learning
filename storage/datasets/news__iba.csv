5890,227405,IBA,Mexican Reforms Spawn Powerful Economic Force,opinion,"Mexico gets no respect as an  

To some extent  though  that s justified  Even under the conservative governments of 2000 to 2012  the country achieved economic growth of less than 3   That s pretty dismal for a middle income country whose population is growing by 1 2  annually 

However  the government of Enrique Pe a Nieto  elected in December 2012  instilled reforms that now seem to be taking effect 

With a business friendly government  decreasing obstructions to markets in its institutional structure  and excellent free trade treaties  Mexico may be set to surprise us on the upside 

A History of Not so Free Markets

Mexico hasn t really been a free market country since the glory days of Porfirio D az  1876 to 1911   Indeed  the Mexican Revolution that followed D az was socialist inspired and bitterly opposed to the wealthy elite who had prospered in previous decades 

Meanwhile  the Institutional Revolutionary Party  PRI  governments of 1929 to 2000 nationalized the oil industry and imposed a huge mass of conflicting regulations on the economy  In 1981  a Mexican CEO  for whom I did a bond issue  said to me   This economy is a triumph of Joan Robinson economics  

Robinson  a Cambridge left socialist economist  1903 83   had recommended that the state make the main economic decisions   including setting prices  1981 Mexico represented her theories  but the economic collapse of the following year showed how badly they worked in practice 

Afterward  there was a partial liberalization under the PRI governments of 1982 to 2000  although it was largely dominated by crony capitalism  A famous example is the  privatization  of the telephone monopoly Telmex to Carlos Slim  who became the world s richest man from its profits 

Finally  reform was expected when the conservative opposition PAN candidates won the 2000 and 2006 elections   but it never happened  Economic stagnation continued despite access to the U S  market following the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   and productivity performance was especially poor  It grew just 0 3  per annum in 2007 to 2014  according to The Conference Board s Total Economy Database 

Changing Fortunes

Today  though  all of this appears to be changing 

In addition to opening up the telephone business  Pe a Nieto has made at least modest reforms to Mexico s dreadful  union dominated education system 

He also opened Mexican oil leases to foreign bidders  which had previously been banned by the Mexican Expropriation of Foreign Oil in 1938  Of course  in a fitting example of Murphy s Law  bidding has been permitted just as oil prices have dropped 

Indeed  the national oil company  Pemex  made a record loss of  6 4 billion in the first quarter  with production down 7 7  from the previous year  continuing a 10 year record of decline  And  since Mexico s budget relies heavily on revenue from Pemex  the budget balance has been thrown for a loop 

Still  Mexico s overall prospects for 2015 to 2016 look considerably improved  with the International Monetary Fund forecasting average growth of 3 2   Meanwhile  the projected balance of payments deficit is modest at 2 3  of GDP   easily financeable even if a credit crunch occurs 

Most importantly  the long term favorable factors remain  For one thing  Mexico has free trade agreements with a whopping 44 countries  That s four times as many as Brazil  according to the Financial Times 

So  if you d like to take advantage of this unloved nation  here are a few ideas for how to invest in Mexico 

First is the iShares MSCI Mexico Capped  ARCA EWW   a  1 9 billion ETF that s trading at 18x earnings and yielding 1 3   Because it s linked to the MSCI Index  EWW gives you a broad spread of Mexican holdings  And since it s capped  it doesn t overweight you in the big cap America Movil  MX AMXA   which is controlled by Carlos Slim  Finally  it boasts an affordable expense ratio of just 0 48  

A particular favorite of mine is Industrias Bachoco  NYSE IBA   a poultry farming combine based in Guanajuato province  Because of NAFTA  Bachoco has access to the U S  market  where it makes about one third of its sales  It also has the advantage of considerably lower labor costs than competitors  such as Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   in a labor intensive business  IBA is currently trading at a forward P E of a mere 10 5x and has a decent dividend yield of 2 1  

Lastly  Grupo Simec  S A B  De C V   AMEX SIM  is a specialty steel manufacturer based in Guadalajara  Like IBA  SIM is reasonably priced  trading at 11 4x forecast 2015 earnings  although it doesn t pay a dividend  Encouragingly  the company s first quarter net income was up 35  from the previous year

5893,227408,IBA,5 Agriculture Stocks To Survive US China Trade War Qualms,opinion,The equity universe is rife with apprehensions regarding the possibility of a full blown trade war between the United States and China  Though the hopes of conflict resolution propelled the benchmarks north on Monday  the final outcome of the scenario still remains indiscernible In fact  China has taken an aggressive stance against Trump s  60 billion tariff implementation  The strong retaliatory methods that China wants to adopt include levying  3 billion tariffs on fruits  nuts  pork and other agricultural products imported from the United States The ripple effect of these signaled trade restrictions to the prime export market of agricultural products were evident from the anxieties among the American farmers Amid such pressing concerns  we have spotted five U S  agricultural stocks which are likely to remain safe investment bets going forward Two Prime Economies at WarPresident Trump s attempt to trim  100 billion trade discrepancy by ordering punitive tariffs on about  60 billion worth of Chinese imports to the United States elevated tensions last week  However  Beijing s reciprocation of the act with a plan to target  3 billion U S  imports on Mar 23  signals its intention to continue this uneasy trade warBoth the superpowers are not conceding ground over trade but at the same time making attempts to prevent the situation spiraling beyond reach In fact  the U S  administration has repeatedly implored for a more open Chinese economy for its businesses  In sync with this  China is asked to do away with its rules that force American companies to hand over treasured intellectual property in order to operate in the Chinese markets  Moreover  Beijing has also been requested to lower tariffs on U S  automobiles  augment spending on U S  semiconductor and widen U S  access to Chinese financial sector Nevertheless  Liu He  a trusted advisor to Chinese president  has criticized the U S  allegations of Chinese intellectual property theft  noting that the country  has the capability to safeguard its national interest  Eventually  Trump might not get the desired dip in the annual trade deficit as Beijing is unlikely to make any such effort  Notably  it is doubtful that China will bring about changes in its intellectual property based trade rule  as it is regarded as  a key element  for its economic development U S  Agriculture  Clear   Obvious TargetExports have altered the U S  farm economy in the recent decades  as investments on massive livestock operations  high yield seeds and more resourceful logistics has made American farmers the prime suppler of foodstuff globally However  China is the biggest export market of U S  agriculture products  Soybean shipments to China was more than a third of the aggregate U S  yield in 2017  China is the largest meat consumer in the world and it imported nearly 309 000 metric tons of pork from the United States in 2017  Beijing is also regarded as the second best export market for U S  cotton after Vietnam   American agriculture is one industry that stands to suffer the most in the ongoing U S  China trade war Under the  3 billion proposed tariff plan  China would be imposing 15  tariff on 120 product lines of U S  imports valuing roughly  1 billion  counting products like wine  fruit  steep pipes  and ethanol  Moreover  a second group of eight categories worth  2 billion  including pork and recycled aluminum  would be liable to a 25  tariff Lean hog future prices had dipped over 4  on Friday on fears of 25  tariff over U S  pork by China  News of fresh tariff program has spread anxiety across the U S  farm belt  The U S  Department of Agriculture predicts that its farm income this year will slide to the lowest level since 2006 Endurance Stocks Amid the Trade WarWe have zeroed in on five bullish U S  agriculture stocks that are likely to withstand the volatile times These companies have a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   recorded a positive average earnings surprise in the last four quarters and performed better than the industry over the last three months  Notably  the Zacks

5904,227419,IBA,Classic  The Long And Short Of Trend Investing,opinion,The following was published by RealMoney on 4 26 2006  As with all of these  classic  articles  I republish them because they aren t available at RealMoney any more  They changed their system for links  and so articles and comments that I put a lot of work into have disappeared   Investing If you believe in the trend but prices are high  take a half position   Despite U S  automakers  woes  cars will be built by someone  this makes stronger parts suppliers a good play   Global economic development means more demand for chicken One of the most important things to understand with investment ideas is what time period they are for  Sometimes a given asset can take different directions over the short  intermediate and long terms Imagine for a moment that you buy the thesis that a large portion of the world is joining the capitalist economy  and that this will lead many more people and businesses in developing countries to demand more goods consistent with what we view as a middle class lifestyle  That s a secular trend that will play out over many years  It can be a guiding theme that can help organize investment ideas over the long term Now  say that your interpretation of that secular trend implies higher worldwide demand for foodstuffs  metals  timber and energy  However  when you look at the valuations of some of the companies affected by the trend  they appear to be too high  and profit margins are above historical norms   Valuations are in fact reasonable for many companies in these sectors  but play along with me for a moment  You are faced with a problem  then  You think the secular trend is valid  but that much of the story is presently anticipated by current valuations  What to do  One technique that I have used in situations like this is to buy half of what I would if valuations were reasonable  which occasionally aggravates my boss  who is an all or nothing kind of guy  If the stocks go down  I would come up to a full position  If the market gets crazier and valuations rise  I would punt out the smaller position for a gain  If the market muddles somewhat trendlessly  I would buy and sell using my rebalancing discipline  which will clip a couple of extra percentage points over time There are alternatives  though  You could buy a full position  but then you are committing to the stock for the long run on the idea that the secular trend will dominate over valuations  You d better be right  because with higher valuations than normal  being wrong has a greater cost You also could do nothing  After all  valuations are extended  and you won t just pay anything for a stock  This strategy presumes an interruption in the general trend will be coming  That may or may not happen  high valuations often get higher for stocks in a winning thesis  Paying up for a good idea is often a good strategy  but the tradeoff between valuation and the secular trend is a difficult balancing act Part of working that tradeoff comes with experience  but I would argue that it also requires humility   the market always finds a new way to make a fool out of you  Always consider what could go wrong  Conservatism means that you will always stay in the game  and staying in the game for a long time is the secret to compounding returns The Internet BubbleLet me give you a few real world examples  Think of the Internet bubble  The long term prognosis that the Internet would be big was correct  in hindsight   but valuations were screaming  Don t play here   and many concepts were quite marginal from a cash flow standpoint  That said  the technicals were screaming   Momentum  baby  Time to play  My solution was to sit it out  I figured that  eventually  the cheap financing would run out and the market trend would shift  The problem was  it lasted two years longer than I anticipated Maybe I left something on the table  I could have played with smaller position sizes  or played with a mental  stop order  in the back of my mind  That said  it didn t fit my personality  and I didn t feel that I could evaluate who the survivors would be  so my optimal decision was to sit it out   I didn t short it because the momentum was too great  Never argue with a liquidity wave  Industries in Secular Decline What if you are looking at an industry in secular decline  such as the photo film business  think of how Kodak  EK NYSE  has fumbled  or  worse  Polaroid   fixed wire phone service companies  or the newspapers  All of these are being displaced by new technologies   Verizon  VZ NYSE  looks cheap and has a nice dividend  Is it a candidate to buy  This is an example of Warren Buffett s concept of  cigar butt  investing  Someone may have tossed it on the ground  but you can still get a few good puffs out of it  The company has limited growth potential unless a radical new strategy gets introduced  and that could be costly  or even fail  I had better get this company extremely cheap to compensate for potentially falling earnings at some point in the future  Even a wasting trust has a proper price  so if I can get it at a level that reflects a 15  annualized return  that could be a great investment  One nice thing about declining industries is that there usually isn t a lot of direct competition   Here s one more example  auto parts  I own Johnson Controls  JCI NYSE  and Magna International  MGA NYSE    two companies with strong balance sheets that are picking up market share against weaker competitors  Automobiles are going to be built  even ifGM and Ford aren t going to be building as many of them   This is one part of the auto sector where you can have moderate growth  and the stronger suppliers can do far better than the average  I still want to buy them cheap  but I can afford to pay a little more for quality in markets where quality is scarce  In this case  lower quality companies could be cheaper  but they aren t the ones to buy when an industry is under stress   Playing Chicken As the developing world grows  so will demand for animal protein  To me  that means chicken   Valuations are favorable here  because many investors are scared about avian flu  Whole flocks of birds might have to be culled if even a few get sick  That said  large North American poultry producers isolate their birds from wild birds  and even from humans who have the flu   The risk is overstated  and once the pandemic is over  valuations will rise   Some people are mistakenly avoiding chicken  even though there is no chance of getting avian flu if the chicken is properly cooked   I own Gold Kist  GKIS Nasdaq  and Industrias Bachoco SA IBA NYSE    but am considering whether I shouldn t increase my exposure and add Pilgrim s Pride  PPC NYSE    or Sanderson Farms  SAFM Nasdaq   Tyson  TSN NYSE  is too diversified  and I m not crazy about the management  Full disclosure in 2013  I am still long Industrias Bachoco SA  IBA    what a great unknown company ,2013-04-26,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/classic:-the-long-and-short-of-trend-investing-164556,164556
5905,227420,IBA,China Tariffs Incite Fear In Trump Heartland  Stocks In Focus ,opinion,Trump s attempt to trim the  100 billion trade deficit with China has sent shock waves across the equity universe  landing the American heartland in murky waters Beijing has taken an aggressive stance by slapping up to 25  tariffs over  3 billion U S  imports in response to the recent steel and aluminum import duties announced by Trump on Mar 23 Either by chance or by design  China s retaliatory tariffs target the specialty agricultural products grown by the rural communities that had backed Trump s victory in the 2016 presidential elections   Republican supporting states like Iowa and Illinois  as well as the remaining nation s bread basket will be in trouble soon if agricultural exports to the key overseas market tumble   Trump stated that trade disputes are  good  and  easy to win   while the consensus view of economists believe that  all parties lose  The ripple effect of these trade restrictions might hit the U S  agricultural business  as well as Trump s supporting force in November mid term elections Beijing Hostile Over Political   Retaliatory CausesChina has often levied tariffs on nations for retaliatory and political interests Last year  South Korea was targeted on account of Seoul s choice to host the U S  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system  which Beijing deemed to be an insult  In sync with this  the South Korean economy downsized  6 8 billion  on grounds of a tourism boycott from China Also  earlier in 2008  Beijing s nationalists had urged a prohibition against the French supermarket chain   Carrefour  PA CARR  Group   after Tibetan liberation supporters  advocates objected the Olympic torch s course through Paris China had also barred banana imports from Philippines due to its territorial disagreements with the latter Trump Heartland in Murky WatersAmerican trade supporters have cautioned that Beijing s tit for tat tariffs will impact large volumes of U S  agricultural exports grown in the heartland states which had voted for Trump China has levied tariffs up to 25  on 128 American goods  majorly including luxury agricultural products such as nuts  dried fruits and ginseng  Other products like pork  scrap aluminum and specialized steel products have also been included in this list A 25  charge over pork will heavily weigh over Iowa  producing nearly one third of the aggregate U S  pork  This mid western American state had witnessed strong backing for Republicans in 2016 Furthermore  almond  nuts  and other dry fruits hit by the tariffs imposed by China are the staple products of California s Central Valley  Despite California supporting Democrats  farmers of Central Valley had voted for Trump   The U S  Department of Agriculture predicts that its farm income this year will slide to the lowest level  since 2006 Now  it remains to be seen if this downtrend will also impact the President s support for the upcoming mid term elections this November American Food Industry at StakeAmerican agriculture is one industry that stands to suffer the most in the ongoing U S  China trade war Exports have altered the U S  farm economy in recent decades  as investments on massive livestock operations  high yield seeds and more resourceful logistics have made American farmers the prime supplier of food stuff globally Nevertheless  China is the biggest export market of U S  agriculture products  Soybean shipments to the nation accounted for more than a third of the aggregate U S  yield in 2017  This East Asian nation is the largest meat consumer in the world and imported nearly 309 000 metric tons of pork from the United States last year  Beijing is also regarded as the second best export market for U S  cotton  after Vietnam   However  now it is feared that the recently levied  3 billion tariffs will drag down revenues and profitability of the U S  agricultural companies   Notably  per media reports  domestic demand for meat based products has been gradually declining in the United States  At this stage  trade restrictions in the prime overseas market will possibly become the biggest setback for the American meat product companies Stocks in Focus  We have zeroed in on four U S  agricultural stocks that investors might want to recall in their watch list  These stocks currently carry a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold   and have performed better than the  over the past  year These stocks seem to be promising investment bets at the moment

5929,227444,IBA,Is Industrias Bachoco  IBA  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Industrias Bachoco  S A B  de CV   NYSE IBA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Industrias Bachoco has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 27  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 55  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Industrias Bachoco s current PE ratio noticeably above its midpoint  which is 11 62  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Industrias Bachoco Holdings has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 13  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Industrias Bachoco s stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Industrias Bachoco has a P S ratio of about 0 81  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Industrias Bachoco currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes IBA a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 38  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 9 34  Clearly  IBA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Industrias Bachoco might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of B  This gives IBA a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and none lower  while the full year estimate has seen one downward and no upward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 24  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen 4 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Industrias Bachoco  S A  de C V  Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineIndustrias Bachoco is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 7  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Breakout Biotech Stocks with Triple Digit Profit Potential The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond  775 billion by
