14306,235821,SITC,Retail Isn t Dead  It s Growing And Pays 6   Dividends,opinion,"Seems like you can t go a week without reading about the retail apocalypse 

I saw a recent headline that read   75 000 Retail Stores Will Close by 2026  

That may very well happen  But the idea that e commerce giants like Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and Walmart Inc  NYSE WMT  will completely destroy brick and mortar retail is outrageous 

Sure  e commerce sales are growing quickly   about 5  every year  But 90  of US retail sales still happen in person 

Meanwhile  US retail sales have steadily grown 2 4  annually since 2009  And they re projected to grow 2  through 2024 

That s solid and stable growth 





Even better  the companies that rent property to brick and mortar retailers are making money hand over fist  And some pay dividend yields as high as 6    More on that in a moment  
Americans Still Like To Buy Clothes In Stores
There s no way around it  E commerce has crushed some retail sectors  Think electronics and media  That s why Circuit City and Blockbuster stores are a thing of the past 

But other areas of retail are flourishing 
Take apparel  for example  A recent survey showed that nearly 70  of Americans still buy clothes at brick and mortar stores 
Yes  in store apparel companies have lost some market share to e commerce companies  But overall  in store spending on clothes has been stable  as you can see in the chart below 
In fact  2018 was the strongest year for in store apparel spending on record 




Groceries are another stable area of brick and mortar retail 

I expect online groceries to go mainstream in the next five years  But right now Americans only buy 1  of their groceries online 
That figure is expected to grow to 5  by 2024  But that still means Americans will buy 95  of their groceries in stores for the foreseeable future 
Spotting Opportunities Others MissI focus on safe and reliable dividend paying stocks 

I often find the best opportunities in industries other people ignore  Opportunities like a tobacco company with a 5  plus dividend yield 

A business development company with a 10  plus dividend yield 

And a gold streaming company that s up over 40  since I wrote about it 

Now I m doing the same thing with a special niche in brick and mortar retail 
The Best Way To Invest In RetailA lot of the buildings where traditional retailers operate are owned by special business entities called real estate investment trusts  or REITs 

REITs can own all kinds of properties   not just retail  But here s the main thing you should know about them  REITs have to pay out 90  of their income as dividends 
That means their dividends are often huge 
Across the board  REITs usually pay higher dividends than stocks and bonds 




But the dividend yields for retail REITs are even higher  In fact  the 10 largest retail REITs have an average dividend yield of 6 1  
On top of that  REITs are much less risky than most retail investments  thanks to predicable cash flows and high dividends 





For instance  when the S P 500 fell 18  from October 2018 to December 2018  REITs only fell half as much 
But just because a company pays a high dividend yield  it doesn t mean that dividend is safe 
That s why I developed a proprietary system called the Dividend Sustainability Index  DSI  to measure dividend safety  In a nutshell  the DSI looks at three key metrics  payout ratio  debt to equity ratio  and free cash flow 

And three retail REITs pass the DSI with flying colors 
Three Retail REITs That Pay  Safe  5  Plus Dividend Yields
The first company on my list is grocery REIT Weingarten Realty Investors  NYSE WRI  

Remember  groceries are one of the stronger areas of brick and mortar retail that I mentioned earlier  And WRI s biggest tenant is grocery maven Kroger Company  NYSE KR  

WRI pays a 5 7  dividend yield with a low payout ratio of 69   The company has raised its dividend for six years in a row  And   with such a low payout ratio and strong free cash flow   I expect it to raise its dividend again 

Next on my list is Taubman Centers  Inc   NYSE TCO   an apparel based shopping center REIT with properties in 11 states  Household names like H M  Williams Sonoma  NYSE WSM   and Urban Outfitters  NASDAQ URBN  are some of TCO s biggest tenants 
The company sports a hefty 6 6  dividend yield  It s also maintained or increased its dividend every year since 1991  And  with a payout ratio of only 70   I d expect it to keep this trend going 

Finally  we have Site Centers Corp   NYSE SITC   which owns and operates 33 shopping centers throughout the US 
SITC pays a reliable 5 7  dividend yield  It also has a low payout ratio of 48  and a very healthy debt to equity ratio of 47   This means the company should continue to meet its 5 7  dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
All three of these companies should continue to profit from the stable US retail market ",2019-08-21,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/retail-isnt-dead-its-growing-and-pays-6-dividends-200457091,200457091

The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DDR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DDR s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that DDR has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 8  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in future P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management  and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  DDR s P CF ratio of 8 8 is lower than the industry average of 20 9  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DDR currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DDR a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for DDR is just 1 8  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 6  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DDR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though DDR might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of D  This gives DDR a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and no downward movement in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 3 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DDR Corp  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDDR is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Top 14  out of more than 250 industries   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2018-01-03,Zacks Investment

118166,339681,SITC,Is DDR Corp  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DDR Corp    NYSE DDR   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DDR Corp  has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7 51  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 97  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DDR Corp  s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 14 79 over the past five years  In fact  the current level stands close to the lows for the stock  highlighting that it could be a superb entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 72  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should point out that DDR Corp  has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 52  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  DDR Corp  s P CF ratio of 10 02 is lower than the Zacks classified REIT   Equity Trust   Retail industry average of 16 46  which indicates that the stock is undervalued from this aspect as well Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DDR Corp  currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DDR Corp  a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for DDR Corp  is just 1 70  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 52  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  DDR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though DDR Corp  might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade and Momentum score of  C   each  This gives DDR a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat mixed  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days compared to no downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen no upward revisions and five downward revisions in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained flat in the past two months  while the full year estimate has slipped 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DDR Corp  Price and Consensus   This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDDR Corp  is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 26  out of over 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks classified REIT   Equity Trust   Retail industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades Could Profit   Big League   from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ,2017-05-14,Zacks Investment
