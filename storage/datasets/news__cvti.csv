ABC   5 Broker Friendly Stocks in Focus Amid Middle East TensionsTensions between the United States and Iran heightened after the latter retaliated to the early hour U S  airstrike at Baghdad airport  which killed Iran s top general Qasem Soleimani on Jan 3  The retaliatory move on Jan 7 saw Iran firing multiple ballistic missiles at two military camps in Iraq housing American troops Naturally  this escalation in tensions between the nations has weighed on stocks  Moreover  in the event of the United States retaliating following Iran s missile attacks  the broader equity market might be hurt further in the days ahead  Notably  geopolitical tensions are never good for the market as these cripple economic growth However  irrespective of market conditions  investors strive to design a

coverage in great detail  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer

stocks  A popular index of small caps has been scaling record highs of late as this niche segment doesn t face currency issues and is undeterred by  trade war concerns  In contrast  such factors act as bottlenecks for bigger names Small caps  being more U S  centric  are poised to benefit from the latest tax overhaul policy  The tax cut will drive earnings and cash flow for the stocks  Banking on these positives  investing in stocks with high domestic exposure in terms of revenue generation seems sensible       US Equity Benchmarks Flop  Small Caps TopThe broader equity market has been struggling to break out from a tight trading range for quite some time now  Investors  interest in equities seems to be dissipating  with only 32 7  expecting a higher rally in stocks in 12 months from now  per the Conference Board  In the last trading session  all the major bourses  including the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq  closed in the red However  small capitalization stocks  popularly measured by the Russell 2000 Index  have more room to run  The group scored its second straight closing record on May 17  while large cap stocks remained in correction territory for the longest stretch in a decade  Ironically  the issues that are dealing a blow to large caps  are helping small caps outperform Small Caps Dismiss Trade War Fears Last weekend  Trump s comments that he is working with President Xi Jinping to help Chinese telecom group ZTE  HK 0763  Group get back into business ebbed fears of a full blown global trade war  But  his comments in the second round of US China trade talks this week casted doubt on the outcome for the pair of superpowers  He said that Beijing is becoming too  spoiled  and that his expectations from the negotiation are low  After all  he himself said that  will the negotiation be successful  I tend to doubt it  Geopolitical tensions are  mostly  headwinds for large cap companies as they erode overseas profits  Small caps  on the other hand  remain unperturbed by international disputes due to limited exposure to foreign markets A Stronger Dollar Isn t a DeterrentThe current strength in the U S  dollar is weighing on multinational stocks  These stocks derive a big portion of their earnings from international sales  As a result  rise in dollar has a negative impact on their foreign sales  Meanwhile  small cap stocks have little or no exposure to overseas market when it comes to revenue generation  So  they tend to gain with a stronger dollar The ICE Dollar Index recently topped the 93 mark for the first time since last December  The dollar s upward journey was supported by an uptick in Treasury yields that reflected higher interest rate expectations  Fed officials  by the way  have said that the economy is ready to brace higher rates The yield on the 10 year Treasury note continues to stay at a 7 year high of 3 1   Rising inflation expectations led to a selloff of Treasuries  After all  higher commodity prices diminish the value of a bond s fixed interest payments  The 10 year yield increased as treasuries came under pressure  read more    Not the End of Bull MarketWith professional investors pouring money into small caps  it seems that the bull market has also further room to run  And why so  At the end of the bull market investors tend to pull money out of small caps and invest more in large caps This is because large caps tend to lose less money than small caps heading into a bear market  In fact  small caps that are darlings of the bull market can completely get decimated Time to Think Small for Better Returns  5 Solid BuysGiven the bullishness  investing in small cap stocks seems the right thing to do now  We have picked five small caps that should make meaningful

10879,232394,CVTI,Looming digital regulation has U S  truck industry scrambling,news,"By Nick Carey GREEN BAY  Wisc   Reuters    A new regulation that will force U S  trucking companies to electronically log employee hours is designed to limit accidents by keeping tired drivers off the road  It may also drive smaller trucking firms out of business  A trucking industry survey earlier this year of mostly small operators found that 84 percent lacked electronic logs  according to load matching firm truckstop com  Paper logs allow transport companies already facing razor thin margins to fudge the books  boosting their hours on the road to help the bottom line   But a mandated switch to a digital system by late December 2017  regulators say  will boost safety by preventing exhausted truckers from driving  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  FMCSA  forecasts the regulation would save 26 lives per year and prevent 562 injuries   An FMCSA cost benefit analysis found the new rule would cost truck firms  1 8 billion across the sector to implement  but fewer crashes and less paperwork would save  3 billion  Industry experts argue that whatever those savings  the smaller firms and independent owner operators that are the backbone of a highly fragmented market will take a productivity hit  making it difficult to pay off their trucks that have doubled in price since 2000   As a result  small to mid size trucking outfits will need to find more drivers to haul the same amount of freight    and seek other ways to cut costs    in order to make it    Some of the smaller  trucking  companies are just not going to survive  the change to electronic logs  said Dan Clark  head of BMO Transportation Finance  North America s largest truck and trailer financing company  The biggest truck firms back the rule and have used electronic logs for years  Large outfits like Schneider National  Swift Transportation Co  N SWFT  and Covenant Transportation Group Inc  O CVTI  all say the new logs reduce truckers  miles on the road  Cutting down driver miles means higher spending for additional drivers to haul freight  That leads to higher prices for consumers unless the firms find ways to squeeze more productivity out of their trucks   According to an FMCSA analysis  the rules will affect nearly 3 4 million drivers  Larger firms with better economies of scale like Werner Enterprises Inc  O WERN  have seen their productivity cut between 3 and 5 percent by electronic logs  Estimates vary up to 15 percent for how much productivity could fall at America s small trucking outfits  Industry lobby group the American Trucking Associations  ATA  estimates the sector is short about 50 000 drivers  Electronic logging could leave the industry short 1 million drivers  according to industry tracker FTR Intel  NASDAQ INTC   The pending change has U S  railroads hoping to take market share from the sector  CSX Corp  O CSX  Chief Executive Michael Ward said  won t impact the big truck firms because they follow the law today  but it will affect small firms    This will be a positive for us   Ward said   THE ONE THAT HAS THE TRUCK  WINS   Though it does not kick in until the end of next year and is being challenged in court by an independent truck driver association for violating driver privacy  executives are already bracing for the new rule s impact   This will be the single biggest thing to hit our industry since deregulation   in 1980  which reduced government controls on trucking rates and routes  says Chris Lofgren  CEO of Schneider National  whose customers include Walmart Stores Inc  N WMT  and  Home Depot  Inc  N HD   Schneider  the biggest private U S  trucking company with annual revenue of around  4 billion  offers flexible schedules for drivers who want weekends at home  or longer routes with more money    I get the routes I want so I can eat up the miles   said Bob Wyatt  68  a Schneider driver who has 4 9 million safe miles on the road   Truck makers are racing to make automatic vehicles that are easier and more comfortable to drive to help with driver retention   Denny Mooney  head of global product development at truck maker Navistar  N NAV  said he has heard from customers that say    if our drivers don t want to drive your trucks  we won t buy your trucks    Green Bay based Schneider is also putting customers under more scrutiny  Last year  Schneider rolled out an app for drivers to rate customers  enabling Schneider to fix problems or drop accounts that consistently chew up driver time  Rival J B  Hunt Transport Services Inc  O JBHT  is doing the same  after its own report last year found on a good day time wasted on picking up and dropping off loads can cost a trucker two hours out of a daily limit of 11 hours driving time  or 100 miles on the road  Drivers get paid by the mile and log an average of 7 500 miles per month in 2015  That focus on getting more efficient is one reason why Troy Clarke  CEO of truck maker Navistar  said he is not convinced electronic logging will lead to truck sale spike  Instead  he said  truckers  will address capacity problems through an increased focus on productivity   
Schneider is focused on building closer relationships with thousands of smaller carriers through its brokerage business to boost capacity  The company expects more long term contracts like one it has executed with Home Depot  N HD   Traditionally  pricing power seesaws between customers and truckers depending on the economy  Schneider s deal with Home Depot keeps rates per mile more steady  and guarantees the home improvement chain access to trucking capacity   We believe capacity is going to get tighter and tighter  said Erin Van Zeeland  vice president of transportation management at Schneider   We believe the one that has the truck  wins  ",2016-10-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/looming-digital-regulation-has-u.s.-truck-industry-scrambling-432457,432457

 2017   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  P A M  Transportation  Nasdaq   NASDAQ PTSI        Werner Enterprises  Nasdaq   NASDAQ WERN        Old Dominion  Nasdaq   NASDAQ ODFL       and Covenant Transport Group  Nasdaq   NASDAQ CVTI       Transportation Stocks Keep Trucking HigherI often look at the Zacks Industry Rank to see which sectors of the market are heating up or cooling down   This week I see that the Transportation   Trucking industry has moved near the top of the rankings   The industry is currently ranked  15 of the 256 industry s that are Ranked by Zacks   Last week it was  25 so it is rolling higher Two  1 sAt the top of the list of names in the group  I see two Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks  The first name on the list isP A M  Transportation  Nasdaq       This is a very small cap stock that is very thinly traded with average daily volume of roughly 15 000 shares   Despite the lack of trading  PTSI has been a solid performer of late  as the stock has moved higher by around 40  in the last month PTSI has a value style score of A and a growth style score of D   Normally I am all about the growth and a D would turn me off  but this stock is in a hot space so that makes it worth a closer look The next name on the list is a lot bigger and much more liquid  Werner Enterprises  Nasdaq      is also a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and sports a value style score of B and a growth style score of A   At  2 3B in market cap  it is much bigger than PTSI  WERN saw a steep sell off at the open  but over the last month or so  the stock is up just 3 8    WERN has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate rise of late  The estimate stood at  1 13 90 days ago and has since moved higher to  1 24   The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate also moved higher over the same time period  from  1 41 to  1 51 A Bunch Of  2 sAs I scan down the list of the trucking stocks  I see 5 stocks with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and most of them are of decent size  Of the  2 s  I like

10930,232445,CVTI,Investing For The Future  3 Companies Planning Ahead,opinion,"Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  unveiled several new products and services in Cupertino on Tuesday  These slick events are the culmination of billions of dollars in research and development for the tech giant  In fact  over the last 12 months  Apple spent more than  5 5 billion on R D 
If companies want to thrive in the competitive market landscape  then they must invest for the future  And that means paying up for things like research and development  advertising and capital expenditures  capex  
Think Long Term
Typically  expenses that are expected to generate future benefits over multiple periods are capitalized by firms and depreciated over their useful lives  such as new factories or expensive equipment  This is based on the matching principle of accrual accounting 
Research and development expenses generally fit this description  However  since 1975  accounting standards have required R D costs to be expensed in the period incurred  One reason for this is the uncertainty of the future economic benefits 
Because R D are expensed rather than capitalized  companies can skimp on these expenses in order to hit short term profitability targets  However  this often comes at the expense of long term profitability 
Advertising is another cost that is expensed as incurred even though it is expected to provide a future economic benefit  Similar to R D  companies can slash these expenses  but that is usually short sighted 
Advertising is a necessary investment for most companies  Even a well known brand like Coca Cola  NYSE KO  spent a whopping  3 3 billion on advertising in 2013  or about 7  of revenues 
Investing for the Future
If you re a long term investor  then you should pay close attention to how a company is investing for the future  Companies that pay up now for R D and advertising may depress current earnings  but it should boost future growth 
The right amount of capex  R D and advertising is heavily dependent on the industry it s in  It wouldn t be very useful to compare a tech company s R D expenses to a utility s  for example 
So what are some companies that are investing for the future 
I ran a screen in Research Wizard that looked for companies with R D  capex and advertising expenditures as a percentage of total assets that were greater than their industry median 
I also screened for companies earning cash returns on assets above their industry median  indicating that they are generating strong returns on these investments  I further screened for companies with a Zacks Rank of 1 or 2  which indicates positive earnings momentum 
Here are the 3 names from the list 
1  The Greenbrier Companies  NYSE GBX 
The Greenbrier Companies primarily manufactures railroad freight car equipment  It also provides servicing as well as railcar leasing 
2  Covenant Transportation Group  NASDAQ CVTI 
Covenant Transportation Group is a freight transportation and logistics services company headquartered in Chattanooga  Tennessee 
3  Fox Factory Holding Corp   NASDAQ FOXF 
Fox Factory designs and manufactures high performance suspension products primarily for mountain bikes  side by side vehicles  on road and off road vehicles and trucks  all terrain vehicles  snowmobiles  specialty vehicles and applications  and motorcycles 
The Bottom Line
If companies want to thrive in the competitive market landscape  then they must invest for the future  And that means paying up for things like research and development  advertising and capital expenditures  capex   These three companies are spending a large amount on these three items relative to others in the industry

10931,232446,CVTI,Trading Well  Stocks to Watch Now,opinion,"It was a wild day on Wall Street on Thursday as they ripped in the morning  rolled over in the afternoon  and a lot of stocks did a lot of different things  There were some amazing moves  The ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Fut ETF  ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY   went crazy and a lot of stocks did well  So let s take a look at some stocks that were really trading well  despite the bad market on Thursday 

Cypress Semiconductor Corporation  NASDAQ CY  has been great ever since they announced the deal with merger with Spansion Inc   NYSE CODE   You can see on the chart how it continues to stair step its way higher  I was looking for an opportunity for a pullback  even a gap up  but we did get a 3 day consolidation  up another 55 cents  or 4   on 6 5 million shares  It looks like this stock has gone through and above the 2013 highs  which means at this point  there may be some further acceleration  It s long in the tooth as well  however  it has momentum  My target is 14  and then 16 

Novavax  Inc   NASDAQ NVAX   which we put a swing trade on Thursday because of the breakout above resistance  At this point  I m looking for this stock to move to 6 95  and then maybe the 7 1 4 zone  The second target is up around 9 00 

The ProShares UltraShortDJ UBS Crude Oil  ARCA SCO  still continues to rock  I showed you this little pennant  or wedge  last week in the low 50 s  Since then it s up 12 points and still running  The price of oil is under  60 now  This may very well spike up toward 70 

TG Therapeutics  Inc   TG Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ TGTX   broke out as well on Thursday  and I put a swing trade on it  It got all the way up to 18 71 before backing off  I think the top of this channel is due for a test  and that s about 21

10946,232461,CVTI,Buy 4 Truckers To Gain From Strong Freight Transport,opinion,"An improving U S  economy  substantial surge in manufactured and retail goods  and a sharp rebound in a number of end markets are expected to fuel growth of the transportation sector  Of the various means of the U S  transport  trucking is the largest one  servicing 70  of freight tonnage 
Momentum to Continue
The U S  trucking industry has witnessed gradual improvement in 2017  As the U S  economy continues to grow  demand for carriage is also increasing and the momentum is expected to continue in the long term  The trucking industry is the lifeblood of the economy and an integral part of the manufacturing  transportation and warehousing industries 
In   ATA  American Trucking Associations  has projected freight volumes to grow 2 8  in 2017  Thereafter  from 2018   2023  the freight volume growth rate will be 3 4  per annum  For 2017  ATA has estimated that 15 18 billion tons of freight will be moved by all modes  The figure will rise 36 6  to 20 73 billion tons in 2028  Trucking revenues will likely grow 5 4  annually between 2018 and 2023 and are expected to reach  1 trillion by 2024 
Truck transport is a  derived demand  industry  which means demand for truckers depends on the demand for the products that trucks haul  Therefore  trucking serves as a barometer of the U S  economy  Trucking industry will remain the dominant means of domestic freight and its share in the U S  transportation sector is likely to remain not less than 67  by 2028 
Low Fuel Prices 
Declining oil prices is a major boon for many truckers  Fuel cost accounts for a considerable portion of expenses of trucking companies  Lower oil prices have reduced their operating expenditure  thereby giving the bottom line a boost  With declining trucking cost  business enterprises are increasingly opting for this mode for shipment their products instead of railways and other means of transportations  
While a few trucking companies hedge their fuel needs and impose fuel surcharge to customers  this is not the scenario industry wide  There are many trucking companies which are positioned to gain from the fall in fuel prices 
Capacity Constraint 
Capacity constraint in the form of driver shortage is driving top line growth of truckers  However  if the U S  economy continues to grow steadily  truckers will have to hire more drivers to grab market share  Manufacturing  consumer spending and international trade are likely to be among the key contributors to the rapid growth  More drivers will be required to keep up with the growing demand and the truckers should consider investing more in their fleets 
Trucking Industry Sports Strong Zacks Rank 
Trucking industry is currently in a great position from the  perspective  The  is currently in the top 17   43 out of 256  of the Zacks Categorized industries  suggesting it is well positioned  especially when compared with other segments out there  Except railroads  102 out of 256   no other transportation industry is currently within the top 50  bracket of the Zacks Categorized industries

February 22  2018   Stocks in this week s article Covenant Transportation Group  Inc    NASDAQ CVTI    Kulicke and Soffa Industries  Inc    NASDAQ KLIC    TrueBlue  Inc    NYSE TBI    Haverty Furniture Companies  Inc    NYSE HVT   and Graphic Packaging Holding Company   NYSE GPK   5 Value Stocks with Alluring EV EBITDA Ratios to Own NowValue investors generally tend to cling to the price to earnings  P E  strategy while seeking stocks that are trading at attractive prices  P E  without a shadow of a doubt  is the most popular multiple used by investors for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  But even this ubiquitously used equity valuation multiple is not devoid of  is a Better Option  But Why Although the widespread use of P E stems from its simplicity  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better approach as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  Also known as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA determines the total value of a firm while P E just considers its equity  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Simply put  it is the total value of a firm EBITDA  the other element of the ratio  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more alluring it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued Unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  EV EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another limitation of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and also can be used to value entities that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  is also a useful tool in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt But EV EBITDA has its downsides too  It alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Thus  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees

ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen value stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume

statements  listen to conference calls and engage in talks directly with top management  At times  they even talk with customers to gauge what they like or dislike about the products and services offered by the company Further  brokers understand the company fundamentals and try to place them against the present economic background to figure out how it may fare as an investment  Hence  after thorough research  brokers decide to rate that particular company s stock  So  when an analyst upgrades a stock  one can easily depend on it However  solely depending on analysts  upgrades is not the right way to build an investment portfolio  One should also take into consideration certain other factors to ensure robust returns Picking the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help in your search for potential winners Broker Rating Upgrades  4 weeks  of 1  or more  The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1  or more over the last four weeks

Corp    NYSE EXC   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research Tap These 5 Value Stocks with Enticing EV EBITDA RatiosThe price to earnings  P E  ratio  due to its apparent simplicity  enjoys great popularity in the value investing world and is preferred by many investors while uncovering bargain stocks  But even this widely used valuation metric is not devoid of limitations What Gives EV EBITDA the Upper Hand While P E is widely considered as a useful tool to work out the fair value of a stock  a more complicated and less used metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  P E  on the other hand  considers only its equity portion Also known as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  In a nutshell  it is the total value of a company The other component  EBITDA gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Typically  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is undervalued Unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  it is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear  Stocks flaunting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another key drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms with a debt laden balance sheet and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels Then again  EV EBITDA has its limitations too  The ratio alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  It varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital requirements As such  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

11031,232546,CVTI,Demand For Trucks Surges On Strong Freight Transport  4 Picks ,opinion,U S  trucking industry has been witnessing significant demand in recent months  The trucking industry is the lifeblood of the economy as it moves more than 70  of the country s freight by volume  Truck transport is a  derived demand  industry  which means requirement for truckers depends on the demand for the products that trucks haul  Consequently  trucking serves as a barometer of the U S  economy As the U S  economy continues to grow  demand for carriage is also increasing and this momentum is expected to sustain in the rest of 2018  At this stage  investment in trucking stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank will be a prudent move Robust Demand for TruckersTrucking industry is currently benefiting from two factors  Firstly  the U S  economy is on solid footing  In its 2017 2018 Freight Transportation Forecast  the American Trucking Association   ATA   has predicted continuous growth for truckers driven by manufacturing  consumer spending and international trade over the next 12 years Secondly  the trucking industry is currently facing capacity crunch  A healthy labor market with unemployment rate at its lowest in nearly 18 years has resulted in severe shortage of drivers  This has raised the price for truckers  According to the ATA  the United States is currently facing truck driver shortage of approximately 50 000 Moreover  trucking industry has discovered a new avenue of growth as the demand for online shopping is booming in the United States  Large e commerce companies are booking truckling space to deliver their products  The ATA estimates that the country will need 898 000 more drivers over the next decade to keep up with growth and demand Strong Trucking Volume and RatesThe latest report of the ATA forecasted that truck transportation volume will rise 4 2  in the United States in 2018  Notably  total truck tonnage  including for hire and private carrier operations was 10 8 billion tons in 2017 With shipping demand high  truckers are able to charge higher for their services  Notably  freight rates have been rising since 2017  Currently these rates are soaring  with ELD  Electronic Logging Devices  mandates in place since December 2017 Per the latest DAT RateView  in October 2018  Van trucking rates  Flatbed trucking rates and Reefer trucking rates increased 3 5   6  and 4 7   respectively  year over year  As the holiday season approaches quickly  industry watchers expect increased demand  lower capacity and better freight rates for the U S  truckers Growth Induced PoliciesThe two pro growth policies of President Trump  namely  significant cut in corporate taxes and deregulation are major catalysts for trucking  The corporate tax rate was lowered from 35  to 21   Incidentally  a large section of truckers book much of their revenues in the homeland  Consequently  a significant reduction in corporate tax rate borne by truckers would be immediately accretive to cash flow Our Top PicksA robust U S  economy  healthy consumer and business confidence  massive tax haul and business friendly policies of the government are anticipated to fuel trucking industry s growth  We have narrowed down our search to four stocks carrying either Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  with strong growth potential The chart below depicts price

Molina Healthcare   NYSE MOH    Dana Inc    NYSE DAN    DICK S Sporting Goods   NYSE DKS    Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   and Covenant Transportation Group   NASDAQ CVTI   5 Stocks that Brokers Currently Love   Do You The sole aim of investors  while designing their portfolio  is to generate handsome returns  However  equity market tricks are not easy to master with a deluge of stocks flooding the space at any point of time  This is particularly a daunting task when one tries to select a winning portfolio without proper guidance Therefore  it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by the experts in the field  The experts in the field of investing are brokers Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors All types of brokers indulge in thorough research of the stocks under their coverage  They have access to detailed information on a company  They attend company conference calls presentations to this end and scrutinize every detail available publicly before advising investors  Naturally  broker advice acts as an invaluable guide for investors in their bid to garner the maximum from their portfolios Earnings Estimate Revisions   An Invaluable PointerSince brokers follow stocks in their coverage minutely  they revise their earnings estimates on a stock after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  All decisions by brokers are backed by solid logic and thus estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock For instance  an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north  Similarly  lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation  Investors tend to be guided by the direction of estimate revisions and stock price while formulating their investment strategy  To take care of the earnings performance  we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks Revenue Performance Not to be IgnoredWhile we have talked about the bottom line in detail  the revenue performance should not be overlooked  Actually  according to many market watchers a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance To address top line concerns  we have included price sales ratio in our screen  It serves as a strong complementary valuation metric For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

11044,232559,CVTI,5 Broker Friendly Stocks In Focus Amid Middle East Tensions,opinion,Tensions between the United States and Iran heightened after the latter retaliated to the early hour U S  airstrike at Baghdad airport  which killed Iran s top general Qasem Soleimani on Jan 3  The retaliatory move on Jan 7 saw Iran firing multiple ballistic missiles at two military camps in Iraq housing American troops Naturally  this escalation in tensions between the nations has weighed on stocks  Moreover  in the event of the United States retaliating following Iran s missile attacks  the broader equity market might be hurt further in the days ahead  Notably  geopolitical tensions are never good for the market as these cripple economic growth However  irrespective of market conditions  investors strive to design a winning portfolio of stocks  They  after all  are putting their hard earned money into stocks  Amid the prevalent confusion  it is almost impossible for individual investors to come up with a winning portfolio of stocks without proper guidance  Therefore  it is in the best interest of investors to seek advice from  experts in the field  Who are These Experts   Why is their Advice Important The concerned experts are brokers  Brokers have a deeper insight into what s happening in a particular company  along with a better understanding of the overall sector and the industry To attain their objective  they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations  Since brokers follow the stocks in their coverage in great detail  they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock Broker opinion should  thus  act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action  buy  sell or hold  on a particular stock Making the Most of Broker AdviceThe above write up clearly suggests that by following broker actions  one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks  Keeping this in mind  we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions in earnings estimates over the last four weeks Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has been included  The price sales ratio takes care of the company s top line  making the strategy a winning one Screening Criteria   Up  Down Rating   Total  4 weeks   Top  75  This gives the list of the top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last four weeks   change in Q  1  est   4 weeks    Top  10  This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past four weeks for the upcoming quarter To ensure that the strategy is a winning one  covering all bases  we have added the following screening parameters Price to Sales   Bot 10  The lower the ratio the better  companies meeting this criterion are in the bottom 10  of our universe of over 7 700 stocks with respect to this ratio Price greater than 5  A stock trading below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors Average Daily Volume greater than 100 000 shares over the last 20
