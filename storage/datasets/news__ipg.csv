14650,236165,IPG,Special Report  As Baby Powder concerns mounted  J J focused marketing on minority  overweight women,news,By Chris Kirkham and Lisa Girion LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Pressure was mounting on Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and its signature Baby Powder  In 2006  an arm of the World Health Organization began classifying cosmetic talc such as Baby Powder as  possibly carcinogenic  when women used it as a genital antiperspirant and deodorant  as many had been doing for years  Talc supplier Luzenac America Inc started including that information on its shipments to J J and other customers  J J  meanwhile  looked for ways to sell more Baby Powder to two key groups of longtime users  African American and overweight women  The  right place  to focus  according to a 2006 internal J J marketing presentation  was  under developed geographical areas with hot weather  and higher AA population   the  AA  referring to African Americans   Powder is still considered a relevant product among AA consumers   the presentation said   This could be an opportunity   In the following years  J J turned those proposals into action  internal company documents show  It distributed Baby Powder samples through churches and beauty salons in African American and Hispanic neighborhoods  ran digital and print promotions with weight loss and wellness company Weight Watchers and launched a  300 000 radio advertising campaign in a half dozen markets aiming to reach  curvy Southern  NYSE SO  women 18 49 skewing African American   These are only some of the more recent examples of J J s decades long efforts to offset declining Baby Powder sales amid rising concern about the health effects of talc  based on a Reuters review of years of J J print  radio and digital advertising campaigns and thousands of pages of internal marketing documents and email correspondence  Adults have been the main users of Johnson s Baby Powder since at least the 1970s  after pediatricians started warning of the danger to infants of inhaling talc  As adults became ever more crucial to the brand   accounting for 91 percent of Baby Powder use by the mid 2000s   J J honed its powder pitches to court a variety of targeted markets  from teen focused ads touting the product s  fresh and natural  qualities  to promotions aimed at older minority and overweight women  Today  women who fall into those categories make up a large number of the 13 000 plaintiffs alleging that J J s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower  a powder brand the company sold off in 2012  caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma  Many of the ovarian cancer lawsuits have blamed the disease on perineal use of J J cosmetic talcs   a claim supported by some studies showing an association between such use and increased cancer risk  The most recent cases have alleged that J J s talc products contained asbestos  long a known carcinogen  In an investigation published Dec  14   Reuters revealed that J J knew for decades that small amounts of asbestos had occasionally been found in its raw talc and in Baby Powder and Shower to Shower  based on test results from the early 1970s to the early 2000s   information it did not disclose to regulators or the public  J J challenged the findings of the Reuters report  describing them as inaccurate and misleading  BABY POWDER  EVERYWHERE  Krystal Kim  a 53 year old African American  was one of 22 plaintiffs whose case in St  Louis resulted in a jury verdict last summer of  4 69 billion against J J  Kim said Baby Powder and Shower to Shower were household staples among her family and friends when she was growing up in New Jersey  Kim played baseball as a teenager  she said  and her mother told her to apply Baby Powder to avoid being  the stinky girl    Every time I took a shower  I put Baby Powder on   recalled Kim  whose ovarian cancer  first diagnosed in 2014  is now in remission   I put it on my panties  on my clothes  everywhere   J J is appealing the St  Louis verdict  The company did not respond to requests for an interview with Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky or any other executive to discuss the company s marketing of cosmetic powders  In an emailed response to questions from Reuters  J J said its Baby Powder is safe and asbestos free  It noted that the company s marketing over the years has been directed at many demographics and groups  and that  we re proud pioneers of the practice of multicultural marketing   It also pointed out that some Baby Powder ads have featured the cornstarch version of Baby Powder  the safety of which isn t questioned  Reports by Bloomberg News  the New York Times and the Post and Courier of Charleston  South Carolina  have cited some internal J J documents revealing the company s focus on African American and overweight women at certain times  But the full timeline and scale of the marketing efforts  particularly those aimed at teenage girls  in minority communities and through organizations such as Weight Watchers  are reported here for the first time  Most businesses know the demographic profiles of those who buy their products and  as a matter of course  direct their marketing at those groups  Some   fast food companies and soft drink makers  for example   have courted minority customers to increase sales among heavy users at times of growing public concern about the possible health effects of their products  In a lawsuit filed in Mississippi state court in 2014  Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood alleges that J J failed to warn consumers of the risks associated with its talc products and accuses the company of implementing a  racially targeted strategy  for selling Baby Powder after J J became aware of health concerns  The company focused its marketing on  minority communities expected to be more likely to use the talc products   Hood claims in the lawsuit  J J denied the allegations and last year filed a motion for summary judgment in the suit  arguing that the case involved matters of federal law  beyond the state s purview  A judge in December denied J J s motion  a move the company has appealed  The case is scheduled for trial later this year  In its response to Reuters  questions  J J said   Suggesting that Johnson   Johnson targeted a particular group with a potentially harmful product is incredibly offensive and patently false    DEEP  PERSONAL TRUST  Sold continuously since 1894  Johnson s Baby Powder accounted for less than 1 percent of J J s  81 6 billion in revenue last year  but it is deemed critical to the company s family friendly image  An internal J J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division  with Baby Powder at the core  as J J s   1 Asset   grounded in  deep  personal trust   Beginning in the 1950s  however  a series of case studies published in medical journals pointed to the dangers of breathing in talc  Pediatricians took notice  By the late 1950s  a third of them were recommending cornstarch or oil to treat diaper rash and chafing  because there is no dangerous dust  in them  according to an internal J J report  A report in the June 1966 edition of the American Journal of Diseases of Children  citing the deaths of three children who inhaled large amounts of talcum powder  concluded there was  no justification  for using the product on babies because it has  no medicinal value   By 1974  more than 60 percent of Johnson s Baby Powder sales were  attributable to adults  who used it on themselves  according to a J J analysis  Losing the connection to the product s namesake   babies   left J J eager to cultivate other markets  Beginning in the 1970s  J J ran ads clearly intended to woo young women  in addition to its traditional marketing aimed at families with babies   You start being sexy when you stop trying   was the line from an ad that appeared in Seventeen magazine in 1972  The photo shows a young woman stroking a young man s curly blond hair   It s a feeling you never outgrow   is how an ad in Family Circle magazine from the mid 1980s put it  with a photo of a bottle of Baby Powder next to a teddy bear alongside the mirrored reflection of a young woman  In 1989  advertising firm Young   Rubicam submitted a plan to J J to  initiate a high level of usage  among young women to  augment the weakening baby link   Under the plan  ads in style magazines like Seventeen  YM  Glamour and Mademoiselle would try to convince teen girls that Johnson s Baby Powder   applied daily after showering  is a simple  feminine way to smell clean and fresh during the day   Young   Rubicam  now known as VMLY R  declined to comment on the document and referred questions to J J  Baby Powder sales continued to fall throughout the 1980s and early 1990s  Since health professionals had already recommended against using talc on infants  a 1986 internal report warned  a  last straw  safety concern could lead consumers to abandon the product altogether  As early as 1992  the company keyed in on the sales potential with minority women  A J J memo that year mentions  high usage  rates for Baby Powder of 52 percent among African Americans and 37 6 percent among Hispanic customers   and notes that women of both ethnicities use the product more than the general population  The memo suggests investigating  ethnic  African American Hispanic  opportunities to grow the franchise   while referring to  negative publicity from the health community on talc   including  inhalation  dust  negative doctor endorsement  cancer linkage   Portions of that memo were cited in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times  STAGNATING SALES By 2006  the company was recognizing that  consumers do not see a need for powder   according to a sales presentation that year  Baby Powder shipments had been  stagnating  in recent years  the presentation said  and it was essential to  find a new business model  that  strategically and efficiently targets high propensity consumers   Those groups  according to the presentation  African Americans  nearly 60 percent of whom used Baby Powder by this time  compared to about 30 percent for the overall population  overweight people  and fitness conscious people looking to lose weight  It was also in 2006 that the International Agency for Research on Cancer  IARC   an arm of the World Health Organization  classified perineal use of talc as  possibly carcinogenic   saying available research provided  limited evidence  it caused cancer in humans  That came about 20 years after IARC classified  talc containing asbestiform fibres  as  carcinogenic to humans   its highest risk classification  After the IARC s 2006 move  talc supplier Luzenac America started including a note about the agency s latest classification on a chemical safety document accompanying shipments to all customers  including J J  Under a heading that reads  carcinogenic status   the document says IARC  has concluded that perineal use of talc based body powder is possibly carcinogenic to humans   In a deposition for one of the ovarian cancer cases tried in St  Louis  a Luzenac America executive  Shripal Sharma  said the company felt it was important to add what he referred to as a warning to the safety document  Asked whether Luzenac knew that J J did not pass on this warning  Sharma said   It is not our job to tell our customers what to do with their products   In a statement to Reuters  Imerys Talc America Inc  as Luzenac is now known  said   Talc s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies   echoing J J s response  Through an Imerys spokeswoman  Sharma declined to comment  Two years after the IARC classification  J J sought proposals for an  African American agency  to develop marketing campaigns for the company s baby products line  A 2008 document sent to prospective agencies summed up the situation   Johnson s Baby Oil and Baby Powder products  while traditionally used only on babies  are today primarily consumed by adult AA women for use on themselves   One way to reverse the brand s decline  it said  was by  speaking to AA consumers with a more relevant message with the most effective media vehicles    ETHNIC CONSUMERS  That year  the company contracted with a North Carolina marketing firm  Segmented Marketing Services Inc  which says it specializes in targeted promotions to  ethnic consumers   The firm would distribute 100 000 gift bags containing Baby Powder and other Johnson s baby products in African American and Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago  according to a contract with J J  Run by African Americans who had been executives at Procter   Gamble Co and Quaker Oats  Segmented Marketing Services has said in past press releases and its own marketing publications that it hands out millions of free product samples and promotional offers through national networks of more than 10 000 African American and Hispanic churches  and tens of thousands of  beauty salons  barber shops  entertainment venues and healthcare networks   The company published an advertorial in 2008 prepared for distribution with Johnson s baby products in which the firm s founders  Sandra Miller Jones and Lafayette Jones  said they  welcome  J J as a partner   When caring rituals started in infancy continue through adulthood  a person s self confidence and even faith in the world are often strengthened   the pamphlet said   Whether in the gym  at work  at church or at the beach  Johnson s Baby Powder helps grown ups feel more comfortable in their own skin   It came with a coupon for  1 off Baby Powder  Lafayette Jones and Sandra Miller Jones did not respond to calls  emails and LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  messages seeking comment  J J also launched campaigns to boost sales of Baby Powder to  curvy Southern women  and athletic adults who want to smell fresh  according to company documents  It advertised in Weight Watchers magazine and offered promotions through the Lane Bryant clothing chain for plus size women and Curves  a women s fitness and weight loss franchise  Marketing plans also included ads to run in Southern Living magazine and during the Style Network show  Ruby   a reality TV series that documented an obese Georgia woman on a mission to lose weight  A 2009 presentation laying out the  Powder media plan  highlights that it will reach 31 million people  in the South  hot climates overweight states    and that  43  of our plan will focus on the top 10 overweight states in the nation   A 2009 ad in Weight Watchers magazine suggests readers  bust stress with a midday workout  and then  stay fresh post exercise by applying Johnson s Baby Powder   Internal J J marketing emails before the Weight Watchers campaign ran discuss whether the women featured are heavy enough to resonate with the intended audience   Can you ask WW if they have any images of slightly bigger women  They don t have to be super curvy  but a little bigger than the current image would be preferable   wrote Grace Lee  a J J brand manager  to others at the company and ad agency Lowe New York  Weight Watchers  now known officially as WW International Inc  declined to comment on the campaign  Lee   Interpublic Group of Companies Inc  NYSE IPG   which owns the former Lowe New York  didn t respond to requests for comment  SUMMER SUCCESS The Weight Watchers campaign was successful  according to a 2009 internal J J recap  which showed that sales of Baby Powder at Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  shot up as much as 9 percent during the summer months when the ads ran from the same months a year earlier  reversing a decline  J J s overall Baby Powder media advertising budget increased to a proposed  495 000 for 2010  up 71 percent from  288 000 in 2009  driven by more dedicated spending toward promotions for overweight women  The company in 2010 launched a radio campaign in the South targeting  Curvy Southern Women 18 49 Skewing African American   A presentation from TMPG  a marketing agency that handles promotions with radio DJs  said the campaign made more than 18 million impressions on the target audience through ads and promotions on  urban adult contemporary  radio stations in Southern markets  including Dallas  Atlanta  Nashville  Mobile  Alabama  and Jackson  Mississippi  The presentation slides feature some photos of plus size African American women holding Baby Powder samples at  targeted station events  that also included spa giveaways and  Baby Powder Stay Cool Cash   TMPG did not respond to requests for comment  In a 2010 email  Debra DeStasio  a J J promotions and marketing manager who oversaw the baby products line at the time  gave the green light to two proposed radio stations for the campaign in Dallas  saying  we are good with those general market stations that have good Hispanic reach and good AA reach   In another 2010 email  she said the DJs will be the Baby Powder  brand ambassadors   charged with  communicating our message  encouraging listeners to call in to talk about how they use Baby Powder and driving to retail where appropriate   All the radio promotions would be  based on the weather   she wrote   If it s hot and humid  we ll run that week  If it s rainy or colder  we won t   DeStasio  who now works as a promotions and marketing manager at Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  Co  did not respond to requests for comment  J J s spending on Baby Powder promotions   coupons  discounts  and samples   came to about  1 2 million in 2008 and again in 2010  almost half of it directed at overweight and minority women  By 2011  the company cut back its promotional spending to  752 000  mostly aimed at the general consumer market  In 2013  a jury found J J negligent in the first case ever to claim that regular use of Baby Powder for feminine hygiene caused ovarian cancer  The jury didn t award monetary damages  but the verdict spawned a cascade of similar lawsuits  Of the eight ovarian cancer cases that have gone to trial so far  four have resulted in verdicts for plaintiffs and one for the company  Three other verdicts against J J were overturned on appeal  In 12 trials of cases claiming that asbestos in talc caused plaintiffs  mesothelioma  J J was cleared of liability in five  and plaintiffs won three  resulting in a total of  172 million in damages  Four others resulted in hung juries and mistrials  J J is appealing all the verdicts against it  Meanwhile  J J has pulled back from marketing specifically to minority and overweight women  A 2015 presentation makes no mention of minorities  suggesting the brand  target adults  with a focus on men   Plaintiffs  lawyers and other advocates have become more vocal in criticizing the targeted marketing campaigns  In its most recent newsletter  the National Council of Negro Women  a women s leadership group with about 30 000 members  drew attention to the issue with an essay penned by civil rights lawyer Ben Crump  who is representing some Baby Powder plaintiffs  In an interview  Janice Mathis  the council s executive director  said   Lots of products target African Americans  That s marketing 101  Go where our customers are  What has me disturbed about this is that you didn t give any caveat to the customers  once you knew there was a possibility there was some danger    Edited by Vanessa O Connell and John Blanton

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates 
VGM Scores
At this time  Interpublic has a nice Growth Score of B  though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C  Following the exact same course  the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side  putting it in the middle 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of this revision has been net zero  Notably  Interpublic has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   We expect an in line return from the stock in the next few months ",2019-11-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/interpublic-ipg-up-34-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue-200487099,200487099
14655,236170,IPG,Interpublic  IPG  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Interpublic Group  IPG  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this marketing and advertising company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Interpublic is 14 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 5 5  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Interpublic is 26 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 1 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 3 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Interpublic  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Interpublic a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Interpublic well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/interpublic-ipg-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-200499024,200499024
14656,236171,IPG,Interpublic  IPG  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Interpublic Group of Companies   NYSE IPG   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4 2  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  24 04 in the previous session  Interpublic Group of Companies  has gained 2 8  since the start of the year compared to the 5 3  move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the  1 7  return for the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 22  2019  Interpublic reported EPS of  0 49 versus consensus estimate of  0 48 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 17 68  
For the current fiscal year  Interpublic is expected to post earnings of  2 01 per share on  8 58 billion in revenues  Meanwhile  for the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  2 1 per share on  8 68 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 6  and 1 22   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Interpublic may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Interpublic has a Value Score of B  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 11 8X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9X versus its peer group s average of 5 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 2 27  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Interpublic currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Interpublic fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Interpublic shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Interpublic Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Interpublic have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Publicis Groupe SA  PA PUBP   PUBGY   Omnicom Group  OMC   and Global Payments  GPN   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 23  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Interpublic  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/interpublic-ipg-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200499625,200499625
14685,236200,IPG,Improve Your Retirement Income With These 3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks   January 23  2020,opinion,"Here s a revealing data point  older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself 
And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last  People are living longer  so that money has to cover a longer period  Making matters worse  income generated using tried   and   true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days  That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses 
In today s economic environment  traditional income investments are not working 
For many years  bonds or other fixed income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs  However  these yields have dwindled over time  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6 50   but today  that rate is a thing of the past  with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future 
While this yield reduction may not seem drastic  it adds up  for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries  the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than  1 million 
In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields  today s retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits  Because of certain demographic factors  it s been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035 
Unfortunately  it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income   bonds and Social Security   may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees  But what if there was another option that could provide a steady  reliable source of income in retirement 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
As we see it  dividend paying stocks from generally low risk  top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant current low risk  low yielding Treasury and fixed income alternatives 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3   and positive average annual dividend growth  Many stocks increase dividends over time  helping to offset the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
The First of Long Island  FLIC  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 18 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 04   This compares to the Banks   Northeast industry s yield of 1 78  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 77   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 72 is up 5 88  from last year 
H R Block  NYSE HRB  is paying out a dividend of 0 26 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 29  compared to the Consumer Services   Miscellaneous industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 04 is up 4  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 23 per share  Interpublic Group  IPG  has a dividend yield of 3 97   This is compared to the Advertising and Marketing industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 94 is up 11 9  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
It is true that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  but high quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly  can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market 
A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies  especially blue chip stocks  increase their dividends over time  helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
You may be thinking   I like this dividend strategy  but instead of investing in individual stocks  I m going to find a dividend focused mutual fund or ETF   This approach can make sense  but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees  which may reduce your dividend gains or income  and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach  If you do wish to invest in a fund  do your research to find the best quality dividend funds with the lowest fees 
Bottom Line
Regardless of whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  looking for a steady stream of income from dividend paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement 
Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement

102623,324138,IPG,Know These 3 Facts To Avoid Paying Half Your Retirement Income To The IRS   January 30  2020,opinion,"If you do not make a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the specified deadline  the IRS could hit you with a big penalty   50   For example  if you were required to withdraw a minimum of  4 000 and you did not  you would be obliged to pay  2 000  Plus  beginning January 1  2020  the rules concerning RMDs were updated 
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose Interpublic Group  IPG   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Preparing for the distribution stage is where you may settle on choices about where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll wish to travel  interests you may seek after  and different choices that will influence your retirement spending 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the RMD that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you attain a certain age  That age used to be 70 1 2 but it is now 72 
Why does the IRS require you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When does it become necessary to begin taking distributions  Your first distribution must be taken by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you turn 72  for most accounts   Also  if you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year after the calendar year in which you retire 
For each year after your required starting date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you don t need to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you covered taxes before contributing  Other varieties of Roth accounts require RMDs  But  there are approaches to avoid them   for instance  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Example  Ann is 71 and must take her first RMD in the year following the year she reaches age 72  Her year end IRA balance the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  The result of dividing  100 000 by 27 4 is  3 649 63   the amount that Ann must withdraw for her first RMD

102624,324139,IPG,3 Reasons Why Interpublic  IPG  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Interpublic Group  IPG  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this marketing and advertising company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Interpublic is 14 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 5 6  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Interpublic is 26 3   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 1 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 3 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Interpublic  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Interpublic a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Interpublic well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2020-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-why-interpublic-ipg-is-a-great-growth-stock-200503623,200503623

Malibu Rum paid American singer Nick Jonas to host a competition in Vietnam that began with 33 Instagram stars battling to catch fake pineapples while flying off a giant waterslide into the sea   In one month alone  videos and pictures from the  Malibu Games  were viewed 2 4 billion times online  showing the potential for so called  influencer marketing  to reach social media mad consumers that may overlook older  traditional brands  This kind of advertising  where celebrities and popular bloggers earn money by posting about products  has developed over the past five years on Instagram  Snapchat  Twitter  N TWTR   Facebook  O FB  and YouTube  Influencer marketing found early popularity with beauty  fast fashion and fitness brands but has now spread across the spectrum  even though some analysts question whether it actually works   It accounted for about  1 billion a year of advertising spend on Instagram alone last year  according to influencer marketing agency Mediakix  which predicts the entire market could reach  10 billion by 2020  still tiny in the near  600 billion ad realm  but growing fast   Thibaut Portal  leader of Pernod s global media hub  said influencer marketing was playing a  growing and key role  in the French spirit maker s campaigns and was in use on all its major brands  Influencers give Pernod more options for spending marketing dollars online  an important destination for liquor companies which have restrictions on television advertising in some places  such as France  Sometimes brands use social media stars with millions of followers to drive awareness of a brand  but other times pick  micro influencers  with thousands of followers who  as experts in their industry  can impact choices    We are not interested in working with big  massive influencers with four or five million followers  when  the week after  the same influencer is going to post a picture of a washing machine   Portal said  The rapid growth of influencer marketing shows how the broader ad industry is changing  as brands struggle to reach consumers in a world of fragmented content on the internet  now the biggest platform ahead of TV   Brands will pay anywhere from  10 000 to more than  100 000 for a single social media post  experts say  depending on the size  engagement and loyalty of the person s followers  This can buy online content more cheaply than traditional advertising   Pernod is far from alone in using the technique  with fellow consumer giants like  Unilever   L ULVR   Nestle  S NESN  and Mars all testing the waters  Pernod declined to say how much of its 1 7 billion euro marketing budget it spent on influencers  but Unilever said it accounted for  tens of millions  of its 7 7 billion euro marketing last year   However some analysts question whether a viral video clip seen millions of times actually lifts sales   Influencers can also artificially enhance their audience numbers   which often dictate their fees   by purchasing fake followers  machine generated profiles fueled by  bots   This was highlighted last month when Unilever said it would cut ties with influencers that buy followers   If it was a child before  it s a teenager now  and it s got to grow up quickly   Neil Waller  co founder of influencer marketing platform Whalar  said about the fledgling advertising area   CUT OUT MIDDLEMAN Pernod credits Malibu s social media presence for helping to invigorate the brand  whose sales volume grew in each of the past three years  according to researchers IWSR  after falling the previous two  The Malibu Games mostly featured people whose notoriety centers on social media  Besides singer Jonas  15 4 million followers on Instagram   participants included Sierra Dallas  1 2 million   Alba Paul Ferrer  878 000  and Rory Kramer  483 000    The influencers posted about their experiences of the three day event  including enough short video clips to make up over four hours of footage  A teaser video was watched 10 million times  the company said  Getting creative content directly from influencers also allows brands to skirt the middleman  traditional ad agencies owned by the likes of WPP  L WPP   Omnicom  N OMC   Publicis  PA PUBP  and IPG  N IPG    Nonetheless  agencies are using the tactic too    We re deeply involved in it  when creative agencies launch campaigns there will be an influencer element in it   Jonathan Nelson  digital boss of the world s second largest ad company Omnicom said   These are tailored experiences for you   Research by Accenture found that 53 percent of consumers aged 18 to 34 were loyal to brands that partnered with social influencers  compared with just 8 percent for those over 55   According to e commerce analytics firm L2  72 percent of Instagram users report making purchase decisions based on something that they saw on the site     Unilever Chief Marketing Officer Keith Weed said he expected influencers to take a growing part of his budget    We see it as a very powerful vehicle     creating very authentic real time content at a much lower price   Weed told Reuters   The way it penetrates the culture  I really do think it s going to be a big and vibrant market    Mars  another major advertiser  is also a fan  It divides its ad budget  with 80 percent going on proven campaigns and media  15 percent in areas that are unproven but where

102716,324231,IPG,WPP CEO Sorrell could learn his fate next week,news,"By Kate Holton LONDON  Reuters    WPP founder Martin Sorrell could find out as early as next week whether he can remain at the helm of the world s biggest advertising company but is likely to struggle to work with its board even if he is cleared of wrongdoing  sources said  WPP  L WPP  sent shockwaves through the industry last week when it said it was investigating alleged misconduct by Sorrell  raising the prospect that the 73 year old could step down after more than 30 years in charge  Sorrell denies the allegations  A source close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity said the result of the investigation by independent counsel was likely to come next week  However a second source who is familiar with Sorrell s thinking questioned whether it would be business as usual if the CEO was exonerated because he is unhappy about how the situation has been handled   When there is a family bust up life is never the same again   the second source said  declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation   Kissing and making up would seem to be a very challenging concept after this    WPP declined to comment   The longest serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index  Sorrell built WPP into the world s biggest advertising group by three decades of relentless dealmaking and is one of the most high profile  and best paid  executives in Britain  In his time the group has expanded to own top creative agencies including J  Walter Thompson and Young   Rubicam  as well as media planners and buyers and market research and public relations groups such as Finsbury  Present in 112 countries and employing more than 200 000 people  WPP provides services to clients including Ford   Unilever   LON ULVR   P G and a string of major corporations   BREAKING UP THE BUSINESS  It largely outperformed its peers Omnicom  N OMC   Publicis  PA PUBP  and IPG  N IPG  in the years that followed the financial crisis but it has been hit in the last 18 months by a downturn in consumer spending from some of its biggest clients  Its shares are down around 30 percent this year  with the growing migration of advertising online also adding to the challenges facing the industry    It won t be this week  it could be as soon as next   the first person said on the timing of the investigation   The uncertainty about Sorrell s future has renewed speculation as to who would take over the top job if he left and whether the group would remain in its current form  Analysts have speculated that WPP could sell its data management arm which provides market research to clients  Analysts at Liberum have valued the asset at around 3 5 billion pounds   5 billion   compared with WPP s current market valuation of 14 6 billion pounds   In the past the WPP management has said that although the data management arm has recorded lower growth rates  it is attractive to clients who want to see the impact of their media spending  making it aligned with the rest of the group

102717,324232,IPG,Britain s WPP  investors adjust to life without Sorrell,news,"By Kate Holton LONDON  Reuters    WPP  L WPP  entered uncharted territory on Monday after the exit of founder Martin Sorrell left the world s biggest advertising company rudderless at a time of intense industry change  Shares in WPP fell 6 percent after Sorrell  the driving force behind 33 years of dealmaking and relentless expansion  stepped down on Saturday after the board investigated an allegation of misconduct  David Herro of Harris Associates  WPP s biggest shareholder according to Thomson Reuters data  said Sorrell would be missed   Sir Martin is a visionary  a legend in advertising and a skilful businessman   he said   The circumstances surrounding this are regrettable as is a leadership transition without Sir Martin s involvement   The sudden departure of Sorrell  the face of the company which he founded in 1985  has sparked questions as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form of employing 200 000 people in more than 400 agencies across 112 countries  It has also prompted fears that without Sorrell s contacts it could lose clients and talent while it seeks a new CEO    We think the lack of operational direction for the group and potential for client losses are clear downside risks over the short to medium term    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  said    The potential for asset sales or even a break up may provide some support  but these are highly uncertain and unlikely to take place in the near term    WPP said that chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman while its digital boss Mark Read and Andrew Scott  the chief operating officer of WPP Europe who oversaw acquisitions  become joint chief operating officers  They inherit a difficult task  with WPP in March publishing its weakest results since the financial crisis as consumer goods groups such as  Unilever   LON ULVR  and P G cut spending and other customers jumped ship  The industry is also battling the might of Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB   which dominate the online advertising market  and watching nervously as consultants such as Accenture move more aggressively into the sector  The changing dynamics have meant the previous idea of building marketing groups up to offer advertising  branding  planning and research on a global scale   championed by Sorrell and followed by others   is now under threat as clients want more nimble relationships in a digital age  Many are starting to ask if they can do things differently   creating their own content to place directly on online platforms or working with smaller ad groups  Analysts are already saying that WPP s market research arm Kantar could be sold off for around 3 5 billion pounds   5 billion   compared with the group s overall market value of 14 5 billion pounds  and question whether there are synergies from holding PR assets like Finsbury   Sorrell had argued that the insight provided from market research had set WPP apart from peers such as Omnicom  N OMC   Publicis  PA PUBP  and IPG  N IPG   enabling it to improve its decision making when planning and buying media space for ads   The group also owns stakes in groups such as Chime Communications  Vice  AppNexus and Chime Communications which could be reviewed   ALL CHANGE With so much change in the industry  some analysts have questioned whether the group should seek a new CEO from outside who could look at it dispassionately  Names already in the frame include Jerry Buhlmann  who runs the Dentsu Aegis network  and Adam Crozier who previously ran broadcaster  ITV   LON ITV  and  Royal Mail   LON RMG   Jeremy Darroch  the well regarded CEO of bid target Sky  and Andrew Robertson  boss of rival ad agency BBDO  have also been linked with the job   From inside WPP Read  51  is seen as the lead candidate   While a common refrain heard about WPP is that no one knows the company like Sorrell  Read is the one man who comes close after he wrote to the WPP boss asking for a job in 1989   From the company s office in Farm Street  Mayfair  he watched as Sorrell pulled off a string of takeovers before building his own profile by growing its digital operations   He spent nearly 10 years on the WPP board  introducing him to investors  and is regarded by peers as a strategic thinker who can win corporate pitches to bring in work   Scott  49  is better known in the corporate world than the advertising community  having worked on the company s acquisition strategy    Mark will be responsible for clients  operating companies and people   a spokesman said   Andrew will focus on financial and operational performance and implementing on going reorganization of the group s portfolio   They will  report to and be supported  by Quarta  Read has already contacted senior executives within WPP to offer to speak to clients and reassure them that work will continue as normal   Whoever replaces Sorrell however will face longer term questions as to whether a group that was built in his mould should remain intact after his departure  Already executives are predicting that bits will be sold off in a move that could once again become a model for the wider industry   David Jones  the former CEO of WPP peer Havas and the founder of tech marketing group You and Mr Jones  predicted WPP would eventually end up missing Sorrell more than he would WPP   No one else can keep that company together the way he has been able to because he built it   he told Reuters    It s the fall of an emperor and one that I think will not only take the empire down with him but will also have massive ramifications for that entire industry

102726,324241,IPG,Interpublic Group  IPG  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Interpublic Group  IPG  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 26  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This marketing and advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 06 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  100  
Revenues are expected to be  1 96 billion  up 10 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Interpublic 
For Interpublic  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Interpublic will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Interpublic would post earnings of  0 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 89  delivering a surprise of  9 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Interpublic doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/interpublic-group-ipg-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200408778,200408778

102777,324292,IPG,5 Stocks With Solid Sales Growth To Add To Your Portfolio,opinion,Investors often overlook sales growth while selecting stocks as a company s stock price is typically more sensitive to its earnings momentum  Nonetheless  earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily manipulated  That s why sales should always be considered Sales growth is an important indicator of a company s health and ability to sustain its business  It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not rigged and is less volatile than earnings Without some top line growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the long term  While a company can witness earnings improvement by lowering expenses  a sustainable bottom line growth requires steady sales rise Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Further  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control  and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see  Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening     Based in Orlando  FL  Darden Restaurants  Inc    NYSE DRI   owns and operates full service restaurants  Expected sales growth rate for fiscal 2019 is 5 4  and the stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 Carlisle Companies Incorporated   NYSE CSL   operates as a diversified manufacturing company  This Scottsdale

102876,324391,IPG,Publicis to buy U S  digital ad firm Sapient for  3 7 billion,news,"By Leila Abboud PARIS  Reuters    Publicis  PA PUBP   the world s third largest advertising agency  is to buy U S  based digital ad specialist Sapient  O SAPE  for  3 7 billion in cash as it seeks to accelerate growth after a botched merger earlier this year 
The French group is hoping rapid growth in both North American and Internet advertising  which are far outpacing European and traditional ad formats  will help it catch up with sales gains at rivals such as WPP  L WPP  and Interpublic  N IPG  
Chief Executive Maurice Levy has blamed Publicis  recent poor performance on a failed merger with world No 2 ad agency Omnicom  N OMC   announced in August 2013 and abandoned in May over control and cultural clashes 
But some analysts said Publicis  offer of  25 per share  a 44 percent premium to Sapient s closing price on Friday  was a hefty price for a company whose growth may have peaked 
The transaction  which followed an unusual rally in Sapient shares and options last week  could also dash hopes among the French company s shareholders that cash might be distributed to them  analysts said 
Publicis shares fell 2 3 percent  while Sapient was up 42 percent at  24 59 in early afternoon trading 
 A good asset at a steep price   said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Charles Bedouelle of the deal  adding it would  likely push back  Publicis   cash return story by two years  
UBS analyst Tamsin Garrity said Publicis had been under pressure from investors to return cash  and was expected to announced share buybacks at a strategy day on Friday 
 The acquisition of Sapient makes such returns unlikely   she added  Garrity has a neutral rating on Publicis shares 
Levy defended the decision  saying the company would generate more value in the long term by buying Sapient rather than buying back its own shares  He pledged to update investors on his approach to dividends and buybacks sometime in November 
 This operation is extremely important for securing the future of Publicis   Levy said   It is far better to invest and deliver a higher growth and higher profits     which will lead to a re rating  rather than simply buy back our own shares  
 The deal will create a foundation for accelerated growth  by giving Publicis access to new markets and revenues  he added 
Publicis said the deal would be financed through existing cash and new debt  and would not affect Publicis  credit rating  It did not say when it would add to group profits but forecast 50 million euros   63 million  in annual cost savings 
 A JILTED LOVER  
Sapient s sales grew 14 1 percent to 1 1 billion euros last year  far outstripping Publicis  sales growth of 1 2 percent  though the French company had a higher operating profit margin  The U S based group earned 63 percent of its 2013 sales in North America and has 13 000 employees  8 500 of which are in India 
 The risk that growth slows at Sapient is one of the transaction s more important considerations   said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser 
He noted the deal gave Sapient an enterprise value  equity plus debt  of around 12 times its forecast earnings before interest tax  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA  for 2015  far above Publicis  current multiple of about 8 times 
Martin Sorrell  the chief executive of Publicis  rival WPP  was even harsher  telling financial blog Business Insider that Publicis had rushed into the Sapient deal to compensate for its botched marriage with Omnicom 
 It looks like the behavior of a jilted lover   said Sorrell  who often trades barbs with his cross channel rival 
Levy responded on a later conference call that he did not think Sorrell  knew anything about love  
 When it comes to love he should give that to the French   he said 
Buying Sapient will speed Publicis  roughly seven year old effort to earn more revenue from digital advertising  which includes everything from online marketing to brand building on social networks and automatic ad buying for major customers 
Last year  38 4 percent of Publicis  sales came from digital  and it had been aiming to reach 50 percent by 2018  something that the Sapient deal will make happen immediately 
According to Zenith Optimedia  the digital ad market is expected to grow 17 1 percent this year  driving total ad market growth of 5 3 percent 
Sapient s main SapientNitro unit is a digital agency on a par with Publicis  Razorfish and WPP s AKQA with customers including carmaker Fiat  retailer Marks   Spencer and consumer goods group Unilever 
 SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY  
Sapient shares rose 20 percent last week ahead of the deal announcement  compared to a 3 3 percent rise in the Nasdaq  prompting some market observers to question whether information had leaked  Trading in options in Sapient was also especially heavy 
 It looks like that there was some suspicious activity in Sapient   said optionMonster com lead analyst David Russell   Someone is definitely making a lot of money on this and they were buying the calls right before the merger was announced  
Sapient boss Alan Herrick will continue to run the company and join Publicis  management team  while Jerry Greenberg  the co chairman of Sapient s board  will join Publicis  board 
The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year  Citigroup  N C  has committed to financing the bid 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Rothschild advised Publicis  while Goldman Sachs and Blackstone advised Sapient

102877,324392,IPG,Under Armour leads Olympic marketing shake up after  rule 40  changes,news,"By Liana B  Baker
 Reuters    Against a backdrop of the iconic five rings  legendary swimmer Michael Phelps sat on a United States Olympic Committee stage at a March media event in Los Angeles  telling reporters why he had arrived fashionably late 
He had been rushed by private jet from Baltimore  courtesy of his sponsor  Under Armour   N UA   which had held its own media event the same day  a coincidence  the company said   Phelps called Under Armour backed athletes a  family  and its chief executive Kevin Plank a visionary with  mind blowing ideas  
The scene previewed the kind of marketing to expect during this summer s games  with companies operating under newly liberalized sponsorship rules   enacted after years of lobbying by athletes and their agents 
Under Armour won t pay the USOC or the International Olympic Committee for such mind blowing branding opportunities  The company is not an official sponsor of the games  That privilege costs brands such as  Nike  Inc  NYSE NKE     Visa Inc   N V  and McDonald s Corp  N MCD  tens of millions of dollars for explicit rights to use the rings  the word  Olympics  and other intellectual property 
Sports agents and marketing executives told Reuters that Under Armour s campaign will be the best case study for the changes to so called rule 40  which ends a marketing blackout during the games for companies who sponsor athletes rather than the event itself 
Phelps  one of Under Armour s biggest bets  competes this week in the U S  swimming trials  where he aims to secure a spot in his fifth Olympics  He hopes to add to his total of 18 gold medals and 22 medals total  which already makes him the most decorated Olympian of all time  On Tuesday  Phelps posted the top time in the 200 meter butterfly heats  advancing to the semi finals 
Beyond Phelps  Under Armour has backed a fleet of about 250 athletes   from the famous to the obscure   and plans a wide range of creative tactics to connect its brand to the Olympics 
The apparel company will  for instance  rent a series of outdoor gyms on a 50 mile stretch of beach in Rio to set up marketing outposts and host daily workouts for fans during the games  It will entertain VIP guests in a penthouse where they can mingle with its stable of athletes 
Official sponsors   worried the rule change could undermine their massive investments   will keep a keen eye out for potential infractions by other companies  John Lewicki  who oversees global Olympic sponsorship deals for McDonald s Corp  N MCD   said his company will use these games to evaluate whether to continue future Olympic deals   I wouldn t necessarily say we re all happy about it   Lewicki said   If we find rule 40 impacts the value of our sponsorship  we could always go back and renegotiate for the future  
McDonald s current deal  at a cost it declined to disclose  runs until after the 2020 summer games in Tokyo 
Lisa Baird  USOC s chief marketing officer said in a statement that  the USOC relies on partner support and works very hard to protect their Olympic rights  but while doing so we also look to expand opportunities for Team USA athletes  
The IOC said in a statement that it takes ambush marketing seriously and will protect its sponsors  exclusive rights 
 If there is a concerted effort to create an unauthorized commercial association with the Olympic Games or the Olympic properties  then we will take swift action   the statement said 
LONG LOBBYING CAMPAIGN
Before the rule change  approved last summer at the IOC session in Malaysia  athletes had long argued they were deprived of commercial attention and income during their most marketable moments 
Peter Carlisle  who represents Phelps as an agent at Octagon  a unit of Interpublic Group  N IPG   said the rule changes help famous athletes like his client  But more changes are needed from the IOC  he said  to help the masses of athletes 
Official sponsorship proceeds  in fact  are vital to less famous participants  whom the Olympic committees support with the money  The USOC s annual budget was  247 million in 2012  the last summer Olympics year  and the cost of sending an individual athlete to the Games averages  40 000  the USOC said 
Companies sponsoring individual athletes or teams had to submit their plans months in advance to the USOC or other national committees to ensure the campaigns do not infringe on Olympics copyrights  Sports agents estimate that hundreds of brands applied for U S  waivers  The USOC declined to release the numbers of waivers requested or granted 
To feasibly take advantage of rule 40  athletes would have had to find sponsors at least six months before the games to meet the deadlines for brands to submit waiver requests  Many Olympians are only finding out in the next few weeks whether they qualify for the games in trials happening all over the world 
 This is a change for the better  but it s nowhere near where we need to get   Carlisle said 
BRANDING FREE FOR ALL
Under Armour   along with dozens of other companies  including camera maker GoPro  O GPRO  and beverage brands Red Bull and Gatorade  a unit of PepsiCo Inc  N PEP    have already started flashy campaigns featuring Olympians  Each has sought approval to continue them during the games 
In March  Under Armour released a commercial showing Phelps swimming to a song called  The Last Goodbye   and then facing a flash of cameras 
 As long as you don t use Olympic intellectual property  like the rings or the word Olympic  you can make something that looks very beautiful   said Lowell Taub  head of sports endorsements at CAA Sports  an agency that works with Olympians such as gymnast Gabby Douglas 
Under Armour s  family  includes other big name athletes who are expected to compete in Rio  Jordan Spieth in golf  Andy Murray in tennis and Kelley O Hara in soccer  It suffered a blow  however  when Steph Curry   one of its highest profile athletes and a star point guard for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association   opted out of playing for the U S  basketball team in Rio so he could rest his injured knee 
The USOC said it plans to police any marketing activity that could hurt their official sponsors  investments  including on social media  but it declined to detail its enforcement plans  Nike  Under Armour s biggest competition in Rio  did not respond to repeated requests for comment 
The flood of new marketing during a three week Olympics period is likely to pose steep enforcement challenges  Phelps  agent  Carlisle  predicted there would be so many violations of rule 40 this summer   especially on social media   that  it ll make your head spin  
Brands are taking their own measures to protect their sponsorship rights  McDonald s said it plans to work with media monitoring agencies  and its own internal marketing teams will watch social media closely to evaluate the impact of the changes 
HIGH STAKES
A source who has negotiated previous IOC sponsorship deals said that top global sponsors spend about  25 million per year for the rights  or about  100 million for four year period that includes a summer and winter games 
The IOC hopes to double fees to  200 million per four year period starting in 2021  the source said  speaking on condition of anonymity  That could mean tough negotiations for the IOC with current sponsors 
Under Armour will likely spend considerably less  It has chosen instead to cut much less expensive deals to outfit the athletes in several national governing bodies  which are groups that oversee specific sports in various countries such as USA Gymnastics  USA Boxing  Rugby Canada and beach volleyball in Switzerland and the Netherlands 
The company does not disclose how much it invests in Olympics marketing  but it reported in a filing that its marketing costs rose by 14 percent   to  122 5 million from  107 6 million   during the first quarter ended March 31  compared to a year ago  The company attributed the increase to  key marketing campaigns and investments in sponsorships  in the filing  which covered the period when it unveiled Olympic themed commercials 
Under Armour plenty of reasons to keep pushing hard at the Olympics  said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand  Unlike Nike  only a small percentage its sales come from international markets  and it needs to catch up to rivals in India and China  he said 
Peter Murray  vice president of sports marketing for Under Armour  didn t rule out becoming an official sponsor at some point 

 As we look to grow the brand and the business around the world outside the US  Olympics will continue to play a role in that   Murray said   We are really just getting started  ",2016-06-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/under-armour-leads-olympic-marketing-shake-up-after-'rule-40'-changes-411355,411355
102884,324399,IPG,Here s Why You Should Hold Delphi Technologies  DLPH  Now,opinion,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks  At times  it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions 
Here we discuss about Delphi Technologies PLC   NYSE DLPH    a company that has an expected long term earnings per share growth rate of 1 7  
Factors Driving Delphi Technologies
Delphi Technologies has a geographically diverse revenue base  Region wise  it derived 44  of revenues from Europe  the Middle East and Africa  EMEA   28  from North America  25  from the Asia Pacific and 3  from South America in third quarter 2018 
Adjusted revenues increased 15  in South America  5  in Europe and 3  in North America  While growth in Commercial Vehicle and GDi drive revenues from Europe  the same from North America is benefitting from program launches and increased sales to Commercial Vehicle customers 
Regional presence coupled with its diversified and innovative product portfolio with updated technologies makes Delphi Technologies a solid choice for original equipment manufacturers  OEMs   This is because OEMs are focused on increasing efficiency and expanding their global manufacturing footprint by choosing suppliers with global scale who can easily adapt to regional variations 
The company s aftermarket business generates stable recurring revenues 
Summing Up 
Despite significant growth prospects  the company faces its share of headwinds  Declining revenues in passenger car diesel and GDi continue to weigh on Delphi Technologies  top line  A debt laden balance sheet may limit the company s future expansion and worsen its risk profile  However  we believe that vast global network and innovative product portfolio bode well for Delphi Technologies

the 16 Zacks sectors   While Fiserv has a market capitalization of  28 65 billion  WEX s market cap is  5 95 billion As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight  You can see  Price PerformanceFiserv clearly scores over WEX in terms of price performance  So far this year  shares of Fiserv have gained 11 4   outperforming the 7 3  rise of the  it belongs to  Shares of WEX have declined 0 9  in the same time frame  Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company s strong prospects WEX s fourth quarter earnings are projected to grow 41 6  compared with 21 1  for Fiserv  Looking at the full year 2018 picture  WEX s earnings are projected to grow 51 6  while that of Fiserv are expected to increase 22 3   For 2019  WEX s earnings are expected to register 15 5  growth compared with 12 1  for Fiserv Thus  WEX has an edge over Fiserv in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock s performance in the previous quarters WEX and Fiserv have an impressive earning surprise history  with WEX s earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters  Fiserv s earnings outpaced the consensus mark in three of the past four quarters However  WEX delivered a higher average positive earnings surprise of 3 3  compared with 1 5  for Fiserv Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock Based on fourth quarter and full year earnings estimate revisions in the past 90 days  WEX is better placed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2018 earnings has increased 1 9  for WEX compared with an increase of 1 2  for Fiserv  For 2018  estimates for WEX have increased 1 4   the same for Fiserv have

102888,324403,IPG,Paychex Rides On Tax Cut  Acquisitions  Strong Cash Position,opinion,"Paychex  Inc    NASDAQ PAYX   looks strong on the back of its strong balance sheet and strategic acquisitions  The company s bottom line continues to benefit from the tax reform 
The company reported strong second quarter fiscal 2019 results wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share outpaced the consensus estimate by 2 cents and increased 20 4  year over year  Total revenues of  858 9 million beat the consensus mark by  2 7 million and increased 7  year over year 
Paychex has an impressive earnings surprise history  having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters  It delivered average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 1 9   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings have remained unchanged over the past 60 days 
What s Driving Paychex 
Solid Cash Position
Paychex is a cash rich company with a strong balance sheet  At the end of second quarter fiscal 2019  Paychex had cash and cash equivalents of  510 6 million compared with  440 1 million at the end of the prior quarter  The company had no long term debt to clear off  The significant amount of cash provides Paychex the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy in the form of strategic acquisitions and other related investments 
Acquisitions  A Key Growth Catalyst
Paychex has been active on the acquisition front  On Dec 21  Paychex completed the purchase of Florida based Oasis Outsourcing for  1 2 billion in cash  The acquisition is expected to bolster the company s PEO growth strategy and expand its PEO sales organization  boost its client base  expand its HR outsourcing and technology enabled services and help it enter new markets  Additionally  Paychex is optimistic of witnessing an addition of  155  175 million revenues in the remaining part of fiscal 2019  ending May 31  2019  from this purchase 
During fiscal 2018  Paychex completed the acquisitions of Lessor Group   Lessor   and HR Outsourcing Holdings  Inc    HROI    Collectively  both these acquisitions contributed nearly 2  to total revenue growth in the first six months of fiscal 2019  
Prior to this  the company had completed 13 acquisitions that helped it to expand services as well as global reach  thereby boosting its revenues 
Lower Tax Rate Driving Bottom Line
Lower tax rate as a result of the tax reform policy  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  is contributing to Paychex s bottom line  The company s second quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share increased 20 4  year over year  The company enjoyed a lower effective income tax rate of 23 8  for the reported quarter compared with 34 8  in the prior year quarter  
For fiscal 2019  management is optimistic about the company s bottom line and its tax rate  Adjusted earnings per share are estimated to grow at a rate of 11 12  and effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 24  
Shareholder Friendly Moves
Reduced taxes will likely lead to greater retention of profits  thus helping the company to allocate more funds toward growth initiatives as well as reward shareholders through share buyback or increased dividend payments  In the first six months of fiscal 2019  the company repurchased 0 5 million shares for  32 8 million and paid  402 7 million in dividends 
During fiscal 2018  Paychex repurchased shares worth  143 1 million and paid dividend of  739 7 million  During fiscal 2017  Paychex repurchased shares worth  166 2 million and paid dividend of  662 3 million  Such moves indicate the company s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business

102889,324404,IPG,Here s Why You Should Retain Interpublic  IPG  Stock Now,opinion,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks  At times  it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed by tough market conditions

It has an expected long term  three to five years  earnings per share growth rate of 7 6   Moreover  earnings are expected to register 5 8  growth in 2019  
However  the company faces its share of headwinds  A debt laden balance sheet may limit Interpublic s future expansion and make risk profile worse  Client concentration is likely to be a major hindrance to business as the company primarily relies on large clients for a significant portion of revenues  Despite these headwinds  we believe that the company has enough positives that justify retention in investors  portfolio 
Factors Driving Interpublic
Solid Business Model 
Interpublic s digital capabilities  diversified business model and geographic reach provide a distinct competitive advantage  The company is expected to achieve targeted levels in the upcoming quarters  based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration integration across agencies through technological improvement  It continues to look for investments acquisitions to expand in high growth regions and key global markets 
Robust Organic Growth
Interpublic looks strong on the back of higher organic revenue growth  In the first nine months of 2018  organic revenue growth was 4 9   which was primarily a result of net client wins and higher spending from existing clients  especially in the healthcare and financial services sectors  Geographically  organic growth was 4 6  in the United States and 5 4  in international markets 
Acquisitions  A Key Growth Catalyst
Interpublic is consistently acquiring and investing in global companies to expand product portfolio as well as adapt to rapidly changing marketing services and the media market  In 2018  the company has completed three acquisitions  These include the buyout of data related and analytical services provider  Acxiom LLC in October  London based social creative agency That Lot through its subsidiary  Weber Shandwick in July  and Brazil based digital marketing and technology agency  Cappuccino in May 
In recent years  the company has acquired agencies across the marketing spectrum  which includes firms specializing in digital  mobile marketing  social media  healthcare communications and public relations as well as agencies with full service capabilities

102890,324405,IPG,Benefits Of A Bear Market And High Value Stocks  ,opinion,"Introduction
Although most investors hate bearish stock market activity  value investors   like yours truly  relish them  Moreover  bearish market activity becomes especially welcome after extended periods of high valuation like we have been experiencing since calendar year 2014  High valuations make it very difficult for value investors to find attractive common stock investments  Consequently  a nice dose of bear market activity brings welcome relief as a result of previously overvalued stocks becoming viable investments again 
However  it is also important to point out that  as I customarily do  it is a market of stocks and not a stock market  Therefore  I would also like to point out that I still consider that the overall market as measured by the S P 500 remains moderately overvalued  On the other hand  recent bearish market activity has brought a lot more choices for the valuation oriented investor to choose from 
Therefore  I have recently engaged in a simple screening looking for value over the overall market based on industry classifications and subindustry classifications reported by FactSet Research Systems Inc  In each article in this series I will be providing a listing of screened research candidates from each of the following industry sectors 
FactSet Sectors   Subsectors

Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I will be presenting a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I will be applying a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I have screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I have screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I have screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I will be able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances as this series unfolds 
In this part 1  I have found 6 research candidates from the commercial services sector as follows 
Sector 1  Commercial Services
Miscellaneous Commercial Services
Advertising Marketing Services
Commercial Printing Forms
Financial Publishing Services
Personnel Services
There are 366 companies available in this sector  However  I only found the following 6 companies that passed the screening process  Although there were several additional companies that had P E ratios below 17  they either failed because of less than investment grade credit ratings or high levels of debt  Furthermore  below investment grade credit ratings was the primary factor that eliminated most of the 366 possible companies  followed by high valuations and excessive debt levels 
 
FAST Graphs Screenshots of the 6 Research Candidates 
The following screenshots provide a quick look at each of the 6 candidates screened out of over 19 000 possibilities  Company descriptions courtesy of Wall Street Journal  In the FAST Graphs analyze out loud video that follows the screenshots  I will provide additional details and thoughts on the possible attractiveness as well as the potential negatives of each of these research candidates

Analyze out Loud Video  6 Research Candidates in the Commercial Services Sector


Summary and Conclusions
I think it s important to restate that out of 366 companies in the commercial services sector as reported by FactSet  only 6 of them screened for quality and value  Consequently  as I stated at the beginning of the video  I do believe the general state of the market is still excessively valued  However  thanks to the recent bearish activity we are seeing more opportunities to find quality stocks at value 
I would also like to remind you that what I am presenting here are attractively valued research candidates  However  as this series of articles unfolds you will discover that they come in all sizes  shapes  and flavors  Consequently  even though they all may be fairly valued  that doesn t simultaneously suggest that they are suitable for every investor  
My next article will cover the communication sector  Once again  out of the 203 possible companies in this sector  I only found 5 that I would consider quality companies at an attractive valuation

Factors Driving TransUnion s Performance
TransUnion s successful acquisition strategy has played a vital role in its growth in the past five to six years  The strategy focuses on investment in unique and differentiated data assets  acquiring new capabilities for expanding in vertical markets and expanding international footprints 
So far in 2018  TransUnion has acquired Callcredit  iovation and Healthcare Payment Specialists  These buyouts are expected to help the company with new market entry and portfolio diversification  moving ahead  In October  the company inked a deal to purchase Rubixis  a healthcare revenue cycle solutions company 
This acquisition is expected to place TransUnion as a competitive player in the post discharge revenue recovery market  Some notable buyouts of TransUnion in 2017 include DataLink services  FactorTrust and eBureau  All these acquisitions are contributing significantly to the top line 
TransUnion possesses an attractive business model with highly recurring and diverse revenue streams  significant operating leverage  low capital requirements as well as strong and stable cash flows  The inherent nature and significance of its solutions in customers  decision making endow it with high customer retention and revenue visibility

   Wrapping Up
In spite of significant growth prospects  TransUnion is not free from headwinds  It has a debt laden balance sheet that may limit expansion in the future and worsen its risk profile  Moreover  the company s operating segments experiences seasonality that causes considerable fluctuations in revenues and profits  Nevertheless  we believe that strategic buyouts are likely to boost the company s top line across all operating segments

103082,324597,IPG,Interpublic  Omnicom To Make Hedge Funds Happy ,opinion,"Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  are disrupting the advertising business in a way most companies in the industry never thought possible  To make things worse  large consumer companies such as Procter   Gamble and Kraft Heinz have reduced their marketing spending  As a result  traditional advertising companies face slowing revenue growth and uncertain future  Just what hedge funds have been looking for to bet against their stocks  According to the   hedge funds  combined short position against the world s biggest advertising companies amounts to over  3 billion with Omnicom and Interpublic being the main targets  Here  we will see if the  confirms the negative outlook maintained by the hedge funds  
 There is a  426 bet against the stock of Interpublic  The chart above suggests hedge funds might be up to something here  As visible  the price has drawn a five wave  pattern since November 2008  Two degrees of trend can also be recognized within the extended wave 3  In the long term  that is actually a good thing  because it shows that Interpublic Group of Companies Inc  NYSE IPG  stock is in an uptrend  In the short term though  and that is the horizon hedge funds are usually more interested in  this pattern suggests a three wave decline should soon begin  It could easily erase about 50  of Interpublic s market capitalization  But the advertising company hedge funds are betting against the most is Omnicom 

With a  2 2 billion combined short position against it  Omnicom Group Inc  NYSE OMC  is the advertising company hedge funds hate the most right now  And we can understand why by looking at the chart above  Omnicom stock rose in impulsive fashion from  20 09 in March 2009 to as high as  89 66 in December  2016  Naturally  a bearish reversal followed  By November 2017  OMC was down to  65 32 in wave A of what we believe is a three wave A B C correction still in progress  If this count is correct  the recovery to  83 34 last month is wave B  which means another selloff in wave C should be expected 
In conclusion  despite the fact that both Interpublic and Omnicom stocks are trading near multi year highs  they seem extremely vulnerable to bearish attacks  Omnicom might lose another 30   but Interpublic investors should be prepared to see their holdings  market value cut in half  making hedge funds with bearish bets against them very happy ",2018-03-13,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/interpublic-omnicom-to-make-hedge-funds-happy-200297601,200297601

103179,324694,IPG,Stocks With Strong Potential Earnings Boost From Trump Tax Plan,opinion,"Companies that have low effective tax rates due to current  tax loop holes  may find their effective tax rate rise  and profits decline   even if nominal corporate tax rates decline  because  tax loop holes  may be closed to pay for the tax rate change
Companies that have effective tax rates near the nominal rates  would likely see their effective tax rate fall  and profits rise   if nominal corporate tax rates decline
Searching for companies that may benefit from a tax rate decline  and are otherwise potentially attractive is a useful exercise
We found 22 stocks among all listed with favorable yield and valuation attributes that may provide interesting Trump tax plan return potential
We found 100 stocks in the S P 500 with effective tax rates from 30  to 35  that would like benefit significantly from a corporate tax reduction
34 of those 100 S P 500 stocks are in current up trends 
Our search for stocks with favorable yield and valuation was of all listed US stocks  for those with these characteristics 
7 year cumulative effective tax rate greater than 30  and less than 36 
12 mo trailing dividend yield greater than 2 
PEG ratio less than 2
12 mo trailing shareholder yield  dividend yield   buyback yield  is no less than dividend yield  no share issuance  
There are companies with tax rates  much higher than the nominal rates   Those cases are too complicated for this simple search  and that is why we limited the effective tax range to less than 36     The 30  minimum is to find those with a substantial potential benefit from a corporate tax rate reduction 
These are the 22 companies that came through the filter criteria 
These are the metrics for each company  along with the Standard and Poor s Capital IQ ratings for 12 months forward   stars   and fair value 

This table presents the trend condition of those 22 stocks  using the QVM 4 Factor monthly trend indicator 
A rating of 100 is for the leading end of the major trend line moving up   A rating of zero is for the leading end of the major trend moving down  A rating of 50 is for the leading end of the major trend line in transition between trend directions   At the bottom of this article  there is an explanation of how the QVM 4 Factor indicator works 

The median tax rate among S P 500 stocks that have positive 7 year cumulative tax rates is 30   and the average is 24  
Our search among S P 500 stocks simply eliminated those with 7 year cumulative effective tax rates below 30  and greater than 35    We found 100 such stocks shown in this table 

Thirty four of those 100 stocks are currently in up trends as measured by the QVM 4 Factor monthly trend indicator  as follows

Companies currently with effective tax rates below the 20  rate that is often mentioned in Washington for the next Congress  may find their effective tax rate rising and profits declining  if the  tax loopholes  they have relied upon are repealed to pay for a new lower corporate tax rate   Companies with rather full effective tax rates  such as those in between 30  and 35   in our filter  would likely find their effective tax rate dropping and profits increasing under a new lower corporate tax rate 
Currently low effective tax rate companies with high valuation multiples would possibly see the double effect of declining profits and declining valuation multiples 
Currently high effective tax rate companies with high valuation multiples may see support for their multiples as their profits increase as their taxes decline 
If a company with a current 35  tax rate  with a 65  after tax income rate  goes to a 20  tax rate  with an 80  after tax income rate   that would be a 23  increase in profits   That profits increase could offset a similar decline in valuation multiple  that might be triggered by a general multiple contraction in the broad market 
All in all that suggests to us that overweighting stocks of companies that would most strongly benefit by a corporate tax rate reduction  and a underweighting stocks whos effective tax rates might increase as a result changes in the tax law is a reasonable idea 
Within these two lists  there should be good hunting ground for strong Trump tax plan beneficiaries  that may be suitable for you

103180,324695,IPG,These Are The 3 Biggest Threats Facing Advertising Stocks ,opinion,"With the amount of ads that consumers come across everyday  it is hard to believe that the ad industry is facing any obstacles  However  advertising giants like WPP  LON WPP    NASDAQ WPPGY    Omnicom Group Inc    NYSE OMC    and The Interpublic Group of Companies   NYSE IPG   may be facing some unseen risks 
Here are the three biggest problems confronting advertising companies 
Budget Cuts
Not from the agency itself  but the clients of ad agencies are cutting their budgets on advertising to remain profitable 
WPP s stock tanked last Thursday when one of its top five clients  Unilever  LON ULVR    NYSE UL    said it plans to save  2 billion   2 1 billion  in advertising before 2020  instead of the previous goal of  1 billion   1 06 billion   The increase in savings is a defense strategy from Unilever against Kraft Heinz s   NASDAQ KHC   merger offer  and it results in the company having less money to pay to WPP 
As the packaged food industry sees a decline in sales with customers  shift in preference to fresh produce  consumer goods companies look to calm shareholders by showing that they can boost returns without outside help 
Consumer goods accounted for 31  of WPP s sales last year  according to Macquarie Group   NYSE MIC    The British based firm downgraded its growth forecast for 2017 from 3  to 2  last month  The decision might be prescient of Unilever s new strategy 
President Trump
 Advertising is cautious with Trump   said Michael Roth  IPG s Chief Executive  in a report by  
While certain issues that Trump supports may align with some brands  mission  agencies still have to go through content to make sure that it doesn t offend anyone 
Furthermore  global firms are sensitive to changes in the world economy  so as the President of United States  the leader of one of the world s largest economies  meets other world leaders and passes new policies ad agencies are affected with each event 
Digital Disruption
While the immediate threats from clients  cost saving and the global economy is impacting ad agencies  the threat of digital disruption is also hovering over them  With Alphabet s Google   NASDAQ GOOGL   and Facebook   NASDAQ FB   as the dominant platforms for advertising  the automated algorithm that s designed to allocate budgets for its clients efficiently seems more cost efficient than traditional agencies 
Though Google and Facebook also face obstacles like the   advertisers  who previously pulled their ads out  have gone back to advertising on those platforms  The change of heart shows that companies have faith that these tech industry leaders will solve the problem 
Bottom Line
 All we re  the clients  really asking for is here s what we re paying for  validate that we re getting it  so we can then evaluate whether it s a good deal   said Marc S  Pritchard  Procter   Gamble s chief brand officer  with The New York Times   And if it s two seconds  and it costs X  and lifts the business  we ll do that  
Budget cuts could mean pulling an ad from Google or Facebook  not necessarily away from the ad agency  President Trump s actions have noticeable effects throughout the whole market  While it is unlikely that the traditional ad industry will be wiped out entirely by the tech companies  certain Silicon Valley darlings are infamous for disrupting businesses  especially within the media sector
