106758,328273,ALLT,Failing To Honor Stops  The Most Dangerous Trading Mistake,opinion,Yesterday  we discussed a common money management mistake among both new and experienced traders  specifically with regard to prematurely raising stops without an objective  technical reason  Today  we discuss a different  and even more dangerous  trade management mistake  It is the opposite problem  which is the much more dangerous mistake of failing to honor your protective stops when they are triggered  Our swing trading system for stocks focuses on identifying explosive breakouts primarily in small and mid cap stocks  in which these stocks typically gain 10  to 20  over a 1   4 week period  In order to achieve these type of gains  the stocks we swing trade are typically high beta with plenty of volatility  Note that this is different than our ETF trading strategy  which is slower paced and lower volatility  The combination of trading both individual stocks and ETFs in our trading newsletter works well  as it smooths out the month to month volatility in our model portfolio  By identifying low risk entry points in leading individual stocks  we are able to use high volatility to our advantage because we look for stocks engaged in a volatility contraction  which are due for an inevitable range expansion within a few days  Because of this  when these stock trades do not quickly move in our favor  and reverse substantially lower instead  it is extremely important to always have preset  clearly defined protective stops in place  A good example of this is with the price action of both ACAT and ALLT Tuesday  Going into Tuesday s session  September 18   we were long both Arctic Cat  ACAT  and Allot Communications  ALLT   among other positions   However  both trades moved against us and hit our preset stop prices  we also sold two winning trades Tuesday  LinkedIn  LNKD  and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals  ALNY   which were larger than the losing trades  On the daily chart of ACAT below  noticed that the stock fell another 4  intraday after hitting our stop price  Although the chart of ALLT is not shown in this post  the importance of sticking to predefined stop prices was even more apparent with that trade  as the stock plunged another 7  intraday after we closed the trade upon hitting our stop price  With ACAT and ALLT falling substantially lower after hitting our stop prices just on an intraday basis  odds are good these stocks may move even lower in the coming days  which would trigger the deadly emotion of hope for traders who failed to sell at the proper exit point  Failure to honor a stop is often the result of the trader falling into hope mode  Conversely  making an emotional decision to exit a falling trade before hitting its actual stop price  as discussed in yesterday s post  is typically result of the powerful emotion of fear  Understanding and maintaining firm control on the human psychological emotions that drive stock markets is crucial for both new and experienced traders to understand  The bottom line is we must always maintain extreme discipline to adhere to stop prices when executing our trading system  or else the dollar amount of the average losing trades will be larger than the winning trades  If that happens  being a consistently profitable trader over the long term is not possible  This simply means we can not and do not hesitate to sell a stock or ETF whenever our stop price is triggered ,2012-09-20,Deron Wagner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/failing-to-honor-stops:-the-most-dangerous-trading-mistake-137050,137050
106759,328274,ALLT,Stocks To Watch  ALLT  CI  GGG  INGR  OZM,opinion,"Here are the Rest of the Top 10 
Allot Communications  O ALLT 
Allot Communications  ALLT  fell in a strong gap move lower to start July and has been consolidating  building a bottom since  The bottoming process has met resistance at 6 a couple of time and is there again moving into the short week  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising while the MACD is crossed up and rising  both supporting a push through to the upside  Watch for a break of resistance to participate 
Cigna  N CI 
Cigna made a top at the end of June and then fell in an arcing pullback  This consolidation created a rounding bottom with the down move  Into the week it is back trying to make a higher high  A possible reversal  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising while the MACD is rising  Both support continued upside 
Graco  N GGG 
Graco had been rising in a broad channel until it broke that to the downside  under the 50 day SMA in December  But that fall seems to have found support last week at the lower Bollinger Band  as it printed several doji reversal candles  The RSI touched the oversold level and bounced while the MACD is still falling but starting to level off  Look for a new high to confirm a reversal 
Ingredion  N INGR 
Ingredion had a strong trend higher from a bottom in August to a peak in late November  It has been in a sideways movement since then though with deteriorating momentum  The RSI remains in the bullish zone but the MACD is moving lower and avoided a cross up last week  Watch for a break of support to enter on the short side 
Och Ziff  N OZM 
Och Ziff started falling in June  losing over 60  of its value before finding support and bouncing in November  It consolidated in a bull flag after an initial bounce and it pressing higher again  The RSI is knocking on the bullish zone while the MACD is leveling after a run higher  Look for a move over Thursday s high to participate 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into the shortened Christmas week sees the equity markets looking weak in the short with the N SPY weak in the intermediate term as well 
Elsewhere watch Gold for a bounce in its downtrend while crude oil continues lower  The US dollar index looks strong and ready for more upside while US Treasuries are mired in broad consolidation  The Shanghai Composite is biased higher in consolidation and Emerging Markets are biased to the downside 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETFs SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Their chars concur on the daily feed after back to back strong down days  while the IWM and QQ are nearing support in prior consolidation channels on the intermediate view  The SPY looks to be weaker rolling lower on the longer view  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
