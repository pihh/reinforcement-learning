Dish will be required to create a 5G network with airwaves it already owns and some it will buy from the merged T Mobile Sprint  Additionally  Dish will buy Sprint s prepaid brands  including Boost Mobile  and have access to the merged company s airwaves for seven years to get its wireless business going    Read more   Look out below   If Dish tries to take on T Mobile and Sprint  it would be  very bad  for investors  analyst says When the merger between T Mobile and Sprint was first announced  observers expressed concerns that the wireless market in the U S  come become much like the one that exists in Canada  Verizon

The state attorneys general initially argued that the deal would drive up cell service costs   Preliminary estimates based on the submissions made by economists for Sprint and T Mobile show that the merger could cost Sprint and T Mobile subscribers at least  4 5 billion annually and the harm to all retail mobile wireless telecommunications subscribers could be even larger   they wrote in their original complaint    The merger will negatively impact all retail mobile wireless telecommunications service subscribers  but will be particularly harmful to prepaid subscribers   they added   Many low income subscribers cannot pass a credit check and  thus  can purchase mobile wireless telecommunications services only on a prepaid basis    Also see  Verizon risks losing a key 5G battle to AT T and T Mobile  says analyst  Following the judge s decision  opponents of the merger echoed these initial criticisms   Today s decision marks a loss for every American who relies on their cell phone for work  to care for a family member  and to communicate with friends   New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a written statement   There is no doubt that reducing the mobile market from four to three will be bad for consumers  bad for workers  and bad for innovation  which is why the states stepped up and led this lawsuit   James added that the attorneys general are reviewing their options  including a possible appeal 

                   If T Mobile and Sprint don t get this deal done  they re toast

Proponents of the deal  however  have argued that a merger is necessary for Sprint and T Mobile to remain competitive as the wireless industry gears up for the shift to 5G service  T Mobile and Sprint s merger makes sense because each company fills the gaps in the other  Jeff Kagan  a wireless industry analyst who had previously expressed some concerns with the deal  told MarketWatch last July  T Mobile excels at marketing  but owns little spectrum  the airwaves that wireless carriers use to run their service  Sprint  he said  has the opposite problem    If T Mobile and Sprint don t get this deal done  they re toast   Kagan said  Having the combined marketing pizzazz and cache of airwaves is necessary for them to build out a 5G network successfully that could compete with AT T and Verizon  he said  Shares of Sprint were up 74  Tuesday morning  while shares of T Mobile were flat  Comparatively  the S P 500

220030,441546,T,Why T Mobile s deal with Sprint could be the warm up to a wild decade of mergers,news,T Mobile s deal with Sprint may usher in the next wave of major U S  media and telecommunications consolidation  the merging of cable and wireless companies The deals  if attempted  could be some of the largest of all time European telecommunications companies such as Liberty Global and Vodafone already own wireless and cable assets ,2020-02-13,CNBC,https://invst.ly/pubux,2083207
220040,441556,T,Investors Are Overlooking This Key Risk in AT T s TV Strategy,news,"It s anything but a veiled secret that AT T s  NYSE T  cable television business in trouble  Last quarter alone  it shed another 1 16 million video customers  bringing its full year attrition up to 3 43 million cable customers  The numbers extend a losing streak that began back in 2017  Investors weren t surprised  and AT T wasn t concerned  either  seemingly certain that the upcoming nationwide launch of AT T TV will turn its television fortunes around 
While analysts and investors debate the state of AT T s video business  though  they re overlooking another red flag that could make the cable television matter moot  The telco giant is also now losing broadband subscribers  who are the company s best cable TV prospects 

Losing broadband customers  too
AT T s television woes are well documented  Its 2015 acquisition of satellite cable name DirecTV has been a bust  but its over the top service called AT T TV NOW  formerly DirecTV NOW  hasn t been any less disappointing  AT T Communications CEO Jeff McElfresh explained in December that the company was prioritizing AT T TV  jibing with previous comments from MoffettNathanson    among others    that AT T TV NOW could eventually be shut down outright  AT T TV is meant to be the new cable flagship  delivered entirely via the internet   even its live linear programming 
There s just one problem with the premise  though  For a customer to enjoy their new AT T TV service  they ll also need a broadband connection  Fewer and fewer consumers are paying AT T for high speed connectivity  though  The company lost 142 000 cable internet connections during the final quarter of last year and shed another 41 000 DSL customers  for a net loss of 182 000 accounts  That s the third straight loss of broadband customers  with each of those being more dramatic than the prior one 

Investors can only speculate as to why AT T internet customers are canceling  It s not a stretch  though  to suggest that consumers who decided they no longer wanted AT T s cable television service also decided they didn t need AT T s broadband service  either  The customer attrition trends sure look like they re starting to coincide 
If that s the case  the loss of broadband customers bodes poorly for the future of AT T TV 
A problem unique to AT T
The trajectories of AT T s broadband and cable customer counts prompt a key question  Is it even possible to retain bundle customers once they decide to un bundle  That is to say  will consumers bother subscribing to just one service from a telco provider  AT T s anecdotal data suggests they won t  but AT T s numbers contrast sharply with those from rival Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  
Comcast is losing cable customers as well  for the record  shedding 149 000 television subscribers during the company s fourth quarter of 2019  Comcast s customers are decidedly unbundling their services  too  The number of Comcast customers with just one service  in fact  hasn t been higher in years thanks to the 671 000 cable TV customers that cut the Comcast cord last year  Its customers aren t bailing on the company s broadband business  though  with another 442 000 getting on board during Q4  It added 1 4 million of them in all of 2019  Verizon is also adding high speed internet customers  even as it loses cable subscribers  Clearly one service can be sold without the other  
Comcast s success at least on one key front isn t just a coincidence  Though it too is moving away from winning cable customers at all costs only to suffer thin margins in trying to keep them signed on  it s proceeding strategically  It knows the business of traditional cable television is in permanent retreat  but it offers a slimmed down  ad supported cable service called Flex to its internet subscribers  Meanwhile  its NBCUniversal arm will soon launch an ad supported streaming service called Peacock  available to all consumers regardless of who their broadband provider is 
In contrast  AT T just upped its U Verse TV and DirecTV rates    again    for 2020  with the former s customers paying as much as  7 more per month  and the latter paying as much as  8 more per month  Indeed  the company has effectively done nothing to add meaningful value for broadband customers    or reward them for sticking around 
Bottom line
It s possible AT T s internet business has simply bumped up against a temporary headwind  It could snap out of it and revive growth going forward  Never say never 
Given the data at hand  though  such an assumption takes a sizable leap of faith despite the company s blue chip status  Until there s clear evidence to the contrary  investors have to be concerned that the deteriorating broadband business only makes the AT T TV launch slated for February all the more challenging  If they re not AT T internet customers  it s awfully easy for them to become a user of any other competing video service ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppshu,2073705
220041,441557,T,HBO Max Has Already Cost AT T  1 2 Billion,news,"AT T  NYSE T  already outlined its plans to invest heavily in HBO Max  the streaming service aimed at broadening the appeal of its premium cable network  But that reality really hit home in the company s fourth quarter earnings report 
In its slide presentation accompanying the report  AT T notes its WarnerMedia segment forewent about  1 2 billion in licensing revenue by holding back content for HBO Max  WarnerMedia previously sold those shows externally to competitors like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  
At its investor day in October  AT T said it would see incremental investments of just  100 million in 2019  stepping up to  2 billion in 2020   Our incremental investment includes spending for new content  forgone licensing revenue of our content  and operating expenses for the direct to consumer platform and customer acquisition costs   AT T CFO John Stephens said at the presentation  emphasis mine  
Even if AT T pulled forward some of those forgone revenues from licensing existing shows  it might end up spending more than anticipated when you factor in its HBO Max originals and additional licensing expenses the service will start amortizing once it launches in May  plus the necessary investments in marketing and customer acquisition 

Hey big spender
Not only is HBO Max licensing a lot of content from its parent company  it s also investing in new originals exclusive to the streaming service while boosting the budget for its HBO linear network s programming 
HBO Max will launch with 31 original series in 2020  TV series have become increasingly expensive as competition in streaming ramps up  That s particularly noticeable at the top end of the market   On very competitive shows  there s probably been 30  price escalation from this time last year   Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos said during the company s third quarter earnings call  With several big names attached to its Max Originals    Anna Kendrick  Elizabeth Banks  and Ellen Degeneres  to name a few    AT T is probably paying a pretty penny to produce its new series 
On top of its Max Originals  AT T is stepping up the budget for HBO  The content budget will rise to  2 5 billion in 2020  up about  500 million from 2018 and 2019  It s not clear whether management includes that number in its definition of incremental investments  but considering everything available on HBO will also be on HBO Max  and its plans to get all of its legacy HBO subscribers onto HBO Max  it very well should count 
With  1 2 billion in forgone licensing revenue  it s likely HBO Max s spending will come in over budget for 2020 
Don t forget about marketing
AT T might have a built in audience with its 34 million HBO subscribers and 170 million total direct customer relationships  but it s still going to need to spend money on marketing and customer acquisition for HBO Max 
Netflix has seen its marketing budget climb considerably over the last few years as it grows its original content library  The company has shifted from marketing what Netflix is to focusing more on marketing specific series  films  and comedy specials in order to attract new viewers 
Likewise  HBO is already a well established brand  But AT T will need to inform consumers of the new value HBO Max provides on top of HBO  That means highlighting new series and films available on the service and explaining how HBO Max is different from HBO 
That won t be cheap  Netflix spent  2 65 billion on marketing last year  Even Disney is spending hundreds of millions on marketing for Disney  despite the media company s massive fan base and ability to promote the service at its parks and properties  AT T will need to spend a comparable amount if it wants to see success with the launch of the new service 
Not too big in the grand scheme of things
Going over its planned budget of  2 1 billion in incremental expenses for HBO Max across 2019 and 2020 won t be the end of the world for AT T  Ultimately  that s still a fraction of Netflix s budget  which will amortize about  12 billion in content expenses in 2020  Disney s budget for Disney  content  licensed and original  and operating expenses is a bit under  3 billion for fiscal 2020 
The  1 2 billion in forgone licensing revenue that popped up on AT T s latest report is a bit surprising given management s earlier guidance  but how big of an effect that ll have on AT T s bottom line ultimately comes down to the consumer response to the launch of HBO Max later this year ",2020-02-02,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pq22x,2073908
220042,441558,T,AT T Preferred Stock Offers a Safer Alternative to the Dividend,news,"Besides unsurprising fourth quarter earnings  AT T s  NYSE T  management confirmed the giant telecommunications and entertainment conglomerate was still on track to deliver results in line with its three year plan  which means the dividend should remain safe over the next several years  
Yet  besides a potential recession  the company s free cash flow and dividend depend on operational uncertainties  such as the decline rate of the legacy TV business and the success of the long awaited video streaming service HBO Max  Thus  AT T s preferred stock could represent an interesting alternative for investors looking for a safer income stream than the company s dividend 
How safe is the dividend 
After its recent 2  increase  the quarterly dividend of  0 52 per share represents an annual cash outflow of  15 09 billion  which is more than covered by the company s free cash flow that increased from  22 35 billion in 2018 to  29 03 billion in 2019 

In addition to paying its dividend  AT T reduced its debt load thanks to about  18 billion of asset divestitures  such as its stake in the video streaming service Hulu  now controlled by Disney  and its operations in Puerto Rico and the U S  Virgin Islands  
As a result  the company s net debt decreased to 2 5 times its adjusted EBITDA at the end of 2019  compared to 2 8 times a year ago  However  the net debt of  151 02 billion remains massive  
Management aims at increasing the dividend and reducing the debt load over the next couple of years  thanks to at least  30 billion of expected annual free cash flow by 2022  AT T s mobility segment  which includes its wireless business  should support the company s goals over the next several years thanks to the deployment of 5G 
Given this encouraging outlook  the dividend seems safe  and the current dividend yield above 5 5  remains attractive  But the company is facing some significant challenges that could have a negative impact on its medium term forecasts 
AT T must deal with the steep decline in its legacy video offerings because of the secular cord cutting phenomenon  During the last quarter  the number of subscribers to premium TV  which includes DirecTV  dropped to 19 5 million  down 945 000 year over year 
Obviously  the video streaming service HBO Max  which the company will launch in May  is supposed to offset the decline of its legacy video business  Management expects HBO Max to attract 50 million domestic subscribers by 2025  But given the intensifying competitive landscape with the new streaming services such as Disney s Disney   Comcast s Peacock  and Apple s Apple TV   the success of HBO Max remains uncertain 
With this challenging context  AT T s dividend could become less safe if the company s transition to video streaming delivers disappointing results 
Safer than the dividend
With its strategy of reducing the debt load  management diversified the company s capital structure  Instead of rolling over some debt  it issued  1 2 billion of preferred stock in December in the form of depositary shares    financial securities    that trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol T PA 
The dividend of this type of stock is safer than the common stocks  AT T would have to cut its common stock s dividend before its preferred stock s in case a prolonged recession or disappointing results lead to diminishing free cash flow  Also  in contrast with the common stock s dividend  the company will have to catch up on any missed preferred stock s dividend payment 
Obviously  there s no free lunch and you should also consider the drawbacks of this safer instrument 
First  AT T s preferred stock is currently trading above its issue price  which leads to a dividend yield of 4 8  that remains below the common stock s dividend yield of 5 5   Also  this preferred stock is callable as from December 2024 at its issue price of  25  which means the company will have the option to buy its preferred stock at that price  which would deprive investors of their income stream  And in general  preferred stocks become less attractive if interest rates rise  and their upside potential remains limited because of their fixed dividend  
Thus  AT T s preferred shares represent an interesting alternative for dividend oriented investors that prioritize the safety of their income stream over some upside potential 
But given the company s significant debt load in a challenging context  execution remains one of the most important factors investors in the common and preferred stocks should pay attention to over the next several quarters ",2020-02-03,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqgyl,2074553

Investing com   Movie studio Lions Gate Entertainment climbed Wednesday on speculation that it could be a hot acquisition commodity as the streaming wars heat up 

Shares of Lions Gate Entertainment  NYSE LGFa  rose 5  following a  naming it as a candidate to become the first Silicon Valley studio 

While huge deals by Walt   Disney    NYSE DIS  and AT T  NYSE T  make the merger space at the top extremely limited  streaming companies may want to snap up a mini studio for production like Lions Gate  MGM or Sony Entertainment  Forbes said 
A deal like that would also give suitors like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  or Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  a library of existing movie and TV content  it added 
That would be especially important as Disney turns up the heat  The House of Mouse just reported that its Disney  streaming service hit 26 5 million subscribers  The service can draw on an entire catalog of Disney  Marvel and Star Wars content 
Lions Gate owns franchises like  The Hunger Games  and  Twilight

220045,441561,T,How Safe Are AT T Stock and Its Dividend ,news,"A streak of annual payout hikes has helped to make AT T  NYSE T  a high yield dividend stock  Moreover  the excitement of 5G contributed to a 37 1  rise in the stock price during 2019 
However  shares have fallen so far in 2020  Competition and massive capital spending have worried investors  This may leave investors wondering if AT T stock can soon return to growth  adding share price appreciation to the returns it gives investors in the form of lucrative dividends 
AT T s dividend may look solid at first glance  The company s long history of phone and internet services has given the company a dividend that has increased every year for the last 35 years  The  2 08 per share annual payout in dividends yields 5 5   Moreover  assuming the merger of T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS  and Sprint  NYSE S  occurs  it will make AT T just one of three companies that will offer nationwide 5G service in the United States   Due to the massive cost of the 5G buildouts  neither Verizon  NYSE VZ  nor T Mobile will likely have the appetite for the price wars of the 3G and 4G eras  
But some investors may be spooked by AT T s payout ratio    the percentage of net income allocated to the dividend  The key ratio has risen to 108 5   leading to concerns about the future of AT T s payout  This compares to a manageable 52 47  for Verizon  

AT T has struggled to stay relevant
AT T stock has experienced pain in many areas besides price wars  Cord cutting decimated a once profitable pay TV business  Moves such as its purchase of DirecTV for  67 billion  including debt  at its peak have left it with massive obligations  The total debt has risen to  184 95 billion  a level not that far below the market cap of just over  265 1 billion 
Moreover  this blue chip company has had to spend tens of billions to build a 5G to keep itself relevant in the communications business  Across the world  analysts expect almost  1 trillion in worldwide 5G infrastructure costs between 2019 and 2025 
Yes  both Verizon and T Mobile also face this cost  However  Verizon  the only other dividend payer  took more of an  all in  strategy on 5G  foregoing the media ventures of AT T  This means the  240 billion company has   a more manageable debt level of  133 14 billion  Despite its lower 4 1  dividend yield  the lower debt makes this a safer dividend 
However  with the declining value of pay TV products  AT T s foreseeable future also depends primarily on the success of 5G  Regardless of how much AT T focuses on non 5G assets  the company is essentially all in on 5G from an investor standpoint  The fact that Verizon is more up front about this fact gives it the advantage 
AT T s stagnant stock price
For much of the latter 20th century  AT T stock climbed steadily  This changed following the dot com bust as investors sold stock and the nature of telecom began to make dramatic changes  As a result  AT T still trades at levels it first saw in 1998 

T data by YCharts
 
It does not help that the century ushered in the decline of a once reliable source of cash flow  the landline  The rise of streaming media in the 2010s encouraged a rash of cord cutting on its pay TV products  Streaming services such as Netflix  Amazon  Disney  and many others have induced millions to cut the cord 
The  remaining  case for AT T stock
However  the financial condition of AT T and the stock s decline so far in 2020 could entice investors  Despite the increases it saw in 2019  the forward P E ratio stands at around 9 7  
Also  while the current dividend exceeds net income  the company produced enough free cash flow in the previous quarter   8 191 billion  to meet the quarterly dividend obligation of  3 726 billion   Moreover  over time  the payout ratio should come down  The previous annual dividend increase from  2 04 per share to  2 08 per share amounted to a 1 96  increase   Wall Street forecasts average yearly profit growth of 4 90   pointing to an anticipated gradual reduction in the payout ratio over time  For these reasons  AT T appears to have a safer payout than the dividend payout ratio would indicate  
Interestingly  the stock s consistent dividend increases may help make this dividend safer  Dividend aristocrats  stocks with annual dividend increase streaks of at least 25 years  tend to continue their payout hikes 
Of course  any company that ends annual payout hikes could face short term  and possibly even long term  selling  Former dividend aristocrat Bank of America suffered for years after payout cuts  General Electric continues to struggle since it cut its dividend  Given the stock s underperformance over the past two decades  management probably does not want to give investors an additional reason to sell AT T stock  If the company can maintain its dividend streak  it more than likely will 
AT T should benefit as more customers adopt 5G  The lack of competition should give AT T  Verizon  and T Mobile significant pricing power 
Furthermore  the company has contemplated selling DirecTV  While that would mean it loses DirecTV  it would enable AT T to unload a money losing unit and give the company some capital to pay down its debt 
Consider AT T stock
AT T s dividend should remain safe  Given the potential of 5G and a high yielding  growing dividend  AT T stock may appeal to income oriented investors at first glance  However  the decline of once stable business units  as well as the cost of building out 5G  has hurt this company  During this time  the pressure of maintaining a dividend streak squeezed AT T 
However  the beginning of 5G could give AT T pricing power it has not seen in years  Additionally  if it sells assets such as DirecTV  it would have an opportunity to lower debt to more sustainable levels ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/przf1,2077911

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorWelcome to the AT T Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Michael Viola  Senior Vice President of Investor Relations  Please go ahead Mike Viola    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsThank you  and good morning  everyone  Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call  I m Mike Viola  Head of Investor Relations for AT T  And joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson  AT T s Chairman and CEO  John Stankey  Chief Operating Officer for AT T and John Stephens  AT T s Chief Financial Officer Randall will begin the call with a brief overview of the 2019 accomplishments and a look at our three year plans  John Stephens will then discuss fourth quarter results  And then John Stankey will walk you through key areas of our 2020 operating plan  John Stephens will then close the presentation with an update on our capital allocation plan and 2020 financial guidance  Then we ll take your questions Before I begin  I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement  which says that some of our comments today may be forward looking  And as such  they re subject to risks and uncertainties  results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website  I also want to remind you that we re in the quiet period for the FCC Spectrum Auction 103  so we cannot address any questions about that today  As always  our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations page of the AT T website  That includes our news release  investor briefing  8 K and other associated schedules And so with that  I m going to turn the call over to Randall Stephenson  Randall Randall L  Stephenson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Mike  I want to start on Slide 3 to close out 2019  And coming into 2019  we laid out a detailed plan for the year  And that plan was the series of specific steps necessary to exit 2019 on a path of sustained growth  A simple summary on Slide 3 is that we met or exceeded every single one of those objectives  And the roadmap is set for the next three years I told you that our top priority for 2019 was to reduce our debt and exit the year at around 2 5 times debt to EBITDA  done  We have now reduced net debt by about  30 billion since we closed Time Warner  And at the end of 2019  our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was about 2 5 times  We gave you the formula for exactly what it would take to get to this debt level  First  we would need to generate  26 billion of free cash flow  done  We exceeded that handily  generating a record  29 billion for the year  Second  we would need to monetize non strategic assets and generate  6 billion to  8 billion of cash  done  We actually generated nearly  18 billion  more than double our target  And we ve already announced an additional  2 billion which will close in 2020 On adjusted EPS  we came in right on plan  low single digit growth  At WarnerMedia  we achieved the 2019 merger synergies and we re preparing to launch HBO Max in May  Growing wireless service revenues was critical  and those revenues were up nearly 2  for the full year  We stabilized Entertainment Group EBITDA and brought in our capital investment right on plan  And after sustained investment in our network  AT T exited 2019 with the best and fastest wireless network in the United States  Our 5G network covers 50 million people today and we expect to have nationwide 5G coverage in the second quarter As we look forward  our 2019 performance positions us well for the next three years  Our plan is very straightforward  and we ve laid it out for you on Slide 4  We see revenue growth every year and expect a 1  to 2  three year CAGR through 2022  By 2022  adjusted EBITDA margins expand by 200 basis points  adjusted EBITDA grows by about  6 billion  free cash flow is between  30 billion and  32 billion and adjusted EPS grows to between  4 50 and  4 80 This is a plan that generates a lot of cash over the next three years  And the board has developed a very thoughtful capital allocation approach that will maintain a solid balance sheet and drive shareholder value  First  we ll continue to invest aggressively and at top tier levels into our core businesses  We expect to invest  20 billion in 2020  Leading in 5G is critical for AT T and we re not slowing down  We re more than 75  complete on our FirstNet build and that will continue and we re continuing to deploy fiber In terms of our capital structure  over the last 18 months  we retired the lion share of the debt we issued to acquire Time Warner  and we ll continue to pay down debt  but at a much slower pace  Our cash will be focused over the next three years on retiring the shares we issued to acquire Time Warner  By the end of 2022  we will have retired 100  of the debt and 70  of the shares from our Time Warner transaction  In fact  we retired 56 million of these shares in 2019  We also plan to retire about 100 million more in the first quarter of this year through a  4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement By 2022  our leverage target is a very comfortable  net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2 0 times to 2 25 times  You can also expect us to continue streamlining our portfolio  as we monetize additional assets of  5 billion to  10 billion this year  And as I said earlier  we ve already executed agreements that will generate  2 billion this year John Stephens will cover the specific steps in the plan later  but first he is going to cover our fourth quarter results  So I ll turn it over to you now  John John J  Stephens    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Randall  Let me begin with the financial summary on Slide 6  As Randall mentioned  we hit or exceeded all our 2019 targets  Let s take a closer look  We grew earnings  Adjusted EPS was  0 89  up 3 5  for the quarter and up 1 4  for the full year  Cash from operations came in strong at  11 9 billion for the quarter and  48 7 billion for the year  Free cash flow was a record  29 billion for the full year  up 30   The addition of WarnerMedia made an impact  as did adding their receivables to our securitization efforts  Our ability to generate cash continues to provide a strong foundation for our capital allocation plan We continued to aggressively invest  Capex was nearly  20 billion for the full year and total gross capital investment was  23 7 billion when you include our investments in FirstNet and other vendor payments  And without the impact of foreign exchange and foregone licensing revenue in advance of our HBO Max launch  fourth quarter and full year revenues would have been  48 billion and about  184 billion  representing growth in both the quarter and the year  Even with these items  operating income margins were stable in the quarter and up 70 basis points for the year  All in all  a very good year as we hit our 2019 targets Let s now look at our segment operating results  starting with our Communications segment on Slide 7  In our Communications segment  Mobility continues to build momentum and delivered solid results  Service revenue grew by about 2  in the quarter and for the year  EBITDA grew both in the quarter and for the year  And EBITDA margins expanded by 40 basis points for the year  while service margins were stable even with a heavily promotional fourth quarter Postpaid phone growth was solid  adding 229 000 in the quarter  For the year  we had about 1 million phone net adds  both postpaid and prepaid  This strong performance was driven by our industry leading network and came even while postpaid phone churn was up as competitors ramped up promotional efforts  You should note  total churn  postpaid and prepaid combined  improved year over year by 12 basis points As Randall mentioned  our Entertainment Group hit its full year target of EBITDA stability  Long term customer value continues to be our focus as we head into 2020  That focus itself drive growth in video and IP broadband ARPUs  AT T Fiber continues to grow  adding nearly 200 000 customers  That brings us to nearly 4 million AT T Fiber customers and we have lots of room left to grow  Premium video net losses improved sequentially by more than 200 000 subscribers  but video losses continue to impact our broadband numbers  especially our bundled customers  Our new simplified video offerings position us for the long term and our subscriber trends are improving Let s turn to Business Wireline  The trends in Business Wireline continue to improve  Revenues grew sequentially and were down just 1 7  year over year  And when you include wireless  business solutions grew 1 1   EBITDA was relatively steady in the quarter and EBITDA margins were up 40 basis points Let s move to WarnerMedia and Latin America results  which are on Slide 8  WarnerMedia had a great quarter when you consider the decision to forego content licensing revenue  Subscriber revenue growth at both Turner and HBO combined with lower film and television production costs at Warner Bros  help to offset that pressure  We made the strategic decision to give HBO Max exclusive streaming rights for top programs  including Friends  Big Bang Theory and other popular shows  In the past  we would have sold these externally Looking at the impact in the fourth quarter  WarnerMedia revenues would have grown by about 10  if these shows would have been sold  In fact  that 10  organic growth would represent WarnerMedia s best growth rate in three years  And EBITDA would have increased by about  300 million or about 11   Obviously  this has an upfront cost for us  but we see this as an investment that makes HBO Max even stronger and will pay off over the long term The big news in our Latin American operations is Mexico turning EBITDA positive in the quarter  The team has done an excellent job of reducing costs and growing revenue in a challenging environment  Fourth quarter Mexico EBITDA improved nearly  200 million year over year and grew by more than  300 million for the full year  We continue to press for further gains  A new wholesale agreement with Telefonica will add to both revenues and EBITDA  Going forward  we expect continued improvement  Vrio continues to work against economic and foreign exchange headwinds  But even in this environment  it continues to be profitable and generate positive cash flows Now let me turn it over to John Stankey to cover our 2020 operating plans and then I ll come back and discuss our capital allocation update  John John Stankey    President   Chief Operating Officer  AT T Inc  and Chief Executive Officer  Warner Media LLCThanks  John  and good morning  everyone  Starting on Slide 10  these are the four key areas of our 2020 operating plan where we will be focused in executing to drive our performance  I ll go into some detail on each of these over the next few minutes  but I ll give you the headlines first Number one is continuing our momentum in Mobility  because we expect Mobility will continue to be the biggest driver of revenue growth and profitability and be a key factor in meeting our 2020 goals  Second  a successful launch of HBO Max is critical to our plans in each of the next three years  Many of you were with us for the Analyst Day in October and have seen firsthand why we re so excited about HBO Max and the opportunities it gives us  We re right on track to launch it in May  Third is growing our broadband revenues by increasing our fiber penetration  Key to this will be bundling our fiber broadband offer with AT T TV  which has delivered over our software based video architecture  Finally  we re laser focused on improving both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our overall operations  and as a result  driving additional costs out of the business Let me dive into each of these four drivers  beginning with Mobility on Slide 11  Last year  our wireless network was recognized as the nation s best and also fastest  Thanks in part  to our FirstNet build  In fact  we did a few of our own spot tests in December to see how our existing nationwide 5G Evolution network compared to the 5G network  one of our competitors rolled out last month  In three out of the four test cities  our network had faster speeds and lower latency on average Point is  our strong spectrum position gives us a leg up and allows us to execute a different 5G deployment strategy than our competitors  We have the low and mid band spectrum to deploy 5G nationwide  We cover 50 million people today and expect to be nationwide in the second quarter  We also have the millimeter wave spectrum we need to deploy 5G  and its gigabit speeds and super low latency to more densely populated cities  We re in 35 cities today and we re adding more this year There is an important point to be made here once we have 5G nationwide  As you know  smartphone upgrades across the industry have been down for a while now  In fact  we re coming off a record low upgrade rate for any fourth quarter in our history  But fast forward to the back half of this year when popular 5G smartphones and devices should be more available at scale  you can expect higher upgrade rates and equipment revenue growth  The timing for this upgrade cycle couldn t be more perfect when you consider that we ll be offering HBO Max on our highest ARPU wireless plans with features tuned for premium media consumption  and then at the time when people are coming into our stores to upgrade  It s a natural opportunity to further the distribution of HBO Max  while adding new Mobility subscribers and improving our wireless ARPUs HBO Max s content has something for everyone in the family  And that makes it a natural fit for our nearly 25 million postpaid accounts that average more than three lines per account  As a result  we expect our wireless service revenue growth rate to be higher in 2020  And after adding nearly 1 million phone net adds in 2019  both postpaid and prepaid  we expect 2020 will be an even better year for net adds  FirstNet plays an important role here  We now serve more than 10 000 first responder agencies and more than 1 million connections with FirstNet  We expect those numbers will grow nicely as our FirstNet deployment reaches 80   and new devices and capabilities come to market in the coming months We also expect a higher adoption of our unlimited plans  We re at a little more than 50  penetration today  but we expect the 5G device upgrade cycle will bring into our stores lots of customers not on unlimited plans today  Increasing the adoption of our best unlimited plans is obviously an ARPU growth opportunity for us  When you add into the mix of customers on select unlimited plans will get HBO Max for free  it s a great opportunity to also improve our overall churn  which we ve seen happen from giving HBO to current unlimited customers  A reduction of one basis point of wireless churn across the base is worth about  100 million to us annually  To sum it up  we re expecting growth of more than 2  in Mobility service revenues this year Let s go to Slide 12 and the headlines for why we believe HBO Max will be a game changer for our customers and for AT T  I expect many of you were at the HBO Max Analyst Day in October  And you heard me talk about the three pillars required for success in streaming  premier content  the technology platform and marketing and distribution  Only AT T enters this space with a solid footing in all three My excitement and confidence in the HBO Max opportunity have only grown since then  The team has made tremendous progress in every area and we re on track to launch in May with a unique offering  Quite simply  we believe HBO Max will be the highest quality premium SVOD in the market with the great experience  better curation and higher percentage of culturally relevant offerings than competing products We re excited to launch HBO Max coming off the tail one of one of our strongest award seasons ever  with new and exciting breakthrough offerings leading the way  We captured an industry leading 34 Emmys and 6 Golden Globe Awards  Joker had more Academy Award nominations than any other film  highlighting our deep and diverse theatrical content  The awards are only the latest indicator that we continue to create high quality  culturally relevant content that appeals to a broad consumer base  And our additional investment in great content is only going to expand the appeal of the service With HBO Max  we ll offer consumers more than twice the amount of programming for the same price as HBO today  We re making great progress on the HBO product platform as well  Our controlled non public beta is getting solid reviews and we re gaining invaluable feedback on important  but subtle issues like user navigation and screen layout  This work is no less important than award winning content Finally  we continue to fine tune our go to market plans consistent with the unique position with which we enter the market  leveraging our extensive AT T distribution and embedded base of more than 30 million domestic HBO subscribers  We re in active discussions across our potential distribution partners  both digital platforms and MVPDs  We re making progress  and we expect we ll have deals to announce prior to launch  Our focus continues to be on providing a compelling value proposition for our HBO distribution partners and our mutual customers  Our more than 10 million HBO subscribers on AT T distribution platforms will be offered immediate access to HBO Max at launch  So we ll get off to a fast start To drive incremental growth  we have unique advantages when combining media and distribution  including our 170 million direct customer relationships across mobile  pay TV and broadband  Plus  we have 5 500 retail stores who will be focused on driving incremental HBO Max adoption by bundling it with premium tiered wireless  broadband or pay TV offers and will use AT T customer insights for WarnerMedia advertising analytics and curation We have very high expectations for HBO Max  And at the same time  we re thrilled about the possibilities of increasing the adoption of higher ARPU services and strengthening the long term value proposition of our highest quality and highest ARPU customers  We fully expect HBO Max will have a positive and immediate impact on the stickiness of our wireless and pay TV and broadband offerings Now let s look at Entertainment Group  those details are on Slide 13  Our EG team delivered our target of stable EBITDA last year  In 2020  you re going to see a supply of the same high value customer centric focus  while increasing our fiber customer base and launching AT T TV  We ll see higher amortization costs in the video business in the first quarter  which creates some tough year over year comparisons for EG EBITDA  But on a cash from operations basis  we expect EG to be stable in 2020 versus last year We believe the greatest opportunity within EG is to significantly grow our AT T Fiber customer base and broadband revenues  We have 4 million fiber customers today  and our recent fiber expansion gives us 14 million locations to sell into  Based on our fiber sales experience  we expect to exit 2022 with about 3 million more fiber customers than we have today or a total of about 7 million  This will be a significant lift in market share compared to our traditional performance in our legacy hybrid fiber copper base footprint It represents an organic market share growth opportunity on an existing product that I ve never experienced in my career  Where we offer competitive broadband speeds  you can expect that we ll lean into video acquisition given the better economics of our improved product portfolio  including AT T TV and HBO Max  all software based products with low acquisition costs  Within our broadband footprint  expected as we exit the year  our premium video subscriber declines will be more in line with overall video industry trends  Looking at our total premium video customer base  we expect year over year improvements in subscriber losses Now let s turn to Slide 14 to talk about our efficiency and cost initiatives  New work to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our operations has progressed over the past few months  We ve previously shared with you that we re targeting an additional 4  reduction in labor related costs  including benefits and contract employees in 2020 alone  That work will ramp quickly and we plan for it to deliver  1 5 billion in additional cost savings  In fact  we ve already identified and implemented about half of those savings Another significant opportunity for us is product and information technology rationalization  We feel comfortable that we can generate another  2 billion of annual run rate efficiencies  exiting 2022  This will come from winning our product portfolio  simplifying our market offers  rationalizing call centers  modernizing our information technology and enhancing the level of customer self support  In addition  streamlining will have the added benefit of enhancing our market agility that ultimately lead to improved market effectiveness  Our assessment work continues  And I expect in the next 90 days we ll have additional efficiency initiatives under way for some of our network  corporate  sales and procurement functions I ll turn it back to John now for his look at capital allocation  2020 financial guidance John J  Stephens    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  John  Strengthening our balance sheet was our top priority last year and our teams did an excellent job of reducing debt and monetizing our asset portfolio  This allowed us to begin retiring shares at the end of last year  while still meeting our net debt ratio goals  In 2020  you can expect that momentum to continue It all starts with strong free cash flows  We had record free cash flow last year and expect to be in a similar range this year  We achieved this even with some voluntary funding for retiring medical costs and higher tax payments in the fourth quarter  We also overachieved on asset monetizations  We expect to do another  5 billion to  10 billion net monetizations this year  with significant efforts already under way  At the same time  we continue to evolve our capital structure  We added more preferred to our capital stack last year when we monetized more than  6 billion of our long term tower purchase options  And we also issued  1 2 billion of traditional preferred stock The publicly traded preferred stock is new to us  but there is a market for it and it provides investors another alternative to invest with AT T  In fact  these shares are currently trading at a premium to par  Investors are looking for secure  dependable returns  which is exactly what this offers and dividend rates as less than our common stock dividend yield make it attractive for us  The tower preferreds also allow us to use very long term assets to generate cash at a tax efficient manner We are also continuing to be focused on our three year debt reduction targets  Depending on the timing of share retirements and asset monetizations  you will see our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios fluctuate throughout the year  But we expect to continue reducing debt for the full year and intend to target leverage in the 2  to 2 25  range by the end of 2022 Our share retirement has begun in earnest  We told you we wanted to buy shares as early in the year as possible  and that is what you are seeing  Thanks to our  4 billion ASR  we ve already bought back about 85 million shares in January  and expect to see another 20 million in the remainder of the first quarter  You can expect us to continue to buy back shares during the remainder of the year and meet or exceed our 250 million share retirement target for 2020  That s on top of the 56 million shares we bought back in 2019 We have a lot of levers we can pull to optimize our capital structure  We re focused on managing debt and have a wealth of opportunities with our balance sheet as we showed last year  You can expect us to continue to manage it in a prudent way including issuing additional preferred shares Now let me revisit our 2020 guidance on Slide 17  Our guidance remains consistent with what we told you in October  This year  more so than most  our results will be more weighted to the second half of the year  For example  in the first part of the year  we expect pressure from heavy HBO Max investment  which you saw begin in the fourth quarter  And in EG  higher content and non cash amortization costs  as well as continued pressure on video subs  But in the second half of the year  you will see our momentum build  For example  share retirements have been aggressive and will continue and the EPS benefits will flow increasingly throughout the year  HBO Max will have launched  leading to strong subscriber growth  The run rate benefits of our cost reduction plans will be clearly visible  And 5G  combined with HBO Max  will drive more upgrades and stronger wireless revenue growth later in the year  Again  all of this has been factored into our full year guidance With that in mind  here s what we ve committed to  1  to 2  revenue growth  Adjusted EPS of  3 60 to  3 70 a share  Stable adjusted EBITDA margins  Free cash flow in the  28 billion range with our dividend payout ratio in the low 50s  Gross capital investment in the  20 billion range and this doesn t include our investments in content  Continued debt reduction with share retirement of 250 million or more common shares in 2020  And our net asset monetizations between  5 billion and  10 billion Mike  that concludes our presentation  We re now ready for Q A Mike Viola    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsOperator  we ll take the first question Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulik  Please go ahead John Hodulik    UBS    AnalystGreat  Thank you  Maybe a couple of questions for John Stankey  Yeah  thanks for the commentary on the entertainment sub trends  but maybe a little bit more clarity  I mean first of all  you saw a slowdown in fiber adds in the quarter  what was driving that  And I guess in conjunction with the guidance for sort of more improvement in the back end of the year  do you expect that trend to reverse  Or when    how do you    do you expect those adds to sort of play out over the course of the year and what drives the acceleration  And then in terms of the HBO Max guidance  the  500 million in incremental expense we saw in  19  does that impact your guidance for the  2 billion in 2020  Thanks John Stankey    President   Chief Operating Officer  AT T Inc  and Chief Executive Officer  Warner Media LLCHi  John  Happy New Year  So first of all  fourth quarter of  19  fourth quarter is seasonally a slower quarter  December is a pretty slow month in general for home based services given the dynamics of the holiday and the like  So that s part of the contribution to the issue of the slowdown  The second is  our gross add performance on video wasn t strong  You see the subscriber trends as we ve shared with you  as we move through this year and we start shifting to AT T TV  our gross add performance starts to get much stronger  And naturally  when you re able to put AT T TV  a software based product with fiber  it s a much more natural combination than a satellite dish and fiber  And so as we start to rollout AT T TV now in markets and we move in  we re going to see much stronger performance on the fiber side I ll tell you as I look at where we are right now and current customer trends  I feel pretty good that that s in fact the case and we re going to be where we need to be on that  Frankly it s not a hard sell  it s a great product  it s a product that customers like  I think we can do very well with it  and I don t expect that we re going to see that continue through  So that s what I would tell you  you re going to see recovery in  20 On the Max side  we gave you a range on what to expect in 2020 in terms of dilution and we re not changing any of that range  The range is a range for a reason  There is a lot of moving parts on Max introduction  It s a combination of both  going to market with subscribers and it s a product that s going to continue to grow over the coming years and we re going to be looking in the market for opportunities for other content acquisition and the like  And it s entirely possible we may be opportunistic or look at something and we want the management team to have that flexibility to be able to balance those things out We have subscriber growth coming and things are working well with our strategies  We may go a little heavier on trying to build up subscribers and what we expected  I think that s the nature of building a new and subscription oriented business  And so that range is important that we have the flexibility for the management team to do what they want to do  We feel very strongly we re going to get back that investment as we build this new distribution platform over the coming years  That s why we re doing this  We like the dynamic of ultimately having some control of those customers and being in a position where we can manage that lifecycle going forward  And we think it s a good smart long term investment John Hodulik    UBS    AnalystOkay  Thanks  John OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick  Please go ahead Philip Cusick    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  guys  Thanks  John  can you update us on the WarnerMedia strategy from here away from Max  We see video industry bundled units declining pretty quickly even away from you as you decelerate  How does that change your thoughts on Turner over time and the strategic value there  And then can you also give us an update on the low value video subs that are remaining in the base and how those should come out over the next few quarters  Thanks very much John Stankey    President   Chief Operating Officer  AT T Inc  and Chief Executive Officer  Warner Media LLCSure  Happy to do that  Phil  So if you step back and think about the position we sit in  in the    what I would call the traditional pay TV universe  I mean everybody knows it s in transition  And it s a mature product that s kind of working its way through the back end of a life cycle  But I like where we stand in that and that our total percentage of cost of goods sold in that space relative to the size of the bundle that the customer buys is not huge Our network portfolio is a fairly concentrated network portfolio  If you think about it  the bulk of our profitability comes from three primary networks  it s TNT  TBS  and CNN  And I think if you look at trends  we all know that general entertainment content and the bundle is not performing as well and the nice part about our two general entertainment networks  TNT and TBS is  they re really hybrids  They re a combination of general entertainment and sports  And so they historically perform at the upper end of desirability from a ratings perspective and attractiveness from an advertisers  perspective because of that mix of content that we have  So one  having more contained portfolio  and two  having that mix of content I think is important to basically ride through this transition and have some resiliency And my view of what s been happening in most carriage agreement negotiations  as we go back out in the market and renew things is our distributors see that and understand that those are important networks to carry forward  And we re continuing to see that people place value on those things even in a more skinny down or a smaller pay TV universe moving forward and feel pretty good about that Now  let s be clear  the reason we re doing Max is we also know that new distribution platforms need to be out there that are the growth platforms and that match general entertainment content how consumers want to see them  And that pivot between what we re doing with linear networks and what we re doing with Max is a key part of the WarnerMedia strategy  It s an important dance and choreography that we have to do to get that right  And we feel we re positioned very well and make that happen  We spent a lot of time in the Investor Day explaining why we think it s a natural place to go To keep the networks relevant  what you should expect us to do  we will continue to invest in them  We ll continue to make sure that they re viable for our distributors  But you ll see the content shift start to occur a little bit  What we see with subscribers is that obviously they like news and sports  They also like content that s socially relevant  And so probably a mix of starting to see a little bit more unscripted content come in  things that cause people go into the office and talk about it around the water cooler  And that will probably start to supplant hours that might have been more general entertainment oriented content that you are going to see showing up on SVOD platforms like HBO Max moving forward And we think that mix in conjunction with what we re doing with Max will allow us to ensure that the content we re producing in our great studios across our different brands will have a place to market that we can monetize with end users either through distributors in the traditional fashion or through direct to consumer constructs where maybe we have a direct relationship with the customer On the subscriber pay TV low value construct  look  we re mostly through that  I would tell you we ve got a little bit more work to do on some promotional roll offs in the first quarter that is going to continue to show up  And when we shared  as I shared earlier  what s going to happen on subscriber trends that I think will be more at the rate of decline by the time we exit this year  you should expect you re going to see continuing improvement in our subscriber trends each quarter as we move through  But I will tell you  you just can t flip a switch and get there overnight  And that s why I m kind of suggesting you should think that we re on a glide path to get back to that ratable decline with subscriber base decline in the aggregate pay TV industry by the time we exit the year We re going to see probably our heaviest losses in first quarter  When I look at what s happening from an operational performance perspective and what the team is doing on gross add improvements  what we re seeing in churn improvements  the rollout of AT T TV that really hits its stride in the second quarter in terms of its availability across the customer base  we ll start to see those subscriber trends incrementally improve as those capabilities start to roll into the base  And we ll get to what I just indicated by the time we exit the year Philip Cusick    J P  Morgan    AnalystThat s helpful  Thanks  John Mike Viola    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsTake the next question  Greg OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery  Please go ahead Simon Flannery    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  Good morning  Thank you  Randall  we put out a lot of targets here for 2020 and beyond  Perhaps you could just share about how the executive incentives are being set up for the year  what the KPIs and metrics are  I know last year deleveraging was I think 25  of the short    or 20  of the short term comp  So any color you could give around what the kind of two or three key focuses are for the year  And then one for John Stankey  You talked about the investment in the network  the capacity there  I think in the past you ve talked about the opportunities in the wholesale market  Perhaps you could just give us an update on how things are going there and the opportunity perhaps to sign up some cable companies  Thanks Randall L  Stephenson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Simon  This is Randall  Yeah  as you articulated and for those who aren t familiar  coming into 2019  I told all of you that our number one priority for 2019 was to reduce our debt and get our leverage ratios down to that 2 5 times debt to EBITDA  And it was going to require strong cash flow generation  selling some non core assets  All that was instrumental in getting there  And to really drive at home and get the focus for the management team  as you said  we set that debt to EBITDA target as a significant amount of executive compensation  and mission accomplished I think the team executed at an amazing level in terms of identifying asset opportunities to dispose  getting those things driven through the process  negotiated  actually getting good prices for all of those assets and then driving just strong cash flows and some impressive working capital opportunities we re taking advantage of and these working capital initiatives that are put in place are not one and done  What we re most excited about are these are working capital initiatives that are repeatable  And so I feel really good about our ability to generate in 2020 even with the HBO Max investments another  28 billion of free cash flow Coming into this year  the debt objective of 2 5 times isn t what we re working toward  What we re working toward is making sure we re continuing to generate the cash flow to execute the broader capital allocation strategy  meaning more specifically  retiring the shares we issued for Time Warner  And as both John Stephens and I articulated in our opening comments  that is a focus  and our objective is to retire at least 250 million additional shares this year  We ll get about 100 million of those knocked out in the first quarter  And there s at least 150 million more to be coming in the back part of the year that will generate nice EPS accretion as we move throughout the course of the year And so all that said  the management team is going to be focused on hitting these earnings objectives that we ve laid out for you and the cash flow targets  And that s what compensation will be really focused on  And I think it s going to be effective in generating the cash we need to execute the share buyback programs and the overall capital allocation strategy John Stankey    President   Chief Operating Officer  AT T Inc  and Chief Executive Officer  Warner Media LLCSimon  thanks for asking the question because I think it highlights a really important aspect of how we re going to grow wireless revenues next year because we already have that strength as you indicated the network performance and that perception  As we do research out  the market is now starting to grow among the customer base  I think we have some plans to even fine tune our brand positioning messages as we move into this year a little bit more  And we know that as we move that perception  which is happening right now  we see momentum in subscriber growth And so we ve got just pure subscriber economics that are going to help us there  make some shifts in distribution  We ve got the tailwinds of FirstNet behind us  which are starting to help us dramatically  And I think the coverage improvements that occur as we get into the second phase of FirstNet will allow us to move through that  And then we talked about just a few minutes ago what we re doing on the upgrade cycles and the Max launch  There s a lot of good things moving our direction what I would call the core organic part of the wireless business to grow revenues And frankly  over the last several years  our wholesale business had been a bit of a headwind in our wireless business because we didn t have the flash capacity that we ve now been able to turn up with these key investments over the last year and a half  We re now in a much different position than we ve historically been and where we ve had to be very guarded about our wholesale position largely because we needed capacity to support our retail base  And we re now  I think in a position in the industry when I look at what has to happen with people either in a deal or no deal situation in spectrum and their spectrum holdings that we are probably more flashed than others in the industry  And we can in fact play in a different way in the wholesale space We re not just focused on cable  I think we want to do  as I ve indicated previously  the right deal  a deal that s constructive for the industry in general  Certainly if there was an opportunity to do something in that space  we might do it  But there s a lot of other wholesale options out there that we expect to lean into and I expect we can step up to in the most accretive fashion possible And what I would indicate to you that I think whether you believe a T Mobile  Sprint deal occurs or doesn t occur  either way they are going to need to be partners in the industry that need to round out networks and do some things differently  And we would also try to understand whether or not we have other partners in the industry  emerging partners in the industry that we can help with on the wholesale side So there are plenty of options for us to go and start pulling that wholesale lever and driving it up  And I think that will be an incremental difference for us than what we ve seen over the last couple of years that we ve been managing that number down John J  Stephens    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSimon  to add to what John said  this is the first year that we ve had stable reseller revenues throughout the year  And in fact  sequentially  we grew reseller revenues and in year over year and the fourth quarter  So what John is talking about  we are not only well positioned for  but it s starting in a small way right now but with the opportunity to make much bigger  It s already occurring and it s contributing to that service revenue growth that we ve had both in the quarter and the year Simon Flannery    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  thanks Mike Viola    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsOkay  Thanks  Simon  Greg  we ll take the next question OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Barden  Please go ahead David Barden    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey guys  Thanks for taking the question  I guess two  first John Stankey  Your    it sounds like you guys really have bought into this idea of 5G smartphone super cycle  And I feel like that is not a consensus view  I know that there s a lot of debate about it internally here between our tech guys and our chipset guys and our phone guys  And so if you could kind of give us some perspective on where that conviction comes from that we re going to get enough of a boost in demand for products that  I don t know that the consumers really understand it s a lot different than what they re already buying that would be super helpful And then John Stephens  could you walk us through the science behind this kind of new embrace of the preferred securities  Because it seems a little odd to be buying back stock  but then at the same time issuing preferred stock and debt has deductible interest and preferreds don t  And so I think that there s some confusion as to kind of what the net benefit to the equity holder is of kind of looking at preferreds and capital stack  Thanks John Stankey    President   Chief Operating Officer  AT T Inc  and Chief Executive Officer  Warner Media LLCHi Dave  So I don t know that I would use the term super cycle  I don t look at the plan and say  we re expecting a super cycle  but we are expecting an increase or a step up in what s occurring  And look  I think that the foundation of that assumption is based on we ve done a couple of different area interface changes  We did the UMTS air interface change  we did the LTE air interface change  And I think there were similar discussions going on at that point in time  Well  will somebody really need the increased LTE speed over UMTS  It works perfectly fine And I would tell you we do see this step up occur because naturally speaking people have a tendency to sit around and run speed test on their devices  And when somebody next to them is getting better performance  it raises awareness among the subscriber base  And I expect that there s going to be a certain number of folks who look at that and just say because that device performs better because these new devices have access to a much broader swath of bands it s going to perform better  And we are going to see a degree of uptick simply because the subscriber base is going to notice that there is a degree of performance  etc  as a result of that Secondly  as I said  we re going to be driving some of this ourselves  We re going to be out there with some pretty aggressive promotion on HBO Max and we re going to be tying these to our better plans  And when you look at what we re assuming in our business plan for the year  our increases in the number of customers moving into unlimited aren t crazy silly step function changes  They re more of the trend and taking advantage of the fact that we are going to put more advertising dollars into the market to support Max and support 5G  And we ll get some nominal uptick in what those migrations into our higher value unlimited plans are  So we want to stimulate some of that  We re coming off of historic lows of upgrades  And we think the market is set up to basically go through renewal cycle given how we re promoting  It s coming at the end of the year in the holiday season  There s going to be better networks out there  We do expect there s going to be an uptick in the upgrade cycle  Super cycle maybe a little bit too strong a word than an uptick  yes John J  Stephens    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerDavid  just to add to what John said  we have had three years here of very low upgrade rates  Just to some extent people are going to need new phones  And so this is just also this aging of the phone base has been occurring over multiple years  Secondly  this is the first time we re going to have a 5G network up and running and available before the devices are out  the next generation networks in there  And as John made very clear  the HBO Max and other products we have they re going to really meld well  The convergence of all three of those things is going to be really attractive for us With regard to the science of a preferred  it s simply this  The market is open to it  Investors want it  They like this certainty  At today s rates  our preferred that s out there is actually trading below 5  yield  about a 4 7   4 8   I am seeing it today about a 4 8  yield  So that s lower cash cost than our common dividend  so that saves us money there  Secondly  as you know they don t share in the common profits of it  Third  it s a diversification for us  And so it gives us an opportunity to go into a different investor base  So just like we had done over the last 10 years have really diversified our debt base  This gives us an opportunity to diversify our shareholder base  And we believe that that s good for everybody and also allows us to bring in the volume or the quantum of common shares that are out there Additionally  when you look at the preferred partnership interest that we ve done and the preferred interest  we ve done there  that has a very efficient    those dividend costs are much lower because they re very tax efficient  So those costs get well below 4   And once again  they allow us to give recognition to assets that people may not have realized  For example  our tower receivables and over  6 billion worth of real option cash that we have a high likelihood of getting  I don t know that anybody was paying much attention to that  Now it gives us the opportunity to put that spotlight that we really already achieved that value So    but the clear science of the preferred is  one  the dividend costs are lower than our common  second  they re stable and our common is going to continue to grow  third  it gets us to another market segment  another investor base which is helpful  and fourth  that allows us to reduce the reliance on the common share base that s out there  For that perspective  we feel very good about  I feel like it s a really    it s a good move for all of our shareholders Mike Viola    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsThanks  Dave  Greg  we ll take the next question OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins  Please go ahead Michael Rollins    Citigroup    AnalystThanks  and good morning  If you fast forward to the end of your financial plan in 2022 given the capex that you ve articulated  can you frame what the network capabilities are going to look like for 5G mobile  fixed wireless broadband coverage and fiber to the home coverage  And then secondly  can you just unpack a little more of what you see driving the strength in industry wireless postpaid phone net add  And as you look at your own customer trend  are you seeing any meaningful differences in customers and markets that have 5G Evolution versus those that haven t received it yet  Thanks John Stankey    President   Chief Operating Officer  AT T Inc  and Chief Executive Officer  Warner Media LLCSure  So Mike  let me see if I can hit a combination of things you laid out  So first of all  I think one of the significant shifts you ll see in 2022 by the time we get to that point and a lot of this is being driven by work on FirstNet is  I think we ll be in a much better position on macro coverage and not only from a number of square miles  but I think you re going to see the improvement in core interior performance given how we densify things to support our FirstNet subscribers and the agencies we have there And as I said  this is really    where last year was a year of us getting coverage  macro coverage in place kind of getting the umbrella  the footprint turned up this year is where we do a lot of the    make the network better stuff  So we ve been doing all the site acquisition  all the fill in  And we start turning up sites and just going to make the network better  It s going to make the network better on the inside of a building that s going to make the network better in terms of the square miles that are covered  And when you add that to the great spectrum position that you re already seeing and the wonderful reviews of speed and performance that we re getting back on test today  that only makes things stronger Secondly  we are as you know in filling with millimeter wave and we ve already turned up over 30 markets with millimeter wave  We re continuing to increase that footprint  And we re going to be very opportunistic of where we can do that  We re in a unique position especially in the places where we offer wireline businesses that we can densify on a fiber infrastructure in a way that s really economic and is advantageous to our cost structure as we move forward  That millimeter wave fill in is where you re going to get unique performance characteristics  It will be obviously  probably more pronounced in the urban areas of large cities Our plan right now is we re not as optimistic as maybe some are on what I would call the fixed wireless replacement construct  We obviously believe there ll be some part of the subscriber base that might decide that they don t need a fixed broadband connection  I think that s going to take a couple of years to start to emerge when you get the density a little bit more robust  I think as we see more mid band spectrum coming in place to support the millimeter wave and make the performance a little bit more consistent  So I wouldn t tell you any of our financial plans and our business plans  We re out there expecting wonderful revenue increases from a push in the fixed wireless space On what we do in the fixed space  you should expect that we re going to continue to add to the wireless    excuse me  the fiber footprint  Right now as we ve shared with you  our goal is to get a little better return out of what we ve deployed because between consumer and business we have about 20 million locations  we can be aggressively working penetration in  And we think that we need to ensure we ve got the right business practices and marketing practices to get the return on that footprint that s there And as soon as I get indications that the team is actually executing on that well and we have the right formula on it  we ll probably release the ticket on some additional bill  You should expect just by natural growth of the population  you ll probably see somewhere between 350 000 to 0 5 million new fiber locations coming into the portfolio  Right now that is just kind of what I would call the natural growth rate that s going to happen  If we step that up a little bit  it will be because we feel good about how we re executing on the embedded footprint we have in place  And we know exactly where the next incremental place as we go and build  And I think it s entirely possible that this operating team could build another 1 million to 2 million a year  if we felt like we had the operating momentum to do that On the postpaid trends  look there s    the difference between prepaid and postpaid is changing  It s getting    they re getting closer together  We ve been in a situation where we frankly as we shared with you our prepaid base looks a lot more like a postpaid base in what may be the broader industry prepaid base looks like  Once we get these folks on prepaid  once we get them on smartphones  we start seeing churn characteristics with multi line accounts that are very similar to what we have in postpaid  And so  I think as the economies improve  as the differences between the two products have gotten a little less  as smartphones have worked their way into the prepaid base because of the cycle of maybe previous generation phones being available  we see customers now starting to opt into a postpaid construct Does that reverse itself if we see some economic headwinds and maybe people become a little bit more careful about what they do  That s possible  But the net of it is when you look at whether a customer goes with our prepaid offer or a postpaid offer  we have a lot of similar characteristics between the two  It s    we can hit them in both places  But we feel very comfortable that we can catch the transition if there s more of a move to postpaid which is what I think is occurring  largely driven by economy and the way the networks are performing and the differences between the two products Mike Viola    Senior Vice President Investor RelationsThanks  Mike  Greg  we ll take one more question OperatorOkay  That question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar  Please go ahead Kannan Venkateshwar    Barclays    AnalystThank you  A couple if I could  Firstly  I mean  when you think about the decline rates of video at DIRECTV  although it will moderate over the course of 2020 based on your guidance  If at some point  DIRECTV becomes smaller than say Comcast and because of the video losses and those lines cross  is there any kind of an impact on your programming cost because of the most stable nation clauses and others that you get on account of your scale  And how does that impact margins if it does  And secondly  when you think about the attach rates for broadband in video homes  could you give us a sense of what that is  And within the base of homes that you ve lost as a result of the promotional roll offs last year  is it in line with the average or is it higher or lower  That will help us get a sense of where trends are  Thanks John Stankey    President   Chief Operating Officer  AT T Inc  and Chief Executive Officer  Warner Media LLCSo the short answer to your first question  Kannan is  no  We    first of all  as you re aware  we went through a fairly significant renegotiation cycle over the last 12 months  So those are all baked in the bag through the next three to five years depending on the nature of the particular content  and I don t see any exposure in any of those agreements that would suggest we re not going to continue to pay at the best part of the rate card given the size and the scale of our business as we move forward I think frankly  what s more likely to happen in pay TV moving forward is what I talked about earlier  where I think there ll be some pruning and trimming of offers in the market  As folks move forward to manage their cost of goods sold on programming costs  it will be dropping or shifting away from less traffic networks  I think that s going to be a bigger driver of cost structure than renegotiation or anything around that  But we re pretty well baked in that regard As you know  one of the things we re working through is  we have a step up in our content cost as a result of that significant renegotiation work we did last year  We re going to have to work through that in 2020  And then in the subsequent years  21   22  you ll see us on what I would call more industry traditional step ups year over year in programming costs  But we re in the bag on those things and I think we re in pretty good shape On the broadband attach rates  the attach rates in footprint where we offer broadband are extremely high and they haven t changed  We would expect to see a modest step up as we move away from satellite combined with broadband and get into our software product distributed over broadband  Those sales rates  I think will help us on gross not necessarily a significant change in attach rates  When we are successful selling  we typically attach both  The reality is  is we want more gross  We don t necessarily want to change the attach rate  We get more gross by the fact that for example in footprint  solid 10  of those subscribers have line of sight related issues on satellite  They won t have that on the software driven product  That helps us on gross intake and that s one of those things that helps us as we move through this year change those subscriber trends Randall L  Stephenson    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  This is Randall  First of all  I just want to thank everybody for joining us again this morning for the call and your interest in AT T  We re coming off of 2019 where we told you exactly what we re going to do  And in terms of debt repayment  operational performance  etc   capital allocation  we checked every box  We ve now given you our playbook for 2020 through 2022  It s a playbook that we feel very confident that we can achieve  We re now gaining momentum in our wireless business  which we feel very good about that  We have a capital allocation plan that we have a high degree of confidence and we ll be able to execute over the next three years  And we have a media business that s performing at a very high level even in an industry that s in transition And with HBO Max coming and the investment we re making there  we re confident that it s just another growth vehicle for this business over the next three years  So  bottom line  we have a plan that we think stacks up very nicely  We re confident in our ability to execute  We love the management team and looking forward to 2020  Again  thank you for joining us this morning John J  Stephens    Senior Executive Vice

220084,441600,T,Better Buy  AT T vs  Frontier Communications,news,"When it comes to telecom stocks  Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  sports what looks like an attractive price  It s just  0 59 per share and hovering near a 52 week low compared to the  38 55 of competitor AT T  NYSE T   as of this writing 
Pit these two telecommunications companies head to head and it seems  on the surface  that Frontier s price advantage makes it the better buy  But when looking at the entirety of both companies  the reason behind the price for each stock becomes readily apparent  and the clear investment choice is AT T  

Why Frontier loses
Frontier is a company in decline  Its decision to buy Verizon s wireline business in three states back in 2016 has proven disastrous 
Revenue has dropped every quarter for the past year  In its third quarter earnings report  Frontier experienced a 6 1  year over year drop in revenue  The company also witnessed its largest customer churn in the third quarter  with a clear trend of customer defections steadily growing since the first quarter of 2018  
Moreover  in the most recent conference call with analysts  Frontier s financials are not pretty  The company reported a loss in 2018 and has reported losses in the three quarters of 2019 it has so far reported  At the end of the third quarter  its total assets stood at  17 6 billion  while total liabilities were  21 7 billion  Also  Frontier was once a dividend paying stock  but suspended its dividend in early 2018 
Frontier is selling operations and assets in Washington  Oregon  Idaho  and Montana  Management has not articulated a turnaround plan  
Why AT T wins
On the flip side  AT T s strategic moves chart a growth path for the company  It purchased Time Warner  Inc  in 2018  allowing the telecom company to add the film and television libraries of Warner Brothers  HBO  and Turner to its arsenal  This set up the company s plan to launch its own streaming entertainment network  capitalizing on the cord cutting trend 
The strategy complements the move to an improved 5G wireless network to unlock faster mobile internet speeds  The faster speeds make a streaming service more attractive 
In addition to AT T s growth strategies  the company is profitable  In 2018  it delivered over  19 billion in net income and has already exceeded  10 billion in net income through the third quarter of 2019   
And while Frontier s third quarter total liabilities overshadowed its total assets  the opposite is true for AT T  The company s assets of nearly  549 billion more than cover its  354 5 billion in total liabilities  
These qualities are incentive enough to see AT T as a compelling investment  but there s more  The company is also a Dividend Aristocrat and in December announced that its quarterly dividend was increasing for the 36th consecutive year  The stock is currently delivering more than a 5  yield  
The verdict
From stronger financials to a strategy for growth  AT T possesses the attributes of an attractive investment  while Frontier Communications does not 
Certainly  some concern exists regarding how well AT T will fare in the entertainment business  It s an entirely new industry for the company  and the cost of producing original streaming content has been increasing  Although AT T has worked to reduce its liabilities  the addition of new streaming services won t help 
Still  between this battle  it s a no contest  AT T clearly comes out on top ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnzn4,2069597
220085,441601,T,Why This Q4 Report Will Be Crucial for ATT,news,"AT T Inc   NYSE  T  is set to release its fourth quarter financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday  The consensus forecast is calling for  0 87 in earnings per share  EPS  and  46 96 billion in revenue  The same period of last year reportedly had  0 86 in EPS and  47 99 billion in revenue Merrill Lynch recently highlighted AT T as one of its preliminary top picks for 2020  The firm issued a Buy rating with a  43 price objective  The valuation is deemed warranted as the company faces challenging operating trends within AT T s TV business  along with higher leverage and integration risk  That said  the negatives are offset by higher earnings expectations and faster growth after taking the impact of stock buybacks and cost savings into consideration Now investors have to be asking themselves if AT T s rise can continue into 2020  At least some on Wall Street feel it can outperform next year  The big issue to consider is that rival Verizon  which had held better in prior years  was only up 7  on a total return basis in 2019 div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  While there is much riding on the Sprint T Mobile merger for cellular communications  it still has a chance of being completed  and that s good for both AT T and for Verizon due to a three way fight being better than a four way one AT T itself sees full year 2019 free cash flow around  28 billion  and its EBITDA margin is expected to grow by 200 basis points by 2022  The company s revenue growth is expected to come from wireless and WarnerMedia  and some from Mexico  Its margin growth is expected to come primarily from wireless  merger synergies  Mexico and a focus on operating cost containment  CFO John Stevenson indicated how it expects to improve its balance sheet as follows The company has begun retiring shares and is evaluating a 100 million share accelerated share repurchase program for the first quarter of 2020  By the end of 2022  AT T expects to retire 100  of the debt it incurred to acquire Time Warner  targeting a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in the 2 0x to 2 25x range  and expects this to lead to an upgrade in its debt ratings Excluding Tuesday s move  AT T stock had underperformed the broad markets with a gain of only 25  in the past 52 weeks  The stock was only up 4  in just the past quarter Here s what analysts had to say ahead of the report 
Deutsche Bank has a Buy rating and a  44 price target

220099,441615,T,Forget AT T    Enbridge Is a Better Dividend Stock,news,"Telecom and media powerhouse AT T  NYSE T  is a rock solid dividend stock for retirement focused investors  It sports an attractive 5 5  yield  which is more than twice what the average dividend paying stock in the S P 500 delivers  Further  it has increased its payout for the last 36 straight years  which puts it among the elite class of Dividend Aristocrats 
However  as good as AT T s payout is  Enbridge s  NYSE ENB  dividend is even better  Here s why income seeking investors should take a closer look at the Canadian pipeline giant 

A bigger income stream now
One big reason why dividend investors should favor Enbridge is its high yield    currently around 6 1   While higher yields often reflect greater risk  that s not the case here 
The company expects to generate about 9 4 billion Canadian dollars   7 2 billion  in cash flow that it could distribute to investors this year  Enbridge  however  only plans to pay out about 70  of those funds even after boosting its dividend by nearly 10  for 2020  The company intends to reinvest the money it retains to cover about 60  of its capital spending  and finance the remaining amount  which it can do under favorable conditions thanks to its top notch balance sheet  Even with that incremental borrowing  Enbridge expects its leverage ratio to remain well below its target level  
AT T  meanwhile  anticipates that it will generate about  28 billion in free cash this year  At its current dividend level  its payout ratio will be in the low 50  range  What s left after that will cover a portion of its  20 billion capital program  but it will need to borrow to fund the remainder  While the company s leverage ratio is currently above its long term target range  it s on track to bring the ratio back down into that range as it executes its capital allocation strategy  Because of that  its payout is on solid ground  
More income later
Where Enbridge stands apart from AT T is dividend growth  The three year capital allocation plan the telecom unveiled last October calls for modest annual dividend growth through 2022  The higher priority for its free cash  as well as proceeds from asset sales  is to offset the dilution and debt from its Time Warner acquisition  As such  AT T only increased its payout by 2  this year  compared to Enbridge s nearly 10  increase  
Enbridge also expects to moderate its dividend growth after this year as it winds down a major expansion phase  However  it believes it can support 5  to 7  annual cash flow and dividend growth after this year  Because of that  income investors who buy Enbridge s higher yielding stock these days can also expect a faster growing income stream than they would get from AT T  
A more appealing option for dividend investors

After exciting investors with better than expected earnings and a lucrative U S  Postal Service deal in 2019  the company is aiming to line up new contracts for its public safety mobile computing products  including  rugged  devices  The devices may have an early mover advantage because they are already certified for use with FirstNet  a nationwide U S  public safety network that has the potential to sign millions of new subscribers  It is worth asking if the company s expansion into public safety technology could be significant enough to drive share price even higher for this already hot stock  and if the business segment is meaningful for those considering a long term investment 
What is FirstNet 
In 2017  AT T  NYSE T  was selected by The First Responder Network Authority of the United States  a government entity  to build a nationwide network that will connect first responders  The company will also operate that network under a 25 year contract   About 75  of the buildout is complete  and construction has progressed ahead of schedule  AT T Chief Financial Officer John Joseph Stephens said at an investor event on Dec  3  

When the network is complete  FirstNet wireless coverage is expected to reach more than 99  percent of Americans  The network differs from traditional cellular service because its primary users  which will include law enforcement agencies  fire departments  and emergency medical services  will receive priority and preemption  
More than 10 000 public safety agencies subscribed to FirstNet by early December  FirstNet said  representing over 1 million connections   However  it s difficult to quantify the total addressable market for FirstNet    and therefore Zebra    due to the network s newness and a level of uncertainty about how signups will continue to play out  There are more than 2 7 million full time law enforcement officers  firefighters  and emergency medical technicians in the U S   according to the American Security Council  but data has not yet emerged on how many FirstNet specific devices have been purchased by agencies that have subscribed to the service 
In addition to traditional emergency services workers  the network will be made available to agencies that may be called upon to help support first responders  particularly during and following natural disasters  Other municipal and state entities such as transit systems may also be eligible for service  and statistics do not take into account part time workers    
How Zebra stands to benefit
So far  163 devices have been certified by federal regulators as compatible with the FirstNet network  But not all have built in support for Band 14  the communication spectrum set aside by the government specifically for FirstNet  Devices that are compatible but not specifically equipped for FirstNet will require a software update  a possible unlocking process  and installation of a FirstNet SIM card 
Zebra said in late October it has two mobile computers and four tablets that have been certified and approved for use on with FirstNet  The company will compete with certain smartphones and other products from manufacturers including Apple and NETGEAR  but not all its competitors manufacture  rugged  devices like those produced by Zebra  The company claims these devices are constructed with drop resistant features that favor usage in environments such as motorcycle policing  incident response and disaster management  Pricing of the devices on an individual basis is not consistent online  and it is unclear what types of prices might be provided for large departments ordering many units at once  
On its Q3 earnings conference call  Zebra Chief Executive Officer Anders Gustafsson characterized the public safety market and FirstNet as  good incremental growth opportunities  for the company   Those are several hundred million dollar markets that are  today  served predominantly by either very unique purpose built devices or consumer devices   Gustafsson said   And we believe that there is a good opportunity to introduce our type of solutions in that market   
Time to wait and watch 
If an investor was not already considering buying Zebra  initial information on its potential to penetrate the public safety market is not substantial enough to tip a decision  However  if the company makes inroads with this segment as it did with the U S  Postal Service  the activity may be worth watching  Prospective investors interested in the company s public safety revenue prospects would be wise to scour earnings reports for Q4 and beyond on both Zebra and AT T as more details on FirstNet rollout  and who benefits  come to light ",2020-01-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/peal5,2053184

220116,441632,T,U S  Supreme Court justices skeptical about New Jersey  Bridgegate  convictions,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Supreme Court justices signaled sympathy on Tuesday toward two associates of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who are seeking to have their convictions in the  Bridgegate  scandal overturned in a case focusing on what kinds of political acts can be prosecuted as criminal fraud  Several justices   liberals and conservatives   appeared dissatisfied during arguments in the case with the U S  Justice Department s reasoning in defending the prosecutions of Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni  although they asked tough question of both sides   The scandal centered on Christie s team engineering traffic chaos on the world s busiest bridge to punish a local mayor who refused to endorse his gubernatorial re election bid  The Philadelphia based 3rd U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 upheld the 2016 convictions of Kelly  a former Christie deputy chief of staff  and Baroni  a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey  for wire fraud and misusing Port Authority resources  At issue in their appeals is whether their actions fit the definition of fraud under federal law  Prosecutors accused Kelly and Baroni of creating days of lane closures in September 2013 on the George Washington Bridge  which connects Fort Lee  New Jersey  to New York City  The closures caused traffic gridlock and were intended to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee  Mark Sokolich  after he declined to endorse the Republican Christie for re election  prosecutors said  The traffic was so bad  local authorities warned at the time that it was a threat to public safety by delaying emergency responders  Christie denied involvement and was not charged  The scandal marred Christie s reputation  damaged his campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and contributed to low public approval ratings in his home state  PAINTING THE MAYOR S HOUSE The justices wrestled with whether changing a bridge s traffic lane patterns was akin to other types of government misconduct  citing examples like a mayor asking public employees to paint his house or snow plow his street before others   Now  that is not a good thing to do  It is really undesirable  And maybe it should be a crime  But 30 years in prison  That I m not sure   said liberal Justice Stephen Breyer  referring to the maximum available sentence for fraud   Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts noted that although the lane meddling created traffic problems  the public could still use the bridge   If people want to use the highway to get to Fort Lee  they can   Roberts said  Liberal Justice Elena Kagan said that although government employees were commandeered as part of the scheme  their role was incidental  Conservative Justice Samuel Alito  a New Jersey native and former federal prosecutor in the state  was among those tough on the prosecution  although he also appeared dissatisfied at what Kelly and Baroni s lawyers argued  Christie  Kelly and Baroni all attended the arguments  A ruling in favor of Kelly and Baroni could make it harder to prosecute public officials for certain political acts  The Supreme Court in 2016 threw out former Republican Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell s bribery conviction in a ruling that narrowed the types of conduct that can warrant such prosecution  McDonnell and former media mogul Conrad Black  who also was prosecuted in a corruption case  filed legal briefs in support of Kelly and Baroni  President Donald Trump last year granted a full pardon to Black  who was convicted in 2007 of fraud and obstruction of justice and spent 3 1 2 years in prison  After dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination  Christie threw his support behind Trump and served as an adviser  but Trump later fired him as the head of his transition team after being elected president  Baroni initially started serving an 18 month prison sentence but was released after the Supreme Court agreed last year to hear the case  Kelly s 13 month sentence was put on hold while she appealed  
Kelly told Port Authority executive David Wildstein in an August 2013 email that it was    t ime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee   and they helped invent a sham  traffic study  to justify the lane closures  Wildstein  the accused Bridgegate mastermind  was sentenced to probation in 2017 after pleading guilty and cooperating with prosecutors ",2020-01-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-supreme-court-justices-skeptical-about-new-jersey-bridgegate-convictions-2059198,2059198
220117,441633,T,Losing Roku Is Just the Latest Disaster for AT T TV Now,news,"AT T s  NYSE T  live TV streaming service  AT T TV Now  has a problem  The app that subscribers use to access AT T TV Now is  as of this writing  no longer supported on Roku s  NASDAQ ROKU  eponymous platform 
That s a big problem  and it s only the latest in a line of problems for the live TV streaming service that once seemed destined to unseat industry leader Dish Network s  NASDAQ DISH   Sling TV and take live multichannel streaming services to new heights 

Et tu  Roku 
For AT T TV Now subscribers who use Roku devices to access the service  the new year came with some bad news  Support for AT T TV Now s Roku app has lapsed  On AT T TV Now s website  an explanatory note lays out the details 

Heads up  Starting Jan  1  2020  you won t be able to add the AT T TV channel to your Roku device  Already have AT T TV on your Roku device  You can keep using it as long as you don t delete the app  We re actively working on a new agreement with Roku and hope to resolve this soon 

This is very bad news for AT T TV Now  By most measures  Roku is the most popular streaming platform on the planet  competitors like Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  Fire TV sometimes claim to have passed Roku in one metric or another  but it s clear for the moment that Roku is still the industry leader   Roku boasts 27 million active users and a 39  market share that includes more than 15  of all connected TVs in the United States  And all of AT T TV Now s major competitors offer Roku channels  Roku s term for apps   DISH s Sling TV  Disney s  NYSE DIS  Hulu   Live TV  and Alphabet s  NASDAQ GOOG   NASDAQ GOOGL  YouTube TV are all still available via Roku s Channel Store 
AT T TV Now also lacks support for Alphabet s Android TV platform  something that is not true of its major rivals  But that long standing issue can t compare to losing support for the most popular OTT platform on the market 
How did this happen 
AT T TV Now s exit from the Roku Channel Store is the result of a lapsing deal and the inability of AT T and Roku to reach an agreement on a new one  Like other platform companies  Roku doesn t let just any old app into its app store  Roku inks distribution deals with the apps in its store  AT T TV Now was signed to such a deal  but no longer    and  as of this writing  negotiations over a new one appear to have hit an impasse 
AT T and Roku aren t saying what they re arguing about  but possibilities include a  platform tax  on subscription sign ups through the Roku platform  a tech industry classic that is an infamous favorite of Apple  and advertising related issues like ad placements and ad revenue sharing 
Is HBO Max a factor 
AT T TV Now is not AT T s only streaming service  The company also owns the soon to be released HBO Max  an on demand streaming service that builds on the HBO brand  There is only limited overlap between the two services    AT T TV Now is a live TV streaming service that offers live streams of network TV channels  while HBO Max will be an on demand service full of original content that won t be available on live pay TV  streaming or otherwise     but the new offering could still be complicating things ahead of its Spring 2020 release  AT T TV Now promotes two channel bundles that include a subscription to HBO  that s the regular one  not Max   which can turn into on demand content via the HBO Go app  And HBO Max will almost certainly be launching on Roku  meaning that AT T and Roku also have to work out the terms that will bring that app on board    discussions that could bleed into similar negotiations over AT T TV Now  For now  this is all speculation  as AT T and Roku have been mum on this possibility 
The latest misstep for AT T TV Now
The Roku debacle is the latest in a long line of problems for AT T TV Now  In October 2018  AT T TV Now    then branded as DirecTV Now    boasted 1 84 million subscribers and appeared to be on pace to topple Sling TV  which had 2 47 million during the same timeframe  from the top spot in the multichannel live TV streaming space  Then came subscriber losses in four consecutive quarters  The initial drop was reportedly kicked off  at least in part  by the ending of promotional accounts  discounted accounts which may have inspired overly optimistic assessments of DirecTV Now s rise in the first place   but that hardly accounts for AT T TV Now s continued free fall 
Taking on water  the service later rebranded and restructured its offerings  That hasn t done much to fix its problems 
With Sony s PlayStation Vue now officially retiring from the competition  AT T TV Now is starting to look like the weakest multichannel service left on the market  While it has a decent base of more than a million subscribers  AT T TV Now is trending in the wrong direction  Nothing illustrates the service s downfall more strikingly than the service s absence from the most important streaming platform out there  AT T TV Now will likely be back in the Roku Channel Store soon  but even a temporary absence is likely to hurt the service s efforts to bring in new subscribers    to say nothing of its reputation relative to its competition ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pidcv,2060086

While AT T s traditional wireline voice business has undergone a period of secular decline due to wireless substitution and cable competition  the company through WarnerMedia has become a diversified media and entertainment business 
The Merrill team noted this when discussing 2020 potential for the communications giant 
Our price objective is based on a P E multiple of 12 times our fiscal year 2020 EPS estimate  which is in the middle of AT T s historical relative multiple range vs the S P 500  We think this is warranted based on challenging operating trends within AT T s television business  higher leverage  and integration risk  but offset by higher earnings estimates and faster growth after baking in the impact of the company s stock buyback and cost savings initiative

220126,441642,T,How Safe Are AT T and Its Dividend ,news,"AT T  NYSE T  has paid shareholders a dividend since 1984  The amount of that payout has varied greatly  but the company has not skipped a quarter in the entire history of its dividend program 
While the road has been a bit rocky  AT T has been steadfast in handing money over to its shareholders  And in recent years  the numbers have settled down a bit  with the company slowly raising its dividend from  0 31 per share per quarter in 2004 to  0 52 for its next quarter  in 2020 
History shows that AT T has been a safe bet for dividend investors and people building out a retirement portfolio  However  the market for some of the company s core products is changing  and that could put the dividend at risk 

What s wrong with AT T 
AT T made a  67 billion bet on the future of cable television when it bought DIRECTV in 2014  At the time  the deal seemed like a smart one  The company  which was focusing on selling subscriptions to its wireless phone service  could bundle that service with a television package and sell it nationally 
That made some sense  but there were a couple of faults in the logic  The first is that in an age where consumers want both a pay TV and an internet subscription  consumers may not want to have to deal with two different companies to get those services  Satellite TV providers didn t offer bundled internet  and in the digital age  that made their product less attractive 
The second issue AT T overlooked    and this may be the bigger problem    is that the company bought DIRECTV right before the traditional cable subscription model began to fall apart  That said  when the deal was made  there were signs that cord cutting could become an issue  and the industry did lose subscribers in 2014 
Those losses have grown steadily each year  and they ve hit satellite providers even harder than the rest of the industry  though that trend was slow to emerge  DIRECTV actually gained 1 2 million paying customers in 2016  while its satellite rival DISH Network lost just over 1 million  
But that was the last year that AT T s satellite company would post a gain in subscribers  It s since lost 554 000 in 2017  1 23 million in 2018  and roughly 2 4 million satellite customers in the first three quarters of 2019  according to data compiled by Leichtman Research Group  That s a disturbing trend  as losses have accelerated greatly and are unlikely to turn around 
How important is AT T s cable business 
The upside that should reassure shareholders is that AT T expects to be able to continue to grow its revenue while absorbing the accelerating loss of DIRECTV customers  It has forecast revenue growth in 2020 of 1  to 2   and it expects its earnings to come in at  3 60 to  3 70 per share 
In the third quarter earnings release  CEO Randall Stephenson promised   Our 3 year plan delivers both substantial and consistent financial improvements over the next 3 years  We grow revenues  EBITDA  and EPS every single year  and free cash flow is stable next year  but then grows in both of the next two years  as well   
In the release the company also specifically mentioned its dividend  saying it expects  continued modest annual dividend growth  with  dividends as  a  percent of free cash flow of less than 50  in 2022  
Essentially  AT T is telling shareholders that it knows DIRECTV has problems  but that the company can handle the subscriber loss by making more money in other areas  It seems to have a solid plan to do that  but it remains at least a little vulnerable if something else in its portfolio falters 
That could happen  but doesn t seem all that likely  AT T has a problem with its satellite TV business  but it s managing the declines and the issues should not threaten its dividend  This isn t a completely safe dividend    the company does have some challenges to navigate    but it s a very strong bet  And management appears to have a very reasonable plan for growth ",2020-01-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pdma5,2052443

220135,441651,T,Democrats accuse Trump of abusing power  obstructing Congress  impeachment probe,news,"By Patricia Zengerle  Susan Cornwell and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump solicited foreign interference to boost his re election chances  undermined national security and ordered an  unprecedented  campaign to obstruct Congress  Democrats said on Tuesday in a report that lawmakers will use as the basis of any formal impeachment charges 
In the 300 page report  Democrats leading the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee leveled allegations of sweeping abuse of power by Trump  saying he used U S  military aid and the prospect of a White House visit to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to undertake investigations that would benefit Trump politically 
Republican Trump  who will stand for re election in November 2020  denies any wrongdoing and calls the inquiry a hoax 
The heart of the impeachment probe is whether Trump misused the power of his office to pressure Ukraine to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden  a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the 2020 election 
The public release of the report is a milestone in a weeks long investigation into whether Trump should be removed from office over his dealings on Ukraine  It summarizes hours of private testimony and televised hearings in which former government officials described a months long effort to pressure Ukraine to carry out the investigations sought by Trump in July 
The report s completions hands the process over to the House Judiciary Committee  which will now be responsible for drafting actual articles of impeachment should lawmakers decide to move forward  That panel will begin proceedings on Wednesday 
In the report  Democrats detail accusations that Trump obstructed their investigation  including refusing to provide documents and testimony from his top advisers  unsuccessful attempts to block career government officials from testifying and intimidation of witnesses 
The Democrats argue that  damage     will be long lasting and potentially irrevocable if the President s ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked  
Making their case to move forward with impeachment  the report said that  any future President will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing  malfeasance  or corruption  and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three  
In a news conference  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff described Trump as a  president who believes that he is beyond indictment  beyond impeachment  beyond any form of accountability and indeed above the law  
 RAMBLINGS 
Trump  who is in London for a NATO summit  repeated accusations that Democrats are using the impeachment process to engage in a politically motivated attack seeking to undo the results of the 2016 presidential election by removing him from office  Opinion polls show Americans are bitterly divided over impeachment 
White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Democrats had conducted a  one sided sham process  that had failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by Trump 
 This report reflects nothing more than their frustrations  Chairman Schiff s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing   Grisham said in a statement 
Lawmakers and the public have heard testimony from current and former officials that military aid was withheld from Ukraine and that a White House meeting with Zelenskiy was conditioned on Kiev announcing a probe into Biden  as well as one into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U S  election 
The report was approved by the intelligence panel on a partisan vote on Tuesday evening  The vote was 13 9  It was not immediately clear how each member voted 
If the full House eventually votes to approve formal impeachment charges  a trial would be held in the Republican led U S  Senate  where a two thirds majority of those present would be required to convict Trump and remove him from office 
PHONE RECORDS
The report also brought to light new allegations by Democrats about phone calls between Trump s Republican allies 
The report suggested wrongdoing within the executive branch extended beyond Trump 
The report said many of Trump s  closest subordinates and advisors   including White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry aided Trump s efforts to pressure Ukraine and withheld information from Congress  Senior administration officials declined to testify in the proceedings 
The report cited dozens of previously unreported phone records of contact between Trump s personal lawyer  Rudy Giuliani  Giuliani s associates  the House Intelligence Committee s top Republican  Devin Nunes  and the White House s Office of Management and Budget 
The phone records were obtained from AT T  N T   the report says 
An AT T statement acknowledged the company complied with a request 
 Like all companies  we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies   the statement said   In all cases  we ensure that requests for assistance are valid and that we act in compliance with the law  
A spokesman for Nunes did not respond to a request for comment 
The report also sought to push back at a frequent defense of trump by Republican lawmakers   that the political novice was simply doing what all presidents do 
 The President s misconduct was not an isolated occurrence  nor was it the product of a na ve president   the report argues 
Republicans  in an advance rebuttal report released on Monday  said Democrats had not established that Trump had committed an impeachable offense 






Trump and other Republicans have suggested that Biden and his son Hunter Biden  who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company  should be investigated for corruption  The Bidens have denied wrongdoing ",2019-12-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-rejects-censure-idea-as-house-panel-readies-impeachment-report-vote-2032499,2032499

220138,441654,T,3 Top Dividend Stocks To Maximize Your Retirement Income   February 12  2020,opinion,"Here s a revealing data point  older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself 
And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry  even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years  That s because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses   and with people generally living longer  the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period 
Retirement investing approaches of the past don t work today 
For many years  bonds or other fixed income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs  However  these yields have dwindled over time  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6 50   but today  that rate is a thing of the past  with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future 
The effect of this drop in rates is substantial  over 20 years  the change in yield for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries is over  1 million 
In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields  today s retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits  Because of certain demographic factors  it s been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035 
Unfortunately  it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income   bonds and Social Security   may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees  But what if there was another option that could provide a steady  reliable source of income in retirement 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
As we see it  dividend paying stocks from generally low risk  top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant current low risk  low yielding Treasury and fixed income alternatives 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3   and positive average annual dividend growth  Many stocks increase dividends over time  helping to offset the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Bank of Montreal  BMO  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 8 per share  with a dividend yield of 4 17   This compares to the Banks   Foreign industry s yield of 3 51  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 78   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 2 is up 7 23  from last year 
Flushing Financial  FFIC  is paying out a dividend of 0 21 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 07  compared to the Financial   Savings and Loan industry s yield of 2 4  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 84 is up 5  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 18 per share  LCNB  LCNB  has a dividend yield of 4 18   This is compared to the Banks   Northeast industry s yield of 1 81  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 72 is up 5 88  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
Overall  that is true  But stocks are a broad class  and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high quality dividend stocks that can generate regular  predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market 
Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend paying stocks  Here s why  many of these stable  high quality companies increase their dividends over time  which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks  you can still pursue a dividend income strategy  However  it s important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF  which can ultimately reduce your dividend income  working against your strategy  Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest 
Bottom Line
Regardless of whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  looking for a steady stream of income from dividend paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement

220139,441655,T,Improve Your Retirement Income With These 3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks   February 12  2020,opinion,"Here s an eye opening statistic  older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself 
And unfortunately  even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned   with the traditional approaches to retirement planning  income may no longer cover expenses  That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet  setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans 
Retirement investing approaches of the past don t work today 
Years ago  investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent  solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6 50   but unfortunately  those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over 
The impact of this rate decline is sizeable  over 20 years  the difference in yield for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries is more than  1 million 
And lower bond yields aren t the only potential problem seniors are facing  Today s retirees aren t feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security  either  Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future  but based on current estimates  Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035 
Unfortunately  it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income   bonds and Social Security   may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees  But what if there was another option that could provide a steady  reliable source of income in retirement

Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Brinker International  EAT  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 38 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 54   This compares to the Retail   Restaurants industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 78   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 52 is flat compared to last year 
Investors Bancorp  ISBC  is paying out a dividend of 0 12 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 03  compared to the Financial   Savings and Loan industry s yield of 2 4  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 48 is flat compared to last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 4 per share  Legg Mason  LM  has a dividend yield of 3 9   This is compared to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 21  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 6 is up 17 65  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
The fact is that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  To counterbalance this  invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly  can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market 
A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies  especially blue chip stocks  increase their dividends over time  helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income

Ericsson  BS ERICAs  and Nokia  HE NOKIA  to deter Huawei  This is likely to be either achieved through direct funding or through consortium of private American and allied companies  backed by government funding  The 5G thrust is possibly gaining precedence as the coronavirus epidemic has hampered the pace of 5G deployment in the communist nation Meanwhile  President Trump has signed an executive order directing federal agencies to devise a plan within a year to test the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure systems against potential disruption or manipulation of GPS that form the backbone of electrical power grids  weather forecasting  traffic signals  smartphone applications and vehicle navigation systems  The move follows heightened U S  concerns about the U K

market and benefit the larger community with superior rural broadband coverage  The all stock merger will help accelerate development of faster 5G wireless networks driven by operational synergies and extended customer base on shared infrastructure assets  The combined entity will be a force to reckon with in the U S  wireless  video and broadband industries  boasting a network capacity for a

220142,441658,T,3 Top Dividend Stocks To Maximize Your Retirement Income   February 13  2020,opinion,"Strange but true  seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement 
And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry  even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years  That s because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses   and with people generally living longer  the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period 
The tried   and   true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn t work today 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields  today s retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits  Because of certain demographic factors  it s been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035 
How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren t producing income  You can only cut your expenses so far  and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
We feel that these dividend paying equities   as long as they are from high quality  low risk issuers   can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low yielding Treasury bonds  or other bonds  
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
Going beyond those familiar names  you can find excellent dividend paying stocks by following a few guidelines  Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3   with positive annual dividend growth  The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 48 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 2   This compares to the Medical   Dental Supplies industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 75   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 92 is up 1 01  from last year 
Marathon Petroleum  MPC  is paying out a dividend of 0 53 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 6  compared to the Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing industry s yield of 2 91  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 12 is up 15 22  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 3 per share  NRG Energy  NYSE NRG  has a dividend yield of 3 06   This is compared to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 2 76  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 2 is flat compared to last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
Overall  that is true  But stocks are a broad class  and you can reduce the risks significantly by selecting high quality dividend stocks that can generate regular  predictable income and can also decrease the volatility of your portfolio compared to the overall stock market 
Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend paying stocks  Here s why  many of these stable  high quality companies increase their dividends over time  which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
You may be thinking   I like this dividend strategy  but instead of investing in individual stocks  I m going to find a dividend focused mutual fund or ETF   This approach can make sense  but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees  which may reduce your dividend gains or income  and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach  If you do wish to invest in a fund  do your research to find the best quality dividend funds with the lowest fees 
Bottom Line
Regardless of whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  looking for a steady stream of income from dividend paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement 
Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement

220143,441659,T,Improve Your Retirement Income With These 3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks   February 13  2020,opinion,"Here s a revealing data point  older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself 
And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry  even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years  That s because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses   and with people generally living longer  the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period 
Retirement investing approaches of the past don t work today 
In the past  investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady  reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6 50   whereas at the time of this article  the current rate is under 2  and looks to stay low thanks to an accommodative Fed 
The effect of this drop in rates is substantial  over 20 years  the change in yield for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries is over  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren t producing income  You can only cut your expenses so far  and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
As a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds  and other bond options   we believe dividend paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable  predictable income investors in retirement seek 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
A rule of thumb for finding solid income producing stocks is to seek those that average 3  dividend yield  and positive yearly dividend growth  These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
First Defiance Financial  FDEF  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 22 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 05   This compares to the Financial   Savings and Loan industry s yield of 2 4  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 75   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 88 is up 29 41  from last year 
Navient  NAVI  is paying out a dividend of 0 16 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 4 34  compared to the Financial   Consumer Loans industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 64 is flat compared to last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 7 59 per share  NetEase  NASDAQ NTES  has a dividend yield of 4 75   This is compared to the Internet   Software and Services industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  16 55 is up 824 58  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
Yes  that s true  As a broad category  bonds carry less risk than stocks  However  the stocks we are talking about   dividend  paying stocks from high quality companies   can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole 
A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies  especially blue chip stocks  increase their dividends over time  helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income

And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last  People are living longer  so that money has to cover a longer period  Making matters worse  income generated using tried   and   true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days  That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses 
The tried   and   true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn t work today 
For many years  bonds or other fixed income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs  However  these yields have dwindled over time  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6 50   but today  that rate is a thing of the past  with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future

So what s a retiree to do  You could cut your expenses to the bone  and take the risk that your Social Security checks don t shrink  Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady  higher rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields

That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
And lower bond yields aren t the only potential problem seniors are facing  Today s retirees aren t feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security  either  Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future  but based on current estimates  Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035 
Unfortunately  it looks like the two traditional sources of retirement income   bonds and Social Security   may not be able to adequately meet the needs of present and future retirees  But what if there was another option that could provide a steady  reliable source of income in retirement 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
As a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds  and other bond options   we believe dividend paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable  predictable income investors in retirement seek 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3  and positive average annual dividend growth  Numerous stocks hike dividends over time  counterbalancing inflation risks 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
General Mills  NYSE GIS  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 49 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 74   This compares to the Food   Miscellaneous industry s yield of 0 23  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 77   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 96 is flat compared to last year 
Independent Bank  IBCP  is paying out a dividend of 0 2 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 62  compared to the Banks   Midwest industry s yield of 2 5  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 8 is up 20  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 23 per share  Interpublic Group  IPG  has a dividend yield of 4 06   This is compared to the Advertising and Marketing industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 94 is up 11 9  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
Yes  that s true  As a broad category  bonds carry less risk than stocks  However  the stocks we are talking about   dividend  paying stocks from high quality companies   can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole 
Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend paying stocks  Here s why  many of these stable  high quality companies increase their dividends over time  which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
You may be thinking   I like this dividend strategy  but instead of investing in individual stocks  I m going to find a dividend focused mutual fund or ETF   This approach can make sense  but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees  which may reduce your dividend gains or income  and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach  If you do wish to invest in a fund  do your research to find the best quality dividend funds with the lowest fees 
Bottom Line
Pursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio  Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low fee mutual funds or ETFs  this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement 
Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement

In the past  investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady  reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6 50   whereas at the time of this article  the current rate is under 2  and looks to stay low thanks to an accommodative Fed 
The impact of this rate decline is sizeable  over 20 years  the difference in yield for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries is more than  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
So what can retirees do  You could dramatically reduce your expenses  and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don t diminish  On the other hand  you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady  higher rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields

220180,441696,T,Improve Your Retirement Income With These 3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks   February 03  2020,opinion,"Here s a revealing data point  older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself 
And unfortunately  even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned   with the traditional approaches to retirement planning  income may no longer cover expenses  That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet  setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans 
In today s economic environment  traditional income investments are not working 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields  today s retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits  Because of certain demographic factors  it s been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035 
So what s a retiree to do  You could cut your expenses to the bone  and take the risk that your Social Security checks don t shrink  Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady  higher rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
Dividend paying stocks from low risk  high quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace current low risk  low yielding Treasury and bond options 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3   and positive average annual dividend growth  Many stocks increase dividends over time  helping to offset the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Archer Daniels Midland  ADM  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 35 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 13   This compares to the Agriculture   Operations industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 81   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 4 is up 4 48  from last year 
Costamare  CMRE  is paying out a dividend of 0 1 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 5 04  compared to the Transportation   Shipping industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 4 is flat compared to last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 05 per share  DHT Holdings  DHT  has a dividend yield of 3 55   This is compared to the Transportation   Shipping industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 2 is up 150  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
It is true that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  but high quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly  can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market 
A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies  especially blue chip stocks  increase their dividends over time  helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
You may be thinking   I like this dividend strategy  but instead of investing in individual stocks  I m going to find a dividend focused mutual fund or ETF   This approach can make sense  but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees  which may reduce your dividend gains or income  and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach  If you do wish to invest in a fund  do your research to find the best quality dividend funds with the lowest fees 
Bottom Line
Whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  seeking the steady income of dividend paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress free retirement 
Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement

220191,441707,T,3 Top Dividend Stocks To Maximize Your Retirement Income   January 30  2020,opinion,"Believe it or not  seniors fear running out of cash more than they fear dying 
And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry  even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years  That s because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses   and with people generally living longer  the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period 
In today s economic environment  traditional income investments are not working 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
How can you avoid dipping into your principal when the investments you counted on in retirement aren t producing income  You can only cut your expenses so far  and the only other option is to find a different investment vehicle to generate income 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
We feel that these dividend paying equities   as long as they are from high quality  low risk issuers   can give retirement investors a smart option to replace low yielding Treasury bonds  or other bonds  
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
One approach to recognizing appropriate stocks is to look for companies with an average dividend yield of 3  and positive average annual dividend growth  Numerous stocks hike dividends over time  counterbalancing inflation risks 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Brookline Bancorp  BRKL  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 12 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 03   This compares to the Financial   Savings and Loan industry s yield of 2 43  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 77   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 46 is up 9 52  from last year 
Investors Bancorp  ISBC  is paying out a dividend of 0 11 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 76  compared to the Financial   Savings and Loan industry s yield of 2 43  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  0 44 is flat compared to last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 4 per share  Legg Mason  LM  has a dividend yield of 4 01   This is compared to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 22  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 6 is up 17 65  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
It is true that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  but high quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly  can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market 
An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio  they can help lessen the effects of inflation  since many dividend paying companies  especially blue chip stocks  generally increase their dividends over time 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
If you re interested in investing in dividends  but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks  beware of fees  Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees  which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends  undercutting your dividend income strategy  Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach 
Bottom Line
Whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  seeking the steady income of dividend paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress free retirement

220222,441738,T,AT T  T  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"AT T  T  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 29  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This telecommunications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 87 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 2  
Revenues are expected to be  46 91 billion  down 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 1  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AT T 
For AT T  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 51  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AT T will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AT T would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  1 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AT T doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/att-t-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200500667,200500667

threatened his China electronics business  he knew that setting up shop elsewhere would be a slog rather than an adventure  The 70 year old had spent half his life building supply chains in southern China to produce goods for big box U S  retailers  But he had never reshuffled one on short notice  with tariffs hanging over his head    It is the hardest thing I ve ever had to do in all my 30 years in the business   said Sloven  president of Capstone International HK Ltd  a division of Florida based Capstone Companies   You ve got packaging  assembling  auditing  labor  overheads  components  logistics  transportation   he said   I went from first gear to fourth gear very quickly    Sloven  a native of Long Island  New York  cut his teeth in Asia in the 1970s sourcing lighting products from Japan  He then moved to Taiwan and then mainland China  making and sourcing electrical products for AT T  NYSE T  and Duracell  before becoming a buying agent for sporting goods retailer Dick s  He joined Capstone in 2012 to manage its network of Chinese manufacturers from Hong Kong   Rising labor costs and tighter regulations in China had already led him to consider moving the business elsewhere in Asia  But the trade war forced his hand   Through dozens of interviews and phone  Whatsapp and email exchanges over a year  Reuters documented Sloven s quest to uproot his supply chain operation  an effort entailing many close calls  bureaucratic headaches   and some good luck  Sloven is just one of thousands of entrepreneurs who have been forced by the trade war to upend their business operations in China in the biggest supply chain shift in a generation  Companies like Capstone contribute over  200 billion in U S  purchases of China made electronics and machinery annually   GRAPHIC  China s top exports and imports from U S     DUE DILIGENCE When Washington imposed the first tariffs in July 2018  Capstone s core products  such as battery powered LED bulbs and motion activated lighting  were not on the list  Nor were some Capstone prototypes that Sloven sees as the future of the company   smart furniture  like a mirror that doubles as a touchscreen with internet access  But his instinct was that U S  China ties were taking a turn for the worse   You don t know what s coming next in China   he said  He set his sights on Thailand as the site of a possible second production base  Sourcing raw materials locally was difficult  but at least they carried no import duties  Setting up a business entity in Thailand was also cheap and fast  and some of the work could be subcontracted   A U S  trade official in Thailand introduced him to various local companies who could help   I will be able to make products in Thailand   Sloven said at the end of last summer  But  he added   it s not going to be easy   In September  U S  President Donald Trump gave him an even better reason to move  The total value of U S  tariffs on Chinese goods was expanded from  50 billion to  250 billion  putting Capstone s LED products in the crosshairs of 10  levies  Smart furniture  if made in China  would take a hit  Soon after  a survey by Amcham China  which represents U S  businesses  showed that a third of its members were planning to shift the sourcing of components or assemble some goods outside of China  Sloven s efforts in Thailand appeared to have paid off  After numerous meetings  he found a furniture factory and an assembler outside Bangkok that could help him  Both had international experience and were expanding to meet increasing demand from U S  firms  And while smart furniture was new to them  they were confident they could pull it off and were ready to invest  The companies cannot be named because of non disclosure agreements  After a site visit in February  Sloven ordered components for his smart mirror to be shipped to Thailand  By mid March  Capstone engineers were showing the factory how to put them together   I m not concerned   Sloven said in February   I m giving him the information step by step   he said  referring to his Thai partner   Even as Sloven grew more optimistic  the urgency to leave China seemed to abate as 2019 began   Trump and President Xi Jinping of China had declared a cautious truce at a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires  and it seemed to be holding  Officials on both sides were suggesting a deal before a March deadline  and the threat of tariffs rising to 25  seemed distant  But Sloven was sticking to his plan   I don t think there s going to be a trade war  but that doesn t change things   he said at the time  GRAPHIC  SE Asia factory activity holds up better    MOVING SLOWLY The March deadline passed  but tariffs remained unchanged  That gave Sloven breathing room  He scheduled a series of pilot runs to test how well the Thai factory handled assembly  He also needed to prepare for audits of labor rights and environmental standards that U S  retailers require  He estimated that would take at least another six months    I m going to start moving on a small scale because they re not going to be able to just do it immediately   Sloven said   As much as they say   Oh  I can do this right now    I m not taking that chance    More investment in tooling and moulds was required  too  but the Thai companies agreed to bear the cost  Regardless of what happened with the trade war  Sloven felt covered   You prepare for war   he said   You re ready if you re attacked   RE NEGOTIATING CHINA Sloven also had work to do in China   His suppliers in Shenzhen  Dongguan and Guangzhou were certain the trade conflict would blow over and were reluctant to negotiate deals that would send components and raw materials abroad for assembly  But Sloven kept pressing ahead with the Thailand plan  concerned about the toll the trade war was taking in China  In early April  Sloven invited Reuters to meet his trade lawyer  Sally Peng of Sandler  Travis   Rosenberg  Peng described how Chinese factory floors were emptying out as workers were laid off  Few owners had the expertise or resources to automate or find new export markets  so most were riding it out  hoping for a trade deal  They were  losing money every day   she said   They believe that eventually it will all come back   Sloven said    I think within five years  it will all be gone   Peng replied  GRAPHIC  Trade flows redirected away from China    INVESTOR CALL The same day Sloven met his lawyer  his bosses in Florida announced 2018 results that reflected the effects of the trade war  Net revenues came in at  12 8 million  down from  36 8 million in 2017  Net losses were  1 million  a swing from a  3 1 million profit    Capstone faced challenges in 2018 unlike any in its history   chief financial officer Gerry McClinton said  Meanwhile  development of the smart mirror was in full swing  The prototype was deemed a success at a Las Vegas electronics show in January  and a PR agency and a marketing company were hired to advertise the new product  Then Trump hiked tariffs to 25  on May 10  For Sloven   and many others   the urgency level bounced back up  That month  a survey by AmCham China and AmCham Shanghai showed the number of firms that had moved production or were considering doing so leaped above 40   To speed things up  Sloven introduced the Thai assemblers to his Chinese suppliers   He wanted to set the rules of the game and then let them interact independently  Those meetings had to go well  or all could fall apart  In a stroke of luck  he discovered the two sides had something in common   The Thai guy  his family was from China originally so he spoke a certain dialect  And the factory in China   my supplier   and him speak the same dialect   Sloven said   What a home run   After months of digging in its heels  the Chinese company finally relented and agreed to supply Sloven in Thailand  AUDITS  LOGISTICS With his supply of components and raw materials secured  the next big step was the audits   Thirty five percent of the product had to be made in Thailand for the product to be considered Thai  and thus exempt from American tariffs  A certificate from an independent auditor would prove that  but the auditing usually takes four to five weeks   I know what I have to do  but getting the information is mind boggling  These are supply chain issues that everyone in the world is going to have to face   Sloven said   Logistics was another concern for Sloven  Shipping to the United States from Thailand takes 8 10 days longer than it does from China  Despite the extra costs and time  Sloven thinks he will be able to make the product for the same price as in China without the tariffs  And by the middle of the summer of 2019  Sloven was confident that most of his challenges had been overcome and that the smart mirror would ship on schedule on October 1   
But  he allowed   there s always going to be hiccups  ",2019-08-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/you-prepare-for-war-how-one-us-firm-tried-escaping-trumps-china-tariffs-1959763,1959763

220241,441757,T,Top Financial Blogger  These 3 Stocks Can Rip Higher in 2020,opinion,David Alton Clark s reputation as one of the best stock pickers in the game precedes him  Based on the blogger s track record  he has rightfully earned this reputation  According to TipRanks  a fintech company that tracks and measures the performance of financial experts  Clark s stock picks see a return of 25 7   on average  Not to mention his success rate  the number of profitable recommendations measured over one year  comes in at 70   So  it makes sense  then  that the five star blogger scores the second spot on TipRanks  ranking of the Top 25 Bloggers Highlighting the current economic landscape  Clark advises against going all in on any position in one fell swoop when making bets for 2020  which also happens to be a US election year  Following 2019 s record breaking performance  the market continues to tear higher thanks to the Fed s monetary policy as well as the improving geopolitical climate  Along with sky high P E ratios  this sets the scene for underwhelming earnings results  says Clark With this in mind  we asked the top financial blogger if he would share his stock picks for 2020  1 DocuSign  DOCU DocuSign is my speculative high flyer selection  I always suggest an investor allocate at least 5  of their portfolio to a speculative play with the potential for exponential growth  Currently  the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating with an  84 average price target   See DocuSign stock analysis on TipRanks I have used DocuSign for the past few years in my real estate business  It is an invaluable asset for me  The DocuSign product helps organizations connect and automate how they prepare  sign  act on  and manage agreements  As part of the DocuSign Agreement Cloud  DocuSign offers eSignature  the world s  1 way to sign electronically on practically any device  from almost anywhere  at any time  Today  more than 560 000 customers and hundreds of millions of users in over 180 countries use DocuSign to accelerate the process of doing business as well as save time and money  I don t think I could operate at this point without it Fundamental AnalysisWhen evaluating a speculative growth stock  the most important piece of the puzzle to me is the growth rate  Currently  DocuSign s is nearly 40  quarter over quarter  Moreover  EPS growth is 17   The company is not currently profitable  yet they have a clear path to profitability  At this stage in the company s lifecycle  many investors are unwilling to take the plunge due to the fact the company has an extremely high P E ratio  When looking at momentum growth plays  I disregard the fundamental  value  statistics  There is more than one way to make money in the market  Growth and value investments are polar opposites  So  a high P E ratio in this case is a good thing  Sometimes you have to just hold your nose and take the plunge  High risk equals high reward Technical AnalysisThe stock has just broken out to all time highs and is up over 40  in just the last six months  Once again  this may keep some on the sidelines due to the fact they believe they have missed the boat  Again  this is the value investor s way of thinking  When looking at a momentum growth play  I want to see the stock breaking out and reaching new highs  I see this as a huge positive  The stock is trading above both its 50 and 200 day simple moving averages  SMA   which is also very positive Wrap upAs I said before  layer into the position as any type of negative macro event may provide a better entry point over the course of the year  Nonetheless  I recently added to my position on the latest breakout  I see the stock as a major buyout candidate as well  with a paltry  13 billion valuation  DocuSign saves companies time  money  and saves the trees  You can t ask for more than that  I am expecting shares to hit  150 over the next 12 18 months if it doesn t get bought out first  2 Facebook  FB Facebook is my cash cow solid capital appreciation play  The company is printing money yet hasn t really gone anywhere in the last year due to potential regulatory issues that I see as overblown  Furthermore  they haven t even begun to monetize Instagram yet  This fact seems lost on the bears I have faith in Zuckerberg  Just look at what he has accomplished with the company and stock so far  This is a buy and hold forever stock for me  I am an avid user of Facebook as well  None of the privacy issues or any of the other issues the company has faced has driven me away  It s where I connect with my family and friends  I don t see myself leaving the platform  Facebook has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks  with the highest price target coming in at  300   See Facebook stock analysis on TipRanks Fundamental AnalysisFacebook is a cash flow machine  The company currently has a huge cash hoard of over  200 billion  With a forward P E of 23 and a 30  growth rate  I consider the stock a bargain at current levels  I just recently added to my position as well Facebook is no longer a growth pure play  The company has proven they know how and when to monetize products  With Instagram monetization in the works and the potential for a crypto currency  I see the fundamentals only improving on a go forward basis Technical AnalysisThe current technical for Facebook is very positive  The stock is trading above both its 50 and 200 day moving averages and has recently broken out above its long term trading range  The good news is there s still plenty of room to run  Nevertheless  don t buy your entire position in one shot  That is a sure way to lose money  Always layer in over time  that way you have some dry powder on hand in case an opportunity presents itself Wrap upFacebook is a money making machine  Zuckerberg has proven he has the chops to create streams of cash flow out of thin air  I remember when the stock sold off because no one thought he would be able to monetize mobile  He sure proved them wrong  The risk reward ratio is extremely favorable at this juncture  I see 38  upside over the next 12 18 months with a  300 price target  3 AT T  T AT T is my income dividend play with modest potential for capital appreciation  I was a consultant for Bell South in the 1990s and audited Time Warner while working with Ernst   Young as well  What s more  AT T is a hometown stock for me  I grew up in San Antonio  Texas  the birthplace of modern day AT T  I can tell you from my experience with both companies I believe they can and will achieve their goals AT T is transforming from being a primarily widow and orphan stock to a dividend growth total return play  Nonetheless  don t expect any big upward moves from the current level in the near term  AT T needs to prove it can make money despite the added debt load and revenues from wireless services waning  According to TipRanks  the stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the analysts   See AT T stock analysis on TipRanks Fundamental AnalysisRecently  CFO John Stephens stated AT T expects to meet all of its commitments to shareholders  He reiterated 2020 guidance for earnings of  3 60 3 70 per share  revenue growth of 1 2   stable EBITDA margins  free cash flow around  28 billion  and dividend payout ratio in the low 50  range  This is a safe dividend income play and is ideal for those looking for income combined with capital preservation with some capital appreciation potential The company has plenty of cost cutting to do and shares to buy back  I see a slow and steady rise in the dividend payout and share price overtime  AT T s fundamentals are strong with a forward P E of 10 and a P FCF ratio of 19 Technical AnalysisAt present  AT T is at the upper end of its trading range  The stock performed the coveted Golden Cross  where the 50 day SMA passes above the 200 day SMA  Nevertheless   40 has been the ceiling for the stock over the past few years and seems to be providing strong resistance now as well  Even so  AT T is just beginning to get its streaming offering online  This new revenue stream may be just what the doctor ordered  If things go well  we could see the stock break out of the current range and climb as high as  50 over the next 12 18 months Wrap upThe fact of the matter is AT T has always been at the forefront of most new communications systems  Moreover  the company still owns the last mile in most marketplaces  As a result  AT T s growth prospects have increased substantially  This selection is the least risky pick of the three  I am looking for a 15  total return based on the 5 5  dividend yield coupled with the potential for moderate capital appreciation over time  I d say we have the potential for another 10  upside  giving you a nice double digit return over the next year with very little risk from this dividend aristocrat To find good ideas for cannabis stocks trading

Data from New York based blockchain researcher Chainalysis showed that only 1 3  of economic transactions came from merchants in the first four months of 2019

220298,441814,T,Koepka leads PGA by 1 after course record 63,news,"Brooks Koepka said before the start of the 101st PGA Championship that he believes majors are easier to win because perhaps only 35 40 players begin the tournament with a legitimate shot of beating him  The three time major champion and world s third ranked player backed up that statement with a course record 7 under par 63 in Thursday s first round in Farmingdale  N Y  Koepka s bogey free card on the demanding Black Course at Bethpage State Park included seven birdies    none of which came on the course s two par 5s   That was one of the best rounds I ve played probably as a professional   Koepka said   This golf course is brutal   However  he acknowledged that his round could have been even better and that Thursday s conditions lent themselves to low scoring  While no one in the morning wave could get within four shots of Koepka s masterpiece  New Zealand s Danny Lee used eight birdies to offset a pair of bogeys in posting a 6 under 64 in the afternoon  The next closest competitor is England s Tommy Fleetwood  who was one of the first players out Thursday and posted a 3 under 67  Another shot off the pace are Luke List  Chez Reavie  Pat Perez  France s Mike Lorenzo Vera and South Korea s Sung Kang  A star studded and deep group of players at 1 under includes world No  1 Dustin Johnson  Rickie Fowler  Phil Mickelson and Jordan Spieth  who is attempting to become only the sixth player to complete the career grand slam  Australia s Jason Day is also at 1 under  They ll begin Friday tied for ninth place  but staring a long way up at Koepka with 54 holes to play  Koepka began his round with a 30 foot birdie putt on No  10  He would roll in six more birdies to throw down the early gauntlet as he attempts to defend his title and become the first player since World War II to win his first four career majors within a two year span  He played Thursday s opening round with Tiger Woods  who had a far more stressful time around the par 70 track  Woods  seeking his 16th major title  double bogeyed the opening hole and added another double on No  17 to go out in 3 over 38  Woods blistered the opening portion of the front nine with a pair of birdies followed by an eagle on the par 5 fourth hole    his first eagle at a PGA Championship since 2001    to get under par for the first time  The rally stalled when his par putt on the following hole lipped out  and Woods added more bogeys on Nos  7 and 8 to fall eight shots back of his playing partner  The margin grew to nine when Koepka rolled in a lengthy birdie putt on his final hole while Woods made par from just off the back to complete his 2 over 72   Just make it   Koepka told reporters when asked about his thought process on the final putt   I think that was the only thing that was going through my head   I had good reads on it all day  The speed control was very solid  I felt very comfortable with the putter after a couple of changes we made  and very pleased with the way I putted today    The course  definitely tests every part of your game  that s for sure   Woods is playing for the first time since winning the Masters last month  while Koepka is coming off a fourth place finish at last week s AT T  NYSE T  Byron Nelson  He has now played 10 consecutive major rounds under par  The rust showed for Woods  who missed a pair of greens from inside of 100 yards and struggled with the speed of the greens  He ll need a solid round Friday just to make the cut  as will Rory McIlroy  who also carded a 72 but only after rolling in his first birdie of the day at No  18   It wasn t as clean as I d like to have it for sure   said Woods  who admitted he skipped Wednesday s practice round because he was  a little bit sick  but felt fine Thursday   Didn t get off to a very good start  It was a good drive and ended up in a bad spot  and I compounded the problem with trying to use the backboard behind the hole there and missing a putt I should have made   And then found my way back around  Got it back under par for the day  and let a couple slip away with a couple bad putts and a couple mistakes at the end   If Woods can take any positive away from Thursday  it may be the fact that the past four PGA champions were outside the top 10 after the first round  On the flip side  he is chasing a man in Koepka who has posted six consecutive rounds in the 60s at the PGA Championship while shooting a combined 25 under par  The scary part for the rest of the field is that Woods said that 63 was about the highest Koepka could have shot on Thursday with the way he was playing   I didn t take care of the par 5s  didn t birdie any of the par 5s   Koepka said   That was disappointing because I felt like you know those are holes you should be able to birdie      And then the second hole today  my 11th hole  I missed about a 5 footer   That would have been nice to shoot 60  I guess that would have been pretty good   But Koepka also realizes that the number he posted on Thursday already limits the number of players in the field who have a realistic shot of catching him   I wouldn t say there s very many guys   Koepka acknowledged   It tests every asset of your game  You ve got to drive the ball straight  It s long  so you ve got to hit it far and really position yourself with some of these shots in   You can t miss    you can t take a shot off  and that s what I love  There s a fine line between 5  6 over and a couple under out here  It s a fun golf course to play  that s for sure   Other notable finishers included Matt Kuchar  Xander Schauffele  England s Justin Rose and Spain s Jon Rahm at even par  Bryson DeChambeau and Italy s Francesco Molinari  2 over   Patrick Reed and Spain s

220301,441817,T,How Trading Your Own Retirement Can Fleece Your Financial Future   December 23  2019,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
OceanFirst Financial  OCFC   GlaxoSmithKline  GSK  and AT T  T  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns

220346,441862,T,How Trading Your Own Retirement Can Fleece Your Financial Future   December 11  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Southwest Gas  SWX   AT T  T  and CNB Financial  CCNE  
If this sounds like you  then here s a question  With your background and skills  should you manage your own retirement investments 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires an altogether different investing philosophy and risk   reward understanding than building wealth for retirement 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
Picking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns   but also carries a lot of risk  which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
For even the most expert stock pickers  the chances for long term achievement are thin 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

220351,441867,T,Powerful Proof Anyone Can Invest For An Early Retirement   December 09  2019,opinion,"Building sufficient financial resources to retire early may sound like a dream  but making that dream come true is not as hard as it may sound  The main thing is simply to save more money each month  No big deal  right  Well   
Usually  advisors advise 15  to 20  of total income saved every month as an objective   yet in the event that you want to retire earlier  you likely need to tighten that number up to 40  or half of your pay  Not a discipline easily practiced when you review or consider that a substantial segment of your paycheck goes to basic  non  negotiable lifestyle needs  But if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle adjustments and trade offs  it s achievable 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration 
The first point is to adhere to the key principles of long term investing  including developing a diversified portfolio that includes stocks with various styles  sizes  sectors and regions 
You may be able to accelerate your potential retirement earnings by consciously seeking higher returns  and also accepting more risk  in your investment portfolio  But whatever your risk tolerance  your portfolio must be diversified to protect against extreme market movements that could jeopardize your early retirement objective  You can choose from a number of ways to allocate investments to diversify your portfolio  and these should be informed by your individual goals  growth and income needs  appetite for risk  and age 
Once you ve begun saving at a higher rate and you have an investment plan  put that money to work in your plan as quickly as you can  Don t worry about finding the  perfect time  to invest   simply put the money in and keep it in  Let compounding work to help you grow your retirement savings at an exponential rate 
You may want to look at growth stocks with attributes acceptable for retirement investing like low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth 
The Zacks Rank routinely recognizes lower risk growth retirement portfolio picks  and here are a few that may be worth considering  PennyMac Mortgage  PMT   AT T  T  and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  Partners LP  PSXP   These growth stocks have strong Zacks Ranks and a beta of 1 or lower  with earnings and sales growth of at least 5  over the past 5 years

220369,441885,T,Tiger survives rash of upsets at WGC Match Play,news,"Tiger Woods took advantage of the uneven play by the youngest competitor in the field to win his opening match Wednesday at the WGC Dell Technologies Match Play in Austin  Texas  Playing in his first match play event since 2013  Woods beat 22 year old Aaron Wise in a match that featured few stellar shots but plenty of momentum swings  Woods build a 2 up lead after two holes  but was unable to keep his foot on the gas and found himself trailing by a hole after the 10th  With neither player executing consistently  Woods was able to get back to all square with a par on the next hole  He then won three of the next five to close out his record extending 64th match play event 3 and 1  That keeps him in control of his own destiny in the round robin format  but Woods knows he ll have to play better over the next two days to advance out of Group 13   I ve played a lot of matches over the years  and this is definitely one of the most emotional matches   Woods told the Golf Channel after securing his win when Wise three putted the 17th hole   I was up early  then I m down  then I m up  There was just a lot of ebb and flow to this match  It wasn t as though we were both playing great golf  but somehow I came out with the win   While Wise will need to win his final two matches and get some help in order to advance  Woods is still in the driver s seat  He received another gift when Brandt Snedeker birdied the 18th hole to halve the other Group 13 match against Patrick Cantlay   We weren t playing that great today  we were both struggling a little bit   Woods acknowledged   If it was a stroke play event  we d be pretty far behind  But in stroke play it s beating the guy in front of you  and that was about it and I was able to advance   Several other favored players would have loved to have squeaked out a win with less than their  A  games Wednesday  No  5 seed Justin Thomas was a 3 and 2 loser to Denmark s Lucas Bjerregaard  No  50   No  9 Xander Schauffele escaped No  62 Lee Westwood 1 up  No  52 Jim Furyk came from behind to upset Australia s Jason Day  No  12  2 up and defending champ Bubba Watson lost to No  57 Kevin Na in a bizarre turn of events  All square on the 18th tee box  Watson was a bad hop away from driving the green  Instead  he wound up in a green side bunker while Na opted to hit iron off the tee  Na found the green with his approach  while Watson s first attempt failed to get out of the bunker  With his second attempt heading for the same result  Watson picked the rolling ball up on his feet  conceding a match he appeared to have control of at 2 up through 12 holes   I wasn t playing that bad  the putts just weren t falling   Na told the Golf Channel   Anytime you beat a two time match  play  champion it s a great feeling  Bubba is the defending champion  he s a great player  and we re good buddies   Meanwhile  most of those who entered in strong form continued their momentum Wednesday  Coming off his victory at The Players two weeks ago  fourth seeded Rory McIlroy closed out American Luke List  64  5 and 4  Spain s Jon Rahm  the No  2 seed  was even more convincing in his 7 and 5 win over South Korea s Si Woo Kim  54    I think it was a combination of I rode my luck a little bit   McIlroy told reporters after his match   At times I hit some loose shots  but I somehow got away with most of them  Luke would admit he didn t play his best stuff  but I played well  He let me away on a couple of holes  but to birdie 13 and 14 to close the match out was nice   No  2 Justin Rose of England was a 2 and 1 winner over Argentina s Emiliano Grillo  53   American Bryson DeChambeau  6  handled Scotland s Russell Knox  59  3 and 1 and Italy s seventh seeded Francesco Molinari dominated Japan s Satoshi Kodaira  63  5 and 4  Also continuing his strong play was England s Paul Casey  the No  10 seed  who saved some much needed energy by beating Mexico s Abraham Ancer  58  5 and 3 just three days after winning the Valspar Championship   There s a lot   Casey said when asked by the Golf Channel about his confidence level   We re trying to manage the energy level as well  The victory was great on Sunday  But then that short window to try to get ready for this on Wednesday     we ve been trying to manage the energy   I ve been fatigued the past few days  so today was really  really good  Actually one of the better rounds of golf I ve ever played around this golf course  so form and confidence are fine   Countryman Ian Poulter  seeded 30th  was able to exercise some demons with his 2 and 1 win over Kevin Kisner  48  of the United States  It was a loss to Kisner in this event last year that prevented Poulter from reaching the quarterfinals and securing a spot in the Masters  Meanwhile  Kisner went on to lose to Watson in the final match   It was painful  I wasn t going to roll over like last year   Poulter told the Golf Channel   I knew that coming out this morning  and perhaps he wouldn t he knew I wouldn t be that easy as what the match turned out to be last year  I played very well today   I know winning your first match is really important  winning every match is really important  Today was really important to come out strong and do whatever you need to do

220381,441897,T,How Trading Your Own Retirement Can Fleece Your Financial Future   November 27  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO   Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation Limited  OVCHY  and AT T  T  
If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires an altogether different investing philosophy and risk   reward understanding than building wealth for retirement 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

First  stick with the fundamentals of long term growth investing  Choose a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to different styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
You may be able to accelerate your potential retirement earnings by consciously seeking higher returns  and also accepting more risk  in your investment portfolio  But whatever your risk tolerance  your portfolio must be diversified to protect against extreme market movements that could jeopardize your early retirement objective  You can choose from a number of ways to allocate investments to diversify your portfolio  and these should be informed by your individual goals  growth and income needs  appetite for risk  and age 
Once you ve begun saving at a higher rate and you have an investment plan  put that money to work in your plan as quickly as you can  Don t worry about finding the  perfect time  to invest   simply put the money in and keep it in  Let compounding work to help you grow your retirement savings at an exponential rate

220391,441907,T,At Brazil s Petrobras  an uphill struggle to vanquish graft,news,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Gram Slattery SAO PAULO RIO DE JANEIRO  Reuters    Five years after Brazilian prosecutors exposed a long running bribes for contracts racket at state run oil firm Petrobras  the company is proclaiming it has cleaned up its act  It has run TV spots touting its whistleblower hotline as well as a compliance department created in the wake of Brazil s epic  Car Wash  corruption scandal  which damaged the oil giant  helped tip Brazil into recession and landed a former president behind bars  In late November  citing progress it had made in rooting out graft  Petrobras closed down a special committee constituted in 2014 to aid investigations into corruption  But interviews with six people with direct knowledge of the company s graft busting efforts  including former Chief Compliance Officer Jo o Elek Jr   paint a picture of an organization still struggling to root out bad behavior  These individuals said Petroleo Brasileiro SA  as the firm is formally known  has strengthened its internal watchdog processes significantly   However  Elek and the others cited a series of obstacles that have hampered the firm s attempts to stamp out corruption  Among them  the people said  is an investigations unit which at times has been severely understaffed   In addition  the people said  bureaucratic hurdles for dismissing anyone at the state owned company  along with unwillingness by many employees to cooperate with compliance investigators  means Petrobras in some cases has left it to law enforcement to gather needed proof of wrongdoing    There was great cultural resistance  to graft probes  said Elek  who led the Petrobras compliance department from January 2015 through April 2018  A former AT T Inc  NYSE T  executive  Elek described his departure from Petrobras as amicable and said it was never meant to be a long term post   All six people were directly involved in designing or implementing Petrobras compliance programs in recent years  Four still work on Petrobras compliance issues  In a detailed statement  Petrobras vigorously denied that compliance investigators have faced significant internal obstacles  It said it has  zero tolerance  for corruption and that it is committed to  immediate interruption  of misconduct     But the company s ongoing troubles  the people said  were on full view in December with the bombshell indictments of six former and current Petrobras employees  The workers stand accused of taking kickbacks in the latest phase of Car Wash  this one centered on irregularities in the company s oil trading division from at least 2011 to 2014  Petrobras was alerted to potential problems in its trading operation since at least 2014  when a whistleblower went public with claims that the energy giant was overpaying for some of its oil purchases  The alleged scheme was also cited by two former Petrobras executives and a former senator in subsequent plea deals with prosecutors   But Petrobras did not move quickly to investigate suspicious activity  identify potential suspects and sideline them  the people said  Five of the workers indicted in December had already left Petrobras by the time authorities issued their charges   The sixth  a Houston based trader named Rodrigo Berkowitz  was still on the payroll when prosecutors issued a warrant for his arrest on Dec  5  Petrobras fired Berkowitz the same day  The alleged scheme may have been ongoing through the time of his dismissal  police inspector Felipe Pace said at the time    TIP OF THE ICEBERG   Berkowitz did not respond to multiple requests for comment  His lawyer confirmed he had agreed to plead guilty in the United States to conspiracy to commit money laundering  Berkowitz is now cooperating with U S  authorities investigating the alleged oil trading scheme  people familiar with the matter told Reuters  Legal representatives for the other five people indicted did not respond to requests for comment   Petrobras said one reason the firm could not break up the suspected oil trading racket earlier was that it lacked surveillance resources reserved for authorities  such as phone wiretaps and access to bank accounts to follow the money  Prosecutors said Berkowitz and the others accepted  31 million in bribes from intermediaries connected to some of the world s largest commodities trading firms  including European heavyweights Vitol SA   Glencore   LON GLEN  PLC and Trafigura AG   In exchange for the kickbacks  the trading companies got oil contracts at advantageous prices  defrauding Petrobras in the process  authorities said   Glencore and Trafigura declined to comment  Vitol said it has a  zero tolerance  policy with respect to bribery and corruption and that it is cooperating with authorities   Petrobras has steadfastly portrayed itself as a victim of illegal schemes perpetrated by a few rogue insiders colluding with unscrupulous contractors and greedy politicians  It downplayed the significance of the December indictments  saying they relate to alleged bribes paid years ago    The latest phase does not involve high ranking executives  politicians or big construction companies   Petrobras said in a statement   Brazilian authorities do not share that view   Some prosecutors said they are just beginning to unravel what they contend is a complex web of payoffs and players  What they know at present is just the  tip of the iceberg   prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa said during a December press conference  2 000 WHISTLEBLOWER TIPS  The Car Wash scandal was a kickback scheme on steroids  Suppliers formed a cartel to divvy up work with the state run oil behemoth  inflating contract prices to hide their payoffs to Petrobras collaborators and politicians  The illicit operation rolled along for at least a decade before Brazilian prosecutors blew the lid off   The fallout helped force President Dilma Rousseff from office in 2016 and landed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in jail last year on corruption charges   The ongoing investigation by Brazilian authorities has spread to nearly every corner of Petrobras  massive operations   Elek  the former compliance chief  said Petrobras has taken meaningful steps to prevent a repeat  Supplier vetting has gotten much tougher  he said  and there is now better tracking of project budgets and spending   But transforming Petrobras  culture into one that champions transparency will be a long term undertaking  according to Elek and the others interviewed  Five of the people said the compliance team s inquiries were frequently slow walked by management as well as by rank and file workers  For example  requests for records that should have taken days to deliver might not arrive for weeks or months  they said   In addition  Elek said powerful unions and internal company committees could sometimes hold up an employee s dismissal when evidence against him or her was not bulletproof  which he attributed in part to the bureaucratic structure of state run companies  Elek said the modest size of his internal investigations team also hampered some compliance work  He said he started with just two subordinates in the investigations unit in 2015  building it to around 40 employees by the time of his departure in 2018   He said he had hoped to recruit as many as 100 people to help tackle the workload in a sprawling company with more than 60 000 employees  But Elek said qualified workers were repeatedly blocked by their managers from joining his team   At one point in 2017  he estimates  his backlog of whistleblower complaints had reached some 2 000 cases   Petrobras disputed those staffing numbers in part  saying it had hired some 78 people for the investigations team by 2017  a figure that has since grown to 164 employees assisted by more than 180 external advisors   TOSSING OUT BAD APPLES  In its written responses to questions from Reuters  Petrobras emphasized that it has been continually improving and refining its compliance program since Car Wash emerged in 2014   The company also said it took steps late last year to make it easier to punish workers found to be involved in corruption  fraud or harassment   As part of that push  the firm overhauled an internal oversight body that used to report to the CEO  Now known as the  Discipline Committee   the three person group has two independent members  including a former federal prosecutor  Marcelo Zenkner  The committee now reports its punishment actions directly to the board of directors   But Petrobras has yet to impose independent oversight of Rafael Mendes  the current chief compliance officer  who still reports to the chief executive  The risks of that structure  some lawyers and corporate governance specialists say  were illustrated by Elek s first boss at Petrobras  Aldemir Bendine  The former CEO is now serving an 11 year jail term following his 2018 conviction for pocketing nearly  1 million in bribes from a contractor in the Car Wash scandal   Bendine was disdainful of the compliance committee and never attended one of its meetings  one person with direct knowledge of the situation said   Elek said he had no personal issues with Bendine  but that his position as chief compliance officer created natural tension with the former CEO   Alberto Toron  Bendine s lawyer  denied that his client was disdainful of the Petrobras compliance committee  Toron said Bendine s conviction related to his activities as CEO of Banco do Brasil SA  a post he held before moving to Petrobras   A sentencing document  however  cited accusations from federal prosecutors that Bendine had received the bribes while he was Petrobras CEO  after soliciting them at Banco do Brasil  Petrobras did not make Mendes available to comment on the matter  In a statement  the company said the current chain of command functions smoothly  It said the chief compliance officer has access to the board  whenever needed  and can only be fired by a full board vote   
 It is wrong to say that  from the beginning  the Petrobras chief compliance officer has encountered resistance   the firm said ",2019-03-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/at-brazils-petrobras-an-uphill-struggle-to-vanquish-graft-1801645,1801645
220392,441908,T,Signs That Your Trading Will Ruin Your Retirement   November 19  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
TriCo  TCBK   AT T  T  and American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO  
If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors

Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
It is interesting to note that the period covered by this study includes the 1987 crash  the 2000 bear market  and the Great Recession of 2008  as well as the bull market of the 1990s 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Key Takeaway for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

220433,441949,T,China s Huawei in unprecedented media blitz as it battles heightened scrutiny,news,"By Sijia Jiang HONG KONG  Reuters    China s Huawei has launched an unprecedented public relations blitz  thrusting its low key founder in front of international media as the telecoms firm seeks to ease concern among Western nations bent on shutting it out of their markets  The move  along with significant personnel change in its 300 strong corporate affairs department  comes as the world s largest telecommunications equipment maker battles fear of Chinese authorities accessing its infrastructure for espionage  In a 25 minute interview aired late on Sunday   his first with state controlled China Central Television  CCTV    Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  HWT UL  Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei shrugged off the global push against his company  which has repeatedly denied any state links   If you do  your product  well  there is no need to worry about sales    It would be stupid on their part if they don t buy   the 74 year old said in a one on one  adding to three group interviews last week with English  Chinese and Japanese media outlets   It would be their loss   Ren said  referring to the United States and other Western countries which have restricted Huawei in their markets  Before last week  Ren had had no more than 10 interviews across media since founding Huawei in 1987  CCTV said  He last met international media at Davos in 2015   My public relations department forced me   a smiling Ren told CCTV when asked why he had opened up to the media   I must make our clients understand us  make our 180 000 employees understand us  come together and get through this tough time    PERSONAL ATTACK The comments come as Polish authorities earlier this month arrested a Huawei executive on spying allegations  fuelling Western suspicion against Huawei on national security grounds  While the Chinese national who was immediately sacked by Huawei denied the allegations  Huawei is bracing for potential fallout from its biggest Western markets as Germany debates whether to follow the United States and allies such as Australia in restricting Huawei s market access  The firm has been shut out of Australia and New Zealand s markets for fifth generation  5G  mobile telecoms equipment  while the U S  President Donald Trump is considering an outright ban on all Huawei equipment with an executive order   Huawei is nevertheless seeing fast growth  securing 30 contracts to supply 5G equipment and shipping 25 000 5G base stations already   up from 25 contracts in December  Ren told CCTV  A person close to Ren told Reuters that the CEO felt the need to talk to the media after the string of negative events overshadowed the company s business over the past year   Among the most high profile events was the arrest in Canada of Ren s daughter   Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wenzhou   over alleged violations of U S  sanctions on Iran   With all the attacks over the past year  now it got personal   when your daughter gets arrested   said the person  who was not authorized to speak with media and so declined to be identified  The arrest was made at the request of the United States  and further strained Sino U S  at a time when trade friction was already threatening to undermine ties  Still  with his daughter released on bail and awaiting a U S  extradition request  Ren  in an interview with international media last week  described Trump as a  great president   FIREFIGHTING Ren s media engagement is part of a broader public relations offensive by a firm whose traditional opaqueness results from being in a highly competitive sector and having significant R D programs   perhaps lending credence to misperceptions we are too secretive   said Chen Lifang  president of public affairs   Huawei is very concerned about misunderstandings which continue to linger despite our best efforts in recent years   Chen told Reuters in a statement   Huawei is committed to being even more open and transparent for not only this year but the foreseeable future   The firm has expanded its international communications team by 25 percent to 30 people over the past six months as it steps up engagement with foreign media  including tours to research labs that had not previously been open to outsiders  Among major personnel changes  Huawei s president of global media and communications  Joy Tan  has moved to Washington to run media and government relations operations there  while Song Kai  former deputy CEO of Huawei U S  and former CEO of Huawei France  has moved back to headquarters to take over Tan s role  Huawei s Washington office has more than halved in size over the past year to low single digit regular staff members  with some employees voluntarily leaving the firm as it was pushed out of the market  people familiar with the matter said  Reuters reported earlier this month that Huawei Canada s vice president of corporate affairs had left the company as scrutiny of the firm deepened  Some Huawei employees described the rapid turn in the international environment as beyond their imagination   The AT T deal at the start of the year was like the party about to start   a member of Huawei s public relations team told Reuters  referring to a partnership with U S  company AT T Inc  N T

220450,441966,T,Signs That Your Trading Will Ruin Your Retirement   October 21  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Independent Bank  IBCP   AT T  T  and Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste  ASR  
If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
For even the most expert stock pickers  the chances for long term achievement are thin 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

220451,441967,T,AT T  T  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"AT T  T  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 28  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This telecommunications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 93 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 3  
Revenues are expected to be  45 08 billion  down 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 72  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AT T 
For AT T  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 50  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that AT T will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AT T would post earnings of  0 89 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 89  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AT T appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/att-t-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200475777,200475777

220484,442000,T,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   October 09  2019,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
Medifast  MED   Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte  OMAB  and AT T  T  
If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
Perhaps   if you re the  one in a million  investor who can expertly manage risk and maintain unflinching emotional control in volatile markets  But for most  there may be better strategies to achieve long term retirement investing goals 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
Diversification vs  Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is Successful Investing a Mind Game 
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the point we re making here is that the money you have set aside for your retirement should be invested using a more conservative  long term approach designed to produce reliable returns  so you can steadily build assets and achieve your retirement goals

220489,442005,T,USOC under pressure to fix USA Gymnastics before Tokyo 2020,news,"By Frank Pingue and Jonathan Allen  Reuters    Like a world class gymnast  the United States Olympic Committee USOC  needs to nail a perfect landing to put a damaging sexual abuse scandal behind it ahead of the 2020 Games in Tokyo  sports sponsorship experts said  The USOC s announcement this week that it would seek to revoke the status of USA Gymnastics as the national governing body for the sport reflects pressure from fans  athletes and sponsors for a lasting solution for the scandal plagued organization   If the USOC didn t take this step now  then they would have had somewhat of a revolt on their hands from athletes and fans   said Jim Andrews  an independent sponsorship consultant   USA Gymnastics has been in turmoil since dozens of female gymnasts  including Olympic champions such as Simone Biles  came forward to accuse former team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse  Nassar was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 women testified about decades of abuse at his hands  The U S  gymnastics team performed well at the world championships in Doha  Qatar  that ended on Sunday  with Biles becoming the first female gymnast in 30 years to claim a medal in all six events at a major competition   The team s success meant a solution was not required immediately  Andrews said  but was vital to bring back lost sponsors and fans   This is a reflection that the sport needs to move on   he said   This has to happen   Asked for comment  the USOC said it had nothing to add to its statement from Monday  As the scandal unfolded  sponsors including Under Armor Inc  Proctor   Gamble Co  Hershey Co  AT T Inc  NYSE T  and Kellogg Co suspended or did not renew sponsorship deals with USA Gymnastics  None of those companies responded to requests for comment on Tuesday  Nassar s sentencing did not end the crisis at USA Gymnastics  Over the past two years  three CEOs have been forced out of the organization after being criticized for the way they handled the scandal  Interim chief Mary Bono resigned just four days into the job last month    This has been such a colossal mess and it can t seem to get a CEO correct   said Bob Dorfman  a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco  referring to USA Gymnastics   There is intense pressure for it to do this right  get this out of the public eye by the time we get closer to the Olympics in 2020   Jonathan Little  an Indiana based lawyer who has represented three gymnasts in lawsuits alleging sexual abuse as well as athletes from other Olympic sports in abuse cases  dismissed the USOC s move as  window dressing    The bottom line is this is just to make themselves look good in front of Congress   he said  adding the organization fears Congress could replace it as it replaced the Amateur Athletic Union with the USOC in the 1970s  In a post on Twitter on Monday  Democratic U S  Senator Richard Blumenthal said he hoped this  signals USOC will be more vigilant in protecting athletes   survivors when others fail them    Some of Nassar s victims such as 2000 Olympic Bronze Medalist Jamie Dantzscher  who has filed a lawsuit against USA Gymnastics  want nothing less than a new governing body    It is time for this organization to be replaced   she said in a statement on Monday  Andrews  the independent sponsorship consultant said sponsors would eventually return to the sport  but only if USA Gymnastics is replaced with an effective body that has the trust of athletes and fans

220526,442042,T,Elliot Management Discloses Major Stake In AT T  T  ,opinion,"Shares of AT T   NYSE T   soared today after active investor Elliot Management Corp disclosed it owns a  3 2 billion stake in the telecommunications giant  the telecom giant jumped as much as 7  in premarket trading  and has gained about 2  in intraday 
Active investors like Elliot Management take large stakes in companies that they believe are undervalued and then leverage their new position to institute the changes they would like to see in the company  However  unlike its peers  Elliot has the size and influence to buy entire companies instead of pushing for changes as a minority stake holder  The hedge fund recently bought health care tech company Athenahealth  and is in the works of acquiring the manufacturing company Arconic   NYSE ARNC   
Elliot Weighs in on AT T s Operations 
The active investor sent a letter to the company expressing their ideas to help improve AT T  Elliot argued for ways to improve its business and realize historic increases in value  raising concerns about AT T s recent acquisition of Time Warner and stating that  AT T has yet to articulate a clear strategic rationale for why AT T needs to own Time Warner   The New York based hedge fund also wrote in the letter that it is seeking seats on the company s board and further challenged AT T to sharpen its focus on its successful wireless business and trim unnecessary assets  Elliot was also critical about the company s acquisition of DirecTV 
AT T s chief executive Randall Stephenson made the company one of the biggest US media players by buying DirecTV and Time Warner over the past few years  The acquisitions  however  left the company with  170 billion in net debt by the end of 2018  The letter blamed AT T s underperformance over the past decade on Stephenson s acquisition strategy  stating  AT T has transformed itself into a sprawling collection of businesses battling well funded competitors  in new markets  with different regulations  and saddled with the financial repercussions of its choices  
AT T shares hit a multiyear low in December as investors were unsure about the company s debt load sustainability  The telecommunications giant spent the past year fortifying its balance sheet by selling off certain assets like its stake in streaming service Hulu  as well as ownership of WarnerMedia s new Manhattan headquarters 
In response to Elliot s letter  AT T said its management team and Board of Directors  maintain a regular and open dialogue with shareholders and will review Elliot Management s perspectives in the context of the company s business strategy   They also expressed that the focused and successful execution of their current strategy is the best path to take moving forward to provide long term value for shareholders 
Bottom Line 
AT T is sitting at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and has a Style Score of A in Value  The stock currently trades at 10X its forward earnings  well below the industry average of 16X  The current valuation of the stock provides a solid entry point if the company can capitalize on the acquisitions it has made in recent years 
Now  in terms of growth  consensus estimates have the company making a bottom line jump of 4 44  to  0 94 and sales slipping 0 62  to  45 45 billion for the current quarter  Full fiscal year estimates anticipate AT T to see an earnings increase of 1 42  to  3 57 and sales growth of 7 02  to  182 75 billion  Its low beta of 0 62 also provides shareholders protection from broader market volatility  but the company still needs to figure out a way to successfully monetize its acquisitions and trim down its debt

220553,442069,T,Brexit Sword Hanging Over Market May Spur Sterling Bond Issuance,news," Bloomberg     Companies considering a sterling bond sale may need to hurry up as potential Brexit deadlock looms 
The U K  s path to exiting the European Union in March is still far from certain  despite some promising signs that a deal may soon be agreed  A no deal scenario would open up a host of regulatory and economic complications  with borrowers highlighting risks including possible flight disruptions  legal holes  or loss of EU funding in bond documents  These worries may intensify in the weeks ahead  potentially driving up borrowing costs or even shutting the market 
 If I were a treasurer thinking  I may need to access markets between late September and June   I would be nervous   said Ian Robinson  a fund manager at BMO Global Asset Management  which oversees more than 75 billion pounds   98 billion  of fixed income worldwide   No one can be sure how bond markets in the U K  may react to adverse scenarios  
The potential issuance window is also squeezed by corporate earnings next month as well as key Brexit meetings in the run up to year end  Such concerns probably helped fuel a post summer pickup in sterling sales  with borrowers issuing a total of 5 6 billion pounds of notes marketwide since the Aug  27 U K  national holiday  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Pension Insurance Corp   ports operator DP World Ltd  and cigarette maker Japan Tobacco Inc  may also bring deals soon 
AT T  BMW
AT T Inc  NYSE T   sold 750 million pounds of bonds maturing in 2026 last week  only the third U S  corporate sale in sterling this year  The Dallas based telecommunications company said the deal was part of efforts to diversify in debt in an email to Bloomberg News 
BMW AG issued its second sterling deal of the year on Sept  5  The German automaker has 950 million pounds of notes maturing in December and a similar total due across the whole of next year  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
 Sterling issuances are a relevant source of funding in the bond market for the group   BMW spokesman Max Morten Borgmann said by email 
Still  recent corporate pound sales have slowed compared to last year  dropping 7 percent to 1 9 billion pounds in the 11 trading days after the U K  national holiday versus the equivalent period last year  By contrast  euro sales are up about 12 percent at 23 1 billion euros   27 billion   partly because of issuers reviving deals that were delayed by market volatility earlier in the year 
Corporate sales in both currencies will likely cool next month due to restrictions ahead of earnings  Whether the market will reopen again after that  particularly in sterling  may largely depend on the Brexit talks 
 This year it is difficult to know if volatility will hit again   said Luke Hickmore  a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investment in Edinburgh  If it does  the window may close  very quickly   he said ",2018-09-12,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/brexit-sword-hanging-over-market-may-spur-sterling-bond-issuance-1606672,1606672

220570,442086,T,Democratic candidates told not to use ZTE  Huawei devices  source,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Democratic National Committee warned party candidates running in November elections not to use devices made by Chinese telecommunications companies ZTE Corp  HK 0763  and Huawei Technologies because they pose a security risk  a Democratic source said on Friday 
U S  lawmakers and the Trump administration have pressured U S  companies to not sell Huawei or ZTE  SZ 000063  products  saying they potentially could be used to spy on Americans  Earlier this year they pushed AT T  N T  to drop a deal with Huawei to sell its smartphones in the United States  
The source said Bob Lord  the DNC s chief security officer  said in a email that it was important for party and campaign workers to be vigilant about the warnings 
 Please make sure that you are not using or purchasing ZTE or Huawei devices anywhere within your staff   for personal or work related use   Lord said 
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai told Congress in March he shared the concerns of U S  lawmakers about espionage threats from Huawei 
 Hidden  back doors  to our networks in routers  switches   and virtually any other type of telecommunications equipment   can provide an avenue for hostile governments to inject viruses  launch denial of service attacks  steal data  and more   Pai said at the time

220571,442087,T,Huawei in British spotlight over use of U S  firm s software,news,"By Jack Stubbs and Joseph Menn LONDON SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Huawei Technologies is facing increased scrutiny in Britain because it is using an aging software component sold by a firm based in the United States  one of the countries where lawmakers allege its equipment could facilitate Chinese spying  sources told Reuters  The fact that the British misgivings stem in part from Huawei s relationship with a U S  company shows how trade wars and heightened national security concerns are making it harder for technology firms and governments to safeguard products and communication networks   A report last month by a British government oversight board charged with analyzing Huawei equipment said it had found technical and supply chain  shortcomings  which exposed the country s telecoms networks to new security risks  One of those is due to Huawei s use of the VxWorks operating system  which is made by California based Wind River Systems  said three people with knowledge of the matter  all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing details which were not made public in the report   The sources said the version of VxWorks being used by Huawei will stop receiving security patches and updates from Wind River in 2020  even though some of the products it is embedded in will still be in service  potentially leaving British telecoms networks vulnerable to attack   Third party software  including security critical components  on various component boards will come out of existing long term support in 2020  even though the Huawei end of life date for the products containing this component is often longer   the July report  which did not name VxWorks  said  U S  and Australian lawmakers have said Huawei s products can be used to facilitate Chinese espionage operations  an allegation the world s biggest producer of telecoms equipment has repeatedly denied  All three sources said there was no indication that the VxWorks mismatch was deliberate  There is also no suggestion that the software itself represents a security risk   Reuters was not able to establish which Huawei products were involved or what steps the Chinese company was taking to address the issue  A spokeswoman for Wind River Systems said she was unable to comment on Huawei  but said the company often helped customers upgrade to newer software versions   Wind River offers migration routes and paths for its customers  which should be pretty well known and understood in the industry   she said  A Huawei spokesman declined to comment on specific issues in the report but said the company would address any areas for improvement which were raised by British authorities       Cyber security remains Huawei s top priority  and we will continue to actively improve our engineering processes and risk management systems   he said  LEGITIMATE CONCERN While the United States and Australia have moved to restrict the use of its gear due to security concerns  Huawei has been deepening ties with Britain  supplying broadband equipment to its largest telecoms provider  BT Group  L BT   and mobile networks for wireless giant  Vodafone  Group  L VOD    Consultant Edward Amoroso  a former chief security officer at AT T  NYSE T   said Huawei s experience in Britain showed the challenges of securing international supply chains   Although no one should dismiss Huawei as a supplier solely because of its geographical location  reliance on software that is going out of support is a legitimate concern  Amoroso said   I don t care if it s from China  Indiana or the moon  it speaks badly for them   he added      The globalized nature of the technology industry has come under increasing scrutiny as countries seek to limit the use of equipment from nations they regard as adversaries  In the United States  the Pentagon is working on a  do not buy  list to block vendors who use software code originating from Russia and China  and Moscow has had problems implementing a data storage law without relying on foreign technology  By contrast  London says it effectively addresses any security issues presented by the use of Huawei products as part of Britain s critical national infrastructure by having the equipment reviewed by staff at a special company laboratory  This is overseen by British government and intelligence officials who report annually on its work  In addition to the issue with VxWorks  this year s report also cited technical issues which limited security researchers  ability to check internal product code   Many in the cybersecurity industry say efforts to bar equipment or software on grounds of nationality are futile because of the deeply inter dependent nature of the global technology business    There s a real dilemma for policy makers  for politicians   said Robert Hannigan  former director of Britain s GCHQ spy agency and now executive chairman for Europe at cybersecurity services firm BlueVoyant

220579,442095,T,Dividend Aristocrat AT T Is Leading The 5G Revolution,opinion,"Wireless technology has come a long way 
The first generation of wireless called 1G rolled out in the 1980s  The only thing you could do with it was make a phone call  And the call quality rivaled that of two tin cans connected by a string 
Since then there s been a new generation of wireless tech about every 10 years  1G gave way to 2G  then 3G and 4G each generation faster and more reliable than the last 
Now we re arriving at 5G  The rollout should be complete around June 2020 
This new technology will let phones and computers communicate 1 000X faster than 4G  It will also make everything from self driving cars to remote surgery possible 
As with any new technology  investors are clamoring for the  best  way to profit from this trend  That means different things for different people 
The Safest Way to Profit from the 5G Revolution Some investors are looking for that  moonshot  stock  You know  the one that might quickly shoot up 100  or more 
Of course  those kinds of wins are great  If one of my stocks shoots up 100   I m thrilled 
But let s face it  they re called moonshot stocks for a reason  They re not all that safe  You might make a lot of money  But you might lose a lot of money  too 
That s not what I m after 
Instead  we re focused on safe and reliable dividend paying stocks  But that doesn t mean we have to sit on the sidelines 
That s where telecom giant AT T  NYSE T  comes in 
The First Company to Roll Out 5G
AT T is the second largest wireless carrier in the US 
It was also the first provider to start rolling out 5G technology  The company expects to complete its 5G nationwide network in 2020 
AT T will also directly benefit as other wireless providers roll out 5G 
See  around a third of Americans are AT T customers  And all of their data will be transferred on the company s infrastructure  So the more data transferred the more people call  text  download YouTube videos  and do the thousands of other things we now do on our phones the more money AT T will make 
But that s not the only reason to like AT T  especially if you re an income investor 
First off  AT T pays a huge 6  dividend yield  That s over three times the dividend yield on the S P 500 
It s also part of an elite group called the Dividend Aristocrats  These are companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years 
AT T has increased its dividend 34 years in a row now  That s incredible  In fact  only 40 companies in the S P 500 have raised their dividends longer and more consistently than AT T 
Safer than the Competition
Over three decades of consistent dividend increases means AT T s dividend is certainly reliable  But it s also safe  as I ll show you in a moment 
That s extremely important  If a company cuts its dividend  its share price is going to crater  Not good 
As a general rule  the higher the dividend yield  the less safe it is  So  when I saw AT T s 6  dividend yield  the first thing I did was plug it into the Dividend Sustainability Index  DSI   my proprietary tool for measuring dividend safety 
The DSI looks at three key things  payout ratio  debt to equity ratio  and free cash flow  I ll walk you through each one 
The payout ratio tells you how much of a company s net income it pays out to shareholders as dividends  The lower the payout ratio  the better 
Next is the debt to equity ratio  No surprise  the more debt a company has  the harder it is to run a business  That includes paying the dividend 
The last thing the DSI looks at is free cash flow  This is the amount of cash the company has left after it pays expenses 
AT T excels in all three categories  For perspective  I compared AT T s DSI score to three major competitors  and it blows them out of the water 

Not only does AT T pay a higher dividend than these companies  its dividend is also safer

220591,442107,T,Analysts Estimate AT T  T  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when AT T  T  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This telecommunications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 90 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 1  
Revenues are expected to be  44 96 billion  up 15 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 13  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AT T 
For AT T  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 15  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AT T will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AT T would post earnings of  0 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 86  delivering a surprise of  1 18  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AT T doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-att-t-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200440712,200440712

220595,442111,T,Exclusive  Britain says Huawei  shortcomings  expose new telecom networks risks,news,"By Jack Stubbs LONDON  Reuters    Technical and supply chain issues with equipment made by Chinese firm Huawei have exposed Britain s telecom networks to new security risks  a government report said on Thursday  The assessment  made in a report signed off by Britain s GCHQ spy agency  will intensify the espionage debate around Huawei Technologies  HWT UL   which has come under increasing fire in the United States and Australia over concerns it could facilitate Chinese government spying  The report was released after sources told Reuters that senior British security officials say they can now give only limited assurances that Huawei s UK operations pose no threat to national security  downgrading their previous position   Identification of shortcomings in Huawei s engineering processes have exposed new risks in the UK telecommunication networks and long term challenges in mitigation and management   officials said in the report  Huawei  the world s biggest producer of telecoms equipment  said that it welcomed the thrust of the report by the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre  HCSEC  oversight board  which it said showed supervision by British authorities was working well   The report concludes that HCSEC s operational independence is both robust and effective  The Oversight Board has identified some areas for improvement in our engineering processes   a Huawei spokesman said   We are grateful for this feedback and are committed to addressing these issues  Cyber security remains Huawei s top priority  and we will continue to actively improve our engineering processes and risk management systems   Huawei says no inspection has ever found any backdoor vulnerabilities in its equipment  It says it is a private company not under Chinese government control and not subject to Chinese security laws overseas  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE  Huawei is a major supplier of broadband gear and mobile networks in Britain  meaning its products are used in critical national infrastructure which could be targeted by foreign adversaries   London says it effectively addresses security issues by having all Huawei products reviewed by staff at a special company laboratory overseen by British government and intelligence officials  The laboratory  known as HCSEC  was set up by Huawei in 2010 in response to British government concerns about possible security threats to national infrastructure  British security officials  including from GCHQ  sit on its oversight board and report annually on its work   But for the first time  Thursday s report by the oversight board reduced the level of security assurance it said was provided by HCSEC  Officials said HCSEC provided  unique  world class cyber security expertise and technical assurance   but also that they had identified technical issues which limited security researchers  ability to check internal product code  There were also concerns about the security of components from outside suppliers which are used in Huawei products  the report said  A spokesman for Britain s National Cyber Security Centre  which is part of Government Communications Headquarters  GCHQ   said a program to resolve the code issue was underway and should be completed by mid 2020  HCSEC is discussing questions about the use of third party software with Huawei  he added  with the aim of finding a  strategic fix  for the problem    This government and British telecoms operators work with Huawei at home and abroad to ensure the UK can continue to benefit from new technology while managing cyber security risks   he said   BIG CHANGE  Previous oversight board reports published in each of the last three years concluded that HCSEC provided  assurance that any risks to UK national security from Huawei s involvement in the UK s critical networks have been sufficiently mitigated   A person with direct knowledge of Huawei s work with the British government said the new assessment that HCSEC could now only provide limited assurance was a  big change  though understated   Huawei has been deepening ties in Britain over the last decade and now supplies broadband equipment to the country s largest telecoms provider  BT Group  L BT   and mobile networks for wireless giant  Vodafone  Group  L VOD    It is also a major supplier to other European telecom carriers including Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  and  Telefonica   MC TEF    BT  its operating subsidiaries  and Vodafone were not immediately available to comment on Thursday s report   Huawei employs 1 500 people in Britain and in February pledged to spend a further 3 billion pounds   4 01 billion  in Britain following a high profile meeting between chairwoman Sun Yafang and British Prime Minister Theresa May  That is in stark contrast to the United States  where lawmakers have stepped up efforts to bar Huawei equipment from the country s networks   Huawei has also been thwarted in its efforts to establish its U S  mobile handset business  The largest U S  consumer electronics retailer  Best Buy  has stopped stocking Huawei products  and a potential breakthrough deal with U S  carrier AT T Inc  N T  collapsed in January

When looking at the last two reports  this telecommunications company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 1 18   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  AT T came out with earnings of  0 86 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 85 per share  representing a surprise of 1 18   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 85 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 86 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 18

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
AT T currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 64   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on July 24  2019

220606,442122,T,Stocks  commodities regain footing after slump,news,"By Marc Jones
LONDON  Reuters    Stocks and commodity markets regained some poise on Thursday  having suffered wild tailspins in the previous session as the United States ratcheted up trade war threats on China 
A 2 percent rebound on China s big bourses  SS  steadied Asian nerves as oil markets clawed back some of Wednesday s 7 percent slump that had marked their worst day in 2 1 2 years 
Beaten up industrial metals including copper and nickel and European stocks pulled higher too in early trade  EU   while there was some relief for Turkish markets after the lira had been dumped to a record low by interest rate cut talk from its re elected President Tayyip Erdogan   IS 
The dollar meanwhile rose to a six month high against the Japanese yen after U S  inflation data that bolstered the case for more Federal Reserve rate hikes this year 
 It mostly seems to be relief after the all red  risk off day yesterday   said Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen 
 The basis for this is not entirely clear to me though because it doesn t seem like this  U S  threats of another  200 of China trade tariffs  has actually restarted negotiations with China    In fact I would argue that it has made the risk of an accident or an unwanted outcome bigger  
Europe s moves were less pronounced than Asia s had been  perhaps reflecting that caution 
The Shanghai Composite and blue chip CSI300 indexes had both ended the day up 2 2 percent  Shares in Japan  T   Australia and Hong Kong closed 1 1  1 and 0 6 percent higher respectively 
The pan European STOXX 600 inched up just 0 2 percent though  with gains in the healthcare and consumer sectors offset by losses in the banking sector and in energy firms after the dramatic drop in oil prices 
Germany s 10 year bond yield and the euro were both broadly steady with traders awaiting minutes from the most recent European Central Bank meeting  A Reuters report showed its policymakers remain split on when to raise interest rates next year 
The difference between 10 year U S  Treasuries and equivalent German Bund yields stood near 30 year highs at 2 59 percent 
 If stocks drop sharply then the Fed will pause and  moreover  we think the U S  is toward the end of its rate hike cycle   said Thu Lan Nguyen  an FX analyst at Commerzbank  DE CBKG  in Frankfurt 
CAUTION  FRAGILE CHINA
Focus was still on what the next steps in the tit for tat trade conflict might be  China has accused the United States of bullying and warned it could hit back  although the form of retaliation is not yet clear 
The retaliatory options available to China include boycotting American goods  sharply devaluing the yuan  and selling off U S  Treasury holdings  Xiao Minjie  senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo  wrote in a note 
China s yuan had strengthened 0 3 percent overnight though   partially recovering from a big slide the previous day after an official currency market level set by the People s Bank of China was not as weak as some had feared

220607,442123,T,Justice Department to appeal approval of AT T acquisition of Time Warner,news,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Justice Department said on Thursday it would appeal a federal judge s approval of AT T Inc s  N T   85 4 billion acquisition of Time Warner  raising the prospect barely a month after the deal closed that it could be undone  AT T was sued by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds  saying that the deal would harm consumers  but U S  District Judge Richard Leon last month approved the deal  allowing it to move forward following a lengthy trial  The merger  first announced in October 2016  was also opposed by President Donald Trump   Leon ruled that the tie up between AT T s wireless and satellite businesses with Time Warner s movies and television shows was legal under antitrust law  AT T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told reporters on Thursday at a conference in Sun Valley  Idaho  that the company was not surprised about the Justice Department s decision to appeal   They have the right to appeal  Everyone has the right to appeal  We have a very fact based thoughtful order  It will be evaluated on those grounds   he said  A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment  The Justice Department opted in June not to seek an immediate stay of the court s approval of the merger  allowing the deal to close on June 14  The Justice Department still had 60 days  however  to appeal the decision approving the merger   The government s notice of appeal filed in U S  District Court in Washington did not disclose on what grounds it intends to challenge the approval  Michael Carrier  an antitrust expert at Rutgers University  said the Justice Department could challenge Leon s analysis of the facts of the case  the economic arguments given or what Carrier described as an apparent pro defendant approach by the judge   Leon had sharply urged the Justice Department not to seek a stay of his ruling  saying it would be  manifestly unjust  to do so and not likely to succeed  In his ruling  he said the government had failed to show competitive harm   AT T told the Justice Department in a June 14 letter that it would manage Time Warner s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit and take other steps until February 2019 or until any government appeal   AT T also said that in the short term  it would have no role in setting Turner prices and the number of Turner employees and target compensation and benefits would remain  largely unchanged   AT T also said it would implement a firewall between Turner and AT T to prevent the exchange of sensitive information of unaffiliated programmers or distributors  In 2016  the Justice Department had demanded that AT T sell the Turner networks  which include CNN  as part of approving the merger  John Bergmayer  senior counsel at advocacy group Public Knowledge  said that since the deal was approved  AT T had raised prices for some video and wireless services   The AT T Time Warner transaction is a bad deal for consumers and competition   he said   Judge Leon s decision contained numerous errors  and we believe the DOJ s position should be vindicated   Deals approved by a federal judge have been undone on appeal in the past   
In 2001  H J  Heinz Co called off its acquisition of Beech Nut after an appeals court overturned a lower court s decision to allow the merger  The Federal Trade Commission had argued the deal would have merged the No  2 and No  3 baby food makers and that competition would be  lessened substantially  if it were to go forward ",2018-07-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-justice-department-to-appeal-approval-of-att-acquisition-of-time-warner-1528102,1528102
220613,442129,T,AT T Stock Is A Buy For Dividend Investors,opinion,"Dividend Aristocrats are those companies that have been able to increase their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years 
Attaining this status is not something that is easily accomplished  First  a company must be a member of the S P 500  which means they must be one of the largest companies in the U S  Second  a company must offer a product or service that consumers cannot do without  This allows the company to grow for long periods of time  Lastly  and perhaps most importantly to income investors  a company must have the ability to weather all phases of the economic cycle if they hope to be able to increase its dividend payment for at least a quarter of a century 
The Dividend Aristocrats are such an exclusive group that there are currently only 57 companies that have earned this title 
One well known Dividend Aristocrat that we think is an excellent purchase right now is AT T  NYSE T   AT T stock is a buy today especially for dividend investors 
Over the last year  AT T s stock has underperformed the S P 500  returning only 2 7  compared to the index s 7 3  gain  Year to date  AT T has seen its share price increase 13 7   This is a solid return less than six months into the year  but still below the S P 500 s 17 7  climb 
We think that this underperformance against the market gives the stock the potential to see impressive growth going forward 
Company Background and Financial Results
AT T has been in existence in some form or another for more than 140 years  Companies don t last that long if they don t offer quality products or services  Today  AT T offers mobile  broadband and other communications services to consumers and businesses in the U S  After purchasing WarnerMedia in 2018  the company also offers Turner  HBO and Warner Bros  content  AT T also provides advertising services in Latin America 
AT T that we know today is a complex mix of merges and spinoffs that have been taking place since the early 1980s  The company trades with a market capitalization of just under  237 billion and produced approximately  170 billion in sales in 2018 
AT T released financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on 4 24 2019  The company s top line grew 17 9  to  44 8 billion  This was primarily due to the Time Warner acquisition  Despite the double digit growth  sales missed estimates by  280 million  Earnings per share totaled  0 86  which was  0 01 below estimates and a 1 2  increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 
The Mobility segment  which is the largest in the company  grew revenues 1 2  to  17 6 billion  Service revenue improved 2 9   but was offset by a 4 5  decline in equipment 
AT T had 80K net postpaid phone adds  which was the first positive total for the first quarter in five years  179K smart phone net adds was offset by 482K tablet and other computing device net losses  Postpaid phone churn increased to 0 93  from 0 84  from the first quarter of last year 
Sales for the Entertainment Group declined to 0 9  to  11 3 billion as the company lost a net 627K subscribers  DIRECTV NOW lost 83K subscribers due to price increases and less emphasis on promotions  AT T did see 93K broadband net adds during the quarter 
Business Wireline experienced a sales decline of 3 7  to  6 5 billion  as growth in strategic and managed services only partially offset declines in legacy products  Wireline capabilities grew 5 5  year over year 
WarnerMedia grew sales 3 3  to  8 4 billion on the strength of Warner Bros   which was up 8 6  due to double digit gains in theatrical product revenues  Revenues for Warner Bros  television was higher by nearly 8  as well  On the other hand  Turner sales dropped 0 4  due to a decrease in advertising  Advertising results were negatively impacted by the shift of NCAA Final Four games into the second quarter 
AT T expects to earn  3 60 per share in 2019  which would be an increase of 2 3  from the previous year  We expect that the company can grow earnings per share at a rate of 3 1  per year through 2024  This is slightly above the company s 10 year growth rate  but growth from WarnerMedia should help propel higher growth for AT T 
Dividend Analysis
While first quarter results were mixed  income investors likely weren t too concerned as the AT T is primarily known for its dividend  The company has raised its dividend for the past 35 years  Currently sitting at 6 3   the company s yield is more than three times the average yield of the S P 500  This makes the stock very attractive for investors searching for income  The current yield is also above the stock s 10 year average yield of 5 6 
A high yield can often be a sign that the company has a deteriorating business  making the dividend prime for a cut 
This is likely not the case with AT T as its dividend is well supported by cash flow 
Over the last four quarters  AT T has generated more than  25 billion in free cash flow  The company has paid out  14 1 billion in dividends during this time period  which represents just 55  of free cash flow produced during this period of time 
This has enabled AT T to sustain its dividend  but also help pay down debt  For example  between free cash flow and asset sales  the company expects to pay down nearly 75  of the  40 billion it had to issue to acquire Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX  by the end of the year 
In addition  AT T has been through three separate recessions and has managed to increase its dividend each time  Because of this  we find that the 6   yield is very safe even in the event of a prolonged downturn in the company s business 
Valuation Analysis
In addition to earnings growth and dividend yield  Sure Dividend believes that changes in an investment s valuation can also have an impact on total returns 
AT T closed the 6 21 2019 trading session at   32 50  Based off of expected earnings per share of  3 60 for 2019  the stock has a price to earnings  or P E  ratio of 9  This compares quite favorably to our five year target P E ratio of 12  If shares were to reach our target by 2024  then valuation would add 5 9  to total returns during this period of time 
If this comes to fruition  then total annual returns would be made up of the following 
  3 1  earnings growth    6 3  dividend yield    5 9  multiple expansion 
When you factor in earnings growth  dividends and possible changes in valuation  investors could be looking at 15 3  total returns for shares of A T over the next five years 
Final Thoughts
AT T s stock has performed well in 2019  though it trails the return of the market index  The company s most recent quarter showed signs of both strength and weakness  Gains in Wireless Service and TimeWarner were offset by the Entertainment Group  Business Wireline and Latin America 
Still  the stock offers a 6   dividend yield that we feel is very safe  In total  investors looking beyond the short term could be rewarded with at least 15  returns through 2024  As such  shares of AT T receive a strong buy recommendation from Sure Dividend

220632,442148,T,Billionaire Slim  America Movil  could profit from election of Mexican leftist,news,"By Julia Love and Christine Murray MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Billionaire Carlos Slim has had harsh words for Mexico s presidential frontrunner  saying recently he is  concerned and afraid  about what leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador might do if elected  But a victory by Lopez Obrador  who holds a double digit lead in most polls before the July 1 vote  could provide upside for Slim s fortunes  particularly with regard to his America Movil  MX AMXL  telecommunications empire  Reuters interviews with a dozen close friends  partners and other people familiar with their dealings show  Lopez Obrador s pick for telecoms minister  Javier Jimenez  told Reuters he favors re examining some regulations stemming from Mexico s landmark 2014 telecommunications reform  a law that has clipped America Movil s profits and inhibited its expansion  That is because Slim s company  which possesses the largest network in Mexico  could play a key role in delivering cell coverage to rural areas but complains current regulations hold it back  Lopez Obrador has championed better connectivity for the nation s impoverished farmers and indigenous people  who are some of his strongest supporters   We have to define a policy so that within six years there is the possibility of 5G across the whole country   said Jimenez  who went to college with Slim and has known him for some 60 years  He emphasized that all players would be invited to take part  Jimenez said such a shift could include reviewing criteria for evaluating  preponderance   That concept in the telecoms law triggers tougher regulation for players with more than 50 percent market share  America Movil still accounts for more than 60 percent of Mexico s fixed lines and mobile users  America Movil executives have complained publicly the company is hamstrung from entering underserved areas because that would only increase its market share  prolonging antitrust scrutiny  Jimenez said the country s reform is behind on its mandate to expand access  He said a Lopez Obrador administration would not seek to modify the overall reform  which created an independent regulator  but would conduct a review of secondary regulations to ensure competition is not coming at the expense of coverage   There shouldn t be competition for competition s sake   Jimenez said   Competition is an element  a tool  that permits a larger goal  which is better attention to the user   There could be even more good news for Slim  Jimenez and another Lopez Obrador adviser  telecoms veteran Abel Hibert  said they were open to the idea of granting America Movil a television license  a sector the company has long been denied entry because of its size and influence  Such a move would be up to regulators  But if it came to pass  it would allow America Movil to achieve its dream of offering customers phone service  internet and video in one package  and  Jimenez said  could help serve far flung consumers  Changes to Mexico s telecoms landscape would come with high stakes  The reform  which required a constitutional amendment  enjoys broad public support  Rates fell  service improved and consumers have more choices  U S  based AT T Inc  N T  invested heavily to grab a share of a market with an estimated 114 million cell subscriptions  Many are wary of softening measures against Slim  whose company has waged numerous court battles to stymie the legislation and maintain its power   If we let down our guard  America Movil will only get stronger   said Senator Gerardo Flores  whose Partido Verde helped pass the reform  A spokesman for America Movil declined to comment  as did a spokeswoman for Lopez Obrador  A PRAGMATIC RELATIONSHIP The prospect of Lopez Obrador  a social activist and economic nationalist  as president has spooked some leading Mexican businesspeople  Yet pragmatism has marked the relationship between the austere politician and Slim  Mexico s richest man  The pair tussled recently over a proposed  13 billion airport for Mexico City  Lopez Obrador decried it as a waste of taxpayers  money  Slim called a rare press conference to defend the project  for which his construction companies hold lucrative contracts  But the controversy faded quickly  Lopez Obrador subsequently said that  if elected  he would consider allowing the private sector to finance the airport  alleviating the need for public money   a solution Slim himself had proposed  Practicality likewise prevailed in the early 2000s  when Lopez Obrador was Mexico City mayor  and he and Slim teamed up to revitalize the decrepit historic center  They clashed early  Slim regularly attended the meetings  but while he was out undergoing a medical procedure  Lopez Obrador s team attempted to make major changes  two people familiar with the project said  Rather than feuding  Slim suggested the men divvy up responsibilities  The project was ultimately a success  Slim saw the value of his downtown real estate holdings soar  while Lopez Obrador positioned himself for national office   Slim doesn t consider Lopez Obrador his ideal leader  and Lopez Obrador doesn t consider Slim his ideal businessperson   said James Jones  a former U S  ambassador to Mexico who knows both men   But I think they can work together   Telecommunications could provide another avenue for the men to help each other get what they want  Mexico s telecoms reform was a rude awakening for Slim  who acquired the former state owned Telmex phone monopoly in the 1990s and has dominated the nation s industry ever since  The legislation aimed at loosening America Movil s grip  The company was forced to share its network with competitors and initially was banned from charging interconnection fees  The company saw its Mexican profit margins fall to less than 35 percent from 45 percent in just a few years  Consumers  meanwhile  rejoiced as rates fell by roughly 40 percent  But more than a third of Mexicans still lack a mobile subscription  behind countries such as Argentina and Brazil  according to estimates from trade group GSMA Intelligence  Millions live in areas without coverage  Reaching those Mexicans would be a top priority for Lopez Obrador  adviser Jimenez said  Noting that companies favor profitable urban areas  he said the administration would entice them to invest in less lucrative rural zones  He did not provide specifics  Some telecoms experts say Mexico s regulations could potentially be tweaked so not all rural subscribers count toward America Movil s market share  though there is some debate about how much flexibility the constitution allows  Slim already has weakened one major plank of the reform  persuading the Supreme Court in August to overturn a provision that had forced America Movil to let rivals use its network for free  To be sure  Lopez Obrador s influence would have limits  The reform created an independent regulator  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT   which oversees competition  But Lopez Obrador could shape the regulator over time  The next president will name four of seven commissioners  Jimenez stressed he would respect the IFT s autonomy and work collaboratively to chart the right course  Nevertheless  many in telecoms are convinced a victory by Lopez Obrador would be a win for Slim as well  
When the men were sparring over the airport   I found it more like a sort of charade   said Ernesto Piedras of research firm CIU in Mexico City   There s been a very long period of them being close and collaborative for political and economic purposes  ",2018-06-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/billionaire-slim-america-movil-could-profit-from-election-of-mexican-leftist-1496143,1496143

from the impending 5G boom  deploying mobile 5G services in select regions in 19 cities across the United States AT T has also revamped its video content lineup at competitive prices  The strategic move is likely to increase its subscriber base and augment overall revenues as lower video packages are offset by higher digital ad revenues  The company has restructured its WarnerMedia business to focus more on video streaming service and fine tuned its operating model with the evolving needs of customers  As part of the overhaul process of the newly minted WarnerMedia unit  AT T has consolidated all its affiliates and sales groups under a unified platform  with its units organized under entertainment networks  live programming  content production and affiliate and advertising

This telecommunications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  45 09 billion  up 18 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AT T 
For AT T  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 49  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that AT T will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AT T would post earnings of  0 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 86  delivering a surprise of  1 18  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AT T appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/att-t-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200407696,200407696

220693,442209,T,BT to cut 13 000 jobs as it tackles bloated legacy,news,"By Paul Sandle and Kate Holton LONDON  Reuters    BT  L BT  will cut 13 000 managerial and back office jobs and move to a smaller London base in the latest attempt by the boss of Britain s biggest telecoms group to rebuild from an accounting scandal and multiple pressures on its business  Chief Executive Gavin Patterson said radical action was  absolutely critical  to ensure BT could deliver the next generation fiber and mobile networks Britain needed   We need to make ourselves more efficient  we need to create oxygen within the business   he told reporters on Thursday  Despite outlining measures to save 1 5 billion pounds   2 billion  a year by 2020 21  the initial market reaction was negative  A failure to hit a revenue target over the latest three months and a disappointing outlook for no profit growth for a couple of years sent BT shares down 9 percent to five year lows   Losing long standing fixed line voice revenue  many legacy telecom firms have expanded into more profitable areas   AT T  N T  in the U S  is trying to buy entertainment group  Time Warner   N TWX  while BT s own push into sports broadcasting was designed to defend its customer base   Since he took the top job in 2013  Patterson has spent billions of pounds on sports rights  network investment and customer service improvements  all while trying to keep regulators  pension fund trustees and investors on side  On top of that  fraud was discovered in Italy while the group was also blindsided by a downturn in corporate and public sector markets  undermining confidence in his leadership  Patterson  50  tried to placate shareholders by maintaining the dividend on Thursday    and pledging to keep it flat for the next two years    and he also agreed a new pension funding plan to plug its 11 3 billion pound deficit  Bernstein analysts called the update  disappointing    BT has now firmly gone from being a reasonably predictable growth story  an outlier in the incumbent landscape across Europe  to becoming a cost restructuring story   they said   Quite a remarkable shift in fortunes with an outlook that is well shy of our expectations   MOVING HOME Traders said guidance for the current financial year was lower than expected  while fourth quarter revenue fell short of targets  showing the challenges facing Patterson as he seeks to rebuild a group that employs more than 100 000 staff  BT  which owns Britain s biggest mobile operator EE  said it would hire about 6 000 new engineers and front line customer service staff to support its roll out of fiber and 5G networks  Around two thirds of jobs cuts will fall in Britain   The company has been based at the BT Centre  near St Paul s Cathedral and the London Stock Exchange in the City of London since it was privatized in 1984 but will now move to smaller premises in the capital   If we compare how we manage the business with our peers  we re frankly too complex and overweight  This is a big deal   said Patterson  The convergence of different technologies means BT has faced growing competition from nimble young rivals including Sky  L SKYB  which has expanded from being a pay TV company to offer a range of broadband services   UNDER PRESSURE One top 50 investor said there was no question Patterson was under pressure  but it was not clear how replacing the chief executive would change the dynamics   Any growth option they pursue is potentially going to have no return on it because the regulator just wants to regulate your returns away from you   the shareholder said   Pretty much the only thing you can do is to attack your cost base    Under Patterson s leadership  BT has had a fractious relationship with the regulator Ofcom  Patterson  who previously worked at consumer goods group P G and cable TV company Telewest  said the hit from regulation would double from about 500 million pounds to 1 billion pounds a year as new controls on its faster wholesale broadband kick in   My biggest concern is more that they need to clear the air with the regulator   the investor said  BT faces caps on how much it charges rivals to use its fast broadband service as Ofcom seeks to promote the development of new networks  THROW OF THE DICE The job cuts  the highest number by the former monopoly since 2008  will cost 800 million pounds to implement  Some of the proceeds from the savings will go towards increasing capital expenditure on new fiber fixed line connections and 4G and next generation 5G mobile networks to about 3 7 billion pounds over the next two years  The new strategy is the latest throw of the dice from Patterson who won early plaudits from investors when he moved BT into sports TV and mobile   That goodwill evaporated when the group delivered a major profit warning in January 2017 due to problems at its multi national Global Services division and the discovery of the Italian scandal  The shares are down 30 percent in a year   Patterson gained some breathing space on BT s pension  which had a deficit of 11 3 billion pounds at the end of June  on Thursday by agreeing a 13 year funding plan  It will pay 2 1 billion pounds into the scheme by 2020 and a further 2 billion pounds will be funded by bonds  
BT said its outlook for the current financial year  to end March  would see a 2 percent drop in underlying revenue  while adjusted core earnings would be in the range 7 3 billion 7 4 billion pounds  down from 7 5 billion pounds in the last year    1   0 7388 pounds ",2018-05-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bt-to-cut-13000-jobs-in-restructuring-plan-1440285,1440285

In a tweet and a report  Daniels  attorney  Michael Avenatti  said a U S  based company controlled by Viktor Vekselberg  a businessman with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin  sent Cohen the payment

Avenatti said Vekselberg and his cousin  Andrew Intrater  made eight transfers to Cohen between January and August 2017 through a U S  based company called Columbus Nova LLC for a total of  500 000 
A lawyer for Columbus Nova said Vekselberg had nothing to do with the transactions 
Columbus Nova was listed by Renova Group as one of its companies as of November 2017  according to an archived webpage for Renova  whose website now says it is under construction  Renova Group is a conglomerate controlled by Vekselberg 
The United States imposed sanctions last month on Vekselberg and Renova to retaliate for the Kremlin s suspected meddling in the 2016 U S  election and other  malign activity  
The New York Times reported last week that Vekselberg was questioned by U S  agents this year as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian interference and possible collusion by Trump s campaign 
Russia denies U S  intelligence agencies  accusations it meddled in the election  and Trump has denied any collusion  He also denies having had an affair with Daniels 
COMPANY HIRED COHEN
Vekselberg and Intrater could not be reached for comment  but Richard Owens  a lawyer for Columbus Nova  said in a statement the company hired Cohen after Trump s January 2017 inauguration  as a business consultant regarding sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures  
Owens said Columbus Nova was solely owned by Americans and that any claim that Vekselberg was involved in providing funding for the payments to Cohen was  patently untrue  
Avenatti also detailed payments he said were made to Cohen by U S  telecommunications company AT T  NYSE T   Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG and Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd   He said all the payments were made in late 2017 and early 2018 
 There are too many unknowns to reach conclusions as to whether anything involved with these transactions was illegal   said Michael Zeldin  a money laundering expert and former federal prosecutor who is now a legal analyst on CNN 
AT T confirmed the payments  saying they were aimed at gaining  insights  into the new administration  AT T has been pursuing an  85 billion takeover of  Time Warner  Inc  NYSE TWX   which the U S  Justice Department is trying to stop 
Avenatti also said he discovered four payments of just under  100 000 each by Novartis to Essential Consultants  the same company used by Cohen to make payments to Daniels 
A Novartis representative said   Any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have expired  
AT T said Essential Consultants was one of several firms it  engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration  but that it received no legal or lobbying services from Cohen s firm 
AT T said the contract ended in December 2017 
A spokesman for Korea Aerospace Industries said the company had signed a contract with Essential Consultants last year for legal consulting concerning accounting standards on production costs  and upon the expiration of the contract  made a payment in November

220747,442263,T,Nafta Trio Meets as Telecom Said to Be Latest Issue Resolved,news," Bloomberg     Nafta negotiators are said to have wrapped up another chapter of the deal as the three ministers leading talks meet again in Washington amid a push for a deal in principle within weeks 
U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer met Canada s Chrystia Freeland and Mexico s Ildefonso Guajardo in sessions Thursday in Washington  The sessions  which could continue Friday  come amid the latest technical talks    what Freeland called an  intensive phase     after the ministers  last session on April 6 
They meet as negotiators are said to have finished work on the telecommunications chapter  according to two people familiar with the discussions  who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions are private  The telecom chapter is the seventh completed out of about 30 under consideration for a final deal 
Freeland  speaking to reporters in Washington on Thursday  said Nafta talks are in period of  intensified engagement  and that so called rules of origin for the automotive sector will be among the things discussed in her meetings 
 We are very committed to getting a deal  to getting a modernized Nafta   she said   We also think we need to take the time it takes to get a good deal  to get details right on complicated issues like rules of origin  So we ll see how today s talks go

Nonetheless  a few key disputes    such as autos  agriculture and investor state dispute panels    will determine whether a deal is possible  said Flavio Volpe  head of an industry group representing Canadian auto parts makers 
 On balance  we may be close enough on all of them to get a deal done   he said in an interview 
The countries haven t publicly confirmed an agreement on the telecom chapter  A request for comment from USTR wasn t immediately returned  Alex Lawrence  a spokesman for Freeland  declined to comment  The U S  had sought assurances to promote competition in Mexico s telecom industry  where companies including AT T Inc  NYSE T   have been investing and Carlos Slim s carrier America Movil SAB is the top mobile phone player 
Talks have shifted gears to what Guajardo called a permanent round of negotiations as the Trump administration eyes a stopgap deal  U S  Vice President Mike Pence and Guajardo have both said a deal could be reached in the coming weeks  though there are signs that there could be a deal that leaves the fine print to further talks between bureaucrats 
Big gaps remain and the Thursday meeting is unlikely to be a final step  The ministers  meeting will be closely watched for signs of breakthroughs on some of the key divides  such as the auto sector  But no statement or announcement is expected at this time  said a U S  administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
The ministers are scheduled to hold a series of bilateral and trilateral talks Thursday and Friday  Mexico Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray is also said to be planning to come to Washington to try to break a Nafta impasse

220764,442280,T,Special Report  Private equity star s picks shine  until cash out time,news,"By Lawrence Delevingne and John Tilak NEW YORK TORONTO  Reuters    Canadian financier Newton Glassman has long told his private equity firm s clients that his big bet on casinos would yield a financial jackpot  Others haven t been so sure  At the end of 2011  a year after Glassman s Catalyst Capital Group Inc took control of Gateway Casinos   Entertainment Ltd  Catalyst told investors in a report seen by Reuters that it already had more than doubled their money and that its majority stake was worth US 475 million   for an implied equity value of the gaming company as a whole of US 699 million  But Catalyst was forced to abandon a planned initial public offering of Gateway in 2012 after investors balked at the firm s valuation  according to two people familiar with the effort  In the ensuing years  Catalyst s implied valuation of Gateway continued to climb  to more than US 1 billion as of Sept  30  2017  according to investor communications  all while Glassman repeatedly told clients to expect a sale that never happened  Now  under increasing pressure to liquidate a past due private equity fund  Glassman is again attempting a Gateway IPO at a valuation of as high as US 1 95 billion  according to a Feb  28 Bloomberg report  Under Catalyst s direction  British Columbia based Gateway has expanded its operations and just restructured its debt  Even so  Catalyst s assessment of the impact of those moves on the company are more optimistic than those of ratings agencies Moody s and Standard   Poor s  both of which still rate Gateway debt as  junk   Michael Lewitt  chief investment officer at hedge fund firm Third Friday Management in Boca Raton  Florida  reviewed Catalyst s valuation of Gateway and called it  extremely aggressive   High valuations and delayed sales apply to more than just Gateway  Reuters has found  with potentially worrying implications for Catalyst s four currently active funds and their big money investors  Catalyst follows a  loan to own  strategy  acquiring the discounted debt of troubled companies  mostly in Canada and the United States  taking over the business in the case of a default or by other means  and then selling at a profit after improving operations  Early success using that strategy with Catalyst s first fund established Glassman s reputation as a savvy investor  It also has helped Catalyst attract enough investors to make it Canada s third largest private equity firm  with about C 6 billion  US 4 6 billion  in assets under management  according to data tracker Preqin  Since Catalyst launched its second fund in 2006  however  the firm s record of double digit annual returns has been based largely on its own assessments of improvements to its stable of distressed companies  When put to the test  at least four of Catalyst s major assets have been unable to find buyers at the firm s valuations  based on a Reuters review of Catalyst s portfolio  multiple communications from Catalyst to its clients and regulatory filings  as well as interviews with people familiar with Catalyst s operations  academics and financial analysts  Those major assets  plus expected payouts from pending litigation  made up US 3 3 billion   or more than two thirds   of the overall US 4 7 billion of unrealized value across all Catalyst funds at the end of 2016  according to an April 5  2017  report for clients  The assets include Gateway and  Callidus Capital Corp   TO CBL   Catalyst s publicly listed subsidiary that specializes in high interest loans to distressed companies and that is itself a major holding of Catalyst funds  Failure to cash out can put additional pressure on Catalyst as funds approach the end of their lifespan  typically eight or 10 years  by which time all money   principal and profits   is expected to be returned to investors  Catalyst Fund Limited Partnership II  for example  was supposed to mature in April 2014 after starting to invest in 2006  But Catalyst has extended the deadline at least three times  The contrast between the picture Catalyst paints of its fund assets in communications with clients and how those assets perform when a sale is attempted shows that investors may not be able to count on the returns they expect  For now  though  any harm to Catalyst s big investors is potential  rather than actual  Glassman could still repeat his early success with his current funds by managing to sell a handful of major assets at big gains  Glassman did not respond to repeated requests for comment  Catalyst and Callidus did not respond directly to requests for comment  In a letter to Reuters  David Moore  a lawyer for the two companies  disputed that Catalyst overvalues assets or has had trouble selling them  Reuters  reporting  he said  is  based upon false and unreliable allegations   In keeping with the industry norm  Moore said  Catalyst s proposed valuations were reviewed by outside accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  They were then separately reviewed by KPMG LLP  Catalyst s independent auditor  which had issued unqualified audit opinions on Catalyst every year  Moore noted  KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment  Moore stressed that Catalyst management s pay is derived from proceeds from asset sales and that  valuations do not in any way affect Catalyst s compensation   He also pointed out that Catalyst had sold 23 assets in its history  13 of them  in accord with applicable valuations   He did not provide specifics on those sales  However  of the 17 completed sales showcased on Catalyst s website  most were  substantially realized  in 2010 or earlier  often for US 50 million or less  according to a Reuters review of information Catalyst sent to clients  Nine of the sales were for the firm s small first fund  which was largely wound down several years ago  Catalyst investors   generally locked in for the duration of a fund s lifespan   include endowments for the University of Michigan  McGill University and the University of Toronto  public employee pension funds in Montana and New Jersey  and major philanthropies such as the Rockefeller Foundation  They did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment on the record  citing confidentiality agreements  Some said on condition of anonymity that they feared getting on the wrong side of Glassman  who has launched dozens of lawsuits in his career  most with Catalyst or Callidus as plaintiff  While in college  he successfully sued his father to force child support payments  according to Ontario court records  Gateway and some other major Catalyst fund holdings examined for this article are among the assets alleged to have been overvalued in two whistleblower complaints submitted in the past 18 months to the Ontario Securities Commission  OSC   according to documents seen by Reuters and people familiar with the submissions  CARS AND PHARMACEUTICALS Private equity holdings can be difficult to value because they often lack ready markets to test their worth  Even when reviewed by third parties  a fund manager s valuations are nonetheless open to interpretation  Private equity experts said that  in general  a pattern of delayed sales can indicate valuations that are too high  Lewitt  the hedge fund manager  said of Gateway and other assets examined in this article   I wouldn t invest a penny with any manager that employs these types of valuations   Advantage Rent A Car is a case in point  Catalyst started investing in the Orlando  Florida  company with a US 22 2 million bet in 2013  and its total investment stood at US 310 5 million as of Sept  30  2017  according to client reports  As Catalyst s exposure to Advantage through Funds III and IV has risen  so has its valuation of the company   even as larger rental car businesses have come under pressure from increased competition and the rise of ride sharing outfits like Uber  Catalyst has long promised dramatic improvements at Advantage that would lead to a successful sale  In a 2014 letter to investors  it projected that within two or three years  earnings would top US 100 million  But for 2015  Advantage had a loss of US 31 million  according to an April 2017 presentation to Catalyst clients  A more recent investor letter put projected 2018 earnings at about US 20 million  Advantage has less than 1 percent of the U S  market and was expected to generate revenue of US 327 7 million in 2017  according to market research firm IBISWorld  That puts Catalyst s valuation of US 542 9 million as of Sept  30  contained in a recent letter to investors  at a whopping 1 7 times revenue  Hertz Global Holdings Inc and Avis Budget Group Inc  the two biggest publicly traded car rental operators in the United States  trade at less than half their 2017 revenue of US 8 8 billion each  Advantage did not respond to requests for comment  Another major Catalyst asset is Therapure Biopharma Inc  Glassman s firm started investing in the Mississauga  Ontario  biotechnology company in 2006  and the commitment totaled US 82 million by the end of 2011  That year  Catalyst valued Therapure at US 202 million  In early 2016  it tried to take Therapure public at a valuation of C 867 million  according to a Reuters analysis of the offering documents  The same documents show that Therapure had operating losses in 2012  2013 and 2014  The effort failed in part because Catalyst s valuation was too high for most investors and in part because of difficult market conditions  according to two people with direct knowledge of the IPO process  In September 2017  Catalyst announced it had agreed to sell Therapure s contract manufacturing business for US 290 million  which would result in a proportional payout for Fund II investors  That sale price   the deal has yet to close   is less than half the US 662 million at which Catalyst valued Therapure at year end 2016  according to a Catalyst document provided to clients in April 2017  Therapure s remaining business   plasma based drug development and protein therapeutics products   probably isn t worth more than US 100 million  according to two sources with direct knowledge of the company  The unsold business is not generating profits  one of the sources said  Therapure did not respond to requests for comment  Since Gateway Casinos  IPO flopped in 2012  Catalyst has continually raised the valuation of its controlling stake   to levels that yield an imputed value for the gaming company as a whole of as much as US 1 95 billion  according to the Feb  28 Bloomberg article  That article  attributed to anonymous sources  appeared as Reuters was seeking comment from Catalyst on the firm s valuations of Gateway and other assets  Reuters could not independently verify that an IPO was imminent or determine the calculus underlying the US 1 95 billion valuation  Gateway operates about two dozen casinos  concentrated in western Canada and  more recently  Ontario  the country s most populous province  It plans to invest more than C 300 million by 2020 to improve existing properties and build new ones  according to a February 2018 Gateway investor presentation  In mid March  Gateway completed a sale leaseback of some properties  yielding net proceeds to Catalyst of C 483 million  Catalyst said the transaction and a parallel debt refinancing would reduce Gateway s debt from C 953 million to C 702 million   or 4 5 times earnings  according to a recent investor presentation  That s in line with the typical debt to earnings ratio of between 4 and 5 for middle market companies  based on Thomson Reuters LPC institutional loan data  However  it s more optimistic than Moody s assessment  The ratings agency estimated in early March that under the new financial plan  Gateway s debt to earnings ratio wouldn t drop below 5 for 12 to 18 months  And Standard   Poor s said the number would climb to as high as 7 5 through 2018  Both ratings agencies still judge Gateway bonds to be non investment grade  junk   By comparison  rival Great Canadian Gaming Corp had a debt to earnings ratio of 2 as of Dec  31  according to a financial filing  Moody s also projects lower profits than Catalyst for Gateway  It did not elaborate on the full assumptions behind its numbers  A spokeswoman said the ratings agency s calculations  reflect our conservative view of the earnings potential of the company s assets   Standard   Poor s and Gateway did not respond to requests for comment  Moore  the Catalyst lawyer  said in a letter to Reuters that the firm s work to improve Gateway had been  highly successful   EARLY SUCCESS Now in his mid 50s  Glassman established Catalyst in 2002  after sharpening his skills at Cerberus Capital Management LP  the New York based distressed investment powerhouse  Catalyst s first fund started investing in 2003  Within several years  it had scored big wins through private sales of its positions in companies like Cable Satisfaction International Inc  AT T  NYSE T  Canada Inc  later known as Allstream  and Royal Group Technologies Ltd  The US 185 million fund  tiny by private equity standards  ended up producing an average annual return of 32 percent over its lifespan  according to client reports  That s far better than a benchmark return of about 17 percent for funds of the same 2003 vintage tracked by investment consultants Cambridge Associates  Catalyst s early triumph helped drive billions of dollars to the firm over four additional funds raised between 2006 and 2015  Glassman has yet to successfully wind up any of those newer funds and return all money to investors  though the most recent one  Fund V  has returned hundreds of millions of dollars since 2015  It is not unusual for private equity firms to hold investments until near the end of a fund s lifespan  However  data from Cambridge and Preqin show that three of Catalyst s four active funds lag behind similarly aged funds in paying proceeds from asset sales to investors  With Fund II already past due  Funds III and IV are to mature in December 2019 and June 2022  respectively  Most of the value of these funds   about US 1 42 billion for Fund III and US 1 36 billion for Fund IV   is unrealized  according to an April 2017 client report  That s more than 60 percent of the total value of each  Some of that unrealized value would come from payouts from litigation whose outcome remains uncertain  Catalyst filed two lawsuits against longtime rival and frequent adversary West Face Capital Inc and others after it lost a bidding process to buy Canadian wireless carrier Wind Mobile from VimpelCom  NASDAQ VEON  Ltd in 2014  Catalyst claimed that it had an exclusive agreement with VimpelCom to buy Wind Mobile and that West Face and others engaged in improper conduct to win the deal and ultimately sell at a big profit  Judge Frank Newbould  originally hearing both cases in Ontario Superior Court  dismissed one of them  concluding that West Face and others  contrary to Catalyst s allegations  had not used confidential information from a former Catalyst employee to make its winning bid  In his August 2016 ruling  Newbould wrote that he had  difficulty accepting as reliable much of the evidence  submitted by Glassman  He described the financier as  aggressive    argumentative  and more of a  salesman than an objective witness   Catalyst appealed Newbould s dismissal  That appeal was dismissed Feb  21  The second Wind related lawsuit  seeking C 1 3 billion in damages  was on hold  pending the outcome of Catalyst s appeal of Newbould s dismissal of the other case  In a report to clients  Catalyst told investors that its remaining Wind related claim was worth US 446 9 million at the end of 2016 and that the firm has  a reasonable likelihood of success at trial   Newbould  who has retired from the bench and now works as an arbitrator  was targeted by an undercover agent last autumn in a sting orchestrated by Israeli investigative firm Black Cube on behalf of Catalyst  according to West Face court submissions in separate litigation  The sting  West Face alleges  was designed to discredit Newbould and his dismissal of one of the Wind related lawsuits  Newbould declined to comment  Black Cube gained attention last year for its work on behalf of Harvey Weinstein to undermine women and journalists in their efforts to go public with allegations of sexual harassment and assault against the Hollywood mogul  A spokesman for Black Cube declined to comment on questions related to Catalyst and Callidus  He said Black Cube always operates ethically and legally  In an April 2017 presentation to investors  Catalyst told clients of Fund III that without the expected litigation payouts  net annual returns as of end 2016 would fall to 8 9 percent from 11 7 percent  Ludovic Phalippou  a private equity expert at the University of Oxford in England  said Catalyst s expected return on the Wind litigation was  extraordinarily  high  given that one of the cases was dismissed and that money that would have been used to buy the Wind assets were presumably deployed elsewhere  RELATED PARTIES One company Catalyst succeeded in selling on the stock market is Callidus  a distressed lending business Glassman invested in  took over  and made a core holding  Glassman s team took Callidus public in April 2014  raising C 252 million while still keeping big positions in the company for its four current funds  Catalyst funds provide guarantees for some of Callidus s risky loans to distressed businesses  But those guarantees mean that investors in Catalyst funds can end up saddled with Callidus investments gone bad  such as Xchange Technology Group  an information technology company that went bankrupt  The relationship between Catalyst and Callidus doesn t end there  In May 2017  Callidus said in its first quarter earnings report that a recent acquisition  struggling Canadian slot machine maker Bluberi Gaming Technologies Inc  was worth about C 110 million  In footnotes  it said that figure was based largely on an agreement for Bluberi to supply 7 000 slot machines to a  commonly controlled enterprise   Callidus did not identify that enterprise  But it appears to be Gateway Casinos  which fits the description in a recent Callidus earnings report of a  large diversified gaming company in Canada that is controlled in common with     Catalyst   Catalyst did not respond to requests for comment  Such an order is large for Bluberi  a small company that recently emerged from bankruptcy  Bluberi has about 1 000 machines in use today  according to a third quarter 2017 ranking by industry consultants Eilers   Krejcik Gaming LLC  The top three companies have nearly 40 000 each  Gateway operates 9 500 slot machines  according to its website  Stephen Casey  a lawyer and accountant in New York with private equity experience  reviewed Callidus s Bluberi holding for Reuters and called it  a very aggressive valuation based on a related party order and some pretty speculative assumptions   The risks  Casey said  include whether Bluberi s casino clients can get the required regulatory approvals for expansion  and whether Bluberi is able to produce all the machines required  Callidus acknowledged both of those risks in earnings reports last year  Bluberi did not respond to requests for comment  Callidus s Bluberi valuation  now at C 113 million  is based on a potential sale using an accounting method the company calls  yield enhancement   which is not recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards  IFRS   In a May shareholder report  Callidus said it would give greater prominence to calculations based on IFRS in its public disclosures in response to an Ontario Securities Commission review of its financial reporting  The OSC declined to comment  Catalyst has said it would like to find a buyer to take Callidus private again  suggesting in a press release last year a price of C 18 to C 22 a share  The stock now trades around C 7  down more than 60 percent over the past 12 months  Callidus said in October 2016 that it had hired Goldman  Sachs   Co to handle a sale process that would be completed by June 2017  Goldman declined to comment  No buyer has yet emerged

States and North Korea will meet for talks next month came on top of hopes that President Donald Trump s political allies would convince him to avoid a global trade war   The broadest gauge of global stocks  MSCI s All Country World Index  was up more than 0 6 percent for a second day and Wall Street looked set for its third rise running as the rebound gathered momentum    N   EU   T  It gained pace as North Korea said it was willing to talk to Washington about denuclearization and would suspend its long running nuclear tests while those talks were under way   It looks like  risk on  sentiment is coming back   said Saxo Bank s head of FX strategy John Hardy  also pointing to weaker safe havens like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc  Europe s mood was also supported after Germany reformed its coalition government to end more than five months in political limbo and as the initial unease caused by a hefty election vote for anti establishment parties in Italy ebbed  Italian bonds

to 2 89 percent ahead of U S  trading and euro zone yields followed suit with German Bunds off a five week low at 0 69 percent   The ECB is going to be presenting growth forecasts that are likely to be stronger  but will be at pains to stress that the move away from monetary easing will be delicately done   said Peter Chatwell  head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho  The euro traded back above  1

with enough seats to govern alone  the country s President  Sergio Mattarella  is expected to open formal coalition talks in April  Early elections are possible if no coalition accord is found  The dollar s swoon helped the Canadian dollar off an eight month low C 1 2995 it had hit on Monday as the latest round of NAFTA renegotiations fanned the trade nerves   Canada is most exposed U S  tariff threats but its central bank holds a rate meeting on Wednesday and if it keeps the door open to further hikes  the currency  is likely to be able to resist further notable depreciation   Commerzbank

220811,442327,T,Mexico telecoms regulator says all can participate in spectrum auction,news,"By Julia Love
MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Mexico s telecommunications regulator  IFT  said on Thursday that any operator could participate in a spectrum auction this year  opening the door for billionaire Carlos Slim s America Movil to bid 
This year  the regulator will auction 120 MHz of radioelectric spectrum in the 2500 2690 MHz frequency band that can be used for wireless services  the IFT said in a statement 
 In reality nobody  no operator is restricted a priori from participating  but effectively we have determined spectrum caps   Alejandro Navarrete  the head of spectrum at the IFT  said on local radio  He said the caps would be determined by the amount of spectrum the operators already have 
The auction has drawn strong interest from operators because it is well suited for broadband  5g mobile networks and the so called Internet of Things  said Federico Hernandez Arroyo  a partner who specializes in telecommunications at law firm Hogan Lovells 
 It is considered as the band for the following generation   he said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday 
Slim s America Movil  which has long dominated Mexico s telecommunications market  acquired a slice of the desirable spectrum last year  purchasing the rights to 60 MHz of the band from Grupo MVS 
As the IFT prepared to auction off the rest of the spectrum  competitors called for strict limits to be placed on America Movil s participation  Arroyo said

220813,442329,T,U S  seeks to block AT T from citing Trump opposition in merger lawsuit,news,"By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Department of Justice on Friday moved to prevent AT T Inc  N T  from arguing that politics played a role in the government s decision to stop its merger with Time Warner Inc  N T   a deal that President Donald Trump had publicly criticized   There was no selective enforcement   Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said at a pre trial hearing   The president is unhappy with CNN  We don t dispute that  But AT T wants to turn that into a get out jail free card for their illegal merger   AT T and Time Warner s lawyer Daniel Petrocelli  however  cited Trump s repeated criticism of the deal as reason to allow the company to argue that the government opposed the deal for political reasons  It is seeking records of communications between the White House and Justice Department that describe Trump s views on the merger  AT T wants the judge to review any communications found to see if they bolster their contention that the transaction was singled out because of Trump s anger with CNN  The documents were requested as preparation for a March 19 trial in which Judge Richard Leon will decide if the  85 billion deal would raise prices  The Justice Department sued to stop the deal on the grounds that it is illegal under antitrust law  The government has asked Judge Leon to rule that AT T may not cite politics  formally known as selective enforcement  as a defense and to quash a request for documents to support that defense  AT T s Petrocelli defended the request   If there is something in those documents  it s important for us   he said at the hearing at the U S  District Court for the District of Columbia  Leon said he would rule on Tuesday  The deal has been followed more closely than most antitrust matters because Trump attacked it while on the campaign trail in 2016  Trump has also repeatedly criticized Time Warner s CNN news network and  in November  he reiterated his opposition to the proposed transaction   Conrath said the government s lawsuit was not motivated by Trump s irritation with CNN and said it had offered several settlement options that would have allowed AT T to acquire CNN  As recently as November  Trump stood by his criticism of the proposed transaction    Personally I ve always felt that that was a deal that s not a good deal for the country   the president said   I think your pricing s going to go up  I don t think it s a good deal for the country   Conrath warned that if the Justice Department were forced to conduct a much broader search for additional documents it could delay the trial until July  Leon also said he did not want the case to get  sidetracked    We have no intention of losing this schedule   Petrocelli said  Petrocelli said Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes had laid out in extensive detail the company s belief that Trump s improper influence was a factor in a deposition Thursday  AT T had taken the unusual step of including the assistant attorney general for antitrust  Makan Delrahim  on its witness list as it looks to find evidence to support its position that the government was bringing a case because of Trump s anger  Conrath offered an affidavit from Delrahim in which he said he had not been instructed or ordered by anyone at the White House or at the Justice Department to bring the lawsuit  Merger cases  however  are judged illegal or legal depending on whether prices go up or innovation is lost because of the deal  
Petrocelli derided the government s case as  weak   saying that their economists had determined the price of AT T s DirecTV could go down and that there could be a small increase to non DirecTV consumers  Conrath sharply disagreed  saying the deal would cause  hundreds of millions of dollars of damage  ",2018-02-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-seeks-to-block-att-from-citing-trump-statements-in-arguments-1263492,1263492

highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Telecom Stock Outlook  T  FTR  TEF   MoreIn the past five trading days  telecom stocks mostly traded flat with a downward inclination owing to the continued market uncertainty triggered by a prolonged partial shutdown of the government  The downtrend was further caused by a draft executive order initiated by the Trump administration to restrain Chinese state owned telecom firms from operating in the United States on national security concerns  The United States is reportedly mulling to seek extradition of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou from Canada before the Jan 30 deadline  to proceed with the legal charges  This probably added to the sector woes in the past week On the domestic front  the Trump administration is reeling under partial shutdown by various federal agencies for an all time record of 33 days and counting  In addition to crippling the normal functioning of the government with furloughs and pay freeze  the impasse has led to unavailability of adequate funds for the speedy deployment of 5G technologies  The shutdown has even hampered FCC s equipment authorization process  compounding industry fears that the deadlock could jeopardize the country s edge in the upcoming 5G boom To make matters worse  the government is supposedly preparing an executive order that could give sweeping powers to the Commerce Department to review imported products by domestic firms and ban the outright sale of such equipment on grounds of national security interests  Industry observers feel that it could ultimately serve as a death bell to some Chinese telecom firms and make it virtually impossible for them to operate in the U S  shores if the bill is passed by the President Despite the conundrums  both the United States and China have continued with their trade negotiations to seek a long term solution to the trade war  The bilateral trade talks between U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu is also scheduled later this month  However  the diplomatic ties continue to be under severe stress as reports emerge that the United States is considering to formally request the extradition of Meng from Canada to pursue a criminal case against her for alleged trade secret theft  Some industry experts believe that the strategic move could be a ploy by the Trump administration to seek a hard bargain from China  Although the warring countries have maintained that the issue would not deter the trade talks  there is no denying of the fact that tense undercurrents have prevailed over both sides Regarding company specific news  strategic corporate actions  divestments  product launches and technology collaborations took the center stage over the past five trading days Recap of the Week

220829,442345,T,AT T  T  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects AT T  T  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This telecommunications company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9  
Revenues are expected to be  48 43 billion  up 16 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 09  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AT T 
For AT T  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 39  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that AT T will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that AT T would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 90  delivering a surprise of  3 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
AT T appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/att-t-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200378412,200378412

220943,442459,T,AT T CEO hints that Trump s CNN antipathy could be behind DOJ lawsuit,news,"AT T  NYSE T  s CEO Randall Stephenson blasted the US Department of Justice over an impending lawsuit 
The department is fighting to block a merger between AT T and Time Warner 
Stephenson said the company will not sell off CNN to satisfy the department 

 AT T s CEO blasted the US Department of Justice following news that the agency will sue to block the company s  84 5 billion takeover of Time Warner 
In a press conference in New York on Monday  Randall Stephenson said he was  surprised to be here   and that the lawsuit was  unprecedented  and  defies logic  
He also balked at the proposal reportedly floated by DOJ antitrust officials that the company should sell Turner Broadcasting  the group of channels that includes CNN  to receive approval for the deal

220971,442487,T,Mexico bristles at U S  proposal that would benefit AT T in NAFTA,news,"By Julia Love and David Lawder
MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Mexico shot down a proposal by the United States to include provisions in the North America Free Trade Agreement that would benefit AT T Inc  N T   Mexico s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Wednesday 
 AT T  which is North American  asked its government to reflect its interests in the negotiation   Guajardo said in an interview on local radio without specifying the details of the U S  proposal   You cannot have an agreement    that gives a tailor s cut  a perfect handiwork  to a specific company  
AT T and the U S  Trade Representative s office declined to comment 
During the last round of talks in Virginia  the United States proposed incorporating Mexico s landmark telecommunications reform into a NAFTA provision that would apply only to Mexico  four sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters 
Mexico s 2013 14 telecommunications reform aimed to break up the dominance of America Movil  MX AMXL   the telecommunications firm owned by billionaire Carlos Slim  which emerged from a state monopoly in the 1990s 
Negotiators are still working to make sure the reform is included in the agreement  Guajardo said 
 What we said is that we cannot accept a specific annex   he said   We can reflect conceptually the commitments that are reflected in the law  which for us is very important to consolidate  
Beckoned by the reform  AT T entered the Mexican market in 2014  spending  4 4 billion to buy Mexico s No 3 and No 4 carriers 
But the market was plunged into uncertainty in August when the Mexico Supreme Court ruled America Movil should not be barred by law from charging its rivals for calls to its network  weakening a key pillar of the reform 
The turmoil has spilled over into NAFTA negotiations  Guajardo said 
 What has kept us from closing  he telecoms chapter is that it was contaminated a little bit by this debate over the zero rate   he said 
The telecommunications reform  which sharply lowered prices for consumers  is one of Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto s signature accomplishments  But throughout the negotiations  Mexico has consistently rejected proposals that isolate the nation  trade experts say 
 What s surprising  about the telecommunications proposal  is that there is the principle that we are negotiating as three countries   said Mexico Senator Gerardo Flores  who was briefed on the proposal 
 And suddenly the United States puts on the table a proposal that demands commitments specifically from Mexico  which converts the negotiation into a bilateral negotiation  
Mexico has been enthusiastic about enshrining a 2014 energy reform in NAFTA  but also with the condition that the language applies to all three countries in the pact  said Duncan Wood  director of the Wilson Center s Mexico Institute 

 Mexico doesn t want to be singled out in any way   he said   You set a precedent where side deals with individual countries can be made  ",2017-11-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mexico-bristles-at-us-proposal-that-would-benefit-att-in-nafta-868793,868793
220974,442490,T,Earn  40K In Dividends On  500K  My 8 Step Plan To 8  Yields,opinion,"Even with the 10 year Treasury  rallying  of late  it still pays just 2 9   Put a million bucks in T Bills  and you re banking  29 000 per year  Barely above poverty levels 
Hence the appeal of closed end funds  CEFs   which often pay 8  or better  That s the difference between a paltry minimum wage income of  29 000 on a million saved or a respectable  80 000 annually 
And if you re smart about your CEF purchases  you can even buy them at discounts and snare some price upside to boot 
Here s why  CEFs  unlike their ETF and mutual fund cousins  have fixed pools of shares  Meanwhile their prices trade up and down like stocks   which means these funds can sometimes trade at a discount to the value of their underlying assets 
And even though stocks at large are expensive today  this rising rate  ironically  environment has income seekers scared of CEFs  Many of my readers have actually asked me if they should bail on our high paying vehicles  The financial media is in their heads  and they re concerned that their funds are suddenly going to drop in price 
Please  don t toss yourself into poverty by following this misguided herd 
With the markets in flux  we should review the principles of successful CEF investing  They are more nuanced than classic stock picking  because we re analyzing managers  strategies and holdings versus simple businesses models  After all  for lazy investors  it s easier to count on dividends via AT T Inc  NYSE T  declining subscriptions than it is to determine how much income for payouts Cohen and Steers Infrastructure Closed Fund  NYSE UTF  has 
 The answer  Plenty  UTF not only pays 8  today  but the fund has raised its payout four of the last five years  
Step  1  Be Careful With Price Charts
Pimco Dyn I  NYSE PDI  has been a great performer since its inception almost five years ago   but it s price chart understates its brilliance 
Looks Like Pedestrian 33  Gains 
  Until You Add the Payouts Back for  192  
Make sure the chart you re reading includes dividends paid  so that it reflects total returns  
Step  2  Demand Alpha
Past performance can be an educational indicator about the quality of the management team and its strategy  PDI has had the benefit of the brightest bond minds on the planet calling the shots  from  Bond King  Bill Gross to current superstar Dan Ivascyn  and it delivered 192  total returns over the last six years  with most of these coming in the form of cash payouts 
Meanwhile Alpine Global Dynamic Dividend Closed Fund  NYSE AGD  has delivered the worst of all worlds to dividend investors  It crashed harder than the broader markets in 2008  then provided almost no rebound as stocks themselves bounced back 
Dynamic dividends  Not here   this dog is still down 18  over the last eleven years 
More Downside  None of the Upside
Don t be fooled by the siren song of its fat 7 6  current yield  Which brings me to our next point 
Step  3  Check Every Yield s Back Story
Some funds pay big distributions that look great   but they re not sustainable  However they continue to attract new  sucker  investors because they are able to fund their payouts   they just happen to shed their net asset value  NAV  at a similar pace 
For example  here are three more dogs that have grinded sideways or worse over the last three years  even when accounting for dividends paid  as the S P 500 has soared 
Big Yields  But Lackluster Returns
Step  4  Know What s Funding Your Distributions
A closed end fund can pay you from some combination of 
Investment income 
Capital gains  and or
Return of capital 
Of the three  investment income is preferable because it s usually the most reliable  Many CEFs pay monthly distributions  so it s best if they match up their payouts with steady income streams themselves 
Capital gains from rising bond or stock prices can further boost distributions  But they are at risk of disappearing if the markets turn unfavorably 
Finally  everyone assumes return of capital is bad  because it s simply shipping your money back to you  But as my colleague  the  CEF professor  Michael Foster  recently wrote  it s often very good for investors 
What s more  if the fund trades at a sizeable discount  this can actually be a savvy way to kick start the closing of a discount window  More on this shortly 
Step  5  Don t Be Cheap About Fees
Most investors are conditioned by their experience with mutual funds and ETFs to search out the lowest fees  almost to a fault  This makes sense for investment vehicles that are roughly going to perform in line with the broader market  Lowering your costs minimizes drag 
Closed ends are a different investment animal  though  On the whole  there are many more dogs than gems  It s an absolute necessity to find a great manager with a solid track record  Great managers tend to be expensive  of course   but they re well worth it 
The stated yields you see quoted  by the way  are always net of fees  Your account will never be debited for the fees from any fund you own  They are simply paid by the fund itself from its NAV 
Step  6  Ignore Short Term Interest Rates
Many funds are selling at bargain prices today thanks to the headline worry that higher rates hurt CEFs  But that s just not true 
Libor is tied closely to the Fed funds rate  And the last time the Fed hiked its rate significantly  CEFs did just fine 
In June 2004  Fed chair Alan Greenspan began boosting rates from then historic lows  Over a two year period  he increased the federal funds rate from 1  to 5 25   An earthquake 
How d CEFs perform  Three prominent funds all outperformed the market during Greenspan s aforementioned run 
Higher Rates No Problem for Top CEFs 2004 06
Regular readers will recognize the Greenspan example quite well  because I ve been using it repeatedly to drive this point home  And I m glad to share another data point   our own profits from this rate hike cycle 
The chart below illustrates three of my CEF recommendations rolling higher in lockstep with the Fed funds rate  and that rate is the orange line stair stepping from the lower left to the upper right  
This Rate Hike Cycle  Our CEFs Have Rolled Higher
Once again  the best CEFs are gaining value in the face of rate rises 
Step  7  Demand a Discount
One aspect of the CEF structure lends itself perfectly to contrary minded investing  fixed pools of shares 
Mutual funds issue more shares whenever they want  But closed ends have a fixed share count  with their funds trading like stocks  As a result  from time to time a fund will fall out of favor and find its shares trading at a discount to its NAV 
This is basically  free money  because these underlying assets are constantly marked to market  If a fund trades at a 10  discount  management could theoretically liquidate the fund and cash out everyone at  1 10 on the dollar immediately  Or it can buy back its own shares to close the discount window  and boost the share price

220975,442491,T,AT T  Constant High Dividend And Potential Growth,opinion,"One of my favourite dividends paying stock which also turns out to be undervalued at the moment is AT T  NYSE T  
AT T is the world s largest telecommunications company  the second largest provider of mobile telephone services and the largest provider of fixed telephone services in the U S  The company evolved from the Bell Telephone Company which was founded by Alexander Graham Bell  the inventor of the first practical telephone 
In July the firm completed the acquisition of Time Warner thereby bringing together global media and entertainment leadership with AT Ts strength in technology  Although the acquisition was approved by the court  government attorneys have appealed against this on the basis that such agreement would harm competition and consumers  The federal judge has already rejected the first appeal and I don t think the decision can be reversed now 
The combined firms posted nearly  192 billion in sales last year  and are worth roughly  282 billion on the stock market  That would have made it the seventh biggest American company by revenue last year  and it will have the thirteenth biggest market valuation   see bar chart below  

Let s have a look at some fundamental numbers now Dividend  6 PE ratio of 6x lower than industry peers of 15xPositive free cash flow and on the riseRevenues on the risePositive net incomeIf we look at the price  this has been hovering at the area of  31  35 region for a number of years  with the exception being 2016 when it reached a high of  43 which retraced back over time  
What this tells us here is that the stock can be considered quite a  boring  investment with prices finding a strong support for years now and thus we don t expect a huge level of volatility 
Should the price remain in the same area  we expect a very good return with dividends level of 6   which most probably would rise once cash injection from the TimeWarner deal start working out 
The stock is also in my opinion undervalued and hence it provides a further opportunity for a total return  growth   dividend  investment in a well established firm that continues to generate good revenues and profits

220987,442503,T,Why Splunk Went On A Shopping Spree In The Last Year,opinion,"The software company has made several important acquisitions to solidify its upward trajectory 
Big data software provider Splunk Inc  NASDAQ SPLK  has made five acquisitions since the beginning of 2017  Mega mergers and acquisitions get a lot of attention these days  but many of them are made by a struggling company trying to shore up its operations or buy its way to growth  for example  AT T  NYSE T  s pickup of Time Warner  
Splunk s strategy is different  It s all about acquiring other fast growing companies like itself that complement its strategy 
New partners  complementary markets
As the number of electronic devices continues to increase by the billions every year  the amount of data floating around out there increases even more  For many enterprises  the data its machines  systems  and websites generate is unorganized and unusable  Splunk s cloud based software changes that  organizing it into a format that s usable and providing insight into what s happening  That capability is a much needed one in the business world  and it has helped Splunk double its sales many times over the last few years 

Splunk isn t alone in its mission to help demystify big data    other software companies offer a similar service  The Splunk platform  though  is becoming a multi purpose one  leveraging its capabilities to decipher mass quantities of information into specific functions  One of the ways the company is trying to extend its reach is through strategic acquisitions  It s been a busy year and a half stretch for the San Francisco based company as it has scooped up five of its smaller peers 

What it all adds up to
The first three acquisitions were small and helped expand and improve on Splunk s existing big data analytics platform  The last two purchases are more significant  though  as they both mark expansion into more specific aspects of big data  cybersecurity and DevOps 
With the digital world growing and becoming increasingly integrated with the real world  the cybersecurity industry is also experiencing rapid growth  It s also a complex and fast changing industry  constantly needing to adapt to new and increasingly complex threats  Many enterprises have found Splunk s data sifting and automation capabilities useful in detecting and responding to cyber attacks  so the company s purchase of Phantom makes sense  Splunk and Phantom want to be the heart of security team s operations  helping them respond to threats faster and addressing the talent shortage in the industry by freeing up time 
The purchase of VictorOps addresses problems software developers and operators are facing as they build and manage new systems  The service uses artificial intelligence to detect and respond to problems  helping DevOps teams resolve issues faster  and to aid organizations in deploying new software faster 
It s too early to tell how these bigger acquisitions will contribute to Splunk s overall growth  The upcoming second quarter report will be the first with Phantom as part of the Splunk team  and comments on the VictorOps integration will likely wait until the fall as the purchase wasn t made until June  Both look like promising additions  though  as the technologies they utilize to get the job done are rooted in the same ones Splunk used to grow into a  15 billion company  With all parties involved complementary and growing in their own rights  Splunk s shopping spree has a good chance of helping sales momentum continue ",2018-07-30,Nicholas Rossolillo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-splunk-went-on-a-shopping-spree-in-the-last-year-200334462,200334462

 Policy makers at the US Federal Reserve raised the target for the Federal Reserve s benchmark rate by 0 25   taking it to the highest since 2008  at 1 75  to 2   This is the Fed s seventh rate increase since 2015  They are also shrinking the Fed s massive holdings of government debt and mortgage backed securities  which were purchased to lift the economy out of the recession that ran from late 2007 to 2009 
As higher rates start to take hold  the repercussions are being felt in the US and overseas  The retreat from emerging markets remains relatively modest  with weekly flows to bond and equity funds down less than 10  from their peaks  according to EPFR Global 
But it has coincided with   and partially fueled   a stronger dollar  contributing to currency crises in countries such as Argentina  Turkey and Brazil  It has also prompted central banks elsewhere  including in Indonesia  Malaysia and Hong Kong  to raise their own interest rates in defense    Source  BBC 
The European Central Bank signaled that any interest rate hike was still far away  even as it moved to end its 2 55 trillion euro stimulus program by the end of the year  The ECB s statement came as a relief  especially after the Federal Reserve raised rates for the second time this year on Wednesday and hinted at two more hikes by the end of 2018   Reuters

221040,442556,T,Democratic senator lifts hold on Trump antitrust nominee  aide,news,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren has lifted her hold on President Donald Trump s pick to run the Justice Department s Antitrust Division  a move that will allow the Senate to vote to confirm Makan Delrahim  a senior Republican aide said on Friday 
Warren  a Massachusetts Democrat  had met with Delrahim early in September where she pressed him about her concerns about lobbying and political interference in antitrust 
Delrahim  a veteran of the Justice Department and a lobbyist  has been nominated to be assistant attorney general  It was not immediately clear when the vote would go forward 
The president took an usually long time nominating Delrahim  finally naming him in late March  The Senate Judiciary Committee approved him in June  and sent his nomination to the full Senate 
In the interim  the Justice Department Antitrust Division is being run by Andrew Finch  who will become a deputy to Delrahim once he is in place 
Warren s office and Delrahim did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hold being lifted 
Senator Orrin Hatch  a member of the Judiciary Committee and a Utah Republican  has worked with Warren and others to address concerns about Delrahim s nomination  Hatch s office said in a statement 
Warren had been concerned about Trump attempting to exert political influence on antitrust decisions  As a candidate  Trump had said he would oppose AT T  NYSE T  Inc s proposed  85 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc  NYSE TWX    owner of CNN and one of the country s largest film and television companies 
Delrahim said in his confirmation hearing in May that on his watch  the division s merger reviews would be free from any political influence ",2017-09-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/democratic-senator-lifts-hold-on-trump-antitrust-nominee-aide-532069,532069

221072,442588,T,Slim s America Movil wins telecom battle in top Mexico court,news,"By Noe Torres  Julia Love and Sheky Espejo MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Mexico s Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled billionaire Carlos Slim s telecommunications company America Movil should not be barred by law from charging competitors certain fees  prompting fears of a rollback of a sweeping antitrust reform  The 2014 telecom industry reform  one of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto s signature accomplishments  prohibited America Movil from charging other carriers for calls made to customers on its network  even though those firms are allowed to bill America Movil for using their networks  The reform was aimed at breaking up Slim s market dominance  which rivals said made it challenging for them to break into the sector  It was one of several changes  along with an opening of the state run energy industry  that have increased competition in Mexico s strategic industries  The Supreme Court ruling said the so called interconnection rates should be set by telecom regulator IFT  siding with America Movil   Latin America s largest telecom firm by number of subscribers and the crown jewel of Slim s empire  Tariffs set by the IFT will take effect from January 2018  the court said  America Movil hailed the ruling in a brief statement late on Wednesday  calling on the IFT to set interconnection rates that are  oriented toward costs  transparent and reasonable   In its ruling  the court also said  however  that the ruling would not have  retroactive effects   suggesting competitors such as AT T Inc  NYSE T  and  Telefonica   MC TEF  would not have to reimburse America Movil for the time they did not pay   The  IFT  will be responsible under its constitutional mandate for recognizing the asymmetry  establishing regulation regarding rates  the so called  zero rate  or whatever else it defines  in line with the exercise of its constitutional faculties   Minister Javier Laynez Potisek said during the court s session  The decision worried foreign companies  which have invested heavily in the market since the reform  Telefonica voiced grave concerns  saying the ruling had  serious consequences for the sustainability and makeup  of the sector  In a possible sign of the pressure the regulator will come under as it ponders whether to allow America Movil to charge  the Spanish company said it and others had been severely hurt by the decision and called on Mexican authorities to find a balance  The office of the president said it respected the court s decision and trusted that the regulator would use its powers to strengthen competition in a sector it described as key to the country  AT T also said it trusted the IFT to respect the spirit of the reform   AT T invested in Mexico trusting in the strong public support that the constitutional and legislative reforms of telecommunications received   the company said   The arduous task of reforming the industry has hardly begun and requires continuous dedication    The IFT said in a statement that it would analyze the court s decision and take appropriate action   Shares of America Movil were up more than 1 percent following the news of the decision  The company did not respond to a request for comment  If its rivals had paid the same interconnection rates as America Movil  Slim s company would have received additional revenue of over  1 billion  according to a recent report by Banamex  Industry experts believe the decision weakens the reform  which significantly lowered prices for consumers   It opens up Pandora s box and creates a terrible uncertainty   said Luis Rubio  a partner specializing in telecommunications at the law firm Jones Day   America Movil fought hard against the reform  arguing to the court that legislators did not have the right to create  asymmetrical  rules meant to handcuff Slim s firm and help smaller industry players  Although America Movil s market share only slipped modestly after the reform  hovering around two thirds of mobile subscriptions in Mexico  the entry of new players such as AT T with billions of dollars in foreign investment touched off a price war among carriers   Cellphone service prices dropped by more than 40 percent  according to Mexico s telecom regulator  But if interconnection rates paid to America Movil eat into carriers  margins  prices may begin to creep up again as a result of the decision  said analyst Ernesto Piedras   The benefits of the  so called zero rate policy  are diverse   the investments  the coverage  the quality    The ruling does not necessarily spell a return to the past  industry experts said   The IFT  created as part of the reform  enjoys greater autonomy than the previous regulator and has broad authority to police the operations of telecom companies and TV broadcasters  It has ratcheted up antitrust scrutiny against America Movil  ordering the firm to separate part of its network infrastructure into a new entity in March  By clarifying the role of the IFT  the decision could prove helpful to other players in the market  said Ramiro Tovar Landa  a professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico

221087,442603,T,AT T s Plans To Cut Time Warner Buyout Costs Meet Resistance,opinion,Per Bloomberg  AT T Inc    NYSE T   is witnessing some resistance from the company s bondholders  in its efforts to reduce the cost of borrowings related to its planned acquisition of Time Warner Inc    NYSE TWX    an American mass media and entertainment conglomerate     AT T has categorically proposed two options to get the deal  First  is an offer to buy back from investors some of the bonds used to fund the acquisition  The second is to swap the bonds into new securities           However  either of the two cases would cost AT T a small premium but substantially less than the 1  it will otherwise have to pay  costing  1 billion including interest   AT T had issued these bonds last year  with a stipulation that if the deal wasn t completed by April 2022  then the company would buy back the bonds at 101  of the face value    At least four money managers that are among the biggest holders have decided to reject either options while two others have agreed for the swap  A significant number of investors could accept either    Representatives of AT T and Time Warner  however  did not comment on the subject   Rationale Behind the MoveIt is believed that  AT T s total debt repayment inclusive of accrued interest since the date of issuance of bond  could be as much as  1 billion  To reduce that liability  the company is now seeking to minimize the interest burden to the possible extent  It now plans either to buy back those debts or have the bondholders swap into new securities  having the same coupon and maturity but different terms     Also  a cash offer by the company in this connection gave some of the bondholders an extra 0 25 cents on every dollar to tender their securities  The buyback offer relates to a subset of the debt with the problematic term known as a special mandatory redemption  SMR  clause AT T s second effort to reduce costs will involve it swapping SMR provision out of those securities in an exchange deal for the same fee  which is also beneficial for AT T s because the clause requires it to buy back bonds at 1  premium  bit higher than present trade value   Swap OptionLast week  AT T stated that in order to qualify for the exchange offer  it must receive consent from investors representing at least  300 million of the outstanding value on the bonds due 2037  2050 and 2058 However  the bonds due 2023 do not have any minimum condition requirement  Also  there is no stipulation for the cash offer to hold good  Some bondholders like pension funds and insurers have the incentive to go for the exchange  since they need longer dated assets to match their liabilities    All the bonds under discussion were sold in July 2017  for the Time Warner acquisition  The April 2022 deadline was given on the bond documents  The companies later agreed to make it June 2021 After the U S  Justice Department sued to block the  85 billion combination on antitrust grounds  arguing that the deal will raise prices for pay TV subscribers  the risk of missing the acquisition deadline seems high  However  the trial is in process    Share Price PerformanceOver the last three months  shares of AT T have outperformed the  with an average loss of 5 5  compared with a decline of 6 6  for the latter              AT T carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the industry are United States Cellular Corporation   NYSE USM   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and SITO Mobile  Ltd    NYSE T   carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see                  United States Cellular has an expected long term earnings growth rate of 1   It exceeded earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  with an average of 306 5      SITO Mobile has an expected long term earnings growth rate of 25       Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-04-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/atts-plans-to-cut-time-warner-buyout-costs-meet-resistance-200303709,200303709
221088,442604,T,My Personal 8 Step Plan For 8  Dividends In Close End Funds,opinion,"Today  the 10 year Treasury pays just 2 7   Put a million bucks in T Bills  and you re banking  27 000 per year 
Hence the appeal of closed end funds  CEFs   which often pay 8  or better  That s the difference between a paltry minimum wage income of  27 000 on a million saved or a respectable  80 000 annually 
And if you re smart about your CEF purchases  you can even buy them at discounts and snare some price upside to boot 
Unfortunately this rising rate environment has income seekers scared of CEFs  Many of my readers have asked me if they should bail on our high paying vehicles  The financial media is in their heads  and they re concerned that their funds are suddenly going to drop in price 
Please  don t toss yourself into poverty by following this misguided herd 
With the markets in flux  we should review the principles of successful CEF investing  They are more nuanced than classic stock picking  because we re analyzing managers  strategies and holdings versus simple businesses models  After all  for lazy investors  it s easier to count on dividends via AT T s  NYSE T  declining subscriptions than it is to determine how much China exposure the Aberdeen Asia Pacific Income Fund  NYSE FAX  has 
 The answer  Only about 5   But that bit of extra bit of research will lead you to a secure 8 9  yield  versus a fallible 5 6  for AT T  
CEF Rule  1  Be Careful With Price Charts
PIMCO s Dynamic Income Fund  NYSE PDI  has been a great performer since its inception almost five years ago   but you d never know it from its price chart 
Looks Like Sleepy Gains 
  Until You Add the Payouts Back 
Make sure the chart you re reading includes dividends paid  so that it reflects total returns  
CEF Rule  2  Demand Alpha
Past performance can be an educational indicator about the quality of the management team and its strategy  PDI has had the benefit of the brightest bond minds on the planet calling the shots  from  Bond King  Bill Gross to current superstar Dan Ivascyn  and it delivered 97  total returns over the last five years  with most of these coming in the form of cash payouts 
Meanwhile Alpine s Global Dynamic Dividend Fund  NYSE AGD  has delivered the worst of all worlds to dividend investors  It crashed harder than the broader markets in 2008  then provided almost no rebound as stocks themselves bounced back 
Dynamic dividends  Not here   this dog is still down 18  over the last decade 
More Downside  None of the Upside
Don t be fooled by the siren song of its fat 7 5  current yield  Which brings me to our next point 
CEF Rule  3  Check Every Yield s Back Story
Some funds pay big distributions that look great   but they re not sustainable  However they continue to attract new  sucker  investors because they are able to fund their payouts   they just happen to shed their net asset value  NAV  at a similar pace 
For example  here are two more dogs that have grinded sideways or worse over the last three years  even when accounting for dividends paid  
Big Yields  But Lackluster Returns
CEF Rule  4  Know What s Funding Your Distributions
A closed end fund can pay you from some combination of 

Investment income 
Capital gains  and or
Return of capital 

Of the three  investment income is preferable because it s usually the most reliable  Many CEFs pay monthly distributions  so it s best if they match up their payouts with steady income streams themselves 
Capital gains from rising bond or stock prices can further boost distributions  But they are at risk of disappearing if the markets turn unfavorably 
Finally  everyone assumes return of capital is bad  because it s simply shipping your money back to you  But as my colleague  the  CEF professor  Michael Foster    it s often very good for investors 
What s more  if the fund trades at a sizeable discount  this can actually be a savvy way to kick start the closing of a discount window  More on this shortly 
CEF Rule  5  Don t Be Cheap About Fees
Most investors are conditioned by their experience with mutual funds and ETFs to search out the lowest fees  almost to a fault  This makes sense for investment vehicles that are roughly going to perform in line with the broader market  Lowering your costs minimizes drag 
Closed ends are a different investment animal  though  On the whole  there are many more dogs than gems  It s an absolute necessity to find a great manager with a solid track record  Great managers tend to be expensive  of course   but they re well worth it 
The stated yields you see quoted  by the way  are always net of fees  Your account will never be debited for the fees from any fund you own  They are simply paid by the fund itself from its NAV 
CEF Rule  6  Ignore Short Term Interest Rates
Many funds are selling at bargain prices today thanks to the headline worry that higher rates hurt CEFs  But that s just not true 
Libor is tied closely to the Fed funds rate  And the last time the Fed hiked its rate significantly  CEFs did just fine 
In June 2004  Fed chair Alan Greenspan began boosting rates from then historic lows  Over a two year period  he increased the federal funds rate from 1  to 5 25   An earthquake 
How d CEFs perform  Three prominent funds all outperformed the market during Greenspan s aforementioned run 
Higher Rates No Problem for Top CEFs 2004 06
Regular readers will recognize the Greenspan example quite well  because I ve been using it repeatedly to drive this point home  And I m glad to share another data point   our own profits from this rate hike cycle 
The chart below illustrates three of my CEF recommendations rolling higher in lockstep with the Fed funds rate  and that rate is the orange line stair stepping from the lower left to the upper right  
This Rate Hike Cycle  Our CEFs Have Rolled Higher
Once again  the best CEFs are gaining value in the face of rate rises 
CEF Rule  7  Demand a Discount
One aspect of the CEF structure lends itself perfectly to contrary minded investing  fixed pools of shares 
Mutual funds issue more shares whenever they want  But closed ends have a fixed share count  with their funds trading like stocks  As a result  from time to time a fund will fall out of favor and find its shares trading at a discount to its NAV 
This is basically  free money  because these underlying assets are constantly marked to market  If a fund trades at a 10  discount  management could theoretically liquidate the fund and cash out everyone at  1 10 on the dollar immediately  Or it can buy back its own shares to close the discount window  and boost the share price  
A discount is a great start  but do make sure that management has  
CEF Rule  8  When Possible  Buy Along Insiders
It s rare to see any fixed income manager put his or her own money on the line at all  unfortunately  According to a recent Barron s article  nearly half of all closed end funds have no insider ownership whatsoever 
Why would we want to own any of them  if the managers don t 
The 3 Best Closed End Funds to Bankroll Your Retirement
Closed end funds are a cornerstone of my   which lets retirees rely entirely on dividend income and leave their principal 100  intact 
Well that s not exactly right 
Their principal is more than 100  intact thanks to price gains like these  Which means principal is actually 110  intact after year 1  and so on 
To do this  I seek out closed end funds that 

Pay 8  or better 
Have well funded distributions 
Trade at meaningful discounts to their NAV 
And know how to make their shareholders money 

And I talk to management  because online research isn t enough  I also track insider buying to make sure these guys have real skin in the game 
Today I like three  blue chip  closed end funds as best income buys  And wait  til you see their yields  These  slam dunk  income plays pay 8 2   9 9  and even 10 1  dividends 
Plus  they trade at 10 to 15  discounts to their net asset value  NAV  today  Which means they re perfect for your retirement portfolio because your downside risk is minimal  Even if the market takes a tumble  these top notch funds will simply trade flat  and we ll still collect those fat dividends

already started to build up in the space with the spate of news First  the latest Blomberg report states that China may slow down  or even stop  the purchase of U S  government bonds  citing that U S  debt has become less attractive than other assets  Since China is the biggest buyer of U S  sovereign bonds holding  1 2 trillion of U S  debt  the action could lead to a broad sell off in the equity

aimed at bolstering the critical U S  Taiwan partnership  The Global Times  a nationalistic arm of the Communist Party media apparatus states  Beijing s diplomatic retaliations toward Washington will come from all sides   Since 1979  Washington has cut off diplomatic ties with the government in Taipei under the  One China  policy  which recognizes the East Asian island as part of China Further  the United States has blocked two Chinese high profile deals over national security concerns  One is Ant Financial s  1 2 billion purchase of transfer firm MoneyGram International and the other is the Huawei Technologies deal with U S  carrier AT T   NYSE T   to sell its smartphones in the United States  The back to back Chinese investment setback in a week has threatened China U S  trade ties The move came as the Trump administration is gearing up for new trade penalties against China in the coming weeks  including potential tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and punitive actions against China arising from an investigation into Beijing s alleged theft of intellectual property  The United Sates is also mulling to impose tariff or import duties on Chinese solar panels and washing machines manufactured in China and its neighbors  If this happens  this would lead to retaliatory measures from Beijing  indicating the beginning of a trade war with implications for the entire world

221184,442700,T,Stocks Continue To Cheer Tax Deal,opinion,"Hey everybody  Dave Bartosiak here for fellow Marquette alum Jim  Jimmy G  Giaquinto  He ll be back with you tomorrow 

Another day  another dollar in the markets today as the tax overhaul on Capitol Hill hit the history books  We are beginning to see estimates coming in from Wall Street firms trying to gauge the impact of the cuts  Already  there have been a few announcements from companies like AT T  NYSE T  saying that they are passing out bonuses based on the tax cuts  If you re looking for some wage push inflation  perhaps this is the start 

The rally today started in the morning and slowed into the closing with the mega caps of the Dow leading the way  The Dow added 55 64 points or 23 bps at 24 782 29  The S P 500 was up 5 32 points good for 20 bps at 2 684 57  The NASDAQ traded sideways  adding just 4 4 points or 6 bps at 6 965 36 

Today s Highlights 

Kevin Matras rang the register on his Landstar trade in Options Trader  He pulled the trigger on closing out the Jan  95 Call  more than doubling up on the trade  rocking out for 110  gain  Despite still being bullish on the trade  he took the huge victory 

 I still like LSTR  But for now  we have more than doubled our premium  and with only 28 days left until expiration  it s time to pull those profits off the table  I see myself repositioning in this one soon  Either on an upside breakout or a pullback  Stay tuned  But for now let s take our profit  

Tracey Ryniec wants you to remember that the Santa Claus Rally period hasn t even hit the market yet  despite us rallying so much recently  In her Insider Trader today she wrote   With the 3 day Christmas holiday now looming  I m expecting stock traders to take tomorrow off  It should be a low volume trading session  Congress also passed a funding bill to keep the government open into January  which also should take away any surprises tomorrow  

Remember  the Santa Claus Rally officially begins next week  It is the week in between Christmas and New Years as well as the first two trading days of the new year  

Another theme in Tracey s write up  the impact of a surging energy sector  was echoed by Jeremy Mullin in Counterstrike today  Commenting on crude  Jeremy said   Energy stocks continue to impress while crude oil just sits at  58 a barrel  I think the smart money is preparing for a big year in the energy space in 2018  They are already buying the stocks  crude oil over  60 will help the momentum continue  Once again  ETFs XLE  NYSE XLE  and XOP ripped higher  both seeing moves over 2   Luckily we got some exposure in the space last week with COP  which was up 3  today  

Small cap energy is a great place to be in order to benefit from the tax bill  Domestic producers will likely be one of the largest beneficiaries of the deal 

That s all I ve got for you folks today  Jim will be back with you folks tomorrow  Remember  the market closes early in observance of Christmas  while Monday there will be no trading in equities 

Have a great night

221222,442738,T,Opening Bell  Dollar Holds Gains As German Politics Sinks Stocks,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Key Events
Yesterday  though Asian stocks except for Chinese shares in both Hong Kong and the mainland fell to start the trading week  European and US stocks climbed 
The news that current Fed Chair Janet Yellen would also leave the Fed s board of governors in early February once her successor takes over as Fed Chairman  was met with indifference by the market  Considering the uncertainty that hit investors when her second in command  then Vice Chair Stanley Fischer suddenly announced his early resignation in October  that s certainly an unexpected reaction 
Under Yellen s watch the unemployment rate has fallen from 6 7  at the beginning of 2014 to 4 1  today  As well  the US s economic expansion continued during her tenure  It currently ranks as the third longest period of growth in history for the nation s economy 
The S P 500 advanced after two consecutive weekly declines  However  traders punched out after prices failed to maintain their session highs  on the news the US Justice Department filed a lawsuit yesterday to prevent AT T  NYSE T  from completing its  85 4 billion takeover of Time Warner  NYSE TWX   alleging antitrust issues 
Global Economic Affairs
While investors are taking the departure of Yellen in stride  notwithstanding that her position on the Fed s board of governors wouldn t have expired until 2024  there may still be a market reaction ahead  When the realization dawns that her departure creates a fourth Fed vacancy for President Donald Trump to fill  next year s interest rates could become less predictable 
Wednesday s release of the Fed Minutes will open a window into policy makers  commitment to higher interest rates in December  The Fed s tasks include the challenge of supporting long term Treasuries such as the 10 year currently seeing the narrowest gap with short term Treasuries including the 2 year in a decade 

The inability of long term Treasuries to move higher creates a vicious cycle  in which the causal relationship is murky  This could be occurring because institutional investors now have a dismal outlook on sustainable economic growth  or a circular  self fulfilling prophecy could be forming  in which the dismal outlook increases investor negativity  and so forth  The Fed s challenge  even a December hike won t help long term Treasuries  since it s already priced in 
With the Thanksgiving holiday this coming Thursday  investors are in for a shortened week that s typically known to be slow for the stock market  It also marks the opening shot for companies to implement their year end  tax related strategies  As well as it being a shorter week  trading volume is traditionally thin since many start their holiday related travel early 
This year  however  the holiday break brings added complexity  putting additional pressure on markets  With lawmakers on Capitol Hill also curtailing their activities  tax reform the biggest market mover over the last few months will be brought to a standstill until the holiday break is over  Having said that  since these reasons have no sway on share value or inherent sentiment  the negative effects should be limited  both in time and price 
This morning  stocks in Asia rallied across the board  led by Tokyo and Hong Kong  though South Korea s KOSPI bucked the trend 

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index neared a decade high  Chinese stocks resumed their rally  led by a rebound in financial shares  which earlier in the week took a hit on the governments  repeated warnings about unsustainable gains and the continuous crackdown on shadow banking which began last year  After the knee jerk selloff that began late last week  investors have come to realize that even with the stricter regulations  China is still a target rich trading environment 

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell  though the euro eked out a gain  after yesterday s worst slide in three weeks  The single currency could be headed still lower 
The dollar received a boost when its biggest currency partner  the euro  fell 0 31 percent yesterday  closing near the low of the session  a sign that after an initial 0 31 percent advance  euro bears went home smiling  The euro first fell in early trading yesterday  after Merkel s month long coalition negotiations collapsed  even as the EU requires stability for Brexit negotiations 
However  after German PPI met expectations  the euro rebounded on the region s continued economic growth  At the end of the day  however  the rebound was struck by technicals  when the price reached a resistance line  where supply has been overcoming demand  at the falling channel top  We forecast yesterday  link above  that the euro would retest the 1 1730 level  It did  and is now poised to resume the downtrend  to retest its post German election low of 1 1554 
While the currency failed to survive the political uncertainty  Germany s DAX bounced from a seven week low  As has been said before  and it s particularly true this year  while currency and commodity traders are very sensitive to geopolitics  ever since the Brexit vote of June 2016  equity investors continuously brush off the headlines  So  while euro traders sold off and the currency resumed its downtrend  equity traders seemed to have decided that even though the coalition talks failed  it won t threaten the economy 
Equities gain another benefit when their base currency slides  Local company exports become more competitive even as local shares become cheaper and thus more appealing to international investors 
Despite the Asia rally  shares in Europe took a step back at the open  as equity traders showed they were being mindful of politics  a relatively rare occurrence  German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced she s prepared to stand for early elections  sending bunds higher 
The Turkish lira reached a new all time low against the dollar  after the USD TRY pair climbed above the January 11  3 9423 peak  posting a new record high of 3 9779 and settling on 3 9592  as of 4 15 EDT 

Recent attempts by the Turkish central bank to support both the lira as well as Turkey s sovereign bonds have failed to bolster either asset  The central bank announced it would auction as much as  3 billion in instruments till the end of the year to help corporate borrowers manage foreign exchange positions  The currency still weakened more than 1 percent and yields on 10 year lira debt surged to a record 13 01 percent  Even today s announcement by the central bank that it would cut bank borrowing limits barely helped the floundering currency 
Except for its pairing with the Turkish lira  the dollar was little changed since yesterday when it rebounded from a 0 46 percent decline to close near the top of its range  on a 0 06 percent advance  leaving it with just a 0 50 percent reversal 
The rise of the USD  the base currency for precious metals  makes them more expensive  reducing demand which in turn causes prices to fall 

Gold also suffered a risk on selloff  pushing it to its biggest fall in two months  Like the dollar  precious metals today were little changed 
The UK s sweetened  divorce  bill to the EU spurred a potentially slower UK economic growth outlook  This is putting sterling and gilt traders on the defensive  Although the pound received a boost yesterday on reports the UK was prepared to double the  divorce  bill  the currency is still locked in a range since October 13 
The Australian dollar fell to a five month low after the central bank signaled that low interest rates are here to stay  for now 

Oil rebounded  paring losses  The commodity is now eyeing its two year high resistance  ahead of US government data to be released tomorrow  forecast to show crude stockpiles resumed declines

221223,442739,T,Euro Snaps Back  Sterling Remains In Narrow Range,opinion,"The US dollar has largely been confined to yesterday s trading ranges against the major currencies amid light news  The North American session does not hold much hope for fresh impetus  The US reports October existing home sales  which are not typically market moving in the best of times  Yellen does not speak until after the markets close  and even then is unlikely to sway expectations  which have priced in a rate hike next month 
There are a couple of exceptions to the inside trading days  First  the dovish twist to the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia s recent meeting saw the Australian dollar make a marginal new five month low of almost  0 7530 before rebounding smartly to push above yesterday s high  A close above  0 7575 would be constructive  Investors seemed to latch on to the RBA s disappointment with the weak wage growth and increased competitive pressure in retailing as restraining prices  However  Governor Lowe s comment that although there is no strong case for a near term adjustment in policy  the next move is likely to spark the recovery  With the daily technical indicators stretched  we had anticipated that a new low would not be sustained   
The euro was sold in early Europe  and marginal new lows were recorded    1 1715   However  the single currency snapped back quickly  Initial resistance is seen near  1 1760  German politics remains the chief talking point  The German President is sounding out the different parties to see if there is a possibility of a coalition  Initial surveys suggest Merkel is in tune with the public in preferring new elections to a minority government  Both of these options are unusual for modern Germany 
We suspect talk of the end of Merkel s tenure is greatly exaggerated  A survey suggests Merkel s CDU will remain the largest party  and within the CDU  there does not appear to be a compelling alternative  At first  it seemed that a minority government would be preferable to new elections  The fear seemed to be that new elections would see the AfD bolstered  but the initial poll suggests this is not the case  The FDP is seen as somewhat irresponsible and may suffer on its leader s gamble  The Greens appear to have won a few new supporters 
 Investors do not seem to think that the unsettled political scene is a threat to the stability of economic performance of Germany  The DAX gapped lower yesterday and quickly filled the gap to close 0 5  higher  It is extending those gains today to trade at a five day high  Technically  we see immediate scope for another 0 5 1 0  gain  
The euro may be helped by some cross rate gains  Concern about house prices and weak interbank rates continue to weigh on the Swedish krona  The euro surged above SEK10 0 for the first time since last November  We note that the three month interbank rate in Sweden fell to a record low yesterday  Ironically  while the Swedish krona is the weakest of the major currencies today  the Norwegian krone is battling the Aussie for the top position  and this despite the fact that three month interbank rates also fell to record lows yesterday   
Sterling is in narrow ranges in the upper end of yesterday s ranges  The government borrowing in October was a little more than expected  but this was offset by the downward revision to the September borrowing  The market is looking toward tomorrow s autumn budget announcement by Hammond and tracking the latest developments over Brexit  Reports suggest the UK Cabinet supported Prime Minister May doubling its initial financial offer  Other reports say she will accept that after Brexit  EU citizens in the UK will be protected by the European Court of Justice   
There were no reports of fresh proposals about the Irish border  There is some thought that if the UK offers progress on the EU citizen s rights and its financial obligation  the Irish border issue could be kicked down to be addressed within a new trade agreement  That seems to be a gamble  and such gambles based on looking for a room to  divide and conquer  have not been particularly successful in the Brexit negotiations  Initial support is pegged near  1 3220  and nearby resistance is near  1 3270 
 The US dollar has toyed with the CAD1 2820 area  which is important from a technical vantage point  It rose to almost CAD1 2840 in early European turnover  It ran into a wall of offers and reversed lower  There is a  1 5 bln option that expires today struck at CAD1 2750 than could come into play  
After slipping yesterday  the MSCI Asia Pacific Index recovered 0 9  today  Equity markets in Hong Kong  Taiwan  and Singapore advanced by more than 1   Hong Kong s Enterprise Index  H shares  advanced nearly 3   led by real estate and financials  European shares are also moving higher  The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is up about 0 3   Energy and information technology are leading the advance  The telecoms sector is the only one in the red which may be a knock on effect from the US Justice Department seeking to block the AT T  NYSE T   Time Warner  NYSE TWX  merger  
Ten year benchmark yields are softer by 2 4 bp in Europe  The 10 year US Treasury yield is paring yesterday s increase  but at 2 35  is still a basis point above last week s closing levels and sits on the five day average  oil prices are firm  helped perhaps by speculation that US oil stocks may have fallen for the first time in three weeks  EIA estimate tomorrow   Next week  November 30  OPEC is expected to agree to extend output cuts ",2017-11-21,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-marks-time-200267088,200267088
221224,442740,T,Chart Of The Day  Trading Time Warner As AT T Merger Blocked,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Red Flag For Time Warner Investors
Perhaps the most repeated new phrase since the Trump campaign is  fake news   It s no secret that the US President doesn t care for media companies  except for the reliably supportive Fox News  It is no surprise then that the Department of Justice is going after the AT T  NYSE T    Time Warner  NYSE TWX  merger  two media companies that aren t on President Trump s good side  claiming that the new entity would wield too much power and violate antitrust rules 
Given that this is the Trump administration  which seems to tenaciously cling to those pieces of legislation it most wants to see enacted regardless of how frequently said legislation may be shot down consider the never ending conflict over US immigration policy  a topic the White House  no matter how many times it s attacked in court we might expect to see a drawn out process contesting the DOJ s suite as well  Thus  until this is merger is put to bed one way or another  undoubtedly shareholders will be unnerved 

Shares of Time Warner fell as much as 6 45 percent and settled with a 3 75 loss on November 2  after the report that the DOJ would block the merger 
After three days of struggle between bears and dip buyers  the price fell another 6 4 percent on November 8  followed by a third  1 5 percent decline 
The overall plunge on the DOJ challenge to the merger was  12 05  or 12 percent  over as little as six trading sessions  It erased a full year of gains for the stock  which had been spurred by the Trump Bump  the post election  animal spirits  stock market revival 
The extraordinarily sharp decline formed the  flag pole   whereas the consolidation since the anniversary of the Trump victory formed the  flag   which is a continuation pattern  When a downside breakout completes  it signals a repeat of the preceding move 
While the flag pole represents the panicked selloff  the flag represents profit taking and a concern that the selloff was panicked  and therefore unsustainable  A downside breakout signals  here we go again   which eggs on traders into the same emotional selloff as the one prior to the interruption by the flag 
Measuring The Target Price
Since the expectation is for a minimum of a repeated move  the target price is measured according to the length of the flag pole  from the November 2nd height of  99 85 to the November 9th low of  86 38  to a total of  13 50 from the flag bottom  forming the target of  72 88 
Stop Loss
To give yourself a fighting chance  you d need to get on the good side of statistics  That means cutting losses and running with wins  in contrast to what novice traders do  which is the single biggest reason for their failure  An acceptable risk reward ratio is 1 3  Since the target provides a  13 50 reward  the stop loss may be up to  4 50 above the entry point 
However  traders could get a more favorable ratio  Even if you re waiting on the conservative 3 percent penetration without waiting for a return move for an entry closer to the pattern s resistance  the risk is only  2 59  nearly half of the  allowed   4 5 to satisfy the 1 3 risk reward ratio  In other words  even with the most conservative breakout and the most aggressive entry  not waiting for the potential return move   the risk reward ratio is 1 5  It increases exponentially in your favor the longer you wait for the return move to be fulfilled  bringing a potential entry to the bottom of the flag 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders should hold on for a decisive 3 percent downside breakout from the flag s  86 38 lower boundary  then wait for a likely return move to retest the flag s resistance  and then wait for evidence of such resistance  with a close lower at least than the price action of the preceding up day  placing a stop loss above the  86 38 level 
Moderate traders would wait for at least a 2 percent downside breakout and a potential return move  allowing for a better entry  with a stop loss above the flag s lower boundary 
Aggressive traders may enter a short position after a 1 percent downside penetration  with a stop loss above the flag s lower boundary  Waiting for a return move  even for a partial one  would reduce the distance to the stop loss and the depth of risk it carries ",2017-11-21,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day-200267089,200267089

221234,442750,T,Is AT T  T  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AT T Inc    NYSE T   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AT T has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  AT T s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that AT T has a forward PE  ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AT T stock in the near term too  P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AT T has a P S ratio of about 1 3  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  T is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AT T currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AT T a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though AT T might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D  This gives T a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased 1 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below AT T Inc  Price and Consensus    The stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAT T is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 10  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like to peek behind the curtain today and view them Starting now  for the next month  I invite you to follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time from value to momentum   from stocks under  10 to ETF to option movers   from insider trades to companies

221256,442772,T,The Week Ahead  Is This As Good As It Gets  ,opinion,"Last week I wrote that there was so much on the calendar that it was impossible to choose a single theme  This week presents the opposite problem  In the wake of the big news  what will command attention  As I studied the data  I was struck by the confluence of record results  Put that together with record stock prices  and there is a natural question for the ever skeptical punditry 
Is this as good as it gets 
Last Week Recap
In the  I predicted a paradise for the punditry  gorging on a feast of data  Fed news  and policy proposals  That was a pretty easy call  and it did give us a chance to think about a range of key issues  I noted that a lot of news does not necessarily translate into volatility   and so it was  The market shrugged off the appointment of a new Fed Chair  Mueller s indictments  and the GOP tax proposal  The economic data was mixed  and so was the market 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500  via Jill Mislinski  She notes the gain of 0 26  on the week  after Friday s strength  Once again  it was a week of very low volatility  the intra week range was less than 1   Historically 1  moves are commonplace   each day 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news has been mostly positive  as summarized by  of long  short  and coincident indicators 
The Good
Lumber futures are stronger   the complexities of trends and tariffs  concluding that this is a useful leading indicator for stocks 
Auto sales continued a  hot streak      The SAAR is now 18 1 million  with good prospects for the end of 2017 
Jerome Powell s nomination as Fed Chair was quietly accepted by markets  With New York Fed President William Dudley reportedly about to announce his retirement  there are four more openings to fill 
Consumer confidence measured by the Conference Board is at the highest level in 17 years   is comprehensive and the summary chart is great   show that future confidence is lower than the present 

Earnings reports remained strong    with earning beat rates 4 8  higher than average and revenue beat rates 1 2  higher   of the biggest winners and losers 
Initial jobless claims hit the lowest level since 1973  four week moving average   Once again  let us look at  informative chart  It helpfully shows the long term view  but with a focus on the last year 

The Bad
ISM manufacturing is cooling from a hot September   The decline to 58 7 from last month s thirteen year high is  modest  they suggest  They are also encouraged by the comments 

The rally is somewhat narrow  Lara Crigger    describes the presence of the  Four Horseman  in many ETFs  The heavy weighting of these stocks can generate an exaggerated impression of overall strength 
The employment news  While the report was mixed  the headline number missed expectations  so I ll score this as  bad   the lower labor force participation and lack of wage growth  up only 2 4  over the last year 
The miss in the headline number was much smaller when considering upward revisions to the prior months 
ADP private job growth was solid   J 
 summarizes the data and reaches the following conclusion 
This was an excellent report in terms of labor utilization  decent in terms of jobs growth  and poor in terms of wages 


The big declines in unemployment  underemployment  involuntary part time employment  and persons who want a job now but haven t looked have nudged us very close to what has been  full employment  in the past two expansions  We may be as little as 1 5 million jobs away 



The Neutral
This week had some news worth mentioning  but without a real market effect 
The GOP tax reform proposal  I have predicted that this would have no market effect  and that proved true this week  The original proposal sparked hundreds of articles on who would benefit from each provision  This is a necessary process  of course  because information is needed before deciding  That said  the proposal is not close to mustering a Congressional majority   has a nice  detailed review of the proposal  It includes the summary table below  If you see yourself has getting a tax reduction  what should you do  I consulted Mrs  OldProf  who tracks issues like this with care  although not as much as used following the Packers   Her recommendation  Do not spend the tax reform money just yet 

The Ugly
Kids  play time is   18 6 hours per week and 2 7 on homework 

The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar
We have a very light data calendar  The JOLTS report is interesting to wonks  but usually spun into an inferior read on job growth  The President s Asia trip will capture the news  but few would venture a guess about the market effect  We are past the peak of the earnings season  but some important news remains 
 has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme
With little on the calendar and so much space and time to fill for the financial media  what will be the focus next week  It is the opposite of last week  when there were many possibilities  As I was preparing the updates on data  I noticed that many economic indicators are reaching record levels   right along with stocks 
I suspect that this will be fertile ground for discussion next week  Since the financial punditry always must dig deeper  I expect to hear the question   Is this as good as it gets 
Here are some perspectives  in my customary bearish to bullish range 
Yes  Some of these levels just cannot get much better  Unemployment claims  unemployment  consumer confidence and the VIX are good examples  And of course  the over valued stock market will follow when these measures roll over 
Maybe  The pros and the individual investors disagree      The interesting charts show that bearish individual sentiment at the end of August coincided with the next leg of a rally  The active manager exposure index has declined from 71 7  to 60 2   but this is viewed as a slightly lagging or concurrent indicator 
Eventually  Volatility is at a record low  Fund manager  provides an interesting analysis of historical VIX readings  with this conclusion 
What did I take away from this study  Equity volatility does not change from ultra low to high overnight  With equity volatility historically low  do not expect a sharp economic or financial market correction absent some exogenous shock  While equity multiples in the U S  continue to be historically extended  we could continue to see low volatility and rising stock prices over the next 12 months  When equity volatility persists at an above average rate for an extended period of time   as it did in 1999 and late 2007 and early 2008   it may be time to pare your risk and accumulate dry powder for a correction 




Not yet  The record earnings expectations march higher  and the stock multiple has not caught up     
Good is good  Do not second guess the obvious  The  the need for advance planning followed by calm execution  He reaches a conclusion like Urban Carmel s 
So the first myth that needs to be abolished is that one won t have the time to get out before the next crash  Not true  the 2007 2008 financial crisis is the first example showing that to be the case  Anyone care to point out a more dire time in equity market history 


The best is yet ahead   that  sell in May  missed s 7 9  gain  He cites LPL s Ryan Detrick who showed that such contra seasonality gains have nearly always been associated with a further rally in the next six months 

Maybe a lot higher   Davidson   who has been very accurate throughout the rally  analyzes economic fundamentals  reaching the following conclusion in what  calls  some of his best work  

Economic indicators provide investment signals well before investor market psychology begins to shift  Investors remain decently pessimistic while economic indicators forecast continued economic growth and higher profits  As more investors turn optimistic  markets should continue to rise higher  I expect markets to rise as long as the T Bill 10yr Treasury rate spread remains favorable  One cannot predict how high  One can only discuss the potential  The SP500 in 3yrs  has the potential to reach  3 500  4 500  A wide range and over valued  but it is impossible to predict how optimistic market psychology can become  For now  the best one can do is to simply say  higher  


The cutoff point for equity investing will be in my opinion the T Bill 10yr Treasury rate spread narrowing to 0 20   At 1 35  today  we have 2yrs 3yrs of higher equity markets ahead in my opinion 


As usual  I ll have more in the Final Thought  where I always emphasize my own conclusions  In this case  it includes what I see as most important

If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be  on politics and investing  As usual  they make their argument with charts  In this case  the topic should be familiar to WTWA readers  Don t mix political opinions and investing  I maintain that understanding likely policy outcomes will improve investment results  Some readers confuse this with political advocacy  Sometimes the policy issues matter to the market  and we should all pay attention

Final Thoughts
Can we expect to identify market tops from the record strength in economic indicators  No 
This is one of the most deceptive practices  and sadly  a common one  Writers who are perpetually bearish  or bullish  will interpret data in a straightforward fashion when it suits their purpose  When it does not  the predict something like  the sunset always follows the sunrise   I call this the Chauncey Gardiner approach  It is just as naive as it is in   and verges on intellectual dishonesty  If I seem unusually exercised by this topic  you are reading me right 
When indicators and markets finally roll over and get worse  we will be able to look back and spot the  top   That is much different from a real time forecast  The current level of economic strength can continue or improve   perhaps for years  Many pounce on the first decline in an indicator and leap to an unwarranted conclusion 
This is not just a bearish trait  When the market was reaching new lows in 2008  the same argument was made by bulls  including Mr  Buffett  How long can things go  Buy when there is fear  These comments were right  but it took several months  While a relatively short time on a historical stock chart  it seemed like an eternity to investors as markets declined much further 
Trying to guess the top  or bottom  from improving  or worsening  indicators is a fool s errand 
Stocks are driven by earnings and interest rate expectations  These factors remain favorable  as I record each week  We have no special threats to financial stability  and plenty of fear built into the market  I also expect the  slower  economic indicators to follow the  soft  data that many try to dismiss 
Monitoring these factors is one of the prime missions of WTWA 

What worries me 
Mueller indictments and President Trump s response  This is still on my list  The first indictments showed an inclination to move up a chain of possible offenders  If a Trump family member is included and the President fires Mueller  the Nixon era  comparisons will get headlines  N B   I refer not to the substance of the issue  but to the market reaction 
The Asian trip  I wish the President had more willingness to use expert advice  With important trade and security matters at stake  it is an opportunity to improve some ties with needed allies 
 and what doesn t
Stock valuation  Since I regard the most popular levels as flawed  I focus on expected earnings and alternative opportunities  While some individual stocks seem richly valued  I am having little trouble finding attractive choices

221322,442838,T,U S  consumers should be free to sue banks  credit card companies  agency,news,By Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    New rules proposed on Thursday by a U S  consumer watchdog would block credit card companies  banks and other firms from forcing customers to waive their rights to join class action lawsuits and settle disputes only through arbitration  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said financial firms should be barred from using fine print in contracts that mandates arbitration instead of a group lawsuit in the event of a dispute over products ranging from checking accounts to credit cards  The agency said the clauses prevent consumers who have been wronged from receiving justice and compensation through the courts  U S  businesses are expected to oppose the proposal and sue if it becomes final  They say arbitration is more efficient and helps avoid costly litigation that rarely benefits the people filing suit   Companies simply insert these clauses into their contracts for consumer financial products or services and literally  with the stroke of a pen  are able to block any group of consumers from filing joint lawsuits known as class actions   CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in prepared remarks   That is so even though class actions are widely recognized to be valid avenues to secure legal relief under federal and state law   In class actions  people band together to sue over the same alleged wrongdoing to make the lawsuit more affordable  A 2015 study by the CFPB found individuals rarely sue on their own because it is too expensive and that about 6 8 million consumers receive  220 million in payments from class action settlements each year  In arbitration  a private individual settles a conflict  Frequently  companies select the arbitrators  the proceedings are confidential and decisions are hard to appeal   Under the proposal  companies could still use arbitration clauses  but would have to state explicitly that consumers can sign onto class actions  They would also have to give the bureau information on claims filed and awards issued in the arbitrations  as well as correspondence from arbitrators regarding unpaid fees and failure to follow standards of conduct   Requiring customers to agree to  mandatory arbitration clauses  when they sign up for a product has become nearly universal since a 2011 U S  Supreme Court decision known as AT T  NYSE T  Mobility vs  Concepcion validated the practice  It has also become a flashpoint for both political parties  Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday supported the proposal  saying  mandatory arbitration clauses buried deep in contracts for credit cards  student loans  and more prevent American consumers from having their day in court when they ve been harmed    U S  Senator Sherrod Brown  an Ohio Democrat sometimes mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate in November s election  pledged to push the CFPB to  finalize the rule as soon as possible   The private sector and conservative political leaders quickly criticized the proposal  saying it only helps attorneys who file class actions and reap fees and shares of settlements  The chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee  Republican Jeb Hensarling of Texas  called it a  big  wet kiss to trial attorneys  and cast Cordray as a  de facto dictator     This move   which will apply to some of the most common financial contracts including credit cards  checking accounts  and even cell phones   essentially hands over the keys of the CFPB s luxury office building to the wealthy  powerful  and politically well connected trial lawyer lobby   he said  The U S  Chamber of Commerce  representing the business sector  said that  in the 50 years since the advent of modern day class action lawsuits  plaintiffs  lawyers have made millions of dollars in fees from these suits while consumers often receive little benefit   The CFPB said the proposal would give consumers  a day in court   It also aims to create a deterrent effect through the threat of group lawsuits and increased transparency  the agency said    Forced arbitration and class action bans force consumers into a biased  secretive  and lawless forum  preventing either a court or an arbitrator from ordering a lawbreaker to repay all of its victims   Lauren Saunders  associate director of the National Consumer Law Center  said in a statement ,2016-05-06,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-regulator-seeks-return-of-class-action-suits-against-credit-cards,-banks-400181",400181

Despite continuous loss of legacy fixed telephony business to wireless and other offerings  Frontier Communications is a favorable stock option with its efforts to expand and enhance its broadband infrastructure and services 
Broadband Expansion Strategy
Frontier Communications recently announced its plan to deploy Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp  s   NYSE NOK   G fast technology in Connecticut  The technology is aimed to deliver gigabit speed broadband services to users living in apartments and multi dwelling units  MDUs  throughout the state  The G fast approach is expected to be a key element of broader copper network upgrade plan which will simplify the broadband installation and activation process in MDUs 
Moreover  the company announced the availability of enhanced broadband service to previously unserved residents throughout West Virginia and in 25 counties within Ohio and to numerous additional rural households in North Carolina  South Carolina  Tennessee  Wisconsin  Minnesota  Arizona  New Mexico  Illinois  Indiana and Texas 
Upsides
We are impressed with Frontier Communications  focus on generating additional revenues through customer retention  market share gain  new product introductions  broadband expansion as well as improved sales and marketing initiatives  We believe that the company is presently focusing on cost control with productivity and customer oriented enhancements 
The above factors have made the company s operations efficient  We are also encouraged by sustainable broadband subscriber growth supported by strong network expansion and improved pricing structure 
The company has been trying to benefit from the growing Business Service Segment  By foraying into North Carolina with the rollout of  Vantage TV  IPTV and broadband services in the region  Frontier Communications will challenge major incumbents like AT T Inc    NYSE T   and Charter Communications   NYSE T   
Meanwhile  the company s decision to reward its stockholders with a quarterly cash dividend of  0 04 per share of common stock  paid on Jun 30  2017 to holders of record at the closure of business on Jun 15  2017  is an encouraging initiative 
Some Downturns
Frontier Communications has been facing outages  poor telephone services and billing problems  The company continues to suffer from the loss of legacy fixed telephony business to wireless offerings  Decline in access lines and wireless backhaul revenues due to customer migration to Ethernet solutions at lower price is another concern  The persistent decline continues to tighten local service revenues  which accounts for most of Frontier Communications  overall revenues 
Moreover  the price performance of Frontier Communications is also depressing  Over the past three months  share price of Frontier Communications moved down 44 76  compared with the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 22 68

221329,442845,T,With Havana trip  Obama seeks to make history  lock in Cuba opening,news,"By Matt Spetalnick  Jeff Mason and Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON  Reuters    Barack Obama s historic visit to Havana next week may be the closest he comes to a Nixon goes to China moment  but he also has another more practical goal  to make his opening to Cuba irreversible for the next U S  president  The Obama administration hopes that getting more U S  companies invested in Cuba and loosening up travel to the island will make it almost impossible for traditionally pro business Republicans to halt or even roll back the thaw in relations if they win the White House in November  Ahead of his March 20 22 trip to Havana  the stage is set for a further easing of trade restrictions and a string of business announcements from the hotel and telecommunications industries and possibly even Major League Baseball   The administration wants to do as much as it can unilaterally before the clock runs out   said a person who has been briefed on Obama s strategy  What remains to be seen  however  is whether Obama can prod Cuba s prickly Communist government to reciprocate at least with modest economic reforms that would help ensure his policy sticks  Cuba s leaders have been slow to loosen their grip on the island s state run economy  That plus strict limits that remain under the U S  economic embargo against Cuba has made many American firms wary  Obama s critics accuse him of giving up too much in return for too little from Cuban President Raul Castro and now taking a premature  victory lap   But administration officials says deeper U S  engagement should not be contingent on concessions from the former Cold War foe  such as improving its human rights record  Obama and his advisers insist that his outreach to Havana has a better chance of sowing the seeds of eventual change than what they see as a failed U S  policy of isolation pursued for more than half a century   This is not a matter of providing concessions   Obama told CNN en Espanol   This is a matter of us engaging directly with the Cuban people   Obama s visit    the first by a U S  president in 88 years   is meant to showcase that approach  But it is also a gamble for a U S  leader whose strategy of engaging adversaries has had mixed results  Locking in his Cuba opening would make it a major piece of his legacy       JUMP START Obama has relied on executive powers to jump start the normalization of ties given continued resistance in Congress to lifting the long standing U S  embargo  His challenge is to advance the process to the point that no successor could unravel it  Cuba has not figured heavily in the 2016 presidential race but it could emerge  especially in Florida  a swing state and home to the largest Cuban American community  For decades  Cuban Americans were broadly opposed to any rapprochement but a younger generation has warmed to Obama s policy shift  Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have pledged to stick with Obama s opening to Cuba if elected  Republican frontrunner Donald Trump said last week the old policy needed to be changed but he would renegotiate with Cuba for a better deal  His challengers  Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio  both Cuban Americans  said they would reverse Obama s approach altogether  Despite that  Obama told CNN en Espanol he believes Congress will remove the embargo in the next administration  whether Democrat or a Republican   though he acknowledged there were not yet enough votes  It would be hard for many Republicans to join any effort to overturn Obama s measures if the White House succeeds in green lighting enough corporate projects in Cuba  congressional aides said  AT T Inc  NYSE T   Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide Inc and Marriott International Inc are expected to sign deals around the time of Obama s visit      Most companies remain cautious  however  because of Cuba s dual currency system  rigid labor market and opaque legal system   There are still some frustrations   said James Williams  president of Engage Cuba  a pro trade lobbying group   But they are not insurmountable   Some of those concerns may be eased if Washington lifts restrictions on using dollars in Cuba trade transactions  a move that one source said could come before Obama s trip  U S  airlines have already rushed to apply for routes to the island  and new travel rules set to be announced this week are expected to make it easier for more Americans to travel to Cuba independently rather than in group tours  That in turn could boost public support for normal relations  Ben Rhodes  an Obama adviser who helped secure the breakthrough with Cuba in December 2014  said the administration has told Cuban leaders the impact of U S  regulatory changes will be limited unless they do more to reform their economy  U S  officials will pay close attention to Cuba s Communist Party Congress  set to convene in April for the first time since 2011   Still  they acknowledge that the prospects remain dim for influencing democratic reform  even though Obama plans to meet dissidents in Havana   We don t view our steps as the types of things that would cause the Cuban government to change their political system   Rhodes told Reuters  Communist Party newspaper Granma last week said Cuba would not renounce its  revolutionary and anti imperialist ideals   Some of Obama s critics say the visit itself is validation of dictatorial rule

The Spurs reeled off a 9 2 run on the strength of a 3 point play by Leonard and 3 pointers from Diaw and Patty Mills to eventually forge a 57 54 lead at halftime  Any suspense created by Sacramento s uprising in the second quarter was quickly dispelled by San Antonio s play in the first five minutes of the third quarter when they outscored the Kings 12 0 and built a 69 54 lead   Our offense got flat and turnovers killed us   Sacramento coach George Karl said   It almost seemed like we weren t ready to play for the first four or five minutes of the third quarter  San Antonio tries to hit you pretty hard in the third quarter and they did it to us tonight  They just don t make mistakes  It s a team of a bunch of revolving pieces that work great together  ",2016-03-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/ginobili's-return-sparks-spurs-to-latest-win-388201,388201

221344,442860,T,World stocks heat up as Bank of Japan goes sub zero,news,"By Jemima Kelly
LONDON  Reuters    World shares jumped and the yen slumped on Friday after the Bank of Japan took one of its main interest rates into negative territory  its boldest step yet to re inflate the economy 
The yield on Japanese benchmark government bonds plunged to record lows  after the Bank of Japan said it would charge 0 1 percent for excess reserves and may cut rates further if necessary  an aggressive policy pioneered by the European Central Bank 
Most investors had believed Japan s policymakers were too cautious to ever adopt such a radical measure  The dollar surged in response  rising about three yen to an almost six week high of 121 495   By 1230 GMT  7 30 a m  ET  it was up 1 8 percent at 120 97 
 We re only one month into the year and two of the major central banks have already surprised markets   said J P  Morgan Asset Management s fixed income CIO in London  Nick Gartside   The ECB has signaled more policy action in March and the BOJ has moved to negative interest rates  a policy previously thought of as unthinkable  
European shares tracked Asian stock markets higher  with the pan European FTSEurofirst 300  FTEU3  index up 0 9 percent  having fallen 1 7 percent on Thursday  Wall Street was expected to open with similar gains   ESc1 
The MSCI world equity index  MIWD00000PUS   which tracks shares in 45 countries  rose half a percent  For the month  though  the index is down 7 5 percent   its steepest fall in almost four years 
 It has become clear that stock markets cannot stand on their own feet   said KBC senior economist Koen De Leus  in Brussels   As long as the economy is shaky and the world is burdened with high debt  central banks and their money printing machines are a necessary evil to keep up the markets  
The plunge in Japanese bond yields encouraged other major bond markets  Germany s 10 year Bund yield fell four basis points to a nine month low at 0 29 percent   on track for the biggest monthly decline in two years 
Two year German bond yields touched a record low of minus 0 471 percent  The yield on 10 year U S  Treasuries fell 4 basis points to 1 95 percent  
The dollar was up 0 6 percent against a basket of currencies at 99 174  DXY   though still down slightly on the week 
OIL GAINS
The promise of extra global stimulus boosted oil prices  which had already risen for three sessions on talk of a possible deal to curb excess supply   O R 
U S  crude  CLc1  added about 1 2 percent to  33 61 per barrel and Brent futures  LCOc1  also gained 1 2 percent to  34 28  That put oil on track for a second weekly gain  though volatility has climbed to its highest since 2009 as traders try to price in the uncertainty around supply cuts 
Earlier  Japan s Nikkei share index  N225  whipsawed on the BOJ announcement before ending up 2 8 percent  to mark a 3 3 percent weekly gain   T 
The central bank s move gave a lift to stocks across the region  even though economists at HSBC and elsewhere doubted it would do much for Japan s real economy or inflation 
 We do not think negative rates are a game changer   said Commerzbank  DE CBKG  strategist Esther Reichelt  in Frankfurt   Pressure on the BoJ will mount to do even more in coming months to attain their inflation target  
MSCI s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan  MIAPJ0000PUS  added 1 8 percent  up 2 7 percent for the week  
The buying spread to U S  debt markets as investors wagered the BOJ decision and a stronger dollar would make it even harder for the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times this year  as originally envisioned by its policy board 
Fed fund futures  0 FF   rose to imply a rate of 51 basis points by year end  compared with 90 basis points a month ago  Futures for U S  10 year bonds  0 TZY   rose 5 ticks 

 With other central banks easing more  pushing their currencies weaker against the U S  dollar     the Federal Reserve will struggle to deliver meaningful rate hikes   said J P  Morgan s Gartside ",2016-01-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/world-stocks-heat-up-as-bank-of-japan-goes-sub-zero-382297,382297

LONDON  Reuters    World shares and risk assets rallied and the dollar backed off highs on Thursday  after the Federal Reserve flagged a rate hike next month  but also an intention to take things slow and steady after that 
The pick up in risk sentiment combined with the dip in the dollar  DXY  gave commodities a reprieve from recent selling  with oil and gold inching higher 
European stocks also opened strongly with the FTSEurofirst 300  FTEU3  pushed to a three month high by more than 1 percent gains in London  FTSE   Frankfurt  GDAXI  and Paris  FCHI   after Japan s Nikkei  N225  had hit a similar peak in Asia   T 
Minutes of the Fed s last policy meeting showed most members were ready to sanction the bank s first rise in rates in almost a decade in December as long as further moves then depended on the economy continuing to perform well 
 We have had an interesting FOMC minutes and risk assets have rallied across the board with the dollar weaker and EM leading the way   said Alvin Tax an FX strategist at  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  in London 
 That is the success of the Fed really  We expect they will hike in December but then proceed slowly after that and that has soothed markets  
Leaps across Asia meant MSCI s benchmark emerging market share index  MSCIEF  was on course for its best day in a month and the 45 country All World equivalent was up for a fourth straight day

221359,442875,T,Mexico ramps up surveillance to fight crime  but controls lax,news,"By Joanna Zuckerman Bernstein and Christine Murray MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Government surveillance requests are gathering pace in Mexico  raising concerns about lack of oversight in a country plagued by corruption and collusion between security forces and criminal gangs   Last year  Mexican mobile operators fielded more than 55 000 requests from authorities for information on citizens  calls  messages  and location data  nearly 25 percent higher than in 2013  according to industry figures obtained by Reuters   Mexico s government has been mired in a decade long war against drug cartels and has used surveillance to fight their trafficking  extortion and kidnapping operations  However  corruption is a daily battle in Mexico  Mobile phone companies and privacy activists worry the system is full of holes and that a new telecoms law risks giving the wrong people the right to ask for sensitive personal information   There s no real control of who can request it   said Fernando Belaunzaran  a politician running for leader of the center left Party of the Democratic Revolution  PRD    You ve got corruption  and the police are infiltrated by organized crime     Just who is getting their hands on this information   Edward Snowden s leak of U S  National Security Agency documents in 2013 stoked debate about surveillance globally  and particularly how much power governments should have to snoop on their citizens and how they should be held accountable  President Enrique Pena Nieto has described corruption as a cultural problem in Mexico  and the jailbreak of notorious drug lord Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman in July highlighted the problem of collusion with crime bosses  Prison officials and members of Mexico s intelligence agency Cisen have been charged over the escape  Mexican federal and state agencies also spent more on eavesdropping software from Italian company Hacking Team than any other country last year  documents leaked online show  Hacking Team s main product enables governments to bypass encryption to snoop on targets  The industry figures will be published in an annual report by Consejo Ciudadano in Mexico City  a citizens  safety group  and industry body Anatel  which represents telecom firms America Movil   Telefonica   MC TEF  SA and AT T Inc  N T    They reported a 12 percent rise in 2013  A request can contain multiple phone numbers  LACK OF OVERSIGHT  U S  and Brazilian laws require court approval for access to more kinds of private data than Mexico does  Only 3 percent of Mexico requests last year were reviewed by a judge  according to federal court data  while approval of the rest was left to mobile companies   Nobody watches the watchman   said Juan Pablo Adame  a former congressman in the conservative opposition National Action Party  PAN   who backs more controls on surveillance  Telephone companies can be punished by the regulator for not handing over information  leaving them little incentive to fight costly battles over the matter   People are not notified after the government snoops on them  nor can they find out  making it almost impossible to bring a case to court  Oversight could be strengthened with a new national criminal procedure code  which specifies that prosecutors need judge approval for metadata  but it is yet to be fully implemented  In the United States  the government reports how many people were arrested and convicted as a result of wiretaps used in criminal investigations  In Mexico  no such report exists   Pena Nieto s government declined to answer specific questions about surveillance policies   The president s office has no comment on this issue  among other reasons because  supposing that your data are corroborated and the inferences correct  this is a national security issue   spokesman Paulo Carreno said in response to questions   The attorney general s office did not respond to questions about why the number of requests has risen although the deputy attorney general for human rights  Eber Betanzos  said the government conducts surveillance responsibly and within the law   Cisen said surveillance findings are classified and the Federal Police declined to comment   WORRIES OVER NEW TELECOMS LAW The telecommunications reform passed last year could make it even easier for the government to snoop  critics say  Telefonica  AT T s Nextel  and America Movil  complained to the regulator that the law is too vague on which officials are allowed to ask for call  message and location data   The number of authorities that can ask for information should be limited  for security and legal certainty   Telefonica said in a public consultation posted on the regulator s website  AT T said it complies with the government when requests are made in accordance with the law  Since the new law  America Movil   which has around 70 percent of Mexico s mobile market   has received information requests from authorities that had never previously asked  spokeswoman Paula Garcia said   They include Mexico s national electoral institute  INE  and the finance ministry s financial crimes investigation unit  UIF   she said  Neither INE or UIF responded to requests for comment  Mexico s telecoms regulator  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT  is set to publish the security bylaws soon  after nearly a year of debate  Paulina Martinez  general counsel for the IFT  said that the new legislation did not broaden surveillance powers  Javier Lozano  a PAN senator who helped draft the law  agreed  though he stressed that a range of officials need the ability to eavesdrop

Bottom Line
AT T was in talks to acquire Straight Path Communications   NYSE T   to expand into the 5G space  However  Straight Path announced yesterday that it is evaluating a superior offer from another multi national telecom giant to acquire 100  of the company  Moreover  AT T is yet to receive regulatory approval for its  85 billion acquisition of Time Warner   NYSE TWX     This may put a brake on its plans considering the increased merger activity taking place in the telecom industry  For the time being  we believe it is best to be on the sidelines  read

221395,442911,T,Does AT T  T  Make For A Suitable Value Pick Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AT T  Inc    NYSE T   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AT T has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 19  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 30 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts AT T s current PE slightly below its median over the past five years  which stands at 14 21   This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its own historical levels and thus it could be suitable entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Wireless National industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 24  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  In fact  the stock has historically always been undervalued than its peers since the beginning of 2014 We should also point out that AT T has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 69   which is lower than the current figure  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for AT T stock in the near term too PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AT T has a P S ratio of about 1 52  This is higher than the Zacks categorized Wireless National industry average  which comes in at 1 45 right now However  AT T has historically always been relatively undervalued compared to the broader market  in terms of the PS metric  over the observed term  Currently its PS compares much favorably with the S P 500 s level of 3 08 Notably  T is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AT T currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AT T a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P B ratio  used to compare a stock s market value to its book value  stands at 2 01  lower than the industry average of 2 23  Clearly  T is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though AT T might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives T a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward revisions and seven downward revisions in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained constant over the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AT T Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAT T is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 27  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past three years  the Zacks Wireless National industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website  our best recommendations and most in depth research are not available to the

221410,442926,T,Feds Slap Sprint With Cramming Suit,news,"By   

For a decade  Sprint  NYSE S  opened the gates to customers  mobile phone accounts  allowed third parties to ring up millions of dollars per year in unauthorized charges  and took a hefty cut of the revenue  charges a lawsuit filed in federal court by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
The financial regulator s announcement Wednesday came on the heels of media reports that the Federal Communications Commission will fine Sprint for unauthorized billing practices  commonly known as  cramming   In October  the FCC reached a  105 million settlement with AT T  NYSE T  over  cramming  allegations    the largest enforcement action in the agency s history  The Federal Trade Commission filed suit concerning similar allegations against T Mobile in July 
But Wednesday s action is the first lawsuit against a telecommunications company from the CFPB  which has signaled growing interest in how mobile banking affects consumers  The lawsuit targets Sprint as a payments processor  and seeks an unspecified amount of consumer restitution and civil fines under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010  the law that created the bureau in the wake of the financial crisis 
During a conference call with reporters  CFPB officials declined to comment on how far their enforcement authority over  payment processors  would extend to other products  such as Apple Pay  Yet while Deputy Enforcement Director Jeffrey Ehrlich said he  couldn t speak to other products that we haven t investigated   he repeatedly emphasized the bureau s interest in  mobile  
 If a company is processing payments over a mobile network  it s something the bureau clearly has jurisdiction over   Ehrlich said 
 When we use our wireless accounts to make purchases  our carriers  such as Sprint  act as payment processors   CFPB Director Richard Cordray stated in prepared remarks   They place the charges for those purchases on our wireless bills instead of on a credit card or other form of payment  
The filing accuses Sprint of letting third parties bill customers for products they didn t know about  or consent to  from 2004 through 2013  These products  or  premium short messaging services   the suit says  included goods like ringtones  digital wallpaper  and text messages that delivered  flirting tips  horoscopes and other digital content   Each product generated charges that ranged from one time fees of 99 cents  to recurring subscriptions of about  9 99 a month  and channeled  hundreds of millions of dollars  to Sprint  according to the lawsuit 
The practice thrived because Sprint  automatically  enrolled customers in its third party billing system  and because the company didn t keep an eye on the merchants that were allowed to access that system  the CFPB alleges 
In response to the lawsuit  a spokeswoman for Sprint  Stephanie Vinge Walsh  issued the following statement   We are disappointed that the CFPB has decided to target Sprint on this issue  and we strongly disagree with its characterization of our business practices  Sprint took considerable steps to protect wireless customers from unauthorized third party billing and is an industry leader in proactively preventing unauthorized charges  
Walsh added that the company has consistently  encouraged any customers who think they may have incurred an unauthorized third party charge on their phone bill to contact Sprint to resolve the issue

221417,442933,T,Japan slips into surprise recession  paves way for tax delay  snap poll,news,"By Leika Kihara and Linda Sieg TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s economy unexpectedly slipped into recession in the third quarter  setting the stage for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to delay an unpopular sales tax hike and call a snap election two years before he had to go to the polls 
The recession comes nearly two years after Abe returned to power promising to revive the economy with his  Abenomics  mix of massive monetary stimulus  spending and reforms  and is unwelcome news for an already shaky global economy 
Gross domestic product  GDP  shrank by an annualized 1 6 percent in July September  after plunging 7 3 percent in the second quarter following a rise in the national sales tax  which clobbered consumer spending 
The world s third largest economy had been forecast to rebound by 2 1 percent  but consumption and exports remained weak  saddling companies with huge inventories to work off 
Abe had said he would look at the data when deciding whether to press ahead with a second increase in the sales tax to 10 percent in October next year  as part of a plan to curb Japan s huge public debt  the worst among advanced nations 
Media have said Abe could announce his decision to delay the hike for 18 months as early as Tuesday and state his intention to call an election for parliament s lower house  Ruling party lawmakers expect the poll to be held on Dec  14 
An adviser to Abe termed the economic slide  shocking   and urged the government to take steps to support the economy 
 This is absolutely not a situation in which we should be debating an increase in the consumption tax   Etsuro Honda  a University of Shizuoka professor and a prominent outside architect of Abe s reflationary policies  told Reuters 
Economy Minister Akira Amari said some economic stimulus was likely  but added it would be hard to craft an exceptionally big package because of the need for fiscal discipline 
No election for the lower house need be held until late 2016  but political insiders say Abe wants to lock in his mandate while his ratings are relatively robust  Next year he is expected to push ahead with unpopular policies such as restarting reactors that went off line after the Fukushima nuclear crisis and a shift away from Japan s post war pacifism 
Facing a divided and weak opposition  Abe s Liberal Democratic Party  LDP  is expected to keep its majority in the lower house  but it could lose some seats 
CONSUMPTION STAGNANT
A senior LDP lawmaker said he expected the premier to call a snap poll  arguing that his  Abenomics  strategy to reenergize the economy was working but needed more time 
 The prime minister feels strongly that he wants to make certain of the economic trend so I think he will put off the sales tax rise from next October   the lawmaker told Reuters 
But he added it was vital to recommit to a firm date for the rise in the levy  or risk upsetting investors worried about Japan s debt  already more than twice the size of its economy 
Even before the GDP announcement  Abe appeared to suggest he was leaning towards a tax hike delay  telling reporters that raising the tax rate would be meaningless if deflation returned 
The yen USD JPY slipped on the poor GDP reading  with the dollar briefly pushing to a seven year high above 117 yen  The Nikkei stock average  N225  fell 3 percent   T 
Sluggish growth and easing price pressures due to sliding global oil prices prompted the Bank of Japan to unexpectedly expand its massive monetary stimulus last month 
Abe inherited the sales tax plan when he took power in December 2012  The LDP  its smaller ally and the then ruling Democratic Party enacted the legislation requiring the tax to be raised unless economic conditions were judged too weak 
The GDP data showed the April hike to 8 percent from 5 percent had made it harder than anticipated for the public to shake off their deflationary mindset  Amari said  although he noted one bright spot in strong corporate profits 
On a quarterly basis  the economy shrank 0 4 percent in the third quarter after a revised 1 9 percent decrease in April June  Economists had expected growth of 0 5 percent 
Private consumption  accounting for about 60 percent of the economy  rose 0 4 percent from the previous quarter  half as much as expected  Wage growth has not kept pace with price rises  so a key mechanism of Abenomics is not working yet 

Some economists  however  said growth could improve in the October December quarter

221419,442935,T,AT T says fiber spending pause affects only new commitments,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    AT T Inc sought to clarify to U S  regulators its plans to pause investments in high speed Internet connections until  net neutrality  rules are settled  saying in a letter on Wednesday that the plans related to new and not existing commitments 
The Federal Communications Commission earlier this month pressed the company to explain its plans to stop investing in high speed Internet connections in 100 cities until the agency sorts out new  net neutrality  rules for how Internet service providers manage web traffic on their networks 
AT T s announcement of a planned pause in fiber investments came in response to President Barack Obama s call for stricter rules through regulations that would treat Internet providers more like public utilities 
The FCC pressed AT T to specify how its response would play into the company s planned  48 5 billion merger with satellite operator DirecTV  which regulators are reviewing  As part of the merger proposal  AT T agreed to provide high speed fiber Internet to 2 million homes 
In the letter dated Nov  25 and released on Wednesday  AT T said it did not plan to limit those investments or other existing commitments but would pause on further expansions because of the uncertainty about new rules 
 To be clear  AT T has not stated that the president s proposal would render all of these locations unprofitable  Rather  AT T simply cannot evaluate additional investment beyond its existing commitments until the regulatory treatment of broadband service is clarified   Robert Quinn  AT T s senior federal regulatory vice president  wrote in the letter 
An AT T spokesman said the company would pause all investments outside of the commitments made in connection with the DirecTV merger  including potential new customer locations beyond the company s initial expansion plan for 25 metropolitan areas as well as other markets  He said the pause affected millions of potential customer locations

In the second quarter of 2016  Scripps Networks posted a positive earnings surprise of 6 76   In fact  the company boasts an impressive history with respect to earnings  Scripps Networks outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average earnings beat of 21 34  
However  things do not look rosy for this Cincinnati  OH based company in the third quarter  The negative sentiment surrounding the stock ahead of its third quarter earnings release can be gauged by the 9 7  decrease in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last three months 
Our quantitative model too does not hint at an earnings beat in the third quarter as it lacks the perfect combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  The  for Scripps Networks is  1 08   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 94 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 93 cents per share

Factors Likely at Play
We expect the company s third quarter results to be hurt by headwinds like foreign exchange woes and escalating costs  We note that Scripps Networks reported lower than expected revenues in the second quarter  The unfavorable trend is expected to continue in the third quarter as well with the company s top line declining in spite of strong advertising revenues 
Also  the company s high debt levels raise concerns  The debt to capitalization ratio at the end of the second quarter stood at a high 0 57 
However  the company s expansion efforts are impressive  In keeping with this  Scripps Networks inked a deal with AT T   NYSE T   in the third quarter  The recent deal with Tribune Media Company   NYSE T   is also encouraging  Even though positive with Scripps Networks  growth by acquisition strategy  we note that that the strategy has integration risks attached to it 
A Stock to Consider
While an earnings beat looks uncertain for Scripps Networks  here is a stock in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that it has the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
Nexstar Broadcasting Group   NYSE T   is scheduled to report third quarter earnings on Nov 8  It has an earnings ESP of  3 49  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see

221421,442937,T,Dealmakers  Trump  Hillary And Mergers,opinion,"Intralinks  a firm created 20 years ago to enable  high stakes transactions and business collaborations   has surveyed global dealmakers on the upcoming U S  presidential election and on how it may affect the economic and regulatory environment for mergers and acquisitions 
The gist of it is  in a database of 1 600 M A professionals worldwide  56  believe that a hypothetical Donald Trump presidency would have a negative impact on the M A space 
On the other hand  the majority view is that a Hillary Clinton presidency would have no impact on M A activity at all  A healthy 57  say so  Another 26  say that a Clinton presidency will have a positive impact 
A blog entry by Philip Whitchelo  Intralinks  Vice President of Strategy and Product Marketing  says that the 26  number is  perhaps unsurprising  
Merger policy only belatedly became an explicit issue in the campaign  Both campaigns have reacted  negatively in each case  to the planned merger of AT T  NYSE T  with Time Warner  NYSE TWX   which amounts to the integration of data pipes with data content providers  Still  there is plenty of room for speculation about which hypothetical administration will do what in this area 
Straws In The Wind 
There are a lot of straws in the wind that may be useful in such speculation  and the straws seem to be blowing in different directions  so no specific conclusion about the impact of a Clinton victory in particular should be altogether surprising  One common way to look at it involves a presumption that the next Clinton presidency might be more or less like the last Clinton presidency in these matters  There was certainly no bias against mergers during the William Jefferson Clinton years  and in some markets there may have been a bias in favor of concentration  which was seen as rationalizing behavior 
In the year 2000  the last year of Bill Clinton s presidency  a time when everyone on the Federal Trade Commission was a Clinton appointee   the FTC challenged only 1 7  of the prospective mergers of which it was informed  For purposes of comparison  in 1988  the last year of Ronald Reagan s presidency  the FTC had challenged 1 4   This was not a significant swing in the direction of merger blockage 
Indeed  the highest percentage of FTC challenges in recent history occurred in 1990  when the FTC brought actions against 2 7   This of course was the middle of the administration of George H W  Bush 
Look at absolute numbers rather than percentages  there were 9 566 mergers in the U S  in 2000  There had been only 2 258 in 1988  That discrepancy represents changes that have nothing to do with the party or the individual in the White House but   that is after all the point  All this tends to support the 83  of the Intralinks sample who said either that a new Clinton presidency would not be a negative or that it would be a positive for the M A space  Either view is  indeed  unsurprising 
The Intralinks survey also disclosed some rather predictable regional differences as to the most important causes of declines and falls in merger activity  In North America  respondents thought that the election would be the single highest impact event in the next six months  But in Latin America  deal makers are focused on monetary policy  In the Asia Pacific region  they are all looking toward China  And in EMEA  they focus on the issue of the implementation of Great Britain s exit from the European Union 
Speaking Of Brexit And EMEA
Forecasters  cited by Intralinks itself in earlier publications  have been predicting a substantial slowdown in economic growth in the United Kingdom lasting through 2017  including declines in business investment  home prices  and consumer spending  This might not be the best of times for merger activity there  although the extent of the consequences for the rest of EMEA is unclear 
In the second quarter of 2016  early stage deal activity in EMEA as a whole grew by 15 7   Intralinks has said that it is  pleasantly surprised  by this  given all the challenges in the vast region 
Germany is the engine here  It showed positive growth in early stage M A activity of 9  in the second quarter  and Intralinks has credited the  steady hand  of Chancellor Merkel ",2016-11-04,AllAboutAlpha,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/dealmakers:-trump,-hillary,-and-mergers-200162743",200162743

221425,442941,T,Don t Wait For A Recession To Sell Stocks,opinion,"Only Sell Stocks in Recessions 
We were recently made aware of an interview at Bloomberg  in which Tony Dwyer of Cannacord and Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research were quizzed on the recently announced utterly bizarre AT T  NYSE T    Time Warner Inc  NYSE TWX  merger  We were actually quite surprised that AT T wanted to buy the giant media turkey  Prior to the offer  TWX still traded 50  below the high it had reached 17 years ago 

The merger of AT T and TWX simply doesn t appear to make much sense  It certainly is a symptom of loose monetary policy though 
The merger as such is actually not what we want to discuss though  Rather  it is a remark of Mr  Dwyer s regarding the stock market in general and what the recent merger mania is signaling  He makes two major points in the course of the conversation  For one thing  he notes that the merger  along with many other mergers that have recently been announced  is the result of the extremely easy availability of credit 
This is undoubtedly true and he rightly avers that all of this will end badly  At the same time he believes though that it represents a great opportunity for investors currently   a point he thinks is not receiving the attention it deserves  This in turn is based on his assertion that one should never sell stocks  even if the market misbehaves by going down a bit  as long as there is no recession 
You can watch a video of the interview  
Tony Dwyer and Brian Wieser opine on the T TWX merger  Dwyer s remark on when to sell or not sell stocks is of particular interest to us 
The Problem with Predictions
The problem with this is of course that by the time everybody realizes that a recession is actually unfolding  the stock market is usually already half way to making its bear market lows  Mainstream economists and central planning bureaucrats are usually particularly clueless when it comes to forecasting recessions  They don t even recognize them when they are staring them into the face 
As an example  shortly before the market crashed in 2008  nearly everybody denied that a recession might already be in train or might be imminent  The ECB actually hiked its main refinancing rate in the summer of 2008  It is fair to say that no one at the ECB had even the foggiest idea that an economic contraction was already underway 

The ECB hiked its main refinancing rate in the summer of 2008  By this time  the recession was approximately 8 months old 
Later  NBER backdated the beginning of the recession to November of 2007  So the argument that one should not sell in the absence of a recession is really not sensible  since it is predicated on the notion that 1  people will actually be able to recognize that there is a recession  and 2  will then act on this recognition in a timely manner in the stock market 
Obviously  that is not how things usually work out  One must not only be able to successfully predict the advent of a downturn  but also act on this forecast before too many other market participants decide to do so  This is obviously not easy  but waiting for NBER or some other authority to confirm a recession will definitely be useless from a timing perspective 
It is of course true that stock market declines very often go hand in hand with recessions  Historically the stock market often tends to lead the economy in economic downturns  but not always  The lead times are quite variable and sometimes very painful market declines can occur without a recession  such as in 1987  
In order to successfully estimate likely long term market returns one doesn t really need to forecast the timing of recessions anyway   one mainly needs to consider valuations  price earnings  price sales  Q ratio  etc   

In the last recession the stock market s lead time was very short   but the recession was only officially recognized after it had been underway for almost a year already 
In the short to medium term the market can obviously deviate considerably from what valuations suggest about its long term outlook  and traders focused on shorter time frames are usually better served by employing technical analysis  or even better  a mixture of fundamental and technical analysis 
Lastly  investors cannot possibly escape the losses generated by a market decline collectively  Consider someone who is timing the market perfectly and is selling right at the top  Someone else has to buy the shares he is selling  so the buyer will then make the losses the seller manages to avoid  This continues down the line with every transaction made while the bear market lasts 
Conclusion
Investors as a group cannot be saved from suffering the losses a bear market inflicts  only the distribution of these losses is open to question  Per experience  only very few investors will actually be able to sidestep a bear market or even manage to profit from it 
This small group of investors will mainly do so by successfully predicting or recognizing a downturn that the vast majority of market observers will swear is nowhere near  In short  one has to adopt what will appear as a contrarian position and do so in a timely fashion  while this is a tall order  those who wait for official confirmation of a recession will have waited too long 
An alternative to making correct forecasts is to use a trailing stop or some other type of systematic approach to time exit and entry into the market  To simply hold on in the face of excessive valuations and excessive credit growth  because there is no recession  seems a very risky strategy by comparison ",2016-11-01,Pater Tenebrarum,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/recessions,-predictions-and-the-stock-market-200161888",200161888

221428,442944,T,AT T sues Cox Communications for patent infringement,news,"By Andrew Chung  Reuters    AT T  N T  is suing Cox Communications for infringing eight patents dealing with network quality after the regional cable provider ignored its complaints about the issue and made  billions  off of the technology  according to a new lawsuit 
In the suit filed Friday in Delaware federal court against Cox and more than 30 of its regional units  AT T said that Cox had been warned about the claims of patent infringement as far back as 2009  It said Cox delayed negotiations and refused to take a license for the technologies 
AT T claims the patents were infringed in Cox s use and sale of digital video recorders  set top boxes  Internet and telephone systems  according to the lawsuit 
The patents relate to methods for improving the quality and reducing the costs of telecommunications services  the suit said 
AT T said in the suit that Cox was also inducing its employees and subscribers to infringe 
  Cox  generates billions of dollars in revenue every year through its use of AT T s technologies   the telecommunications giant said  adding that the lawsuit is necessary to prove AT T is owed royalty payments for the alleged unauthorized use of its inventions 
A representative from Cox said the company just learned of the case and had no comment  Attorneys for AT T also could not immediately be reached 
AT T is asking the court to declare Cox s infringement  wilful and deliberate  and seeks unspecified damages  It also wants the court to order Cox to pay a  compulsory  ongoing  royalty to AT T 

The case is AT T Intellectual Property I  LP  and AT T Intellectual Property II  LP  v  Cox Communications et al  No  14 cv 01106

221429,442945,T,Telefonica trials to take AT T home security technology overseas,news,"By Alina Selyukh  Reuters    AT T Inc  N T  on Monday said Spain s Telefonica SA  MC TEF  will license its home security technology for limited trials in Europe as the U S  carrier hopes it has found a new way to profit from its nascent connected home business 
Telefonica will offer European customers a version of Digital Life  AT T s home monitoring and automation system  for three to six months before evaluating results of the trial  said Steven Bartholomew  a Telefonica spokesman 
AT T  which released the Digital Life platform in the United States in spring 2013  is in talks with numerous other potential global partners about similar licensing agreements  said AT T Mobility CEO Glenn Lurie 
 We spent a lot of money building the platform     This is just another way to take those same assets and monetize them  and not just in the U S   but globally   Lurie said in an interview 
 International  licensing  we think is one of the largest revenue opportunities on top of the core business in the U S    he said  adding that the company is also looking to expand its connectivity system to small businesses and healthcare 
AT T s Digital Life service allows consumers to connect to the Internet various home appliances and processes   such as lights  thermostats  smoke detectors  security cameras or locks   so they can be monitored or controlled remotely 
AT T has said it expected to eventually grow Digital Life into a  1 billion annual revenue stream  but the company has not disclosed the profitability of the platform so far 
Lurie said AT T could license Digital Life to foreign partners either in parts  such as software only  or in its entirety 
Neither company s representative elaborated on the specific content of their particular licensing agreement or the terms of the licensing  which are individually negotiated and rarely disclosed  Typically such deals involve up front and per customer payments  among other fees 
 We are not able to fully disclose how much of the platform we are going to use   Telefonica s Bartholomew said in an email  But he highlighted some of the core elements  such as the digital user experience and the remote management system  as expected to provide consumers  with a unique and strong user experience  
Bartholomew said the Telefonica branded service will be a version of AT T s product adapted to the European market  He also said it was too soon to comment on where exactly the trials will take place 
Telefonica had approached AT T about licensing its Digital Life platform after the U S  wireless carrier showcased it at Mobile World Congress  the international consumer electronics show  Lurie said 

 We ve looked at platforms from a large number of vendors   we believe the AT T Digital Life platform to be best in class   said Bartholomew   It has been successfully proven in the U S  and will accelerate our time to market in this new product category

221438,442954,T,AT T Agrees To Buy DirecTV For  48 5 Billion,news,"By    AT T Inc  NYSE T  agreed to buy DirecTV  NASDAQ DTV  for  48 5 billion on Sunday  finalizing merger rumors that have been circling since last month  AT T would pay DirecTV shareholders  95 per share in the deal 
The acquisition would make DirecTV a subsidiary of AT T  and would bring DirecTV s 20 million subscribers under AT T s umbrella  Experts say AT T wants
DirecTV s pay TV services so it can bundle them better for its existing customers and expand its TV services into states where it does not yet offer its fiber optic U Verse broadband phone TV service 
The deal would make AT T worth more than  200 billion and the buy is worth  67 billion including debt  according to the New York Times 

AT T closed at  36 74 and DirecTV closed at  86 18 on Friday  DirecTV shares have increased by 12 percent since rumors about the AT T deal first emerged in April 
If federal regulators allow the deal to go through  it would be  3 5 billion larger than Comcast s proposed  45 billion deal to buy Time Warner Cable  DirecTV is the second largest pay TV service behind Comcast 
The deal will go to FCC regulators to decide whether to allow the merger to occur  The FCC is currently debating the Comcast Time Warner deal  which critics argue breaks anti trust laws ",2014-05-19,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/at-t-agrees-to-buy-directv-for-$48.5-billion-284943,284943
221439,442955,T,After 24 Years Of Partnership  AT T And Am rica M vil Part Ways,news,"By  MEXICO CITY    The proposed megadeal by AT T Inc  NYSE T  to buy DirecTV  NASDAQ DTV  will shake up the telecommunications market beyond the U S  border  turning Latin America s largest telecom company from a partner into a competitor and roiling a decades long relationship between two of the most powerful moguls in the sector 
The  48 5 billion deal  announced Monday morning after weeks of rumors  includes the sale of AT T s  6 billion stake in Am rica M vil    8 4 percent of the company s shares    to avoid regulatory conflicts  By merging with DirecTV  AT T will not only cut a 24 year partnership with Am rica M vil but end up competing against it in the region  The deal also threatens to disrupt the professional and personal relationship between AT T CEO Randall Stephenson and Am rica M vil s owner  billionaire Carlos Slim 
Though DirecTV s main business is in the U S   the company has significant operations in Latin America  According to Synergy Research Group  at the end of 2013 Am rica M vil had the largest chunk of Latin America s pay television market  with 22 percent of subscribers  DirecTV  with 19 percent  was second 
The two moguls have known each other since the 1990s  when Stephenson worked as a Southwestern Bell Corp  executive in Mexico City  overseeing the company s investment and working directly with Slim  SBC  which bought AT T in 2005  backed Slim s privatization of the formerly state owned Tel fonos de M xico  Telmex  in 1990  now the largest landline and internet provider in Mexico with 80 percent of the market 
During a conference call announcing the deal on Monday morning  Stephenson assured listeners that his relationship with Slim will remain untouched   We created a lot of value for our shareholders   he said   We have changed the welfare of the countries in Latin America  Am rica M vil has invested at a level that s in excess of anyone in that region  
Stephenson also said that he recently visited Slim to discuss with him his plan to buy DirecTV  and reaffirmed his admiration for the Mexican businessman  whom he called   the most inherently brilliant individual that I ve ever worked with  

For all those kind words  AT T had been moving away from Am rica M vil in recent years  In June 2013  the company sold 7 5 percent of the 16 percent of stocks it controlled in Am rica M vil  Slim  currently the world s second richest man with a net worth at  73 billion  has yet to comment on the deal  An Am rica M vil representative declined comment to International Business Times 
DirecTV s Latin American operations have grown 95 percent in subscriptions over the last two years  but they only yield 20 percent of its profit  according to Colombian consultancy firm Portafolio  DirecTV owns 93 percent of Sky Brazil  the country s largest pay television provider  as well as 41 percent of Sky Mexico  which provides service in Mexico  Central America and Dominican Republic 
Slim s current goal is to conquer cable television  as Am rica M vil provides pay TV in 17 countries in Latin America    but not in Mexico  The telecommunications reforms pushed by Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto will put this dream even more out of reach for Slim  since they include anti monopoly provisions and dictate diversification in TV and phone providers  Since Slim controls 80 percent of the phone market  the reforms make it effectively impossible for him to obtain a TV license 
AT T also announced that its designees in Am rica M vil will hand in their resignations immediately  Am rica M vil s website lists two AT T employees in its board ",2014-05-19,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/after-24-years-of-partnership,-at-t-and-américa-móvil-part-ways-285110",285110

221441,442957,T, 50B AT T DirecTV Deal Reported Near,news,"By  NEW YORK LOS ANGELES   AT T Inc  NYSE T   is in active talks to buy satellite TV provider DIRECTV  NASDAQ DTV  and may complete a deal in the next few weeks that could be worth close to  50 billion  two people familiar with the matter said Monday 
The second largest wireless operator is discussing an offer in the low  to mid  90s per share for DirecTV  one of the people said  compared with the company s closing price of  87 16 on Monday 
A bid near  95 per share would value DirecTV at more than  48 billion based on its shares outstanding  and would represent a premium of more than 20 percent to its stock price before news of AT T s interest first emerged on May 1 
The deal price has yet to be finalized and terms could still change  the people said  adding that discussions are continuing  They asked not to be named because the matter is not public 
Other details also have yet to be worked out  such as a break up fee as well as a potential role for DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White  the second person said 
The talks are the latest sign of a rising tide of potential megadeals in the telecoms  cable and satellite TV space  which is being roiled by Comcast Corp  s proposed  45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc  as well as market forces such as the rise of Web based TV and surging mobile Internet usage 
AT T and DirecTV declined to comment  Bloomberg News earlier reported that AT T was offering to pay around  100 per share for DirecTV  whose management team will continue to run the company as a unit of AT T  The Wall Street Journal said a deal could happen in two weeks 
DirecTV shares rose 6 percent to  92 50 in extended trading on Monday 
DirecTV is working with advisers including Goldman Sachs Group to evaluate a possible combination following a recent takeover approach from AT T  Reuters reported last week 
A combination of AT T and DirecTV would create a pay television giant close in size to where Comcast will be if it completes its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable  For that reason  the proposed merger is likely to face a prolonged battle to convince regulators to allow further consolidation in pay TV 
 This is not the first time that AT T and DirecTV have danced around the fire and thought if they could give it a go   said ReconAnalytics analyst Roger Entner 
 They both looked at each other for at least 10 years  Both kind of came to the conclusion that it was in the right environment  It makes a lot of sense to get together  but there was never the right regulatory environment for it  

A Comcast Time Warner Cable merger would call for a counterweight like a combined AT T DirecTV  Entner said  He added that the merger would make sense for DirecTV given the decline of satellite TV 
 They both see the Grim Reaper at the horizon  DirecTV hasn t gone out and bought spectrum  Dish has  so DirecTV needs to find a partner  and AT T is that partner   he said 
Some investors have also speculated about a potential tie up of DirectTV and smaller rival Dish Network Corp 
But Dish Chairman Charlie Egan last week said his company  which attempted to buy DirecTV more than a decade ago  would not make a fresh approach at current prices even though he said such a tie up would create many benefits ",2014-05-13,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/$50b-at-t-directv-deal-reported-near-283755,283755

 By Simon Falush
 LONDON  Oct 23  Reuters    Banks and commodity stocks pushed
Britain s top share index up 1 3 percent by midday on Friday  as
investors shrugged off a shock fall in UK GDP and looked to Wall
Street s open after it made strong gains the previous day 
 By 1112 GMT  the FTSE 100 was 67 41 points higher at
5 274 77  after closing 50 49 points  or 1 percent lower  on
Thursday 
 British third quarter gross domestic product  GDP  shrunk
unexpectedly data showed on Friday  quashing hopes the downturn
is ending and marking the longest recession on record 
 But the UK s blue chip index showed limited reaction  paring
gains slightly before recovering quickly to levels seen before
the data  though the pound fell sharply and European stocks lost
ground 
 The gains were largely driven by commodity stocks whose
exposure is mostly global rather than to the domestic economy 
 Metal prices were firmer  finding support as the dollar
weakened to a 14 month low against the euro 
 Kazakhmys was up 4 8 percent  while Anglo American  Rio
Tinto  Xstrata  Lonmin  and Fresnillo gained 1 9 to 3 5 percent 
 However  the GDP data made investors nervous about whether
the gains could be sustained 
  I think there is definitely a risk that the rally on the
FTSE may have been overdone   said David Jones  chief strategist
at IG Index 
  If there is anything that can put a ceiling on the strength
 in equities  that we have seen over the last couple of months
it is a surprise number like this   Jones said

buoyed by miners and banking stocks  and supported by robust
earnings and economic news from the U S 
 The FTSE 100 closed up 35 21 points  or 0 7 percent at
5 242 57  having touched a 13 month high of 5 299 57 earlier in
the session  It ended 1 percent lower on Thursday 
  We had the rather disappointing GDP figures come in  but I
think traders are taking it that the figures give a better
opportunity for the Bank of England to extend its QE programme  
said Keith Bowman  analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown 
 Britain s economy contracted in the third quarter of this
year  quashing hopes the downturn was ending and instead marking
the longest recession on record 
 But the UK s blue chip index showed limited reaction  paring
gains slightly before recovering quickly to levels seen before
the data  though the pound fell sharply and European

   Savings estimated at 1 3 bln euros a year after 3 years
   Builds on earlier co operation between the two groups
   Could put more pressure on telecom gear vendors
 
  Adds details from press conference  vendors  
 By Leila Abboud 
 PARIS  April 18  Reuters    France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom plan to jointly buy network gear  mobiles and other
information technology to save money  the two groups said on
Monday 
 The project could save about 1 3 billion euros   1 9
billion  annually after three years    a little under 900
million euros for France Telecom and around 400 million for
Deutsche Telekom  they said 
 The venture is an extension of a co operation initiative the
two groups unveiled in February covering areas such as mobile
network sharing in Europe and giving customers wireless Internet
on each other s networks 
 European telecom operators face sluggish growth and tough
price competition and are searching for ways to cut costs to
improve profitability 
 With the advent of smartphones and tablet computers  data
traffic is exploding on networks  requiring steep investments 
  We see significant growth in data and pressure on tariffs 
so our procurement needs to be as efficient as possible   said
Edward Kozel  Deutsche Telekom s director of technology 
 The new venture will begin to renegotiate some 13 billion
euros worth of contracts in the fourth quarter  said France
Telecom executive vice president Olaf Swantee  
 
 NETWORK SAVINGS
 The companies expect the biggest savings to come from
network gear  They also hope to save on the 45 million handsets
they buy a year 
 Supply firms in the firing line include equipment makers
like Alcatel Lucent  Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks 
  It means another headache for the supply industry   said
Paolo Pescatore  analyst at CCS Insight 
 The two companies are already trimming their portfolios to
focus on countries where they have scale  Deutsche Telekom is
selling its T Mobile USA unit to AT T while France Telecom is
reviewing European operations outside France 
 Several analysts on Monday said the JV could rekindle
speculation on an eventual tie up but banking sources told
Reuters recently that such a deal was unlikely 
 France Telecom shares were down 0 8 percent at 15 52 euros 
while Deutsche Telekom s were flat at 11 25 euros by 0906 GMT

 LONDON  Oct 22  Reuters    European shares closed lower on
Thursday  with banks and oil stocks the major losers and
Ericsson falling after disappointing results 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed
down 1 1 percent at 1 014 72 points  The benchmark index is
still up 57 percent from its lifetime low on March 9  but down
38 percent since reaching its mid 2007 peak 
  These markets are due for a bout of consolidation  if
anyone is looking to book some profits this is as good as time
as any   said Mike Lenhoff  strategist at Brewin Dolphin 
  We might get some rough numbers  but if you look at the
whole sweep of newsflow which is being reported then I do not
think anyone can say that what we have seen so far has been
bad   he said 
 Banks featured among the biggest losers  Credit Suisse was
down 3 5 percent after third quarter earnings  with analysts
pointing to a 16 percent fall in investment banking revenues
from the previous quarter and lower pretax profits and margins
at the private banking unit

percent 
 Oil stocks fell as crude slipped back 1 1 percent  BG Group

reported weaker than expected quarterly core earnings and a drop
in sales  hit by the global economic downturn 
 
 CHEMICAL STOCKS FALL

percent lower after sales at the French industrial gases group
fell in the third quarter      Those people who believe that
we re on our way to the moon delude themselves  This is a long

pullback after the rally   said David Buik  senior partner at
BGC Partners 
 Defensive stocks were in favour  with food producer Nestle
up 1 4 percent 
 Vodafone gained 3 4 percent with traders pointing to a
positive read across from results by U S  telecoms peer AT T 
 AT T reported stronger than expected third quarter profit as
the popular Apple iPhone helped it land a record number of new
wireless customers for the period 
 Looking at economic news  the number of U S  workers filing
new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected
last week  data showed  indicating the labour market remains
fragile despite signs of economic revival 
 Meanwhile  U S  home prices fell by a seasonally adjusted
0 3 percent in August  bringing the 12 month decline to 3 6
percent  the Federal Housing Finance Agency said     Across

in mid 2007  and it quickly became a consumer phenomenon thanks
to its unique design and ease of use 
 In its June quarter Apple sold 5 2 million iPhones  This
compares to 268 million phones sold globally by all handset
manufacturers 
 But not everyone has profited 
  We have not found one operator which has created
shareholder value with iPhone   Strand said   When looking at
the numbers we can t see the iPhone effect    a lot of
competitors are actually doing better  
 AT T Inc  iPhone s exclusive carrier in the United States 
said in June its costs to sell the new version of the iPhone
would be similar to those for the original 3G iPhone  which
pressured its profits last year 
 SingTel  Southeast Asia s largest phone firm  has reported
falling profits due to iPhone launches  saying the iPhone alone
hurt operating profit margin by 3 4 percentage points 
 TeliaSonera  the top operator in the Nordics  has launched
the iPhone with large marketing campaigns in all Nordic
countries  but it has not helped it to boost market share or
lift revenues per subscriber  ARPU  according to Strand s
report 
 TeliaSonera s ARPU in Denmark has declined from 212 Danish
crowns to 168 crowns over last two years  twice the pace of ARPU
fall of Sonofon whose ARPU in first quarter was 205 crowns  Its
market share is unchanged from two years ago 
 In Sweden TeliaSonera has lost one percentage point of
market share in two years  and its the lowest ARPU carrier among
top firms  with ARPU falling to 179 Swedish crowns in the first
quarter 
 Operators have heavily subsidised iPhones  hoping to reap
benefits later  but as Apple moves away from exclusive deals
operators are seeing their window of opportunity close  Strand
says 
  Operators are definitely looking for alternatives to the
iPhone that return more value back to the operator   said Frank
Meehan  chief executive of INQ Mobile  a phone making arm of
Hutchison 
 Strand s report says other handset makers are starting to
catch Apple  whose latest model is very similar to original 2007
iPhone  and noted several small operators have started to
successfully court iPhone customers of other operators

share and a merger would remove a competitor   said Michael

technologies and could face regulatory hurdles

 Sprint shares currently trade at 4 2 times estimated 2010

   Sprint buy would come at cost of shareholder payout
   Differing technologies pose significant obstacle
   Deutsche Telekom may be using dealmaking momentum
 
 By Nicola Leske  European Telecoms Correspondent
 FRANKFURT  Sep 14  Reuters    Deutsche Telekom will have to
make an expensive acquisition if it wants to sustain its role in
the cut throat U S  market    even if that means cutting its
dividend 
  Deutsche Telekom will have to decide to stay in the U S 
and grow at the cost of its dividend or to continue to give
value but quit the U S    said Michael Kovacocy  a senior
analyst at research group Metacommunicare 
 Speculation has swirled about a takeover of U S  rival
Sprint Nextel    valued at  11 billion    by the German
incumbent ever since the U S  company announced a huge goodwill
writeoff in February last year 
 Deutsche Telekom  which will not comment on Sprint rumours 
has vowed to keep an attractive dividend policy for shareholders
including the German government  which owns around 30 percent of
the company  and private equity firm Blackstone with just under
5 percent 
 For the past two years its has paid out 0 78 euros per
share  Its dividend yield is at 8 2 percent compared with France
Telecom at 7 7 percent  Telefonica at 6 3 percent and Vodafone
at 5 6 percent  according to Reuters Estimates 
  There is a strong commitment to key shareholders looking to
extract value  but not enough growth at group level to continue
high remuneration   Kovacocy said   There is no real growth
strategy  the emphasis currently is on extraction of value  
 That may be changing  
 
 DEALMAKING MOMENTUM
 Last week  Deutsche Telekom announced it planned to merge
its struggling UK wireless business with France Telecom s Orange
unit  Now all eyes are on the United States  where T Mobile USA
is battling similar problems 
  Sprint is a story that needs to be closely monitored as
Deutsche Telekom s management  in our view  has gained
 dealmaking momentum  from its transaction in the UK
and it might be tempted to address the  other major issue  it
has   UniCredit s Thomas Friedrich said 
 As in the British market  T Mobile USA is the fourth player
in a maturing industry of five large operators  It is
underrepresented in the high end corporate business 
 It would have to beef up spending considerably to catch up
with U S  market leaders Verizon and AT T 
 Currency effects hit company earnings  forcing Deutsche
Telekom to issue a profit warning in April 
 Chief Executive Rene Obermann  who took over in November
2006  has promised to  fix  focus and grow  the company  He has
reduced costs and staff  improved customer service and sold
non core assets 
 But unlike charismatic former chief executive Ron Sommer 
Obermann may not be bold enough for a major acquisition such as
Sprint 
 He has preferred instead to acquire stakes in familiar 
markets such as the Netherlands or Greece or opting for a small
buy such as U S  based wireless outfit SunCom 
 It was under Sommer that Deutsche Telekom bought
Voicestream  an acquisition much critised at the time for being
too expensive but that later turned out to be a clever move 
 
 BE BOLD
 Now  Deutsche Telekom may need to take another bold decision 
 Sprint stock was at its lowest in November  when it hit
 1 38  On Monday morning it rose 11 percent to  4 18 
  A move to buy out Sprint Nextel would remove a major threat
to T Mobile US s customer base    Sprint s  Boost Mobile  
Kovacocy said  but added   Such a large transaction would carry
significant risks  both financial and executional  
 Sprint had  19 6 billion in long term debt at the end of the
second quarter and its network technology is not compatible with
the technology of T Mobile USA 
  Sprint currently trades at 4 2 times estimated 2010 EBITDA 
We believe if Sprint were to be acquired  the board would
require a premium valuation in the neighborhood of 5x 2010E
EBITDA  which would equate to roughly  5 50 share   Michael
Nelson at Soleil Nelson Alpha Research said  
  On the surface  we believe a Sprint T Mobile combination
makes strategic sense as both companies have been losing market
share and a merger would remove a competitor   he said  but 
warned the two networks posed  significant integration risk  
 There also may stumbling blocks connected to national pride 
 An acquisition of Sprint would need support from the German
government  which may be reluctant to see Deutsche Telekom shift
its attention to the United States from its home market 
  When Deutsche Telekom acquired Voicestream  now T Mobile
USA  in the 1990s the German chancellor  Gerhard Schroeder  had
to support the deal and soften U S  concerns about M A from a
company with a large government stake   UniCredit s Friedrich
said 
 Deutsche Telekom could also opt for organic growth but that
would put some pressure on its dividend as well 
  They are between a rock and a hard place   an organic
growth path would mean they have to increase capex and that
would also put pressure on the dividend   said Kovacocy

221456,442972,T,UPDATE 1 EU seeks to close digital divide with broadband aid,news,"  EU seeks to close digital divide between EU countries
   State aid rules facilitate projects in rural areas
   Telecoms organisations are positive on guidelines

 By Foo Yun Chee
 BRUSSELS  Sept 17  Reuters    The European Commission
unveiled guidelines on Thursday specifying how public funds can
be used to help companies roll out high speed broadband
networks  and help EU countries benefit from new technologies 
 Under the rules  state aid would be easier to obtain for
projects in so called grey areas where broadband infrastructure
does not exist such as rural regions  and more difficult for
 black areas  or cities with more than one network operator 
 The EU executive has pledged to make high speed Internet an
important element of its economic recovery plan to drive growth
in the 27 nation bloc and hopes to achieve 100 percent broadband
coverage in the European Union by 2010 
  While this investment should be made mostly by private
companies  there is an important role for public investment in
achieving the widest possible access to broadband in underserved
and non profitable areas   Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes
told reporters 
  Public investments in line with the present guidelines will
significantly contribute to shrinking the digital divide    both
within and between European Union member states   she said 
Industry operators were generally positive on the state aid
guidelines 
  We see a potentially crucial role for the state wherever
private investors are not rolling out fibre networks which can
be continually upgraded and are open to competition   said
director Ilsa Godlovitch from the European Competitive
Telecommunication Association  ECTA  
 She said it was equally important not to crowd out private
investments where open networks are being built 
ECTA members include BT  Bouygues Telecom  SFR which is
jointly owned by Vivendi and Vodafone  and AT T 
 The bigger operators could stand to gain from the new rules
as they expand their networks  said Michael Bartholomew 
director at European Telecommunications Network Operators 
Association  ETNO   which represents 41 telecoms operators in 34
European countries 
  Realistically  I would imagine the larger operators could
be the largest beneficiaries simply because they have the
resources available to make these kind of investments in rural 
outlying areas where there is no competition   he said 
 The Commission said 200 300 billion euros   295 billion to
 443 billion  would be needed in coming years for building NGA
networks 
 It said recipients of state aid would have to allow
competitors access to its networks and not favour any particular
technology

  Adds analyst comments  share price  background 
 By Veronica Ek and Love Liman
 STOCKHOLM  July 24  Reuters    The Nordic region s top
telecom operator  TeliaSonera  posted profits ahead of forecasts
and said its tight grip on costs would pay off through
higher margins this year  despite the economic downturn 
 Shares in the company were up 6 35 percent by 0922 GMT 
outperforming a 1 percent gain in the DJ Stoxx Telecom Index
  It was a very strong report  strong across the whole board 
As usual  fixed line shows a tremendously strong and promising
margin performance   said Espen Torgersen  analyst at Carnegie 
 Second quarter earnings before interest  tax  depreciation
and amortisation  EBITDA   excluding one off items  rose 13
percent to 9 04 billion Swedish crowns   1 2 billion  to beat a
mean forecast of 8 63 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts 
 Sales growth of 9 percent was driven by strength in
TeliaSonera s mobile operations in developing markets including
Kazakhstan  Azerbaijan  Georgia  Nepal and Cambodia 
 That pattern mirrored wider economic developments and chimed
in with factors underpinning a reassuring sales update from
world no  1 mobile operator Vodafone that showed strength in
India and South Africa mostly compensating for weakness in
Europe  
 TeliaSonera    which has operations across the Nordics and
Eurasia and  like many of its peers  has fared relatively well
in the economic slump    suggested consumers were still watching
their wallets closely  
 But analysts praised the firm s cost cutting focus 
  Things are going better because the cost cutting is
working  They re not exactly getting any help from the economic
environment   said one analyst  who asked not to be named 
 Cost controls were also a key factor for Vodafone  which
said in May it would accelerate cost cutting plans  Its shares
rose 2 5 percent 
 
 LOWER COSTS TO LIFT KEY MARGIN
 The Swedish company  which has already announced plans to
slash 2 900 jobs in Sweden and Finland  said lower costs and
capital expenditure would compensate for the worsening economic
situation  resulting in a higher core operating margin 
  Looking ahead  we expect that our efforts to lower
addressable costs and capital expenditure will offset the
negative impact from declining GDP and rising unemployment in
our markets   it said in a statement 
  Therefore we are raising our outlook on the EBITDA margin
and now expect a higher margin in 2009 than in 2008  
 The previous forecast was for an unchanged 2009 margin from
last year s 31 8 percent 
 Norwegian operator Telenor posted forecast beating results
on Thursday while U S  carrier AT T managed a drop in quarterly
profit that was less steep than expected amid flat sales 
 TeliaSonera said it expected sales this year to be in line
with or slightly below last year s level  stripped for
acquisitions and in local currencies 
 Net sales for the quarter increased 9 percent to 27 5
billion crowns versus an expected 27 3 billion

221458,442974,T,COLUMN Blackberry s biggest rival may be itself  Eric Auchard,news,"   Eric Auchard is a Reuters columnist  The opinions expressed
are his own   
 
 By Eric Auchard
 LONDON  June 19  Reuters    Research in Motion officials do
their best not to laugh when asked if they fear the rise of a
Blackberry killer  some theoretical device that does everything
its coveted e mail phone does  only better 
 But Blackberry s biggest threat may come from itself  As the
company s latest quarterly results suggest  there is a gulf
between its pricey corporate phones and price sensitive consumer
models that are cutting into margins 
 When a loyal Research in Motion  RIM  customer such as a
corporate IT manager discovers he s paying more than twice the
price at work that his the 16 year old daughter is paying at
retail  he feels ripped off  That in a nutshell is the crisis
RIM faces 
 Of course  RIM s crown jewel remain its corporate business 
Its franchise there stems from the thousands of company network
managers who rely exclusively on RIM s e mail management
software to ensure corporate communications are securely
delivered to their intended recipients  Companies pay a premium
for this reliability  Those investments lock customers into
Blackberry services and prevent other competitors from breaking
in  However  this is changing 
 After years of failures  Microsoft and Nokia now have secure
e mail systems that offer credible alternatives  They give these
away to corporate clients  putting longer term pressure on
Blackberry s corporate franchise 
 The success RIM has achieved in consumer markets has defied
all analyst predictions  But consumer success has come dearly in
terms of profit margins and falling average selling prices 
Eighty percent of its new users in the quarter ended in May were
non enterprise  retail customers rather than mainstay corporate
clients  The key difference between corporate and consumer
markets is that RIM lacks the customer control over consumers it
has had in offices 
 Ben Wood  an expert on the worldwide handset market at
U K  based market research firm CCS Insight  says Blackberry has
made huge inroads with teens and young adults by working with
operators to market affordable  prepaid phones 
 One secret of the success of the Blackberry in consumer
markets is the familiarity of its standard layout keyboard
compared to typical mobile phone alphanumeric keypads  making
them great for texting  e mailing or instant messaging  But 
then again  copycats are rampant  U S  carrier AT T offers 20
different phones with standard QWERTY keyboards  not just from
RIM  but from Samsung and other makers 
 The introduction of touchscreens and other consumer friendly
features have helped propel RIM stock up 89 percent to  76 55
since the start of 2009  But that is only half the story  Its
Nasdaq listed stock remains 42 percent below year ago levels as
the economy has taken its toll and debate over its consumer
ambitions has played out 
 Results for its first quarter ended in May showed a 53
percent jump in sales from the year earlier quarter as net
profit rose 24 percent  Rosy looking year over year comparisons
disguise a quarterly sales decline  as revenue fell 1 percent
from its quarter ended in February 
 Gross margins recovered somewhat during the quarter to 44
percent  but are well off lofty levels of 55 percent three years
ago and are stuck there  The bigger disappointment was the
company s outlook  which fell short of Wall Street hopes 
 The company faces a flood of competitors this year  At the
high end of the market  Apple Inc starts releasing its new model
iPhone on Friday  Palm is introducing its comeback phone  the
Pre  while a variety of Asian and U S  phone makers are gearing
up to release low priced Google Android phones 
 While making inroads may be hard in corporate markets where
Blackberry is king  for individual consumers  these rival phones
boast better Web browsing 
  RIM now has to decide what business it is in   Wood says 
  Will the consumer business hurt the corporate one  
 The Blackberry market for kids is calling into question the
lucrative corporate franchise RIM has built over the past
decade  It s only a matter of time before the business world
questions why it is paying so much and looks to renegotiate 
That s creating an opening for Blackberry killers to emerge

CBS highlighted that retransmission consent and reverse compensation are projected to exceed the  2 billion mark in 2020  and is on track to hit  1 billion at the end of 2016  a year before than previously expected  In the second quarter of 2016  retransmission revenues surged 44   Several strategic deals with Sinclair  AT T  NYSE T   Nexstar and others have positioned CBS favorably  enabling it to meet the retransmission targets much ahead of its schedule 
The company anticipates increased political advertising in the latter half of the year to favorably impact its performance  CBS has great news for  Star Trek  fans  The company had earlier announced that it will be launching a brand new  Star Trek  television series in Jan 2017  Per the company  the Star Trek series will be launched on CBS Television Network after a special broadcast preview  The fans will be able to enjoy the Vulcan salute once again  more famously known as the  Spock Salute  
Further  the debut and following first run episodes will run exclusively on the network s subscription video on demand service  CBS All Access  for the U S  audience  The company will charge a total of  5 99 per month for both the CBS Television station and access to its video on demand services  Recently  CBS Corporation has come up with a new commercial free subscription for its over the top  OTT  service  CBS All Access  
This ad free model to watch CBS All Access s on demand shows can be availed at  9 99 per month   4 higher than the present subscription service  inclusive of commercials  The company informed that subscribers will be able to view CBS All Access s on demand library of over 7 500 episodes 
We also observed that the company s shares have gained more than 18  in the past one year on the back of better than expected earnings for the six straight quarters  Its earnings of 93 cents a share in the second quarter of 2016 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents and surged 26  from the year ago quarter  Moreover  total revenue of this diversified media conglomerate rose 2  to  3 287 million and also came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 222 million  thus marking the third successive quarter of revenue beat CBS CORP Price

   On the flip side  the media industry is a highly competitive space and CBS Corp  faces intense competition from other broadcast radio and television stations  cable television networks  and motion picture studios in the market in which it operates  This may weigh on the company s top line results

Mexico s Telecommunications Industry Flourishing

In 2014  the government of Mexico initiated major reforms within its telecommunications sector  Mexico s telecom regulatory authority  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT   had taken several steps to instil competition in this highly monopolistic industry  Those reform measures have started bearing the desired results Recently  the IFT announced that the country s telecom sector has witnessed 8 4  year over year growth in revenues in the second quarter of 2016  This rate of growth is highest among all the other sectors of the economy  Remarkably  the telecom sector s growth rate is more than three times higher than the 2 5  overall growth rate of Mexico s GDP in the same time frame  In second quarter 2016  the broader telecom sector of Mexico generated total revenue of approximately MXN 485 billion  over  26 81 billion  Recently  Mexico has been observing massive investment in its telecom sector  In Jun 2016  the country s Secretariat of Communications and Transport  SCT  declared that a total of more than  6 5 billion has been invested over the last three years  In addition  around  13 5 billion has been invested recently in the telecom sector  Moreover  the upcoming nationwide shared broadband network will further attract around  7 billion worth of investment At present  there are three nationwide telecom operators in Mexico  Mexican telecom behemoth America Movil SAB    and Spanish telecom giant Telefonica SA    were the two incumbents  Last year  the U S  telecom behemoth AT T Inc      entered the fray with the acquisition of Grupo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico Furthermore  AT T acquired U S  satellite TV giant DIRECTV  which had a strong Latin American presence including Mexico  Moreover  the IFT has permitted the Mexican TV broadcasting giant Grupo Televisa SA    to enter the country s telecom market  However  the company is yet to take any decision in this regard 


In Mar 2016  Mexico established the Telecommunications Investment Promotion Agency through a presidential decree  The agency is responsible for the installation of the government s proposed 4G LTE shared network and provision of telecommunications services  The federal government will provide the resources to the agency that will be managed by a board of directors  headed by the Minister of Communications and Transport  The IFT will regulate the agency

221466,442982,T,Twilio s Under The Radar Competition  Bandwidth ,opinion,"If you missed my video on you should be ashamed  Watch that immediately and come back  I ll wait 

	The company just issued its first quarterly earnings report since its IPO  The company introduced us to a couple of metrics it uses to measure growth  You know tech companies love their fantasy metrics like Monthly Active Users  Theirs makes sense though  They have one number giving total sales and another giving base sales  The total sales number is the revenue number everyone gives  The base sales number shows customers that have already made minimum 12 month revenue commitments  Like every day  I m good for like 900 calories at lunch  Some days  I go for the win and get the large coke with the fries  Base revenue is more predictable and the variable component is  well  variable  Either way you slice it  Twilio s    revenue was up 77 9  year over year 

	With the company beating EPS estimates by 7 cents per share I expect analysts to come out and increase their estimates for next quarter  That should bump the stock off our Zacks Rank  3  Hold  it s stuck on now  The stock has gone from a  15 IPO in late June to over  45  A very successful offering that happened to be the first tech unicorn of the year 

	Behind the scenes Twilio competitor Bandwidth helps companies build business grade communications into their applications  It s quietly the largest VOIP carrier in the US with 50 million active phone numbers and over 7 600 rate centers  They help fill the gap between the quality of large carriers like AT T  NYSE T  with the speed to market of much smaller providers  When you think Bandwidth you should think Level 3  LVLT   Twilio  AT T and Vonage  VG   With a compounded annual growth rate of 25  between 2010 and 2015  Bandwidth is evolving into a very large player in this business  But don t look for Bandwidth to go public anytime soon 

	So if you re looking to invest in this space  you have to dig around between the four publicly traded companies I just referred to  Unfortunately right now they re all Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  But Vonage has both Value and Growth Style Scores of B  in an industry that ranks in the Top 23  of our Zacks Industry Rank  They entered the arena as a major Twilio competitor when they acquired Nexmo

221467,442983,T,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Yahoo  Verizon  EBay  Sotheby And ATT,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   July 25  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include   Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO      Verizon      EBay      Sotheby     and AT T  NYSE T     

Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

Is Yahoo  Verizon the Worst Merger Ever 

Sometimes mergers go great  Peanut butter and jelly  Brooks and Dunn  Italian beef and provolone  Other times it s a complete train wreck  Looks like Marissa Mayer finally found a big enough sucker  I mean suitor  to buy  Yahoo     Verizon     looks  to be a buyer for about  5 billion  The deal would include Yahoo s core internet business and real estate assets  The non core sale of intellectual property assets will be sold separately 

The deal puts together two of the biggest companies of the 20th century  AOL and Yahoo  If this were before Y2K  the AOL chat rooms would be going crazy right now  Then again  you d be waiting an hour for your dial up to download this video  It s so cheap  it can t be a bad deal for Verizon  right 

Ehhh  EBay    paid  2 6 billion for Skype in 2005 then sold it four years later for  1 9 billion  Still scratching my head  Online auctions and video chats  There s a reason whySotheby s    never bought AT T     Going once  twice  sold  But maybe the AOL side of this sweetens up the deal 

Then again  remember AOL Time Warner  Even the guys running the show over there knew they screwed up   160 billion to create the world s largest media company  Jerry Levin  who sold Time Warner to AOL was quoted as saying   I presided over the worst deal of the century apparently   Not mad at you Jerry  you still got paid  Here with Yahoo  there are some synergies 

There were also synergies when Sprint and Nextel merged agreed to merge as a  36 billion deal in 2005  Shortly thereafter  people realized that walkie talkies are for fifth graders and summer camp slasher movies  Instead of buying Nextels  people made sure their next telephones were smart phones  Sprint shut down Nextel s network in 2013 

Then there s Daimler Benz and Chrysler  Let s take the precision and quality of one of the most sought after car companies in the world and mix it with cheaply made  poorly designed  hot garbage  Talk about culture clash  Mercedes got worse and eventually paid  650 million for Cerberus to take Chrysler  which eventually made its way over to Fiat  Much better match 

Where this ranks in deal making history remains to be seen  I can tell you that Yahoo is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  right now with Value and Growth Style Scores of F  Last quarter the company reported a 5 cent loss  7 cents worse than the 2 cents of earnings analysts were looking for  So if you waited Verizon  you d probably get it even cheaper

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Sail Through Uncertainty 

With uncertainty ruling the markets since the beginning of the year  it s not surprising that dividend investing has emerged as one of the most popular investing themes  Dividends are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from price movements of stocks are at risk 

Why Choose Dividend Growth
	There are multiple styles of dividend investing out of which dividend growth is the most appealing  Stocks with dividend growth generally outperform their peers and generate increased profits year after year  Thus  the dividend growth strategy has an edge over the steady dividend strategy  By investing in stocks with dividend growth  investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation 
	Dividend growth stocks also provide some margin of safety  which enables investors to withstand shocks  In fact  stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth  as opposed to those that have high yields  form a healthy portfolio 
	Moreover  these stocks often have superior fundamentals compared to other dividend paying stocks  This is because dividend growth is often an outcome of a sustainable business model  a long track record of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics 
	Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history Most Recent Payout Ratio less than M Industry   This is the measure of dividend payments as a percentage of earnings  A relatively low payout ratio indicates the company s ability to increase dividend even during tough times 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero   This selects stocks with a strong record of revenue growth 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero   This shortlists stocks with a solid earnings growth history 

Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Median    This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Zacks Rank Less than or Equal to 2   Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment VGM Style Score of B or better  This is simply a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum Market Capitalization greater than  2 billion   We have eliminated small cap stocks to ensure better flexibility and tradability 
	Here are five of the 12 stocks that fit the bill AT T  Inc     is the second largest wireless service provider in North America and one of the world s leading communications service carriers  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of B  It also has an average four quarter EPS surprise of 5 3  Nu Skin Enterprises Inc     offers a comprehensive line of premium quality beauty and wellness products in more than 50 markets globally  Its earnings are expected to grow at a rate of 6 2  over the next 5 years  This Zacks Rank  2 company has a VGM Style Score of B Carlisle Companies Incorporated     is a global diversified company that designs  manufactures and markets products addressing a broad range of niche markets including commercial roofing  energy  agriculture and auto refinishing among others  Its earnings are expected to grow at a rate of 15 6  this year  much above the industry average of 2   The stock has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM Style Score of B NVIDIA Corporation     is a computer technology company with leadership position in GPU accelerated computing  The stock has delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 57 9  over the past four quarters  It has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM Style Score of B MB Financial Inc     is a holding company for MB Financial Bank  N A  with assets of approximately  15 6 billion  Its earnings are expected to growth at a rate of 10 5  over the next 5 years  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of A

The deal puts together two of the biggest companies of the 20th century  AOL and Yahoo  If this were before Y2K  the AOL chat rooms would be going crazy right now  Then again  you d be waiting an hour for your dial up to download this video  It s so cheap  it can t be a bad deal for Verizon  right  
Ehhh  EBay  EBAY  paid  2 6 billion for Skype in 2005 then sold it four years later for  1 9 billion  Still scratching my head  Online auctions and video chats  There s a reason why Sotheby s  BID  never bought AT T  NYSE T   Going once  twice  sold  But maybe the AOL side of this sweetens up the deal  
Then again  remember AOL Time Warner  Even the guys running the show over there knew they screwed up   160 billion to create the world s largest media company  Jerry Levin  who sold Time Warner to AOL was quoted as saying   I presided over the worst deal of the century apparently   Not mad at you Jerry  you still got paid  Here with Yahoo  there are some synergies  
There were also synergies when Sprint  S  and Nextel merged agreed to merge as a  36 billion deal in 2005  Shortly thereafter  people realized that walkie talkies are for fifth graders and summer camp slasher movies  Instead of buying Nextels  people made sure their next telephones were smart phones  Sprint shut down Nextel s network in 2013  
Then there s Daimler Benz and Chrysler  Let s take the precision and quality of one of the most sought after car companies in the world and mix it with cheaply made  poorly designed  hot garbage  Talk about culture clash  Mercedes got worse and eventually paid  650 million for Cerberus to take Chrysler  which eventually made its way over to Fiat  Much better match  
Where this ranks in deal making history remains to be seen  I can tell you that Yahoo is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  right now with Value and Growth Style Scores of F  Last quarter the company reported a 5 cent loss  7 cents worse than the 2 cents of earnings analysts were looking for  So if you waited Verizon  you d probably get it even cheaper ",2016-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-yahoo!-verizon-the-worst-merger-ever-200143659,200143659

   Factors Likely to Influence This Quarter

221476,442992,T,Forget Brexit  Buy These Stocks And ETFs,opinion,"In a historic referendum  Britain voted to leave the European Union  a decision that shocked global financial markets  Earlier last week  the sterling and stocks had rallied strongly on hopes of a Remain vote  The pound got hammered to a 31 year low and stocks plunged after the results 
	For the UK  it s going to be a long road to final separation from the EU and it may not exit intact from the union  Scotland  which strongly voted for Remain  may now hold a vote for secession from the UK   Read   
	We should now brace for a prolonged period of heightened volatility as the market digests the debacle  One near term impact would be a higher US dollar as nervous investors pull money out of European assets and pour money into  safer  US assets 
	The European Union is our largest trading partner accounting for about 20  of our exports   and if the zone experiences an economic slowdown from Brexit  it could impact the US economy  Further  business investment is likely to suffer as managements tend to postpone major investment in uncertain environment   Read   
	However  the US economy will likely weather this storm  Several times in the recent past  global headwinds emanating from Europe and China have caused turmoil in the US market but each time the market rebounded strongly as investors realize that our domestic economy continues to recover slowly but steadily  And with interest rates now expected to stay lower for longer  the outlook for US companies remains positive  Also  while Britain is the fifth largest economy in the world  it accounts for less than 4  of global GDP 
	If you re a long term investor and can tolerate short term gyrations in the portfolio  this is your opportunity to buy from the bargain basement  Look for high quality US companies with no or very low exposure to Europe that have been unfairly punished in the aftermath of the referendum  Stable companies with consistent revenue and dividend growth are excellent investments in the current uncertain market environment   Read   AT T  NYSE T    
	AT T is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock with very little exposure to the UK  Telecom stocks are popular due to their juicy dividend yields and defensive nature  AT T is a dividend aristocrat with more than 30 years of consistent dividend growth  Their current dividend yield is 4 6  and they distribute about 70  of their free cash free as dividends 
	The company had reported strong results for Q1  beating on both top and bottom lines B G Foods   
	BGS is a food products company with a huge portfolio of well known brands  They manufacture and market processed and packaged foods across the United States and Canada  Economic and political woes in Europe do not impact them 
	The stock has a juicy dividend yield of 3 55  as of now  Earlier this year they increased their quarterly cash dividend by 20     This was 46th consecutive quarterly dividend since their IPO in October 2004 
	BGS is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF   
	Homebuilders are domestically focused  A strong US dollar and European economic headwinds do not directly impact them  Further  as the Fed is now expected to stay on hold for quite some time  mortgage rates continue to slide  Ultra low mortgage rates and a tightening jobs market are good for the housing sector 
	XHB is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ETF  It holds about 37 homebuilding companies in equal weights Vanguard REIT ETF    
	REITs are required to distribute at least 90  of their taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends  An improving economy and low interest rates make REITs particularly appealing to investors  In addition to income and growth  REITs also add diversification benefits to a portfolio 
	VNQ holds a diversified portfolio of 153 REIT companies that invest in office buildings  hotels  and other real property in the US  The product charges 12 basis points in annual expenses and the dividend yield exceeds 5  as of now  XHB is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ETF S P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats ETF   
	Dividend growth strategies have been very popular this year but mid cap space has been slightly overlooked by investors  This ETF presents an excellent way to tap that overlooked area with great potential  REGL equal weights its portfolio  which largely reduces company specific risks 
	REGL focuses on companies that have increased dividend payments each year for at least 15 years

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Forget Brexit  Buy These Stocks   ETFs Instead

	In a historic referendum  Britain voted to leave the European Union  a decision that shocked global financial markets  Earlier last week  the sterling and stocks had rallied strongly on hopes of a Remain vote  The pound got hammered to a 31 year low and stocks plunged after the results 
	For the UK  it s going to be a long road to final separation from the EU and it may not exit intact from the union  Scotland  which strongly voted for Remain  may now hold a vote for secession from the UK   Read   
	We should now brace for a prolonged period of heightened volatility as the market digests the debacle  One near term impact would be a higher US dollar as nervous investors pull money out of European assets and pour money into  safer  US assets 
	The European Union is our largest trading partner accounting for about 20  of our exports   and if the zone experiences an economic slowdown from Brexit  it could impact the US economy  Further  business investment is likely to suffer as managements tend to postpone major investment in uncertain environment   Read   
	However  the US economy will likely weather this storm  Several times in the recent past  global headwinds emanating from Europe and China have caused turmoil in the US market but each time the market rebounded strongly as investors realize that our domestic economy continues to recover slowly but steadily  And with interest rates now expected to stay lower for longer  the outlook for US companies remains positive  Also  while Britain is the fifth largest economy in the world  it accounts for less than 4  of global GDP 
	If you re a long term investor and can tolerate short term gyrations in the portfolio  this is your opportunity to buy from the bargain basement  Look for high quality US companies with no or very low exposure to Europe that have been unfairly punished in the aftermath of the referendum  Stable companies with consistent revenue and dividend growth are excellent investments in the current uncertain market environment   Read    AT T    
	AT T is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock with very little exposure to the UK  Telecom stocks are popular due to their juicy dividend yields and defensive nature  AT T is a dividend aristocrat with more than 30 years of consistent dividend growth  Their current dividend yield is 4 6  and they distribute about 70  of their free cash free as dividends 
	The company had reported strong results for Q1  beating on both top and bottom lines B G Foods   
	BGS is a food products company with a huge portfolio of well known brands  They manufacture and market processed and packaged foods across the United States and Canada  Economic and political woes in Europe do not impact them 
	The stock has a juicy dividend yield of 3 55  as of now  Earlier this year they increased their quarterly cash dividend by 20   This was 46th consecutive quarterly dividend since their IPO in October 2004 
	BGS is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock SPDR S P Homebuilders ETF    
	Homebuilders are domestically focused  A strong US dollar and European economic headwinds do not directly impact them  Further  as the Fed is now expected to stay on hold for quite some time  mortgage rates continue to slide  Ultra low mortgage rates and a tightening jobs market are good for the housing sector 
	XHB is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ETF  It holds about 37 homebuilding companies in equal weights Vanguard REIT ETF    
	REITs are required to distribute at least 90  of their taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends  An improving economy and low interest rates make REITs particularly appealing to investors  In addition to income and growth  REITs also add diversification benefits to a portfolio 
	VNQ holds a diversified portfolio of 153 REIT companies that invest in office buildings  hotels  and other real property in the US  The product charges 12 basis points in annual expenses and the dividend yield exceeds 5  as of now  XHB is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ETF S P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats ETF    
	Dividend growth strategies have been very popular this year but mid cap space has been slightly overlooked by investors  This ETF presents an excellent way to tap that overlooked area with great potential  REGL equal weights its portfolio  which largely reduces company specific risks 
	REGL focuses on companies that have increased dividend payments each year for at least 15 years

Market Rebounds  Time for Momentum ETFs   Stocks

After two days of equity market rout  the global market has finally taken a breather  Heavy sell offs triggered by Brexit   which in fact can be tagged as the  global equity loss superseding the market crash in September 2008 on the fall of Lehman Brothers   now seem to have eased

	However  a series of weekend polls suggest that chances of Britain remaining in the European Union have increased ahead of the referendum on U K  s membership in the European Union  EU  to be held on June 23  This brought back the lost confidence in the market duringMonday s trading session  fueling a rally in the stocks  As a result  the S P 500 index touched the key threshold level of 2 100 once gain in early session before retreating  At the close of the day  the S P 500 was about 2  below its all time high of 2 134 72

221485,443001,T,Minimize Stress With Low Volatility ETFs,opinion,"Many investors have been caught off guard this year with the sharp drop in stocks combined with a rush to safety in traditional defensive asset classes  This week we will be reviewing a trio of diversified ETFs designed to hold stocks with lower historical price fluctuations than traditional market cap weighted benchmarks  These tools can be useful for more conservative investors that are seeking to maintain an allocation to stocks with the goal of mitigating downside risk 
Reviewing The Playing Field   David Fabian
The largest ETF in this space is the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF  USMV   which has over  8 billion in total assets  USMV contains exposure to 168 large and mid cap stocks with top holdings in well known names such as AT T Inc  N T  and McDonalds Inc  MCD   This smart beta fund carries a modest expense ratio of just 0 15  as well 
The USMV portfolio is constructed according to rigid constraints on individual stocks  sectors  and overall price sensitivity of each holding  While the structure of this ETF is that of a passive index  it s holdings are regularly evaluated to ensure they are maintaining minimal price fluctuations relative to their peer group  In addition  the multi sector approach allows for this fund to be  and not just a short term defensive hideout 
The PowerShares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio  SPLV  is another well regarded fund in this class with over  5 billion in total assets  SPLV takes a variant approach by taking the 100 lowest volatility stocks in the S P 500 Index and equal weighting each underlying holding  The end result is a deep pool of quality large cap stocks with high concentrations in financials  consumer staples  and industrial companies 
SPLV charges an expense ratio of 0 25  and has a unique feature of providing monthly distributions to its shareholders  This type of regular dividend stream may be an attractive characteristic for income investors and the fund currently sports a yield of 2 31  
Lastly  the SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF  ONEV  is a relative newcomer in this arena  ONEV launched in December 2015 and is designed to select a subset of 420 U S  large cap holdings from the broader Russell 1000 Index  A fund of this nature may be appropriate for investors who favor a deeper index constructed according to similar principles as its more concentrated peers  In addition  ONEV charges an expense ratio of 0 20   which is reasonable for its class 
Analyzing The Technical Picture   
USMV has masterfully done it s job providing minimum volatility  The Funds  top 5 holdings all sport a 2 9   dividend yield  Its structure has allowed investors to take advantage of the strength of defensive stock groups such as consumer staples and utilities while still being highly correlated to the S P 500 

The ETF is flat over the past year while the S P 500 is down 10   Also note the sharp drop in correlation between USMV and the S P 500 leading into August 2015 s sharp decline  That provided a nice footprint of flows into defensive assets 
Moving on to SPLV  this ETF is also made of stable businesses such as Campbell Soup  Coca Cola  Clorox and Verizon 

There are two interesting points worth noting on this chart  First  there are meaningful drops in the one month correlation from time to time  which show the start of a flight to safety in 2015  We also see that while the market has recently reached new lows  this index has positively diverged 
Between SPLV and USMV the technical differences are hardly noticeable 
ONEV is drastically different than the other two  Unlike SPLV and USMV  ONEV s benchmark tracks an index made of a drastically larger number of stocks with greater risk qualities 

As you can see  ONEV is down 6 8  since inception while it s Russell 1000 ETF cousins are down roughly 10   In the same period  the S P 500 is down 9  
We must also note the complete lack of interest in this product to this point  ONEV is a defensive instrument within a non defense stock index  It s an unproven product and style doesn t really fill a classic market objective 
Conclusions 
USMV and SPLV have both proven to be suitable ways to be in stocks defensively 
The greatest differentiators between the two funds is SPLV s monthly dividend payments and  1  greater expense ratio
ONEV is currently not liquid enough to be considered a suitable investment vehicle

221486,443002,T,Where Is AT T Headed ,opinion,"AT T Inc   NYSE N T  understands  like most already people do  that you cannot brew the same formula forever  The company has been a wireline business  has seen the rise of wireless systems and is currently witnessing how the combination of wireless and Internet is disrupting the communications sector 
History teaches that to stay relevant in the communications industry  you must not rest on your laurels  With this wisdom in mind  AT T is trying to transform itself   repositioning its subscriber base  revamping its video play and expanding abroad  However  the major question at this point is whether AT T is getting anywhere with its various turnaround efforts 
This AT T analysis article puts into perspective the various efforts the carrier is making to reinvent itself and their possible outcomes 
Impact Of DirecTV Acquisition On Cash Flow
There are multiple ways in which AT T could benefit from its acquisition of paid TV provider DirecTV  One key way in which DirecTV will be immediately beneficial to AT T is by boosting the carrier s cash flow  Being an already profitable business  DirecTV could improve AT T s cash position by an additional  3 5 billion 
The expected  2 5 billion in cost synergies by 2018 from the acquisition of DirecTV could also bolster AT T s cash flow position  Therefore  taking into account DirecTV s cash flow contribution  AT T s total free cash flow could rise to more than  16 billion by next year  considering that the carrier on its own had  10 billion of free cash flow last year 
AT T needs to strengthen its cash position to support its ongoing revenue expansion and diversification efforts that include deep video involvement and expansion in Mexico 
AT T Acquiring An Old Asset But With Eye On New Future
AT T is acquiring DirecTV when it is fully aware of the transformation sweeping through the video market  An increasing number of paid TV providers are moving to cut the cord in favor of Internet based video services  It may concern many investors why AT T is pouring  49 billion in a business that will soon be overtaken by events 
However  while AT T understands the dynamics of the video market and the flow to online  the company is betting on the slow death of the traditional paid TV business  It believes that as much as the rise of over the top  OTT  video services will choke the life out of traditional television services someday  the process will be slow and happen over many years 
AT T s Online Video Agenda Is Alive
As much as AT T appears to be siding with a linear television provider at a time of transition  it is not lost on the company where the future of video consumption is moving  However  for the time that most people will still continue to consume video through linear channels  AT T believes it will have extra value from DirecTV that it can invest elsewhere  especially in building a more robust online video service 
AT T also understands that it is not enough just to render video over the Internet wirelessly  but owning content is an important part of the game  As such  the company is reportedly investing in online video content through its joint venture called Otter Media 
Therefore  relying on the video experience it is building  together with its vast wireless resources  AT T is looking forward to a bright future in the video business 
Subscriber Base Repositioning 
Part of T s remaking involves subscriber base repositioning  The company is more interested in growing its postpaid smartphone subscriber numbers  That explains why AT T has  in recent times  sought to pay less attention to winning over feature phone subscribers  As such  the population of feature phone customers on AT T s network has been on the decline  and the company is not feeling pain about it 
The reason AT T is not feeling the pain of losing feature phone customers is that the group exhibits a higher churn rate and their loyalty is mostly predicated on aggressive pricing and promotions 
AT T s subscriber quality approach is sensible in that the company is limiting the cost of attracting and retaining low value subscribers  The strategy should enable the company to lower its operating costs and also optimize capital allocation for better returns 
The repositioning of the subscriber base is already having a positive impact on AT T s average revenue per user  ARPU   The company reported that its postpaid ARPU rose by about 6  in just one year  to  68 from  64 as it increased focus on high value customers while letting go of feature phone subscribers 
In terms of subscriber distribution  AT T has seen its smartphone subscriber numbers lift as its feature phone customers decline  The company reported that the population of its smartphone customers rose to 65 million in the last quarter  2Q2015  from 58 million in the same period a year earlier  At the same time  the population of feature phone subscribers contracted to 9 million from 13 million in the prior year 
The chart below shows AT T s smartphone and feature phone subscriber trends 

Cricket Is AT T s Attack Dog
AT T has clearly outlined its subscriber growth strategy  indicating that it is more interested in widening the population of its high value postpaid smartphone subscribers  However  the company is also keen to attract and retain high end prepaid subscribers  As such  AT T has Cricket to serve its interest in the prepaid market  The company has at least two strategies with Cricket  It is being offered as a fallback plan for customers who do not qualify for postpaid subscription  In more recent times  AT T has seemed to position Cricket as the attack dog against its rivals T Mobile US Inc   NYSE TMUS  and Sprint Corp   NYSE S   AT T appears to be particularly interested in using Cricket to raid the prepaid subscriber bases of T Mobile s MetroPCS and Sprint s Boost 
Revenue Boost On Top Of Cost Synergy
AT T is already known as one of the cost leaders in the U S  phone operator business and the acquisition of DirecTV is expected to bolster its cost curtailment advantages 
While cost benefit was the main theme around the acquisition of DirecTV  it should not be lost on investors that DirecTV will also bolster AT T s topline  DirecTV generated  33 3 billion in revenue in 2014  One of the areas in which AT T could unlock more revenue growth from DirecTV is through upselling its subscribers  and there is wide room to do that 
Potential Pain Points For AT T
Content Agreements
One area in which AT T is focusing to cut cost through DirecTV acquisition is through content agreements  Because of its expanded scale  AT T is hoping that it can pressure content providers into making favorable price adjustments  However  given that wireless and satellite content deals are usually negotiated separately  AT T could find it more challenging than it expected to push content providers to agree to its terms 
Threat Of OTT
AT T is betting that the disruptive machine of OTT will grind gradually  allowing it time to recoup profit and investment in DirecTV  However  AT T has no control over how OTT penetration accelerates  which means that its assumptions could be wrong and costly at the end of the day 
Expansion Into Mexico
Sensing market saturation in the U S   AT T is looking abroad to unlock new growth  The company has acquired two wireless assets in Mexico to expand its footprint in the market  While the Mexico acquisition moves are sensible  it will take time before they pay off  In the meantime  AT T could face higher cash burn than it anticipated in sustaining the new businesses in Mexico 
Bottom Line
AT T s transformation is in progress  There will be speed bumps along the way as already highlighted  but they won t be life threatening ",2015-10-22,InvestCorrectly,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-new-at-t-inc.-(nyse:t)-in-the-making,-where-is-the-company-headed-268965",268965

221489,443005,T,Warrants  Options On The Future,opinion,"Have you ever explored the numerous opportunities available using stock warrants  Probably Not 

Virtually everyday in the news with companies reporting a stock offering  either a private placement or a public offering  more often than not  stock warrants are attached to the offering 

As well  you have probably seen articles about Warren Buffett and Carlos Slim with their personal investments involving stock warrants 

My message for you today is that stock warrants are seen daily in the news and whether you will ever buy or sell warrants yourself  you need to understand what they are and the advantages that stock warrants can bring to your portfolio 

But first we need to briefly discuss the overall market environment  These markets are getting very volatile whether you are investing in the resource sector with gold  silver or the shares or if you are investing in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  S P 500 or the NASDAQ  so let s look at a few charts which tell the story of volatility  starting with the strength in the US Dollar 















Stock Warrants versus Call Options

A warrant is a security issued by a company giving the holder the right  but not the obligation  to acquire the underlying company s shares at a specific price  That right expires on a specific date in the future  Generally  warrants are issued in connection with a stock or a bond offering  Frequently  they are done so in the context of an  equity kicker  or  sweetener   The reason a company will issue a warrant is simple  think of it as additional incentive to get the deal done 

There is an obvious similarity to call options  The two instruments are closely related  The major difference is that a call option is created in the marketplace by investors and not issued by a company  Typically  options trade on designated options exchanges  such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange  Warrants will trade on a traditional stock exchange  such as the New York Stock Exchange  NASDAQ or the Toronto Stock Exchange  just like their common shares 

Warrants first came about in the 1920s  At one time  even AT T Inc  NYSE T  had warrants trading  as well as some of the big company names of the past and present  Tenneco Inc  NYSE TEN   Avcorp Industries Inc   TO AVP   Holiday Inn  International Tel   Tel  Lowes  General Tire   Rubber  Mack Trucks and many more 

Fast forward to today  and you will discover that many stock warrants are trading on the shares of banks   financial service companies  as well as companies in biotechnology  autos  restaurants  oil   gas  pipelines and of course on natural resource companies  an area in which many readers have a special interest  With the possibility of the lows being behind us in gold and silver  the opportunity for extraordinary gains in resource shares and or the long term warrants on those shares look interesting 

TRADER OBJECTIVE The first step in trading stock warrants is selecting the right underlying company  This is of utmost importance because if the company does not execute on its business plan and the common shares do not rise  holders of either call options or warrants will not make money  Each investor must perform his or her own due diligence on companies that are attractive for investment 

The next consideration is your time horizon 

Are the markets in a bull market or a bear market and how much time do you want to execute on your investment objective 

Once a viable company is selected  the decision to purchase a warrant or a call option will depend on the timeframe of the trader s goals  While traditional call options generally have a life of between 30 days and one year  warrants often are issued with two to five years until expiration  Thus  short term traders may see more opportunity in call options  while longer term investors may be more comfortable with the several years until expiration that warrants provide  This additional time can be a great asset as in the volatile markets we have experienced over the last few years  Investors can also consider LEAPS  Long Term Equity Anticipation Securities that typically have a maximum life of two years and trade on the Chicago Board Option Exchange   

Whether the investor is considering call options or warrants  the underlying reason is basically the same  increased leverage  Both warrants and options offer additional leverage over purchasing a stock outright  Of course  as with all forms of leverage  the leverage afforded by warrants cuts both ways 

When it comes to warrants  traders can expect to achieve at least a two to one leverage over purchasing the common shares  this is reasonable with most of the warrants currently trading  What this means is if you believe the common shares will rise 100   then the warrants have the potential to increase by at least 200  

In addition to speculative or investment opportunities  warrants can also provide hedging benefits  When combined with both put and call options  warrants also can be used to construct some rather interesting  sophisticated and potentially profitable trading strategies

221490,443006,T,Facebook Seeks EU Approval For WhatsApp,opinion,Reportedly  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  has sought antitrust approval from the European Union for its purchase of mobile messaging service  WhatsApp  In Feb  2014  Facebook declared its intention of acquiring Whatsapp for a whopping sum of  19 0 billion  The company expected this acquisition to not only expand its mobile product lineup but also to add a predominantly young user base  Since the time Facebook first floated the idea of acquiring WhatsApp  some European telecom companies have raised concerns about the proposed deal  apprehending that the social network will have a monopoly in the mobile communications market  Facebook s WhatsApp is expected to offer free voice call services by the end of second quarter of this year  It announced that the service will initially be available on iOS and Android and will gradually be extended to Windows and Blackberry users  WhatsApp s free voice call service will intensify competition for telecom companies such as AT T  NYSE T   This acquisition has already been approved by the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  in the U S  This step of seeking approval from the European Union was initiated by Facebook  as it will save the company from multiple regulatory reviews in different European nations  However  the acquisition deal may be outside the purview of the European Commission as WhatsApp does not earn sufficient revenues to fit into the given criteria  Nevertheless  the commission can take responsibility for the case provided three national regulators raise objection against the same  Allthough any negative result of the aforesaid review will likely to be a headwind for Facebook  we believe that it will not significantly impact its revenue growth in the near term  Moreover  the decision of the European Union will in no way prevent the closure of the acquisition deal  At the most  it can prevent the usage of WhatsApp in Europe  Facebook intends to use the services of Whatsapp in its internet org program  Hence  if WhatsApp gets banned in Europe then the growth prospect of the internet org initiative may be hampered to some extent  Facebook s rapid pace of acquisitions is expected to weigh down on profitability and cash balance in the near term  Intensifying competition from the likes of Google  NASDAQ GOOG   Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  and Twitter  NYSE TWTR  remains a major concern  However  we believe that Facebook s growing mobile user base  Instagram s increasing popularity  frequent launch of new products and international expansions will boost the company s top line and profitability going forward ,2014-05-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/facebook-seeks-eu-approval-for-whatsapp-214433,214433
221491,443007,T,Why We re Ignoring The Stock Correction Scenario  For Now  ,opinion,"Investor Doubt Increases Correction Odds
The S P 500 traded at 1 850 intraday on December 31  2013  Last week s intraday low was 1 862  or just 0 64  above the level seen 135 calendar days earlier  Why have investors become so hesitant in 2014  Answer  The economy and earnings  From  

Behind the stock market s anxious ups and downs of late lies the fear that a weakening U S  and global economy could dash hopes for an uptick in corporate earnings  For the first quarter  earnings season is nearly done  More than 90  of big companies have reported results and they were lackluster  Most beat analyst estimates  but only because expectations were rock bottom  Profit gains for S P 500 companies were just 2 1  overall compared with a year earlier  well below the previous quarter s 8 5  rise  FactSet said  Now investors are seeing soft reports on industrial production  housing starts  consumer sentiment and European economic growth  and they are growing anxious 

Navigating A Stealth Correction In Stocks
As noted in this week s stock market video below  it is not possible for stocks to experience a multi week or multi month correction without a breakdown occurring in the major stock indexes first  For example  if investors are concerned enough about future economic outcomes to spark a stock market correction  the chart below would look worse than it does as of noon Monday 

Last week  we covered the concept of a stealth bear market in stocks  The concept is explored in detail in the video below  allowing us to better understand the odds of a breakdown in the major stock indexes 

DirecTV Deal Met With A Yawn 
Typically  if there is confidence that stockholders on either side of the aisle in a takeover deal will be winners  we would see one of the stocks go up  That is not what we were seeing early in Monday s session  From  

Equities have come under pressure  with consecutive weekly declines for the first time since January  as investors have become leery about growth prospects  Last week  readings on retail sales and consumer sentiment fell shy of expectations while labor and housing data provided reason for optimism  AT T   NYSE T  lost 1 7 percent to  36 12 after the telecom company said it will acquire DirecTV  NASDAQ DTV  for  48 5 billion  as it seeks fresh avenues of growth beyond the maturing U S  cellular business  DirecTV shares lost  1 81 at  84 37 

Investment Implications   Patience Needed
The market s indecisive nature from a risk tolerance perspective can be seen in the chart of the NASDAQ below  The negative slope of the blue 50 day moving average tells us investor conviction has been waning for some time now  In terms of risk management guideposts  we d would feel better about tech and stocks in general if  a  the NASDAQ would recapture its 50 day at 4 159  and  b  the slope of the 50 day turned back up

221493,443009,T,AT T For My Passive Income Portfolio,opinion,For readers who a new to the matter and my dividend growth philosophy  I funded a virtual portfolio with 100k on October 04  2012 with the aim to build a passive income stream that doubles each five to ten years  I plan to purchase each week one stock holding until the money is fully invested  The total number of constituents is expected at 50   70 companies and the dividend income should be at least at  3 000 per year Let s go forward  The markets in are in a small turmoil  Bernanke announced to reduce its quantitative easing at the beginning of autumn this year  The markets were surprised about the fast mind changing views Let me mention one thing  It s always good to reduce the artificial influence from national banks  It s also good that the Fed is the first institution who sweeps off the enduring mechanism of programs to improve the economy The economy hasn t shown bigger growth signals due the Fed stimulus  The only thing that happens is that the risk of asset bubbles increases rapidly  In order to avoid future price hikes in special markets  they needed to shut down their expansive monetary policy Last Friday I bought AT T shares in an amount of around 1 000 for the Dividend Yield Passive Income Portfolio  The leading telecom provider yields above the 5 percent mark and is one of the biggest companies in the world with a current market capitalization of USD 190 billion AT T provides telecommunications services to consumers  businesses  and other providers in the United States and internationally  The company operates in three segments  Wireless  Wireline  and Other  The Wireless segment offers various wireless voice and data communication services  including local wireless communications services  long distance services  and roaming services  It also sells various handsets  wirelessly enabled computers  and personal computer wireless data cards through its owned stores  agents  or third party retail stores  and accessories comprising carrying cases  hands free devices  batteries  battery chargers  and other items to consumers  as well as to agents and third party distributors As you might have seen  I invest more and more money into telecoms  They are not cheap but they can give me more stability for my asset allocation  In addition  telecoms are some of the biggest losers in my portfolio  Maybe I start to repurchase some shares of China Mobile  Rogers or Tesco if the stock performance worsens I personally believe that telecoms have a tough fight against falling prices on higher volumes  They are something like a utility but in my view they have also a bigger potential than electric or gas utilities  The gird of AT T is a real asset and it will grow  For sure this cost a lot of money and will be a burden of the stock price The new stake will give me around  50 bucks in additional dividend income  For the full year  the income is now expected at  1 905  The current yield is at 3 33 percent while the yield on cost amounts to 3 5 percent The return of the portfolio was hit badly with the recent sell off  Because of the high cash amount of  46 2k it s still manageable  As of now  the life to date performance is at 3 16   The stockholdings had a performance of 4 79 percent Here is the income perspective of the portfolio ,2013-06-24,Dividend Yield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/at-t-for-my-passive-income-portfolio-172510,172510

221497,443013,T,B Of E Studies HFT  Begins And Ends With Ambivalence,opinion,A recent working paper from  reports on efforts to understand the rise of high frequency trading and its impact on equity markets  I think it fair to say that the study fails to get any firm grasp of its subject matter  going   as poet Omar Khayyam wrote  The authors leave the subject by the same ambivalent door they used on the way in  Nonetheless  the trip is instructional  if only of the difficulties inherent in the subject matter  The authors   Evangelos Benos and Satchit Sagade   distinguish between aggressive HFTs  which take liquidity from the marketplace  and passive HFTs  which serve a market making function  providing liquidity   The aggressive HFTs as so defined are the more controversial figures in the HFT world  so one of Benos and Sagade s concerns is to determine the difference that this difference makes  In the chart below the passives are represented by the green line  aggressives by red  and all other traders by blue   The dotted lines represent confidence bands   The graph is designed to show the price impact that the various sorts of traders have  From Liquidity to Volatility It appears that the aggressive HFTs have a larger impact than do the passive  One could rather hastily interpret this to mean that the aggressive HFTs make more of a contribution to price discovery than the passive HFTs  Aha  Then they are serving a function  and their price discovery value justifies the liquidity they soak up  But wait    That inference would be too hasty because as Benos and Sagade also tell us  the larger contribution of the aggressives  is roughly proportional to their larger aggressively executed trading volume   so that on a trade by trade basis  they aren t really more informative than are the market makers after all  There is no firm conclusion to be drawn from studying liquidity  so  let s talk about volatility  Here  too  the authors start with a distinction  There is  good  volatility and there is  excessive  volatility  respectively  information and noise   They ask what HFT does to both  A given trader can of course contribute to both  For example  the authors say  half of a particular party s trades might be informed speculation  contributing to the information value of prices  while the other half are simply  used to calibrate her inventory levels   adding to the level of noise  Adding Hasbrouck to the Mix The authors work from a formula proposed by Joel Hasbrouck in 1991  pt   pt    st  In English prose  They assume with Hasbrouck both a random walk component  p   reflecting the efficient information discounted price and a stationary component  s  reflecting noise  The price at any given time  t  is the sum of both  What does HFT do to s  The answer  again  is ambivalence  On the one hand  the high frequency traders have a higher information to noise ratio than old fashioned human velocity traders  The HFTs in the database employed by these authors participated in only about 27 percent of the total traded volume but contributed  more than half of the total private information that is impounded in prices via trades   On the other hand  they also observe that  there are instances where HFTs contribute significantly more noise than the rest of the traders   and where the aggressive group contributes a good deal more noise than the passive one within the HFT domain  One reason for this is that HFTs typically want to end the day with their positions flat  This may require a lot of uninformed or noisy trades toward the end of a trading session  The conclusion of all this is   no conclusion    The  overall welfare implications of HFT are unclear  these will depends on how the marginal benefit of information at some times compares with the marginal cost of excess volatility at other times  including in periods of market stress   Benos is a Bank of England Research Economist  Co author Sagade is a Ph D  candidate at the ICMA Centre  in Reading ,2013-01-07,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/b-of-e-studies-hft:-begins-and-ends-with-ambivalence-149773,149773
221498,443014,T,TECO Energy  No Big Change Expected ,opinion,In this article  we introduce a tentative pricing model for TECO Energy  TE   This is one of many energy related companies in the S P 500 index  Our pricing model is based on our concept of stock dependence on consumer price index  The intuition is simple and clear  the evolution of a share price is inherently related some goods and services and thus the evolution of their relative prices  For example  it is not easy to ignore the intuition that crude oil has to affect share prices of oil companies  We have reported that such a link exists for   CO P  and formulated an empirical model  On the other hand  the oil price is not the only changing price and other goods and services should obviously affect share prices of oil companies  Thus one needs also some reference price  which best expresses the overall price evolution  An example from life  when one jumps in a moving elevator the net trajectory depends on both the person and elevator  Therefore  our model is seeking two CPI components from a large number of pre selected ones  which minimize the difference between observed  monthly closing price adjusted for dividends and splits  and predicted prices for the period between July 2003 and October 2012  For TE  we use a set of 92 individual consumer price indices to select the best two CPIs in order to describe the evolution of the share price  Our two component model also includes a free term  constant  and a linear time term  which compensates well know linear  time  trends between various CPI components  We allow the modeled share price to lead and lag behind one or both defining CPIs  When the price is lagged  the model is deterministic one and foresees at the horizon of the smallest lag  When the price leads both CPIs  one cannot predict the future of the price but get some information on the future CPIs  In the case of TE  both CPIs are contemporary to the share price and the best fit model is as follows  TE t    1 43R t 0    0 05E t 0    1 49 t 2000    150 92  October 2012 where R t  in the index recreation at time t  E is the index of energy also contemporary to the price   t 2000  is the elapsed time  Figure 1 depicts the evolution of both CPIs  The index of recreation evolves slowly and the energy index has been actually driving the TE price since 2003  Figure 2 depicts the observed and predicted  monthly closing  prices together with the monthly high low prices  which are natural limits of the intermonth price uncertainty  Our model correctly predicted the price since 2003  The model residual error is shown in Figure 3  It has standard deviation of  0 85 for the period between July 2003 and October 2012  For an investor  the evolution of TE is almost fully related to the price index of energy   implies a fall to  40 to  60 by 2016  This may induce a fall in energy prices in the long run and the TE price will be on a down ward trend as well  On this long term trend  there should be periods of high fluctuations associated with elevated market volatility  When the actual price is far below the predicted price  one may consider a profitable  in the short run  share purchase  When the actual price is far above the predicted price  it is best time to sell  Currently  the predicted and observed prices are almost equal  No action needed ,2012-11-22,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/teco-energy:-no-big-change-expected-144622,144622

221500,443016,T,The Rare Earth Sector Needs These Three Things To Prosper,opinion,For too long  the rare earth space has operated in obscurity  Greater clarity on prices  inventory levels and demand will create more market stability  according to Matt Gibson  institutional research analyst with CIBC World Markets  In this Critical Metals Report interview  Gibson emphasizes that rare earths are for the risk takers at least for now  For the strong of stomach  he offers details on trading levels  catalysts and opportunities  How will you place your bets  The Critical Metals Report  Matt  in a recent research report  you noted that the rare earth element  REE  space is being driven by market sentiment  Do you expect sentiment to change in the near term  Matt Gibson  Recent support for REE prices has lifted some of the stocks off the bottom  I think we will need a more prolonged period of price stability to really return a lot of positive sentiment  TCMR  When might that happen  MG  That is tough to say  We need a lot more clarity regarding Japanese demand and Chinese supply  We should have that clarity over the next six to eight months  TCMR  Is getting REE data from inside China easier now than it used to be  MG  There are a number of systems that track pricing data and make it available on Bloomberg terminals now  A number of websites are also dedicated to tracking prices  TCMR  Will that improved transparency provide investors more security  MG  I think it helps  The tough part is knowing how much volume is being traded at a given price  Without volume data  it is hard to evaluate the conviction behind a specific price  The current systems do not always provide volume data  TCMR  You also noted in your report that REE equities have betas up to three times the market  As a benchmark  what is the average beta for an exploration stage base metal company  MG  I would say that your typical producer would have an average beta of about 1 5 times the market and a junior would be closer to twice the market  It is fair to say that high risk  high reward is a characteristic of this space  TCMR  What are the highest beta names in the REE space  MG  Names like Molycorp Inc   MCP NYSE   Avalon Rare Metals Inc   AVL TSX  AVL NYSE  AVARF OTCQX  and Rare Element Resources Ltd   RES TSX  REE NYSE MKT  have the highest beta to REE prices and general sentiment in the space  TCMR  In a June 2012 report you wrote that REE companies were trading at an average of 0 3 times net asset value  NAV   What are they trading at now  on average  MG  The juniors are still trading at that level  Molycorp  being closer to the production stage  is trading at about 0 4 times its NAV  By comparison  the juniors recently touched down at 0 2 times NAV  They have traded as high as one times NAV  TCMR  What are the essentials of your REE equities thesis  MG  Right now it goes back to what I mentioned earlier  prolonged price stability in the overall REE market  clarity about Japanese demand  inventory levels and Chinese supply  A better sense of where global growth in general is going would help  too  TCMR  Looking at your coverage universe from A to Z  Avalon recently amended its process flow sheet to exclude the cost of cracking stage  That will shave  200 million   200M  off its capex and about  70 per ton  t  in operating costs  However  its capex remains close to  1 2 billion   1 2B   Are these changes enough to make Avalon s Nechalacho REE project economic  MG  While shaving off part of the capex and operating costs is important for the economics  I think the real savings lie in derisking the project from an operational and technical standpoint  The company is taking a very complex piece of technology out of the flow sheet  That should help Avalon find a partner for the project and derisk putting Nechalacho into production  TCMR  Why has Avalon not yet made an agreement with an offtake partner  MG  Avalon is dealing with mineralogy that has never been processed before  so it is developing a novel flow sheet  Before pulling the trigger  any potential offtaker or joint venture partner will want to make sure that Avalon has completed the pilot plant testing and product testing phases with a larger volume of material  Avalon is completing its pilot plant testing right now  Once that is done and the definitive feasibility study is finished  potential joint venture partners will be looking at a project with much less risk  TCMR  Is the processing plant in the southern U S  still part of Avalon s plan  MG  Yes  that is where the cracking and separation facility is likely to be located  TCMR  In an August 8  2012 research report on Avalon  you wrote   Trade disruptions between China and the rest of the world will maintain tightness in the market and increase the possibility of a takeover offer for AVL   Who would be the potential suitors in a situation like that  MG  I was thinking that emerging producers like Lynas Corp   LYC ASX  or Molycorp  having a robust production profile for light rare earths  would perhaps be attracted by Avalon s heavy rare earths  However  both of those companies are going through their own growing pains and are experiencing issues with ramping up production  As a result  the timing for potential transactions may have been pushed out into the future  TCMR  What is more likely for Avalon  an offtake agreement  a takeover offer or both  MG  In the near term  an offtake agreement is more likely  TCMR  You also follow Frontier Rare Earths Ltd   FRO TSX   In June  it was trading below cash  Recently  Frontier s joint venture partner  KORES  delayed a   24M payment by two weeks  Should investors be nervous  MG  I do not see any cause for concern over a delayed payment  Frontier ended the quarter with  30M on its balance sheet  the company is not hurting for cash   Editor s note  KORES completed its transaction Friday  Dec  14  and Frontier currently has a cash balance of  52M  TCMR  What makes Frontier attractive compared to other REE equities  MG  Three things make Frontier attractive  Compared to a lot of the other juniors  it has a much higher grade deposit  Its mineralogy has a known processing method  so the company does not have to develop a flow sheet from scratch  Finally  it has a strong financial partner in KORES  TCMR  What is its timeline to production  MG  Ultimately that will depend on permitting and a lot of derisking activities  Right now  I see the project coming into production in the 2016 timeframe  TCMR  Does having a strategic partner like KORES scare off potential takeovers  MG  It could be a deterrent  it also could attract interest  The REE space is very much like a specialized chemical business  Knowing where you will be selling the material at the end of the day and that it will meet an actual customer s needs is attractive in the REE space  TCMR  You also cover Molycorp  the largest of all REE plays in terms of market cap  You have a Sector Outperform rating on Molycorp with a 12 18 month  20 target price  Molycorp was trading at  35 in April  Does Molycorp deserve the beating its share price has taken since then  MG  Whether the price drop is warranted is outside my scope  I will say that several things have contributed to the price decline  One is an increase in capex that affected the valuation  The continued decline in REE prices also contributed  There has been dilution associated with Molycorp s equity financing  And I think the investment community is disappointed with how forthright management has been in discussing the capex increases  TCMR  Not long ago  Molycorp was flush with cash  Now  it will need more capital to complete the ramp up of Mountain Pass  Has the company mismanaged its resources  MG  I do not know if this is a matter of mismanagement  These things tend to happen in projects where you are putting so many components in place  Typically  the labor component ends up costing more than expected  This is mostly a function of how much time it takes to get these projects built and up and running  TCMR  Molycorp should end 2012 producing about

221501,443017,T,Autonation s Share May Fall In Q4 ,opinion,Here we revisit our price model for AutoNations  AN   which we have been modeling since 2009  In March 2012  we presented a new prediction for AN in which we expected no large changes in the first half of 2012  At least the price was not expected to go out of the uncertainty bounds defined by monthly high low prices  This prediction was right  The AN  monthly closing  price was hovering around  35 before it started to grow in July and reached the level of  44 in September 2012  Our current model shown the price to fall back to  35 in the months to come  The closing price for the 12th of November was  40 56  i e  approximately 10  down from the October s closing price  The model suggests that no recommendation to buy AN should be given and there is no reason to keep it in the short run  few months   We will revisit the model in two three months  Two Best CPIsAutoNations is a company from the services sector  as defined by the S P 500  and operates as an automotive retailer in the U S  here we present the current model  which has been obtained by decomposition of the time series of monthly closing share prices  adjusted for splits and dividends  into a weighted sum of two consumer price indices  One might presume that a fast growth in the CPI inherently linked to the AN share price  e g  energy consumer price for energy companies  relative to some independent by dynamic reference should be manifested in a higher pricing power for the company  Therefore  the task is to find the two best  say  in sense of RMS residual error  defining CPIs  It allows testing of the underlying concept  decomposition into CPIs  and to estimate time lags and coefficients for AN  We have borrowed the time series of monthly closing prices of AN from Yahoo com and the relevant  seasonally not adjusted  CPI estimates through September 2012 are published by the BLS  The evolution of AN share price is defined by the consumer price of rent of primary residence  RPR  and the index of financial service  FS   In March 2012  the defining time lags were as follows  the RPR index leads the price by 10 months and the FS index leads by 5 months  The revised model has only one difference  the lag of RPR is one month longer  The relevant best fit models for AN t  are as follows  AN t     1 89RPR t 10    0 36FS t 5    15 47 t 1990    270 31  February 2012 AN t     1 95RPR t 11    0 37FS t 5    16 08 t 2000    439 34  September 2012 where AN t  is the AN share price in U S  dollars  t is calendar time  This model is valid since August 2011 with the same lags and coerffcients  Figure 1 displays the evolution of both defining indices since 2002  Due to the negative coefficient  slope   the sharp drop in the FS index in 2009 best explaines the jump in the share price five months later  Monthly Highs And LowsFigure two depicts the high and low monthly prices for the share together with the predicted and measured monthly closing prices  The predicted prices are well within the bounds of the share price uncertainty before June 2012 and then the curves deviate  This deviation has been growing and presented the challenge to the model  It also supposed that the probability for the price to fall has been increasing with time  The model residual error is shown in Figure 3 with the standard deviation between July 2003 and September 2012 of  2 01  Both CPIs have negative influence on the share price  Therefore  the price should decrease when the indices grow fast ,2012-11-13,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autonation's-share-may-fall-in-q4-143414,143414
221502,443018,T,India s Gold Demand Rises While China Cools ,opinion,Gold demand overall is high as Market sentiment is yet bullish because of the tension in the Middle East and also the Fiscal Cliff  India s Gold demand picked up in Q3 as expected due to re stocking  ahead of the Indian wedding and festive season Gold buying during Diwali in November  India was the world s strongest Gold Market in the third quarter  while Chinese demand slipped due to a softer economy  the World Gold Council reported today  The result is that through the first three quarters of the year  the two countries are neck and neck in the race for total Gold Demand in 2012  Through the end of September  India s Gold Demand moved back out in front at 612 metric tons  while China s was 605  India s Gold Demand rose 9  to 223 1 metric tons in the July September period from 204 8 in the year ago quarter  the WGC said in its quarterly report on trends in demand  India accounted for 30  of global consumer demand  Indian Gold Jewelry buying was up 7  year on year to 136 1 tons and investment demand rose by 12  to 87 0 tons Global Gold Demand reflects challenging global Economic climate  The WGC Report   ETFs up 56  and India up 9  in Q3 2012 Global Gold Demand in Q3 2012 was 1 084 6 tones  t   down 11  from the record Q3 2011 figure of 1 223 5t  This dip in demand is in comparison with exceptional demand in Q3 last year  Gold Demand remains resilient  Q3 2012 was above the five year quarterly average of 984 7t  according to the World Gold Council s Gold Demand Trends Report  In value terms Gold Demand was 14 0  lower year on year at  57 6bn and the average gold price of  1 652 oz was down 3  on the record average Q3 2011 price The key findings from the report are as follows Global investment in ETFs over the quarter was up significantly by 56  on the previous year The Indian market is showing signs of recovery  up 9  to 223 1t from 204 8t in Q3 2011 following increases in both jewelry and investment demand  In comparison with Q3 2011 jewelry demand was up 7  to 136 1t and investment demand rose by 12  to 87 0t  Investors moved into the imitation coin market  up 59   whilst jewelry increased due to re stocking ahead of the Indian wedding and festival season  Indians appear to have acclimatized to recent price trends and have been buying into a rising market In China Gold demand fell 8  to 176 8t in Q3 2012 from 191 2t in Q3 2011 due to falls in jewelry of 6  and investment of 12  mainly  as a result of negative sentiment surrounding China s slowing economy  Jewelry demand was 123 8t in Q3 2012  due to a decline in purchases of 18k pieces and a notable slowdown in the expansion of the retail network  as stock building reduced  Investment demand was down to 53 0t demand this quarter remains 19  above the longer term average Central banks bought 97 6t in the quarter  In six out of the last seven quarters  central bank Gold demand has been around 100t  which is a sharp increase from as recently as 2010  The year to date figure for central bank buying is up 9  Marcus Grubb  Managing Director  Investment at the World Gold Council said  Gold is beginning to re establish itself as part of the fabric of the financial system  In the medium term  the quantitative easing initiatives in the West and the continuing growth story in the East  particularly in India and China  coupled with the seasonally strong quarter coming up in Asia  are excellent indicators for further growth in the Gold Market  Against a backdrop of continued global economic uncertainty and elections in China and the US  it is clear from five year rising demand trends that gold s fundamental property as a vehicle for capital preservation continues to endure  as evidenced by this quarter s increase in global ETF investment  up 56  and continued purchasing by central banks  the ultimate long term investors Gold Demand and supply statistics for Q3 2012 Third quarter Gold demand of 1 084 6t was down 11 0  in comparison to Q3 2011 The value measure of Gold demand was 14 0  lower year on year at  57 6bn The average gold price of  1 652 oz was down 3  on the record average Q3 2011 price Investment demand  the sum of ETFs and total bar and coin demand  was 429 9t  down 16  compared to the same quarter last year  but was 23  above the five year average Demand for Gold ETF and similar products in Q3 were up by 56 0  on the previous year to 136 0T Demand in the jewelry sector was down 2 0  to 448 8T compared to 458 0T in the same quarter in 2011  The ongoing slowdown in China continued to dampen demand in the second largest regional jewelry marketThird quarter Gold demand in the technology sector was down on Q3 2011 by 6 0  at 108 0T though remains stable  Use of gold in electronics has shown a steady level of incremental growth since Q4 2011  driven by demand for tablet devices and mobile phones among others Both the supply of gold and recycling were down 2  in the third quarter compared to year earlier levels  with mine production down 1  for Q3 2012 China Unveils New Top Leaders  China on Thursday unveiled the elite group of leaders who will set the agenda for the country for the next decade  presenting them to journalists from around the globe after months of secretive bargaining and abundant speculation  The seven members of the committee that sits atop China s political system strode out onto a stage in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing  reported CNN They were led by Xi Jinping  who takes over from Hu Jintao as head of the Communist Party  which has ruled China for more than 60 years  Xi is joined on the new Politburo Standing Committee  the party s top decision making body  by Li Keqiang  who is expected to replace Wen Jiabao as premier early next year  Xi also succeeded Hu as head of China s powerful Central Military Commission  which oversees major national security and military affairs  That makes for a cleaner transition than in the past two power handovers  when the former party chiefs held onto the key military role for years afterward  using it to keep exercising considerable power and influence Xi s immediate assumption of the military leadership  unlike his two predecessors  and the decision to cut the Standing Committee to seven from nine leave fewer voices to obstruct consensus and may help him consolidate control  Those moves may also speed up decisions on challenges ranging from an economic revamp and shrinking the nation s wealth gap to a strengthened campaign against corruption and

221506,443022,T,A Critical Metals Mixed Bag  Chris Ecclestone,opinion,A flood of companies scrambled to capitalize on the rare earths space  overpopulating the sector with too many losing bets  according to Chris Ecclestone  a mining strategist with Hallgarten   Co  in London  Now  a downturn in the sector should reveal which companies have the pedigree to make it to production  Ecclestone says  In this exclusive Critical Metals Report interview  learn which other metals and minerals are getting the market s attention with positive fundamentals  The Critical Metals Report  With so many players entering the rare earth elements race  you ve said it s gone from the Kentucky Derby to something akin to the Gypsy Horse Fair  How can investors make sense of it  Chris Ecclestone  Well  the next phase after the Gypsy Horse Fair is the glue factory  There are more than 300 rare earth companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange  Even 200 would be too many  This space should really have 30 public companies  with probably five in production in the next five or six years  while the rest fiddle around exploring  I think there will be a rush of these companies tacking  Gold  onto the end of their names and saying   Hey  look  We re a gold story now   All the better  too  because the space is overcrowded with non serious people with very mediocre properties  The amount of capital that was sucked into the vast number of rare earth stocks that have gone nowhere has detracted from the few that are serious players and that are going to get into production  The legitimate companies have been rather capital starved in recent times because of the bad odor that has surrounded the rare earth space  TCMR  Which companies are among the handful that you do like  CE  Molycorp Inc   MCP NYSE  is doing all the right things  Vertical integration is key  Molycorp was able to use what was probably an overvaluation in its stock price to acquire Silmet and Neo Materials  Those were very clever deals  Another good example is Great Western Minerals Group Ltd   GWG TSX V  GWMGF OTCQX   I like the Steenkampskraal Mine in South Africa a lot  The mine is not in production right now  but Great Western has been processing for years with its wholly owned subsidiaries  Less Common Metals Ltd  and Great Western Technologies Inc  People say that Frontier Rare Earths Ltd   FRO TSX  is likely to get into production  All that really depends on getting a partner  Frontier looks OK from that point of view  Then you have companies in Australia involved in xenotime  which is a rare earth phosphate mineral that s used for coating jet engines due to its heat resistant element  There s a whole magnet culture in rare earths  but there are a lot of other rare earth applications other than magnets  Magnets are not the only way forward  There s a list of products that are made from the whole group  Seventeen elements make up the rare earth suite  TCMR  With rare earths generating less investor interest compared to 2011  some of those companies have started to promote their secondary projects  for example tantalum or niobium properties  How does this work  and what do investors need to be aware of in evaluating these projects  CE  Some of these companies actually start off as tantalum stories  In fact  the tantalum or niobium property may have once been its main property  which is obvious if you look at the grades  It s similar to some uranium producers that located a small amount of rare earths and said   Oh  we re not uranium now  We re rare earths because uranium is in the dumpster   But tantalum has an interesting dynamic  The problem is  Is it going to be economic to mine these really low grade deposits  Is having a really big resource at a really low grade a compelling property  The niobium market is totally dominated by two mines  one of which is the Niobec mine in Qu bec  which is owned by IAMGOLD Corp   IMG TSX  IAG NYSE   Between IAMGOLD and CBMM s Araxa mine  they ve got a little more than 90  of the market  which they ve kept really well serviced  The end users feel pretty comfortable about the way it s managed  Nobody is going to upset the apple cart by promoting other niobium properties  TCMR  With rare elements on the backburner  you re looking more closely at other critical metals and minerals  such as tungsten  fluorspar and antimony  Starting at the top  what does an investor need to know about tungsten  CE  Look for companies with past producing properties  Tungsten mines can last for 50  60  or even 80 years  Malaga Inc  s  MLG TSX  Pasto Bueno mine in Peru has been operating since the turn of the century  With tungsten  it s better to go with the tried and true  TCMR  Ammonium paratungstate  which is the raw material from which tungsten is separated  was priced at about  450 ton  t  this time last year  What s it trading at now  CE  It s come off  but it hasn t come off that much  It s under  400 t at the moment  Industrial demand may be sort of sloppy  but it s still a great price enough to justify production of some of these old mines that have been closed down  TCMR  You mentioned Malaga and its tungsten mine in Peru  In February  it increased its Proven and Probable reserves by 16  and its Measured and Indicated resource by 140   What sort of advantage is it to have a growing tungsten producing mine outside of China  CE  There s always an advantage to having a growing resource  It also pleases the Canadian retail crowd  who want to see a forward moving resource  The mineralization just goes on and on forever  That s really the nature of the tungsten deposit  Malaga has quite dramatic expansion plans that could double or triple the amount of production  I think the market s there for that at the moment  But that inflow of extra production is liable to choke off the demand for some of the more expensive projects out there  TCMR  Basically  Malaga supports the industry to a point where there s excess supply  CE  I m not sure we re going to see excess supply for a few years yet  It s a fair way until we start seeing some flow out of these other companies  Largo Resources Ltd   LGO TSX V  in Brazil is working over an old tungsten mine  which is particularly rich  But altogether  it s still only a single digit percentage of global production coming from each one of these  These projects are not really making a big dent in China s dominance  TCMR  Let s move on to fluorspar  What s the investment thesis for fluorspar  CE  Most people have never heard of fluorspar  but rare earths  tungsten  antimony it s all the same story  The Chinese took it out of the ground  destroyed the competition by giving it away  then stopped exporting it in large volumes  The same thing is happening with fluorspar  More and more companies are weary of moving their factories to China  The only way that they can guarantee that they don t have to do that is to find an alternative source of supply  It doesn t matter what metal you re in  if you ve got a proprietary technology  you re the end user and the processor  You better find yourself another source of production or the Chinese are going to come calling and say   If you want to keep getting this product  you have to move your factory to Shanghai   The Japanese were effectively told they needed to move their plants and many of them did  but now everyone s a bit spooked by that  TCMR  Are there any serious players on the fluorspar side  CE  Definitely  Canada Fluorspar Inc   CFI TSX V  has an offtake agreement with France s leading chemical company  Arkema  Before  there just wasn t the economics to do that until the Chinese started tightening the screws  TCMR  Canada Fluorspar is developing the St  Lawrence Mine in Newfoundland and expects a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  in early 2013  The mine previously produced fluorspar  What are your thoughts on that project  CE  It s a good development  The company can t do much better than having a  sugar daddy  through an offtake agreement  I don t think there s that much room for a lot more players  South Africa is currently the largest producer of fluorspar  There are a few players down there  some of which are owned by Spanish or German end users  There might be room for three or four more market entrants  TCMR  The British Geological Survey says that antimony is in critically short supply  Does that mean the price of antimony could be on a steep upward climb  CE  It used to be   2 000 4 000 t for decades  But now there s a strong suspicion that the Chinese have really have blown the resource up  They haven t got anything left  That is producing panic because antimony mines are very rarely large  at least not in the West  Any replacement mines are likely going to be extremely small and may provide just 1  of global supply  Antimony appears in veins  The grade is frequently good  but the grade in the vein is sometimes 7  and the veins are never wide  TCMR  What is antimony mostly used for  CE  It s used in plastics as a fire retardant  The main market force behind that was the auto industry  where the need for lighter vehicles meant that more plastic needed to be used  Vehicles would essentially become like bombs if automakers used the old types of plastic  Antimony is a product that goes in the mix to provide that fire retardant quality  TCMR  Why should investors be interested in antimony  CE  It s got one of the best price dynamics out there  Largely  the demand is going up  but the supply is going down  And there is no quick fix  There is no Molycorp or Lynas that s going to be on the scene to build a mega antimony mine  because mega antimony mines do not exist  They never have  Except for that one freakishly large mine in China  all the rest are miniscule  TCMR  Antimony is usually produced as a byproduct  Are there any publicly traded companies producing antimony as a byproduct that you re following  CE  Mandalay Resources Corp   MND TSX  would like us to believe that it s a gold company producing antimony  but I think it is more of an antimony company with a gold byproduct  Antimony often occurs with some other metal  like lead or gold  If a company can get antimony and gold together  it s hit the jackpot  Mandalay has that  It also has enormous potential to develop other antimony mines  TCMR  About 70  of Mandalay is controlled by institutional investors  Is that cause for concern  CE  No  it s great  I like that  The more institutional investors  the better  The market loves that come hell or high water  TCMR  It seems to be fairly well situated  too  in that there s infrastructure around it  CE  Yes  there are roads and railroads there  It s a really old mine  it was found in the 1860s  It just goes to show that tungsten and antimony mines can go on forever  There are some interesting things going on in reviving old antimony mines in the Maritime provinces in Canada  Nova Scotia to the heartland is where production has been in the past  Watch that area because that s where you re going to start seeing it happen again  TCMR  Let s bookend this discussion with rare earths  How will investors know when to return to the rare earth sector  Is now the time  while things are still incredibly undervalued  CE  I would selectively return to a couple of names  But be hyper selective because the rest of the rare earth companies will be flapping their gums  TCMR  Thanks for speaking with us today   is a

221507,443023,T,Weighing The Week Ahead  Time For A Confidence Rebound ,opinion,Everyone agrees that the economic recovery has been disappointing  There is no consensus on the cause  Nearly everyone has missed the most crucial element  The crisis of confidence  Confidence is essential to economic success  as we have known for more than a century  Listen to this brief sound clip  instantly recognizable to many The background story is not so well known  The TeachingHistory site provides  of the drafts of FDR s first Inaugural Address  and the changes involved  The most memorable line was actually taken from discussions in the business community  as noted here  When confidence is lacking  we get less  not all or nothing  but less  of the following  Employers are less willing to expand    new plants  new workers Potential entrepreneurs are less willing to act    new businesses  new jobs Young families are less willing to buy new homes Anyone worried about employment is less willing to make a major purchase Banks are more reluctant to lend And many other similar effects Without the ingredient of confidence  the economic engine is missing an element  It is time to retire the  pushing on a string analogy  which has outlived its usefulness  I suggest that we call this the  Confidence Gap   We have all of the elements for the economic engine    deferred demand  strong balance sheets  and potential profits for all  There is one thing missing  I think of it as the  spark plug gap  being a little too wide  but that is because my education includes  with his cap at a jaunty angle  Who is responsible for the  confidence gap   There are plenty of candidates  especially after last year s debt ceiling fiasco  I ll offer some of my own expectations in the conclusion  but first let us do our regular review of last week s news  Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead  There are many good sources for a list of upcoming events  One source I especially like is the weekly post from the WSJ s   In contrast  I highlight a smaller group of events  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios   This is unlike my other articles where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context   Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market  Last Week s Data   Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good The news last week was very good  even better than the market result  Rail traffic is better  especially measured by intermodal traffic  See  and his helpful chart Sentiment  a contrarian indicator  is below the bullish average of the recent market rise   Housing had a good initial reaction to the QE3 announcement    Home sales data were encouraging    where you can see a comprehensive look at sales and building permits as well as this revealing look at the improving inventory situation The Bad There was plenty of bad news last week Flash PMI indicators from Europe were weak  via multiple sources   I noted this source in last week s preview  There is a thirst for data because we are so interested in news from Europe and China  The same pundits who express skepticism about  surveys  rush to embrace this source  I am watching  but with some caution  I like to see a longer track record Initial jobless claims remained in the danger zone  Seasonal factors might still be in play  but I continue to regard this as bad news  Here is the long term perspective in the  Greece is headed back to the front burner for market worries  Our key source on that topic  The New Athenian  notes both the  and the  toward meeting Troika requirements  The Greek dilemma remains on the agenda for a Euro solution Gasoline prices rise again    up more than four cents  Check out this and other  mixed  high frequency indicators  Leading Economic Indicators had a slight decline   puts this in historical perspective The Ugly Denard      I am expecting a rebound from my favorite college player  but this is a great illustration of dispassionate investing versus emotion  I am cheering for Michigan    as usual    but not investing   Meanwhile  readers are invited to submit ugly news that I should have noted  The Indicator Snapshot It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators  The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions  The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses  The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found    Bob and I recently did some videos explaining the recession history  I am working on a post that will show how to use this method  As I have written for many months  there is no imminent recession concern  I recently showed the significance of by explaining the relationship to the business cycle  The evidence against the ECRI recession forecast continues to mount  It is disappointing that those with the best forecasting records get so much less media attention  The idea that a recession has already started is losing credibility with most observers  I urge readers to check out the list of excellent updates from prior posts  Readers might also want to review my new   which explains many of the concepts people get wrong  The single best resource for the ECRI call and the ongoing debate is Doug Short   describes the complete history  the critics  and how it has played out  The post highlights the most important economic indicators used in identifying recessions  showing that none have rolled over  Doug updates the recession debate every week and includes a great chart of the  big four  indicators used by the NBER in recession dating  This has become a mandatory weekly read for those who are still worried about a new recession   Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  This week we continued as bullish after a brief stint at  neutral   These are one month forecasts for the poll  but Felix has a three week horizon  The ratings have moved a little higher  and the confidence has improved from last week  It has been a close call over the last few weeks   For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer   The Week Ahead There is a busier calendar for data this week  As noted above  my grading of the reports relates to what I see as important  The  A List  includes the following  Consumer Confidence  Conf Board   T  as an important confirming concurrent indicatorInitial claims  Th  which continue to provide the most up to date read on jobs and the economy The  B List  includes several reports Michigan Sentiment  F  is as important as the Conference Board  but we already have the preliminary read for the month Chicago PMI    once again more significant because of the weekend before the national PMI  This is the most reliable of the regional indicators Personal income and spending for August  F   Other indicators may seem fresher  but this is important confirmation and could move the market Durable goods  TH  has the same significance and interpretation as Personal Income There will be assorted speeches by central bankers  but the key discussion will be about Spain  The market wants Spain to agree to a bit more austerity and request an official bailout  This news will be greeted as bullish  sending Spanish yields lower  the Euro higher  and US stocks higher as well  This may seem counter intuitive to some  but that will be the take  Watch for it  Trading Time Frame Felix has moved back into a marginally bullish posture over the last two weeks  but it has been a close call  In practice  the official forecast has mattered little to our trading positions  Felix became more aggressive in a timely fashion  near the start of the summer rally  Since we only require three buyable sectors  the trading accounts look for the  bull market somewhere  even when the overall picture is neutral  The ratings have been getting a little stronger  so we maintain the profitable trades  Felix does not try to call tops and bottoms  but instead keeps us on the right side of major moves  either up or down  Investor Time Frame Many long term investors have simply   Here is an astounding research finding   One surprising finding shows that investors are likely so consumed by the negative economic news  including high unemployment and the weak housing market  that they haven t even noticed the strength of the stock market  For example  when 1 000 investors were asked whether they thought the S P was up or down during each of the past three years  66  thought it was down in 2009  48  thought it was down in 2010  and 53  thought it was down last year  In fact  the S P gained 26 5  in 2009  15 1  in 2010  and 2 1  last year   Those worried that it is  too late  to invest should read Eddy Elfenbein s nice post    including this chart   Understanding the attractive fundamental conditions is the first step for the long term investor  but it does not mean that you should be going  all in   How much risk should you take  The right answer is different for everyone  but too many people choose  zero   These investors do not follow the Buffett advice of buying when others are fearful  Then  when the market rallies  they are afraid that they are  too late   I wrote a new article  Stock Prices and the Fundamentals  Don t be Fooled  showing how to avoid this trap  The answer is not going  all in  since most of us have to pay more attention to short term risk than does Mr  Buffett  Should you worry about the  fiscal cliff   The basic answer is  not yet   I explain why in two articles  The first reveals my one word solution  The second offers   and how I am investing for the long term program  If you have been following our regular advice  you have done the following  Replaced your bond mutual funds with individual bonds  bond funds are very risky   Sold some calls against your modest dividend stocks to enhance yield to the 10  range  andAdded some octane with a reasonable allocation of good stocks There is nothing more satisfying than getting yield and call premiums  even if stocks move sideways  If you have not done so  it is certainly not too late  We have collected some of our recent recommendations in a     a starting point for the long term investor   Comments and suggestions welcome   Final Thoughts on Confidence There are some glimmers of improvement  The latest WSJ NBC poll includes these two results  where you can see their other six key takeaways   A burst of  right direction  optimism  Nearly four in 10 people said that the country is  headed in the right direction    the highest that number has been in NBC WSJ polling since January 2009  By way of comparison  in NBC WSJ polling in August  July and June the  right direction  number never rose above 32 percent  Important piece of context  A majority of people   55 percent   still say that things are off on the  wrong track  Economy improving   In a bounce similar to the  right direction  improvement noted above  42 percent of people now believe the economy will get better over the next year  an improvement from the 36 percent who said the same just a month ago  That burst of optimism comes not from those who had previously been pessimistic   18 percent in both the August and September NBC WSJ poll said the economy would get worse   but rather from movement among those who had previously predicted the status quo  38 percent in August  and now feel more optimistic  32 percent in September  This is only a start  but most readers probably are not seeing these indicators in their regular reading  Tracking confidence measures of all sorts is important for investors  This is how we will discover that prospects are improving     or not  This week s upcoming data will provide updated information on consumer sentiment  We will see more on the candidates and general economic sentiment as well  The Payoff    If Confidence Returns to Normal Some astute observers see plenty of upside  JP Morgan s Thomas Lee notes that if the S P earnings yield merely equaled the high yield bond  a frequent past metric   the S P 500 would be at 1600  Check out the to see what else might happen before election day  It is going to take heightened confidence before we see this  but it certainly could happen ,2012-09-24,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-time-for-a-confidence-rebound-137387,137387
221508,443024,T,Crude And Steel Still In Sync ,opinion,We have been reporting on the trade off between the producer price index of crude oil  domestic production  and the PPI of iron and steel since 2009  It has been always a linear and lagged link between them  Our previous update included PPI data through March 2012  Here we present an annual wrap up   We reported that the PPI of crude oil had been likely evolving in sync with that of iron and steel  but with a lag of two months in September 2009  In order to present both indices in a comparable form  the difference between a given index  iPPI  i e  iron steel and crude   and the overall PPI was normalized to the PPI   iPPI t  PPI t   PPI t   These normalized differences represent the evolution of the rate of deviation from the PPI over years   Figure 1 depicts the corresponding time histories of the normalized deviations from the PPI  including the most recent period through August 2012  Even a simple visual inspection reveals the following feature  the  normalized deviation from the PPI of the  index of iron and steel lags by approximately two months behind the  normalized  index of crude oil  Figure 1  The deviation of the iron and steel price index and the index of crude oil from the PPI  normalized to the PPI   In order to reduce both deviations to the same scale we additionally normalized the curves in Figure 1 to their peak values between 2005 and 2012    iPPI t  PPI t    PPI t  max iPPI PPI     This scaling allows a direct comparison of corresponding shapes  In Figure 2  we display the normalized index of iron and steel shifted by two months ahead to synchronize its peak with that observed in the normalized index for crude petroleum  The scaled index of crude demonstrates just short term deviations from the index of iron and steel in the overall shape and timing of the peak and trough  Simple smoothing with MA 3  makes the curves resemblance even better  As an extra benefit of the resemblance  one can use the two month lag to predict the future of the iron and steel price index  Figure 2  Deviation of the iron and steel price index from the PPI  normalized to the PPI and the peak value after 2005 as compared to the deviations of the index for crude petroleum normalized in the same way  The normalized index for iron and steel is shifted two months ahead  ConclusionThe link between oil and iron has been unbreakable  Between 2006 and 2012  the deviation of the price index of iron and steel from the PPI in the USA repeats the trajectory of the deviation of the index of crude petroleum  domestic production  with a two month lag  Therefore  the prediction of iron and steel price for at this horizon is a straightforward one ,2012-10-04,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crude-and-steel-still-in-sync-138733,138733

221510,443026,T,Wall Street Exposed   Part 3   How Dividends Create Value,opinion,Before we dicuss how the mechanism of dividends keeps the stock  and by extension market  somewhat rational we need to review what we have learned thus far about the sneakyisms of Wall Street     discussed the necessity of having dividends to anchor share prices to company fundamentals  Part 2 showed why share buybacks are an inferior method of transferring wealth from firm to shareholder   and that is if you believe that it succeeds in doing that at all  The third segment in this Wall Street expose is to show how dividends work in creating ballast for your investment vehicle which will keep your portfolio afloat    Dividends and a Zero Growth Economy   To illustrate this  assume that the economy falls into zero growth and stays that way perpetually  Does this mean that it is impossible to make money investing  Not at all  But consider two companies   one is a defensive dividend stock and the other was formerly a high growth tech stock  Defensive Dividends   100 per share  Earnings yield of 10   PE of 10   Payout ratio 50   dividend yield 5  Techie Titan   100 per share  Earnings yield of 5   PE of 20   No dividendsIf you invested in the Defensive Dividends stock you would be locking in a 5  yield and there is the potential to get up to a 10  dividend yield if payout ratios are boosted  Remember we are assuming zero earnings growth   Will share prices fall  Maybe but likely not fall too far as it forces the yield up  In a no growth economy  it is unlikely that investors wouldn t be interested in a 10  yield in a company with defensive earnings  This would provide lift to the prices to bring yield back down thus protecting your capital    But where is the floor in the Techie Titan  If they offer dividends you ll likely see prices fall in half since a 50  payout ratio at current valuations is only a 2 5  dividend yield  If they didn t offer dividends what is the worth of this no growth company  It could be much lower indeed  Dividends provide support for share prices  Dropping prices mean bigger yields which increases attractiveness for investors  Granted  if the profit falls or the dividend is cut  this can create more downward pressure  But all things being equal  a decent yielding dividend stock has more ballast in the share price than a non dividend stock  Look at China small cap stocks and how low valuations can get since they refuse to pay dividends  If these firms paid dividends   even a small one   the prices would be supported at much higher levels  Even in risky stocks people are willing to invest  even if only a small amount  when yields start getting in the high teens and low 20s    Jumping Yields and Price Support   Some investors time their purchases by looking at dividend yield compared to historical averages  When hte yield gets too high they start buying  When yields get too low due to rapid share price advance  they go back to saving up cash  Look at the company AT T  T  and note how you could have made money by simply buying systematically when yields broke above 5   5 5  and holding  When the sky was falling in 2008 and 2009  a dividend yield on AT T above 6  seemed to be the sweet spot for investors to jump on board    Granted  dividends are derived from profit and profit is not a constant that we can plot  This means that we cannot dogmatically say that you should buy high yield stocks that are well above their 5 year average since revenue and earnings might be shrinking at this is being priced in advance  But the point I am trying to make is how a dividend policy can provide a bottom floor that will attract investors when prices fall too far  This is your ballast since there is a direct link between lower share prices and higher income streams  Dividends help create an equilibrium between share price and income for a smoother ride    Paying Dividends Creates Deep Value   In addition to dividends being a transparent and fair method of transferring company wealth to shareholder and creating a tangible link between firm value and share price  it is also a useful mechanism to keep your dividend yields strong  How so    It is important to remember that dividends come from profit  The lower the price is in relation to profit the higher the dividend you can achieve  Wouldn t it be good if we could keep share prices down for a nice strong and consistent income payment  Sure  but how would you do so  Prices typically only drop when earnings fall right  Wrong  You can remove equity from a company and lower share prices which will boost your dividend yield provided this removal of equity doesn t directly lower future earnings  Here is an example  A certain utility company trades at  12 per share  The payout ratio is 80  and the dividend is at  1 per share with small annual increases  This means the dividend yield is now at 8 3   The company has been slowly accumulating cash and now has  2 per share in liquid assets  This is factored into the share price  If the company were to announce a one time special dividend  what would happen to the share price  Shares must fall on ex dividend date by the same amount as the dividend anything less would work out as an arbitrage play in the short term  No money made or lost right  Well look at the picture with longer range lenses Let s assume for simplicity sake that the  2 per share in cash and  1 per share profit are paid out all at once  This  3 per share removal of equity drops shares down to  9 as anything less will allow short term profiteering  Although the book value has dropped 25   the future profits did not drop 25  or  1 to 75 cents  Even if profits remain the same  the price to earnings ratio is now more attractive despite the removal of equity  Dividend yield is now 11  and the future earning potential remains the same  This means that you are either getting a better income return or that share prices need to bounce back up over the next while to maintain valuations  Either way this is a win win situation for the shareholder and it doubles up as a protection that keeps executives and their stock options at a distance    In fact  I would be even happier if the company could sell all its assets and give the cash to shareholders if future profits were not harmed  In a limited sense  this is what is happening when dividends are given back  Prices are temporarily depressed  the opposite of open market buybacks  which creates deeper value in one of the only metrics that matters to dividend investors   the price to earnings ratio  and not price to cash revenue assets   By continually removing equity from the company  the share price s valuations are continually lowered  thus resulting in stronger support for capital gain and income yields combined  Academics wonder why there s a premium or extra market wide performance on low price to book ratio stocks  maybe they should look into the dividend mechanism that lowers book value compared to the price to earnings ratio    Now that we scratched the surface of the market and examined the importance of dividends for sane valuation and sustainable profit taking  we are going to switch gears for a while and talk about the myth of risk  What really is risk  Is it possible that financial experts that blow off all these fancy risk adjusted ratios are really just blowing smoke into the air  Has Wall Street pulled the wool over your eyes again  Part 4 will reveal the answer ,2012-07-16,Portfolio

221511,443027,T,Weighing The Week Ahead  It s All About Jobs,opinion,From start to finish  the coming week will have a heightened focus on employment  Labor Day weekend in a presidential election year provides the obvious backdrop  Stubbornly high unemployment and sluggish economic growth underscore the issue of greatest concern This popular chart from Calculated Risk shows the nature of this recovery  described in terms of employment  So little accomplished  and so far  so far to go    What are the solutions  Republicans contend that Obama policies  even augmented by aggressive Fed action  have failed  Expect the Democrats to use their convention to blame Congress  The week culminates with the monthly employment situation report for August  It is more important than ever  since most see the data as significant in determining the Fed s next move  I ll offer some of my own expectations in the conclusion  but first let us do our regular review of last week s news  Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead   There are many good sources for a list of upcoming events  With foreign markets setting the tone for US trading on many days  I especially like the comprehensive calendar from Investing com  There is also helpful descriptive and historical information on each item  In contrast  I highlight a smaller group of events  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios  This is unlike my other articles  where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context  Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market Last Week s Data Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good There was very little data last week  and the news was open to varying interpretations  Bernanke threads the needle  The Fed Chair did better than I forecast last week  since I thought that anything less than a clear policy statement would disappoint markets  He did enough hinting to satisfy  while making it clear that more data is needed  Of the many discussions of his speech  I want to emphasize those most helpful for investors  I like the  and also the   For those of us who are interested in what we expect to happen  we should respect the conclusion Mr  Bernanke acknowledged some of the hurdles he faces  noting   It is true that nontraditional policies are relatively more difficulty to apply   he said  But he left little doubt that he sees the benefits of trying   Over the past five years  the Federal Reserve has acted to support economic growth and foster job creation   he said   and it is important to achieve further progress  particularly in the labor market   Rail traffic is at a four year high  via    Sentiment  has backed off from excessively bullish levels  On a contrarian basis  this is positive ECB President Draghi skipped the Jackson Hole Symposium  The market saw this as good news as participants concluded that the ECB team was  on a specific proposal for next week  We shall see about that  but the stories on this front got a positive reaction Housing is showing strength   calls it a  significant turn   Still only back to the 1999 or 2000 levels in real terms  the nominal prices do show an uptick  See  for the expected fine analysis and several charts The Bad There was negative news  but fairly modest in overall significance  GM idling Volt plant for four weeks  beginning September 17th  The July employment data was positively influenced because the traditional summer plant closings did not take place  This plant   who will receive 90  of normal pay from unemployment compensation   For those of us watching employment data  it is something to note Spain continues to delay in asking for help  The market reacts negatively  since it delays the process  It is rational for Spain  since the objective is to get the best possible terms  They want to see the ECB proposal The Bundesbank s Jens Weidmann is  over expanded ECB bond buying  This is a natural response  and a good bargaining posture  Chancellor Merkel has urged him to stay on the board and make his views clear More bad news on China s economic growth as the  flash  PMI    and hits a   We all want to get the best data on China  The flash index differs from official data  Actual consumption of key inputs may differ from either of these surveys  One key input is iron ore  so I was intrigued by the thoughtful analysis from the FT s Izabella Kaminska    There is an intriguing analysis of the data and some good charts  China watchers    and that should be all of us    need more reporting like this Consumer Confidence  via the Conference Board  was weaker  Here is the long term chart  The University of Michigan report was slightly better than expectations The Ugly Individual investor knowledge  The SEC studied this by doing some tests with fake fund prospectuses  They discovered that investors did not even grasp the basics   of the study  Meanwhile  there is an increase in day trading among individual investors  The Silver Bullet I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  This week s award goes to Todd Sullivan  who has some   His work qualifies for the Silver Bullet because so many prominent pundits have been completely wrong on this subject  He fearlessly takes on the big names like the ECRI  David Rosenberg  Nouriel Roubini  and Nassim Taleb  He highlights the most important aspect of the discouraging employment picture  the drag from the continuing loss of government jobs  If you view the data in terms of private employment growth  the picture is quite different   Todd s analysis should help anyone who wants a complete picture of the sources of sluggish growth  The Indicator Snapshot It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators  The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions  The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses  The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found   Bob and I recently did some videos explaining the recession history  I am working on a post that will show how to use this method  As I have written for many months  there is no imminent recession concern  I recently showed the significance of this by explaining the relationship to the business cycle  The evidence against the ECRI recession forecast continues to mount  It is disappointing that those with the best forecasting records get so much less media attention  The idea that a recession has already started is losing credibility with most observers  I urge readers to check out the list of excellent updates from prior posts  Readers might also want to review my new   which explains many of the concepts people get wrong  The single best resource for the ECRI call and the ongoing debate is Doug Short  This week s article    describes the complete history  the critics  and how it has played out  The article highlights the most important economic indicators used in identifying recessions  showing that none have rolled over   The Bonddad Blog also has a   With the release of personal income  we now know the values of all four series thought to guide the NBER s recession dating decisions  While all of these series are subject to revisions  of course  as of now the simple fact is that all four rose in July  and three of the four are at post recession records  So unless they are revised significantly downward  the simple fact is that no new recession started in July  Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  This week we switched to neutral  We have been bullish since June 23rd  with a one week move to neutral a month ago  These are one month forecasts for the poll  but Felix has a three week horizon  The ratings have moved lower  and the confidence has deteriorated from last week   For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer   The Week Ahead While there will be fewer reports this week  the news will be especially significant  The  A List  is all about jobs  The monthly employment situation report  F  will be important for markets  the Fed  and the political campaign Initial claims  Th  which continue to provide the most up to date read on jobs and the economy ADP  Th  releases private employment data The ECB provides more information on its bond buying plans  Th  The ISM reports on manufacturing  T  The  B List  includes three reports  ISM services  Th  Construction spending  W  Auto sales  W  The Democratic convention will also provide plenty of additional discussion about jobs    Trading Time Frame Our trading positions continued in fully invested mode last week  Felix became more aggressive in a timely fashion  near the start of the summer rally  Since we only require three buyable sectors  the trading accounts look for the  bull market somewhere  even when the overall picture is neutral  As the tape has improved  the ratings from Felix have gotten stronger  Felix does not try to call tops and bottoms  but keeps us on the right side of major moves  We had one  neutral  forecast about a month ago  but things never got weak enough to reduce positions  The ratings are weaker  but there are still several attractive sectors to own  Investor Time Frame Sources continue to highlight the overbought nature of pure dividend stocks  This week Bespoke  for stocks with different yields   Dividend investing is fine  but you must look past the dividend yield and study the earnings  earnings growth rate  cash flow  balance sheet  and payout ratio  If you have been following our regular advice  you have done the following  Replaced your bond mutual funds with individual bonds Sold some calls against your modest dividend stocks to enhance yield to the 10  range  andAdded some octane with a reasonable input of good stocks There is nothing more satisfying than collecting good returns in a sideways market  If you have not done so  it is certainly not too late  We have collected some of our recent recommendations in a     a starting point for the long term investor   Comments welcome   Final Thoughts on Employment I am not expecting a strong employment report   I ll do my regular monthly preview at mid week   Because of the expectation of Fed action  the impact of the report may be dampened  Real weakness will be seen as confirming Fed action  It has been a confusing year  even for professionals  Traders   have been under invested and wrong throughout the year  He writes as follows  Oh  and did I mention that 90 percent of the traders I know are underperforming the S P 500  which is up 12 percent this year   There is something lurking out there     we cannot continue to have central bank stimulation forever  with more debt layered on more debt   one trader said to me  He  too  is underperforming   I m long 20 percent of what I would normally be long in a market like this  I gotta own it because my neighbor owns it  that s a silly investment concept  but it s worked this year   he said  He also notes that 90  of traders expect an imminent correction of 10   something that he sees as a contrarian indicator  Top strategists are also pretty bearish  Bespoke reports on the year end price targets  Check out the  to see how little these have changed throughout the year  Part of the explanation is that traders and strategists both seem to have focused too much on the obvious problems and under estimated the resolve and power of governments and central banks  Nearly every commentary on the Fed emphasizes the author s opinion of what policy should be Those of us who focus instead on understanding and predicting policy decisions  regardless of our personal views  have a real advantage This will get increasingly difficult in the weeks before the election ,2012-09-02,Jeff
