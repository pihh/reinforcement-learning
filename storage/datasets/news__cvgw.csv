21891,243406,CVGW,Dig Into DuPont Analysis With These 5 Top Ranked Stocks ,opinion,"Return on equity is one of the most sought after metrics by investors  The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the 16 stocks that made it through the screen

22017,243532,CVGW,Dig Into DuPont Technique To Grab 5 Quality Picks,opinion,"In a market where complacency levels may falter any time thanks to central banks  moves  geo political concerns and overvaluation issues  picking the right stock is a challenge  The metric return on equity goes a long way in resolving this issue 
The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
But to fine tune this basic concept  one can land on DuPont  NYSE DWDP  analysis  This theory will take investors a step higher and better pick some quality stocks  
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 14 stocks that made it through the screen

22019,243534,CVGW,Ride On DuPont Analysis   Pick 5 Top Stocks ,opinion,"Return on equity is one of the most trusted metrics used by investors  This profitability ratio enables investors to differentiate between a profit churner and a profit burner  It measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
To shortlist these gems  one can look at the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 13 stocks that made it through the screen

22046,243561,CVGW,4 Stocks To Celebrate World Food Day,opinion," Climate is changing  Food and agriculture must too  
This is the theme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  FAO  for this year s World Food Day   WFD   The theme revolves around the fact that the global climate is undergoing a drastic change  which is heavily affecting food and agriculture production  On the other hand  population is also growing steadily  which means a gradual rise in food demand 
This is why it is important to adopt effective steps to boost food and agriculture production by a significant extent in order to meet rising demand despite the effects of climate change  Most countries are coming forward to explore different ways to make food production and agriculture more sustainable in order to exterminate hunger completely from the entire world 
Objectives of WFD
Since the time it was first observed in 1979  WFD is celebrated every year on October 16  the day on which the FAO was created with the aim to eradicate global hunger  Millions of people from across the world celebrate this day by participating in several events that are organized to promote awareness about different issues  including food wastage and lack of preservation of water for irrigation  that lead to scarcity of food  These events include the WFD dinner  a meal packaging event and hunger walk 
This year s WFD will be celebrated at a time when the United Nations  UN  is preparing for the Climate Change Conference  COP 22  which will be held from November 7 to 18 in Marrakech  Morocco  Countries throughout the globe have been asked to give special importance to food and agriculture in the climate action plans they provide  The FAO have also asked countries to raise their rural development investments  In Sep 2015  193 countries committed to eliminate hunger by 2030 
Why Bet on Consumer Staples 
The concerns related to scarcity of food  which is one of the main reasons for hunger  are mostly associated with the consumer staples category  Even in a country like the U S   the popularity of this category provides important indications about the financial markets and the overall economy  Though the sector has struggled for most part of this year  there is still scope for a rebound  Concerns including food deflation  rising competition and slowdown in demand in emerging markets affected the sector 
However  it is being speculated that signs of improvement in the U S  economy in the second half of this year hold the key for the sector s rebound  Recently released economic data  including the ISM manufacturing and services Indexes  consumer confidence data and consumer credit numbers have been encouraging  which indicates that the economy is back on track 
Separately  rising possibilities of a rate hike in December is also expected to attract investors  attention to this category  Consumer staples is considered to be one of the major defensive sectors and is expected to remain relatively unaffected by a rate hike 
4 Stocks to Consider
Selecting financially strong consumer staples stocks  especially those whose operations are related to food production  might be a profitable option ahead of World Food Day  Food producing companies have an important role to play in eliminating hunger in the days ahead  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult

22049,243564,CVGW,Archer Daniels  ADM  Stock Continues To Decline  Here s Why,opinion,Leading food processing company  Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   seems to be losing sheen due to back to back dismal sales performances  The company s surprise history reveals that it has lagged the sales estimates for over three years now  This probably has weighed tremendously on the stock performance Evidently  shares of Archer Daniels have declined 10 2  year to date  while the Zacks categorized  sector grew 9   Apart from the dismal sales trend  the company s earnings in the most recent quarter marked its second consecutive miss which further hurt sentiments  Notably  shares of the company have dipped 11 3  in the last three months and 3 4  in the past one month Further  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company s estimates have declined in the last 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 fell by 2 cents to  2 64 per share while estimate for 2018 declined by 4 cents to  2 92 per share Archer Daniels Midland Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    What s Leading to the Decline Clearly  the stock is struggling due to strained earnings and revenues  as discussed above  In the recently reported first quarter 2017  both earnings and sales lagged estimates  While this marked Archer Daniels  second consecutive earnings miss  the company has delivered negative earnings surprise in seven of the last eight quarters  Consequently  the company has an average negative surprise of 2 6  for the trailing eight quarters  Further  the company has been missing sales estimates for over three years now The dismal performance can be primarily attributed to the fluctuating commodity prices  oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins  Further  its significant presence in the international market exposes it to unfavorable foreign currency translations Additionally  the company faces intense competition in all segments where it operates  Furthermore  Glencore  LON GLEN  s plans to expand in the agriculture space may increase competition for Archer Daniels Can the Tables Turn We believe Archer Daniels  strategic initiatives and constant focus on cost savings along with enhancing processing capabilities and global footprint through strategic acquisitions bode well  The company remains on track with long term strategic plan that was announced in 2012  In this regard  Archer Daniels enhanced cost structure  solidified core operations and made significant expansions   both geographic as well as category wise These factors helped the company to generate cost savings and gain efficiencies  which in turn drove first quarter results  While the first quarter results were below expectations  both earnings and sales grew year over year  Moreover  the company s run rate savings in the first quarter reflect that it is on track with its 2017 target  Going forward  management remains confident of sustaining this momentum in 2017 Further  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents per share for second quarter 2017 reflects 44 4  growth from the prior year quarter  Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of  16 1 billion  up 3 1  from the year ago quarter  Moreover  the stock is supported by a  of  A   which justifies growth prospects Bottom LineThe company s strategic initiatives and cost saving plan can be rewarding for the company  However  the lower than expected revenues and earnings cannot be ignored  We would hence prefer to stay away from the stock until more pronounced effects of the company s initiatives are visible in its top and bottom line performances Stocks to ConsiderMeanwhile  investors may consider better ranked stocks in the same sector including Calavo Growers  Inc    NASDAQ CVGW

22106,243621,CVGW,5 DuPont Tested Juicy Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,Return on equity  ROE  is one of the best arrows in an investor s quiver that enables him to single out the right investment choices  It is a commonly used profitability ratio that measures the earnings a company generates from its equity However  delving into the basic ROE and analyzing it at a deeper level  with the help of DuPont  NYSE DD  analysis  could lead to better returns  It is an analytical method  which critically examines three major elements   operating management  management of assets and the capital structure   related to the financial condition of a company  It s basically taking ROE apart to examine how it works  Although it can be presented in several ways  the most popular one is shown below ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity MultiplierAdvantage of DuPont over ROEThe importance of ROE can t be gainsaid  but still it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis on the other hand allows investors to assess which of the elements is dominant in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having high margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods which rely on higher turnover In fact  it also sheds light on a company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  ROE of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt burden So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective will be at a loss if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  DuPont analysis comes to the rescue and finds out the better stock  Thus  a company with a healthy mix of all the three metrics   profit margin  asset turnover ratio and equity multiplier   will be the most alluring DuPont analysis is not difficult  as the required numbers are available in a company s income statement and balance sheet However  looking at the financial statements of each and every company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can easily shortlist the stocks that look impressive based on a DuPont analysis Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or
