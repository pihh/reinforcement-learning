158735,380251,NWL,Newell s Lack of Traction Could Mean a New CEO,news,"By Charley Blaine
Investing com   Changes at the top may be afoot for Newell Brands  NASDAQ NWL   which shouldn t come as a surprise to investors who ve seen the stock dive while the company showed little traction in its turnaround plans 
 that Newell s board  mostly made up of activist shareholders  is thinking of replacing CEO Michael Polk  who s been in his job since 2011  A decision is not imminent  the Journal said  because it s possible that a turnaround will succeed  If Polk can make it happen  he ll reap lucrative rewards 
Newell  a consumer goods conglomerate best known for Rubbermaid products  Sharpie markers  Elmer s Glue  Graco baby strollers and Mr  Coffee coffee makers  has had a horrible run as a stock 
The shares peaked at  55 06 in June 2017 and were trading at  17 14 in the early afternoon today  That s a decline of 68   The S P 500 s performance over the same time frame is a gain of about 14  
For shareholder activists  this is manna from heaven  a chance to push management to unload underperforming assets and streamline operations  Carl Icahn controls three board seats  Starboard Value  another activist investor  has two  A number of top executives have left as a result of their prodding 
The problem is that the stock has yet to respond to the company s turnaround plan  which is focused on selling businesses that represent 35  of total sales  In fact  a disappointing fourth quarter earnings report last Friday    and a forecast for more bad news in 2019    caused the stock to fall 21  that day  The company said it was hurt by the U S  trade war  higher costs and the bankruptcy of Toys  R  Us  a key outlet for baby strollers 
Newell is demonstrating the risk all conglomerates potentially face  buying too much and then not being able to get results  Newell  then known as Newell Rubbermaid  bought Jarden Corp  for  15 billion in 2016  The deal brought in such brands as Rawlings sporting goods  K2 Sports  Mr  Coffee  outdoor equipment company Coleman and Diamond Match 
The problems emerged almost immediately  And Newell has been unloading many of its businesses  including Rawlings  K2 Sports  Diamond Match  and Waddington Group  a packaging manufacturer ",2019-02-21,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/newells-lack-of-traction-could-mean-a-new-ceo-1786710,1786710
158736,380252,NWL,Judge rules against hedge funds that challenged 2016 Jarden deal,news,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON  Del   Reuters    A Delaware judge ruled against hedge funds on Friday that tried to get more cash out of Newell Brands Inc s  O NWL  2016 acquisition of consumer goods company Jarden Corp  the latest setback for a once popular investment strategy known as appraisal 
Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Court of Chancery found that the fair value of Jarden stock was  48 31 when it was acquired by Newell  well below the  71 35 sought by funds affiliated with Fir Tree Partners and Verition Fund Management 
The ruling is one of the more stinging losses for investors pursuing appraisal  which once delivered reliable returns and rankled Wall Street dealmakers for adding costs to mergers 
Appraisal allows shareholders to decline a deal price and instead go to court to try to convince a judge that they deserved a higher price for their stock  The funds will now receive  48 31 per share  not the  59 21 per share paid to other Jarden stockholders in 2016 in a deal valued at  16 billion 
The hedge funds could have received an additional  26 5 million for their 2 4 million Jarden shares if they had accepted the deal price 
The ruling can be appealed 
A lawyer for the hedge funds  Stuart Grant  did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Slights said there were indicators that Jarden s sale process was marred by the negotiating style of Chief Executive Officer Martin Franklin  whose rush for a deal may have depressed the potential price 
But he accepted Jarden s arguments that the market price for its stock prior to the deal announcement was the best indicator for fair value  He also noted the company struggled to sell stock at  49 per share prior to the Newell deal 
Slights  ruling is a sharp departure from earlier in the decade  when Delaware judges found funds deserved well more than the deal price for several companies such as computer maker Dell Inc  delivering big returns 
Even when judges ruled against investors  they tended to find fair value was the deal price and not below it  limiting the investors  potential downside 
It became such a popular strategy that the U S  Chamber of Commerce  a business lobby group  began to question if the majority of U S  public companies should continue to incorporate in Delaware  State lawmakers eventually amended the law to make appraisal less potentially lucrative ",2019-07-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/judge-rules-against-hedge-funds-that-challenged-2016-jarden-deal-1929220,1929220

158878,380394,NWL,U S  companies likely to take further big hits from Venezuela economic turmoil,news,"By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON  Reuters    A slew of major U S  corporations are likely to announce in the next few weeks whether they will take big writedowns for their troubled Venezuela operations  and some may say they are leaving the country altogether   The companies may decide to slash the valuations of their businesses and take charges based on declines in some of the oil producing nation s four exchange rates for the bolivar currency  of which three are official and one black market  and then deconsolidate the operations on their balance sheets  Wall Street securities analysts said  They may have more reason to accelerate the process after the socialist government on Friday declared a 60 day economic emergency  which would give President Nicolas Maduro wider powers to intervene in companies or limit access to already scarce dollars in Venezuela  It also disclosed that the nation s economy contracted by 4 5 percent in the first nine months of last year while the official annual inflation rate was the world s highest at 141 5 percent in that period  as plunging oil prices  and what critics of Maduro see as policy missteps  took an increasing toll   Venezuela s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment   The Reuters analysis shows that U S  companies with exposure could face total writedowns of more than  3 billion if they revalue their assets in Venezuela using the less preferential Simadi exchange rate of nearly 200 bolivars to the dollar  In the past  many companies valued their assets using the main official rate of 6 3 bolivars per dollar   But even that change may not reveal the full extent of the problem given that the black market exchange rate has worsened to about 878 bolivars to the dollar from about 190 bolivars a year ago  according to dolartoday com  a website that tracks the rate   MONITORING DAY BY DAY  Increased government regulations and lack of access to U S  dollars at lower rates could force companies such as Goodyear Tire   Rubber Co to deconsolidate if they lose further control over their operations   Goodyear said in recent financial disclosures that a deconsolidation move would trigger a one time  pre tax charge of more than  500 million and what it termed  derecognition  of  293 million of cash on its balance sheet  Goodyear was not immediately available for comment  At a Jan  12 investor conference  Goodyear Chief Financial Officer Laura Thompson described Venezuela as  a very volatile environment    The outlook is pretty uncertain  Our visibility is unclear  but we continue to monitor the situation day by day  quarter by quarter  as we go   Thompson said  Deconsolidation under U S  accounting rules allow companies to treat a subsidiary in a volatile foreign market as an investment rather than an operating unit  while writing down the market value of that subsidiary largely insulates the parent company from future hits to its financial results  So far  blue chip companies that have deconsolidated in Venezuela and written off nearly all of their investment there include Procter   Gamble Co   Pepsico  Inc  N PEP  and Ford Motor  N F  Co  Among those who have departed altogether is cleaning products maker Clorox Co  One major pressure point could be drug companies   Abbott Laboratories   N ABT   Abbvie Inc  Merck  N MRK    Co Inc   Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  and  Zoetis Inc   N ZTS  have about  1 8 billion in combined net monetary assets exposed to the bolivar  recent U S  regulatory filings show  Zoetis  which declined to comment for this story  began scaling back operations in Venezuela several months ago  executives have said previously  Pfizer  Merck and Abbvie did not return messages seeking comment  Abbott declined to comment  These companies  preferential access to dollars at the official exchange rate has become more difficult  even as the government has made availability of drugs a priority  But the economic crisis has worsened so much that now less business is being done at the official rate  even for essential food and medicine  The government also has another lower official rate known as the Sicad rate   that has been at around 13 bolivars to the dollar   but there are also very few dollars available at that rate  The last Sicad auction was in September  Meanwhile  it is not uncommon for U S  companies to have currency exchange settlements pending with the Venezuelan government for years  U S  regulatory filings show  SUSPENDED SHIPMENTS Other companies selling sensitive products  such as baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co  have had to adjust their practices because of constraints placed by the Venezuelan government on the release of U S  dollars to repatriate cash back to the United States  Mead suspended shipments to Venezuela temporarily  the company said during an October investor day presentation  The company was not available for comment  Consumer products maker Newell Rubbermaid Inc  N NWL  has been identified by some Wall Street analysts as the next major U S  company that will likely take action to protect itself from Venezuela s crumbling economy   We continue to view a deconsolidation  in Venezuela  as a likely event  when Newell reports fourth quarter results on Jan 29  analysts at Jefferies Companies said last week in a research note  If Newell were to deconsolidate it would take a one time charge of  111 million  according to company commentary in recent U S  regulatory filings  Newell declined to comment for this story  Such a move would largely protect the company from taking further Venezuela related hits to its financial results in the future  Among U S  companies  Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate maker  Mondelez International Inc   O MDLZ  has one of the largest remaining exposures to Venezuela  with  617 million in net assets  according to the Reuters analysis of corporate disclosures   We would expect to provide an update on Venezuela and other markets when we announce our  fourth quarter  earnings on Feb  3  but I m not able to provide comment before that time due to quiet period   said Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens  Besides Newell and Goodyear  3M Co  Colgate Palmolive Co and  Herbalife   N HLF  Ltd have at least raised the specter of insulating their financial results from Venezuela  In U S  regulatory filings over the past three months  the companies have talked about deconsolidation if conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate

158940,380456,NWL,5 Value Picks Boasting Amazingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  It is preferred by many investors to handpick stocks trading at attractive prices  However  even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its limitations Is EV EBITDA a Better Alternative to P E Although P E enjoys great popularity among value investors  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative  EV EBITDA  also referred to as the enterprise multiple  gives the true picture of a company s valuation and earning potential  Additionally  it has a more comprehensive approach to valuation   EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other component of the ratio  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued However  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Companies with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates P E also can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA is also not without its limitations and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No

158942,380458,NWL,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Verso  Qiwi  Newell Brands  WhiteHorse Finance And Element Solutions,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 18  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Verso Corp    NYSE VRS    Qiwi plc   NASDAQ QIWI    Newell Brands Inc    NASDAQ NWL    WhiteHorse Finance  Inc    NASDAQ WHF   and Element Solutions Inc   NYSE ESI   5 Value Picks Boasting Amazingly Low EV EBITDA RatiosThe price to earnings  P E  ratio is widely considered by investors as a yardstick for evaluating the fair market value of a stock  It is preferred by many investors to handpick stocks trading at attractive prices  However  even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its limitations Is EV EBITDA a Better Alternative to P E Although P E enjoys great popularity among value investors  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative  EV EBITDA  also referred to as the enterprise multiple  gives the true picture of a company s valuation and earning potential  Additionally  it has a more comprehensive approach to valuation   EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other component of the ratio  gives the true picture of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that depress net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued However  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Companies with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates P E also can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA is also not without its limitations and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Hence  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other key ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome For the rest of this Screen of the Week

158944,380460,NWL,Should Value Investors Pick Newell Brands  NWL  Stock Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Newell Brands  Inc    NASDAQ NWL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Newell Brands has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 74  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 15  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level Newell Brands puts current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 17 03  over the past five years  Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 69  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Newell Brands has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 50  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Newell Brands has a P S ratio of about 0 98  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 48  right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Newell Brands currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NWL a solid choice for value investors and some of its other metrics make it clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Newell Brands is just 1 92  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 2 71  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 0 83  which is noticeably better than the industry average of 12 76  Clearly  NWL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall 
Though Newell Brands might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B  This gives NWL a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen five estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while current year estimate has seen six upward and no downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 13 3  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has improved 1 8  in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Newell Brands Inc  Price and Consensus   Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near termBottom LineNewell Brands is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future  However  the company s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors  as it has a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 39  out of more than 250 industries   In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most Likely for Early Price Pops  Since 1988  the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of  24 6  per year  So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention ",2020-01-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-newell-brands-nwl-stock-now-200495986,200495986

158998,380514,NWL,5 Value Stocks With Exciting EV EBITDA Ratios To Own Now,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio is the most commonly used tool for evaluating a firm s value due to its simplicity  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this broadly used valuation multiple is not without its shortcomings Why EV EBITDA is a Better Choice Although P E enjoys great popularity among value investors  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative  EV EBITDA gives the true picture of a company s valuation and earning potential  Additionally  it has a more comprehensive approach to valuation   EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   The first constituent of the ratio  EV  is a firm s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash The other element  EBITDA  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it eliminates non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value  Unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into consideration  This is also the reason why EV EBITDA is commonly used to value likely acquisition targets  The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Moreover  P E can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms with a debt laden balance sheet and have a high degree of depreciation  It also allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels However  EV EBITDA is also not without its shortcomings and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and its future performance  The multiple varies across industries  a high growth industry typically has higher multiple  and is generally not appropriate for comparing stocks in different industries due to their diverse capital requirements As such  a strategy solely based on EV EBITDA might not fetch the desired outcome   But you can combine it with the other major ratios in your stock investing toolbox such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to uncover value stocks Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It

from Wednesday s Analyst Blog 5 Top Ranked Cheap Stocks Trading Under  20 to Buy for DecemberThe Dow  S P 500  and Nasdaq all reached new highs once again Wednesday as they continue their hot November on the back of increased U S  China trade war progress and better than feared quarterly earnings results  In the last several days  both President Trump and President Xi Jinping have appeared more optimistic that the so called phase one trade deal can get done  Meanwhile  the Russell 2000 also hit a new 52 week high this week  which is a big deal for the small cap index  With this in mind  now seems like a solid time to add a few  cheap  stocks to your portfolio Here at Zacks  we try to avoid labeling stocks as  expensive  or  cheap   Instead  we look far beyond face value  and our system puts an emphasis on earnings estimate revisions to find stocks that will hopefully be winners for investors With that said  lower priced stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading at higher prices  Nonetheless  stocks that trade for  20 or less can still be highly attractive to investors for many reasons  one of which is they present the chance to take a larger position in a company Today we found 5 strong stocks currently trading for under  20 per share with our  that investors might want to buy heading into December The AES Corp Prior Close   18 75 USDAES is a global power

revenue estimates  after it posted record Q3 billing for cloud subscription  managed services  and professional services  FEYE stock has been volatile over the last two years  but it is up nearly 30  in the past three months  Plus  FEYE still has plenty of room to run before it hits its 52 week highs of over  20 per share FireEye is a Zacks Ranks  2  Buy  at the moment that also holds  A  grades for Growth and Momentum  The firm s full year sales are expected to climb 6  and 7 5   respectively in 2019 and 2020  Meanwhile  its earnings are projected to slip this year to  0 02  but then soar to

Zacks industries Newell Brands Inc Prior Close   18 83 USDNewell Brands owns a diverse portfolio of consumer goods brands that includes everything from Mr  Coffee and Rubbermaid to Coleman and Calphalon  The company easily topped our Q3 earnings estimates on November 1 and raised its outlook  NWL stock had tumbled since the summer of 2017  when it was trading for over  50 per share  But Newell Brands shares have surged over 40  in the last six months  This climb started after the firm announced it hired Ravi Saligram as its new CEO at the end of July and crushed our Q2 bottom line estimates The company s full year fiscal 2019 earnings are projected to surge over 29  from the year ago period to reach  1 67 per share  Overall  Newell s comeback narrative might just be starting and its positive earnings revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   NWL also holds  A  grades for Value  Growth  and Momentum  Plus  the firm s current annualized dividend yields 4 89  right now  which comes in well above peers such as Kimberly Clark s 3 06  NeoPhotonics Corp Prior Close   8 15 USDNeoPhotonics designs and makes optoelectronic solutions utilized in high speed

fell short of our estimates  Despite the miss  the firm s current year earnings picture has trended upward to help Pure Storage earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now  PSTG also holds  A  grades for

expected to come in over 19  higher at  1 96 billion  The bottom end of the income statement appears even stronger  with PSTG s adjusted FY20 earnings projected to surge 19  to  0 25 per share  Then Pure Storage s fiscal 2021 EPS figure is expected to climb nearly 70  higher to  0 42  The recent downturn might present interested investors with an opportunity to buy PSTG on the dip Looking for

159038,380554,NWL,Can Newell s Transformation Plan Help Regain Stock Momentum ,opinion,Newell Brands Inc    NASDAQ NWL   is grappling with lower core sales coupled with adverse impacts of foreign currency translations  which have been affecting its top line for quite some time  Evidently  the company s sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the last six quarters in second quarter 2019 Moreover  its earnings and sales fell year over year in the second quarter mainly due to the aforementioned headwinds  This  coupled with a decline in sales across the Food   Appliances and Home   Outdoor Living segments  further weighed on the company s performance Management expects the adverse effects of currency on its results to continue throughout 2019 due to strong U S  dollar  It expects currency headwinds to hurt the top line by nearly 150 basis points  bps  in 2019 and 100 bps in the third quarter  Further  currency headwinds will continue to mar the company s gross and operating margins for the aforementioned periods Consequently  Newell estimates net sales of  2 42  2 47 billion along with a core sales decline of 2 4  for third quarter 2019  It also anticipates normalized operating margin contraction of 100 130 bps to 11 9 12 2   Driven by these limitations  Newell s stock has been in the doldrums  Shares of the company have lost 22 3  in a year  wider than the  s decline of 11 6  Transformation Plan   A BoonNevertheless  the stock seems to be picking momentum  with 5 8  gain in the past month  whereas the industry dipped 0 7   Encouragingly  Newell is smoothly executing on its Accelerated Transformation Plan through market share gains  point of sale growth  innovation  e commerce improvement and cost saving plans  The key aspects of the Transformation Plan are restructuring the company into a global consumer product entity  valued at more than  9 billion As a result  Newell plans to offload non core businesses that account for nearly 35  of its sales  and utilize  10 billion after tax proceeds from divestitures and free cash flow to lower debt and make share repurchase  Further  it expects to retain its investment grade rating and an annual dividend payout of 92 cents per share through 2019  targeting 30 35  payout ratio The execution of the plan will likely lead to the simplification of the company s operations  which is likely to reduce the number of manufacturing facilities by 66   distribution centers by 55   brands by 45   number of employees by 39  and reduce above 30 ERP systems to two by the end of 2019  These efforts will likely help it to improve operational performance and enhance shareholder value amid a rapidly changing retail backdrop Moreover  Newell is likely to gain from plans to retain the Rubbermaid Commercial Products business  which was earlier classified as held for sale  owing to its solid long term growth prospects  Management expects this business to be accretive to operating margins  normalized earnings per share and operating cash flow in 2020 and beyond  Reflecting gains from the inclusion of this business  effective from the third quarter  the company raised net sales and operating cash flow guidance for 2019  Net sales are now projected to be  9 1  9 3 billion versus  8 2  8 4 billion mentioned earlier  Operating cash flow is projected to be  600  800 million compared with the previously stated  300  500 million Despite the retention of the Rubbermaid Commercial Products business  the company plans to pursue divestitures of the U S  Playing Cards  Mapa Spontex and Quickie businesses  In fact  Newell s plans to divest underperforming and non core assets  and simultaneously  make prudent investments in areas with high growth potential look quite appealing The company expects to complete divestitures of these businesses by the end of 2019  generating  675  775 million of after tax proceeds  This will mark the completion of its Accelerated Transformation Plan  Proceeds from these divestitures will be used to reduce debt as part of the company s efforts to strengthen balance sheet and maintain investment grade rating  Apparently  Newell lowered its gross debt by  517 million and net debt by  777 million in the second quarter  Management now estimates to achieve gross debt to an EBITDA leverage ratio of less than 4x by the end of 2019 and roughly 3 5x by the end of 2020 We expect Newell s robust Transformation Plan to drive the top line in the long term  Moreover  these efforts are likely to aid in returning the stock to growth

NowInvestors typically have a fixation on the price to earnings  P E  multiple while seeking stocks that are trading at attractive prices  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase stocks that have a low P E ratio  But even this straightforward  broadly used valuation metric suffers a few downsides What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Substitute The popularity of P E can be attributed to its apparent simplicity  While it is the most commonly used tool for assessing a firm s value  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA does a better job  Also referred to as enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and its earnings potential  While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total  is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents The other component of the multiple  EBITDA gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Generally  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued   EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio does not  Given this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another shortcoming of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less open to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  the ratio allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels Then again  EV EBITDA

159062,380578,NWL,Newell Down 20  In 3 Months  Is A Turnaround On The Cards ,opinion,Newell Brands Inc    NASDAQ NWL   is smoothly progressing with the execution of the Accelerated Transformation Plan through market share gains  point of sale growth  innovation  e commerce improvement and cost saving plans  In sync with this plan  Newell has been divesting its underperforming and non core assets in order to simplify the operating structure and boost profitability However  shares of this consumer products company have lost 19 7  against the  s 2 4  growth in the past three months  This underperformance might be attributed to the company s dismal top line trend  having lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the trailing six quarters Lower core sales  foreign currency headwinds and adverse impact from the new revenue recognition standard have been hurting sales  Unfortunately  management anticipates core sales decline of 2 4  in the first quarter and low single digits in 2019  This reflects persistent softness in the top line performance in the quarters ahead Additionally  net sales are projected to be  8 2  8 4 billion for the full year  down from  8 6 billion generated in 2018  Foreign currency translations are expected to hurt sales by roughly 150 basis points  bps  Furthermore  Newell estimates net sales of  1 66  1 70 billion for first quarter 2019  down from  3 billion generated a year ago  Normalized earnings per share are envisioned in the band of 4 8 cents for the first quarter  down from 34 cents earned in the year ago quarter Newell s Transformation PlanWhile the afore mentioned factors make us apprehensive about Newell s performance  its efforts to improve operational performance via Transformation Plan bode well  The key aspect of the Transformation Plan is restructuring the company into a global consumer product entity  valued at more than  9 billion  Furthermore  the company plans to offload non core businesses that account for nearly 35  of the company s sales  utilize  10 billion after tax proceeds from divestitures and free cash flow to lower debt and make share repurchase as well as retain its investment grade rating and an annual dividend of 92 cents per share through 2019  targeting 30 35  payout ratio The execution of this Transformation Plan will lead to simplification of the company s operations  which is likely to reduce its number of manufacturing facilities by 66   distribution centers by 55   brands by 45   number of employees by 39  as well as lower above 30 ERP systems to two by the end of 2019 As part of the progress  Newell recently agreed to sell its Process Solutions business for after tax proceeds of  500 million  Earlier  it agreed to divest the Rexair business to Rhone Capital  These transactions are anticipated to close by the end of the second quarter of 2019  Management also expects to split up the Consumer and Commercial Solutions business besides offloading the MAPA and Spontex businesses in a separate transaction  It expects these divestitures to be completed by the end of 2019 Proceeds from the recent sale of assets have been utilized to lower debt and make share repurchases  Impressively  Newell deployed  102 million for the payment of dividends and  996 million for share repurchases in the final quarter of 2018  Also  the company repaid debt of  2 6 billion  In 2018  it generated more than  5 billion of after tax proceeds from divestitures Wrapping UpWe expect the company s robust Transformation Plan to address the hurdles and well position Newell for growth in the future Not to forget  Newell s gross margin returned to growth in fourth quarter 2018 after seven straight quarters of contraction  Gains from the company s productivity initiatives  pricing actions and the revenue recognition standard drove gross margin  somewhat offset by higher inflationary pressures  Additionally  the company recorded the second consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion  which is expected to continue in 2019  Normalized operating margin is likely to expand 10 50 bps and 20 60 bps in the first quarter and 2019  respectively Furthermore  Newell s robust earnings surprise history with an expected long term earnings growth rate of 4 9  highlight its inherent potential  The company has outpaced the earnings estimates in 10 of the trailing 12 quarters These positive attributes along with the solid progress of the Transformation Plan might help in the revival of this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock Three Better Ranked Stocks

159075,380591,NWL,Archer Daniels Down 9  In 3 Months  Can Efforts Aid Recovery ,opinion,Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   has been witnessing softness across its Carbohydrate Solutions segment for the past few quarters now  This is weighing on the company s top line  having lagged estimates in eight of the last 10 quarters including fourth quarter 2018 Additionally  the company has reported soft fourth quarter results  wherein the top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Also  it witnessed a negative earnings surprise after four straight beats  with second consecutive sales miss  Revenues fell year over year due to decline in revenues at all its segments  except the Oilseeds and Nutrition  Lower Merchandising and Handling results  including important insurance settlements in other income and dismal performance at Animal Nutrition  on account of persistent production issues were added deterrents  Furthermore  the adjusted operating profit at the company s Origination  Nutrition and Carbohydrate Solutions segments decreased 29 9   15 1  and 30 9   respectively Lower Bioproducts results along with weak ethanol margins and volumes have been hurting the Carbohydrate Solutions division s performance  In addition  lower margins and sales in EMEA as well as elevated costs in North American liquid sweeteners due to lower production rates at Decatur complex remain deterrents  Going ahead  management expects the segment s overall results to decline year over year due to persistent pressure on European sweetener and North American ethanol industry margins as well as issues related to the Decatur plant  However  these headwinds will be somewhat offset by robust Starches and Sweeteners in North America Consequently  shares of the company have lost 9 3  in the past three months  wider than the  s 7 5  decline Can Cost Savings   Other Initiatives Deliver Growth Archer Daniels remains focused on strengthening its business through increased cost savings   a key component of its long term strategy  Notably  the company generated run rate cost savings of more than  300 million in 2018  exceeding the targeted  200 million  Meanwhile  the company remains focused on cost synergy activities by addressing redundancies and removing overlapping corporate SG A  Going forward  Archer Daniels will focus on lower capital spending and increasing benefits from these investments Moreover  the company targets  550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next few years  This includes cost savings of  350 million from operational excellence and process enhancements  and about  200 million in incremental purchasing savings Meanwhile  Archer Daniels has been enhancing its operational efficiency at production and supply chain networks to curtail costs  Also  the company has been on track with its business transformation under the 1ADM program  which forms an integral part of Project Readiness  It has been progressing well with the Readiness program and anticipates this program to make contributions of  200  250 million to earnings by the end of 2019  Further  the program is expected to help management have a more coordinated approach toward driving business improvement  standardizing functions and enriching consumers  experience In a bid to manage its business portfolio  Archer Daniels has been undertaking strategic initiatives via acquisitions and divestitures  Recently  the company concluded the Neovia buyout  which is expected to enhance its global footprint in the animal feed industry  Also  the company has been expanding its nutrition portfolio with citrus ingredients and flavors driven by the Florida Chemical Company buyout These apart  management remains focused on five major platforms   animal nutrition  health   wellness  carbohydrates  human nutrition and taste   to boost growth For first quarter 2019  Archer Daniels issued an encouraging outlook for its Nutrition  Origination and Oilseeds segments  Management expects increased profits for the Nutrition segment  backed by operational improvements and gains from acquisitions as well as higher margin and sales  Solid growth at the North American Grain business and higher results for ARTCO is likely to drive results at the Origination division  At Oilseeds  crushing and origination s robust volumes and gains from Algar  SoyVen and North American plant expansions will remain tailwinds Bottom LineAlthough Archer Daniels witnessed soft results and sluggish Carbohydrate Solutions segment in the fourth quarter

reported figure  Further  the consensus mark for revenues is at  2 472 million  depicting a drop of 6 3  from revenues recorded in the year ago quarter Factors That Pose WorriesCoty has been struggling with supply chain hurdles  which also resulted in a 7 7  drop in like for like  LFL  revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  The hurdles included disruptions related to warehouse and planning center consolidation  in Europe and the United States  This also had an impact on all three business units  Further  shortages from various external suppliers affected the Luxury unit  which was also largely hurt by Hurricane Florence Moreover  gross margin contracted 120 basis points due to problems pertaining to the supply chain and escalated freight costs for the Consumer Beauty and Luxury divisions  While the company is working on addressing the supply chain issue  it is expected to be fully addressed by the third quarter of fiscal 2019  Markedly  Coty s operating income in the second quarter is likely to drop moderately on account of currency woes and the residual supply chain obstacles Talking of the Consumer Beauty segment  the unit has been witnessing persistent sluggishness and has been posting soft organic sales for the past few quarters  The segment remained under pressure in the first quarter of fiscal 2019  wherein its revenues plunged 20 6  to  828 8 million  whereas LFL or organic sales declined 14   Results were hurt by supply chain disruptions  including customer penalties and increased promotions  Also  underlying weakness owing to persistent softness in mass beauty categories in United States and Europe dented results  Additionally  softness in certain developed markets  stiff competition and challenges associated with certain brands were deterrents  Though management is working toward enhancing this segment  full recovery is likely to take time  The Consumer Beauty segment LFL revenues are expected to fall at a high single digit rate in the second quarter These factors make us apprehensive about Coty s performance in the quarter to be reported Can the Upsides Offer Cushion Coty s Luxury and Professional beauty segments have been performing impressively for quite some time now  primarily backed by solid brand performances  innovation and strong consumer demand  Though revenues in these segments were hurt by supply chain headwinds to some extent in the first quarter  the units continued to witness underlying growth  In the Luxury segment  underlying growth was backed by strength in Gucci  Tiffany  Chloe and MiuMiu brands  Region wise  the segment witnessed strong performance in Europe and in emerging markets  especially Asia  Moving on  the Professional Beauty underlying growth was fueled by brands like Wella and robust growth in ALMEA and Europe  Also  contributions from ghd drove underlying performance  Going ahead  management plans to continue boosting the Luxury and Professional Beauty segments by tapping brand opportunities in these categories Also  Coty is on track with its Transformation Plan and is focused on building and streamlining back office operations  upgrading systems  optimizing manufacturing and logistics  and simplifying overall operations  Simultaneously  the company is focused on investing in brands and transforming digital capabilities to drive sustainable growth  These factors along with gains from buyouts and cost saving efforts are likely to reflect in the quarter to be reported results  However  we believe that the headwinds may not be offset completely What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn t show a beat for Cotythis earnings season  For this to happen  a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold

Q3 HighlightsThe company s normalized earnings of 54 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents and remained flat year over year Newell Brands Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Net sales totaled  2 277 2 million  which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 323 million  The top line also declined 7 7  year over year on account of the new revenue recognition standard  unfavorable currency rates and decline in core sales Further  the company s sales were impacted by the loss of sales from Toys  R  Us  which recently filed bankruptcy  Notably  core sales dipped 4   However  the company reported improved core sales trends across all segments and regions  on a sequential basis  Moreover  the Writing business returned to growth during the reported quarter The company expects the improved core sales trend to continue in the fourth quarter Normalized gross margin contracted 10 basis points  bps  to 35 7  while normalized operating margin expanded 10 bps to 13  in the quarter under review Segmental PerformanceThe Food   Appliances segment s  which includes Appliances   Cookware Food  net sales declined 11 4  to  722 million  This downside can be attributed to currency headwinds  adoption of new revenue recognition standard and challenges in the Appliances category due to lost sales to a key U S  retailer  These were partly offset by gains in the Food category In the fourth quarter  the company expects core sales trends for the segment to improve sequentially  backed by product launches in Appliances and Cookware Net sales at the Home   Outdoor Living segment  which includes Outdoor   Recreation  Home Fragrance  and Connected Home   Security  were  727 million  down 6 8  from the prior year period  The top line was hurt by the new revenue recognition standard  unfavorable currency  persistent troubles for Yankee Candle in Europe and lost sales for Coleman at a key U S  retailer  This was somewhat mitigated with robust growth witnessed in Connected Home   Security  and Home Fragrance U S  wholesale businesses The company expects core sales trends to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter  driven by strength in Connected Home   Security  and growth in Home Fragrance  driven by improved U S  wholesale channel and stabilization in Europe The Learning   Development segment  which includes Writing and Baby  generated net sales of  829 million  which were down 3 9  from the prior year period  The downside was due to adoption of new revenue recognition standard  unfavorable currency and decline in core sales for Baby  driven by the bankruptcy of Toys  R  Us  However  much of the downside was negated by return to core sales growth in the Writing business The company anticipates the Learning   Development segment to return to growth in the fourth quarter  backed further strengthening of Writing business and progress on Baby  despite the impacts of the liquidation of Toys  R  Us Transformation Plan UpdateThe company has made substantial progress on its Accelerated Transformation Plan announced on January 25  2018  It has been improving operational performance through the divestiture of non core businesses  deleveraging balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders As part of the progress  the company has concluded three divestitures year to date  including The Waddington Group  Rawlings Sporting Goods Company and Goody Products  for about  2 6 billion of after tax proceeds  Furthermore  Newell has right sized the cost structure and adapted the organizational design to a smaller company footprint  These actions taken in the second and third quarters yielded about 10  reduction in professional headcount on the continuing businesses Additionally  the company improved leverage by allocating proceeds to pay down debt and share repurchases  As a result  it exited the third quarter with  2 5 billion lesser debt than the prior year  The company reduced debt by  890 million to  9 6 billion in the third quarter  It also repurchased  511 million worth of shares in the third quarter Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the quarter

159142,380658,NWL,Is Newell  NWL  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Newell Brands Inc    NYSE NWL   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Newell has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 8 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Newell s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should point out that Newell has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 8 7  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Newell has a P S ratio of about 0 8  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  NWL is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Newell currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Newell a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Newell is just 1 4  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 0  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 5  which is far better than the industry average of 10 5  Clearly  NWL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Newell might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A  This gives NWL a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending lower  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and three downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 10 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Newell Brands Inc  Price and Consensus    This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNewell is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  among the bottom 15   and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for

159143,380659,NWL,Newell Brands  NWL  Down 11 7  Since Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Newell Brands Inc    NYSE NWL    Shares have lost about 11 7  in that time frame 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is NWL due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts Newell Beats Q1 Earnings  Updates Transformation PlanNewell Brands reported mixed first quarter 2018 results wherein the company s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line marginally lagged the same  While this marked the company s second straight earnings beat  sales figure failed to top the consensus mark after surpassing expectations in the fourth quarter of 2017  Further  management retained its 2018 view This Hoboken  NJ based company posted normalized earnings of 34 cents per share  which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents but remained flat year over year  The bottom line gained from cost savings  favorable pricing  gains from acquisitions and a lower tax rate  compensated by the lost earnings from divested operations  fall in core sales and commodity cost inflation On a reported basis  earnings per share came in at 11 cents compared with  1 31 earned in the year ago quarter Net sales of  3 017 4 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 039 million as well as declined 7 6  year over year on account of the adverse impact of the last year s divestitures  net of buyouts  Also  the top line was hurt by the disrupted business of the Baby division along with a considerable inventory destocking in the Writing division s office superstore and distributive trade channels  Further  core sales fell 3 5   mainly due to Writing and Baby Normalized gross margin contracted 120 basis points  bps  to 33 3  while normalized operating margin declined 190 bps to 8 7  in the quarter under review Segment PerformanceLive segment net sales inched up 0 4  to  1 071 6 million from the year ago period  However  core sales decreased 3 1  on account of improvement in Appliances   Cookware  which was more than offset by a high single digit fall in Baby business Net sales at Learn segment came in at  495 4 million  down 13  from the prior year period  Core sales dropped 14 3   mainly due to decline in Writing business Work segment net sales of  640 7 million grew 4 4  year over year  Also  core sales rose 5 5  on account of continued strength in Waddington and Safety   Security Net sales at the Play segment came in at  616 8 million  down 1 8  from the prior year period  Core sales dipped 2 6  due to fall in Outdoor   Recreation  compensated with sturdy growth registered in Team Sports The Other segment net sales of  192 9 million plunged 50 2  from the prior year quarter on account of the divestitures of the Tools  Winter Sports  Fire Starter and Fire Log plus Cordage businesses  Core sales declined 4 1  due to weakness in Process Solutions  partly offset by improvement in U S  Playing Cards Transformation Plan UpdateIn line with its Accelerated Transformation Plan  Newell inked a deal to divest its packaging maker  The Waddington Group  to Novolex for roughly  2 3 billion  The transaction  anticipated to close within 60 days  is likely to generate after tax proceeds of about  2 2 billion  which will be further used in deleveraging and share repurchase  Moreover  Newell adds Jostens and Pure Fishing brands to the list of potential divestitures These moves are expected to speed up value creation and transform portfolio to leverage the company s abilities with respect to innovation  design and e commerce  Also  it will help improve operational performance  deleverage the balance sheet as well as enhance shareholder value The key aspects of this Transformation Plan are restructuring the company into a global consumer products  entity  valued at more than  9 billion along with major brands in seven consumer segments  offloading non core businesses that account for nearly 35  of the company s sales  utilizing  10 billion after tax proceeds from divestitures and a free cash flow to lower debt plus make share repurchase as well as retaining investment grade rating and an annual dividend of 92 cents per share through 2019  targeting 30 35  payout ratio The above will likely generate net sales of above  9 billion  boosting shareholder value and financial flexibility  Newell progresses well with its divestiture operations and anticipates the same to be completed by the end of 2019  Thereafter  management projects sales of roughly  9 5 billion with normalized operating margin expansion of more than 15  by 2020 Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  459 million  long term debt of  9 623 5 million and shareholders  equity of  14 130 9 million  excluding non controlling interests of  36 4 million The company reported negative operating cash flow of  401 7 million compared with negative  263 6 million in the prior year period  During the quarter under review  the company returned  112 6 million to shareholders in the form of dividends OutlookFollowing the mixed quarterly results  management reiterated its guidance for 2018  Net sales are still projected in the band of  14 4 billion to  14 8 billion with core sales to be flat to down low single digit rate Further  management continues to expect normalized earnings per share in the band of  2 65 to  2 85 and envisions operating cash flow in the range of  1 15  1 45 billion for 2018  However  the company estimates both the metrics  outlook to come in at the lower end of the guided range

Review  Is This The Calm Before The Storm 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Is this the Calm Before the Storm  We noted that when the market is slow and conditions are not attractive  patiently NOT trading can be an attractive strategy  However  forcing trades when conditions are not attractive by taking on more risk can be a big mistake  especially when slow markets are interrupted with a new batch of volatility  It s important to know your style  what works for you considering risk tolerance and goals  but that doesn t mean sticking your head in the sand and never learning anything new 
This Week  Caught Leaning Into A Trade  Now What 
Here is a look at a sector and asset class ETF chart from Blue Harbinger  and it seems many market participants have been leaning heavily against the China  trade war  trade this year  see  ASHR   

The data is through the end of day yesterday  and as we can see  China had been performing absolutely terribly this year  but showed signs of life yesterday  What happened  The market seems to have been favoring the US strongly as the two countries exchanged tariffs and more tariff threats  But just yesterday we received news that the two sides had made plans to talk  and that was enough to sharply reverse the direction of China stocks in a relatively strong one day move  Further still  it shows a lot of people may have been  caught leaning  into the China trade  So now what 
There is a lot of negative sentiment built into the current market  We have opined that any solid and credible news about improvements on trade would be worth 4   and 10  if a real trade war is avoided  Yesterday s rally is a big reaction to a hint of news  China and the US made only tentative plans to talk   It suggests that much of the fast money is  leaning the wrong way  
So what do you do when you get caught leaning   or even offsides  It is especially challenging because your initial lean reflects an opinion  Alternatively  it can be very useful to discover situations where most others are leaning  Investopedia s Alan Farely covers the latter in his 
20 Rules Followed by Professional Traders
One of the salient points from Farley s article is that if you re too in love with a trade   you give way to flawed decision making  It s your job to capitalize on inefficiency  making money while everyone else is leaning the wrong way  
 RevShark  takes on the former  We don t necessarily endorse any of the bear trap  rigged market rhetoric  but nonetheless it is an interesting read about leaning the wrong way 
Computer Generated Bear Trap Crushes Stock Traders Leaning the Wrong Way
The point is that the market can often lean too far in the wrong direction on a trade  and as a trader you can either lean too far  i e  get caught  offsides   or you can look for the opportunity to exploit the market inefficiency  Obviously easier said than done  but staying alert and disciplined in your trades can help 
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our own trading models  as shown in the following table 

We find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
For more information about our trading models  and their specific trading processes   click through at the bottom of this post for more information  Also  readers are invited to write to main at newarc dot com for our free  brief description of how we created the Stock Exchange models 
Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger   a source for independent investment ideas  
Holmes  This week I bought shares of MercadoLibre  NASDAQ MELI  on 8 16  I am sure you have an opinion on that Blue Harbinger  you always do 
Blue Harbinger  This is an online retailer based out of Argentina  and I have mixed feelings  On one hand  online retailers have been kicking butt in the US as the  death of brick and mortar retail  narrative rages on  However  I d be a little nervous about investing in a company based out of Argentina because that economy seems very uncertain  Honestly  I think you re on the right track  but I d probably prefer a China Internet company  You know  Bidu  NASDAQ BIDU   Alibaba  NYSE BABA   YY  NASDAQ YY   they all seems pretty cheap  and we could see a nice springback when the US China trade war ends amicably 
Holmes  My thesis is actually similar  I am a technical trader  and I focus on the metrics surrounding  dip buying  opportunities  and as you can see in the following chart  the dip on MercadoLibre is compelling 

BH  Looks like a  cup and handle  formation to me  and I think emerging  and frontier  markets in general may be due for a rebound  But what about fundamentals  Holmes  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Holmes  I am a technical trading model  I care less about long term fundamentals considering my typical holding period is only about 6 weeks 
BH  Fine  I ll check back with you then  How about you  Road Runner any trades this week 
Road Runner  You bet  I bought Home Depot  NYSE HD  on 8 13  I too am a technical trader  but I m not quite the  dip buyer  that Holmes is  Instead  my process is based more heavily on momentum  As a general rule  I try to buy momentum stocks that are in the lower end of a rising channel  and then I hold them for about 4 week  Here is a look at the chart for my Home Depot purchase 

BH  Interesting  I understand your process in theory  Road Runner but I m not entirely sure I see the  lower end of a rising channel  in the chart you shared  But how about fundamentals  There s more good info in the following Fast Graph  And honestly  I can better see the momentum you are talking about in the Fast Graph too 

Road Runner  Thanks for the info  but as a reminder  I ll be out of this trade in 4 weeks  My strategy has been putting up positive numbers this year  although not as positive as some of the other more pure play momentum traders  i e  not waiting for the dip in the rising channel  
However  I know that blending my picks with the other models helps us put up strong returns regardless of market conditions  because eventually  pure momentum will fall out of favor  and my  lower end of a rising channel  momentum strategy will be more en vogue again at some point in the future  Team work  Blue Harbinger plenty of upside with diversified risks  and an aggregate strategy that can perform well across changing market conditions 
BH  Thanks Road Runner  And how about you  Felix any trades this week 
Felix  I sold my Newell Brands  NWL  shares this week for a loss  I bought them back in February  My holding period is longer than the other traders  on average it s 66 weeks   but my version of momentum didn t work out for this particular trade  It happens 


BH  Sorry this one didn t work out better for you  Home Depot has certainly been returning a lot of cash to shareholders between dividends  the yield is over 2   and share repurchases  Plus  these types of value stocks have been out of favor lately  as we saw in the ETF performance chart earlier in this report  value has been underperforming growth   Here s a peek at the Fast Graph 

Felix  Thanks for the info  I also ran the Russell 2000 Small cap index through my model  and the top 20 are ranked below 

BH  Thanks Felix  Those small caps have far less non US business exposure than do their large cap Russell 1000 counterparts  That s certainly been a factor lately in light of tariff and trade ware talks 
Athena  This week I sold my Weight Watchers  WTW   shares at a loss  I bought them back in July 
BH  That s somewhat goofy that they sold off lately considering the company beat earnings expectations and exceeded revenue guidance  However  they did lower future guidance  and the market didn t seem to appreciate their new share issuance  You re in and out of these trades so quickly  your typical holding period is about 17 weeks   This seems like more of a long term play to me  I ve shared the Fast Graph below   but your strong performance track record  shared earlier in this report  speaks for itself  Thanks  Athena 

Oscar  This week I ran our High Liquidity ETFs with price volume multiple over 100 million per day through my technical model  and the top 20 rankings are included below 

BH  Wow you really are a momentum trader  Oscar  I see you ve ranked ProShares Ultra QQQ  QLD  at the top of your list  That fund seeks daily investment results  before fees and expenses  that correspond to twice  200   the daily performance of the NASDAQ 100  And if you look in our ETF chart near the start of this report  QQQ has been the best performer on this list  year to date  Your are quite the momentum bull  Oscar 
Conclusion 
Trading strategies work  until they don t  And they don t always stop working when you d expect them to  You may think of it as bulls versus bears  fear versus greed  or traders leaning too hard in one direction or another  As Benjamin Graham famously said   in the short run  the market is a voting machine but in the long run  it is a weighing machine   Investors and traders alike have been  voting  hard against non US countries in general this year  and heavily against China in particular  And if the market is leaning too far into this trade  did you get caught during yesterday s snap back  And perhaps more importantly  when the US and China do eventually come to more formal terms  besides yesterday s simple hint of discussions   the snap back could easily be much more violent  Will you be ready  How are you positioning  and how will you react 
Background On The Stock Exchange 
Each week  Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends  Since they are all traders  they love to discuss their best current ideas before the game starts  They like to call this their  Stock Exchange    Check out Background on the Stock Exchange for more background   Their methods are excellent  as you know if you have been following the series  Since the time frames and risk profiles differ  so do the stock ideas  You get to be a fly on the wall from my report  I am usually the only human present and the only one using any fundamental analysis

159166,380682,NWL,Facebook  Newell Brands And Tableau Software Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 2  2018    highlights Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   as the Bull of the Day  Newell Brands   NYSE NWL   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tableau Software Inc    NYSE DATA   Here is a synopsis of all three stocks  Social media behemoth Facebook  Inc  has been a  must own  internet stock for years now  primarily because of the company s remarkable ability to expand its core business  Facebook continued that trend with its latest quarterly earnings report  Now  despite spending concerns  Facebook has set itself up for a strong 2018 and beyond Facebook operates its titular social networking website  as well as the popular image sharing platform Instagram and messaging application WhatsApp  The company s networks are incredibly popular on the web and on mobile platforms  including iOS and Android  Facebook reaches more than two billion monthly active users  MAUs  around the world On Wednesday afternoon  the Mark Zuckerberg led company once again reported better than expected quarterly results on both the top and bottom line  Facebook also witnessed strong growth in key geographic regions and reminded investors that it is well prepared for the future of the technology sector Latest Earnings ResultsFacebook reported adjusted earnings of  2 21  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 96 per share  The company notched total revenues of  12 97 billion  surpassing our consensus estimate of  12 58 billion  These results marked year over year growth of 77 4  and 47 3   respectively Changes to the U S  tax code impacted earnings by  0 77 per share  Factoring in these costs  Facebook reported earnings of  1 44 per share still about 20  higher than the year ago quarter  Daily active users reached an average of 1 40 billion in December  Monthly active users were 2 13 billion at the end of the quarter  an increase of 14  year over year Facebook also continued its shift to a primarily mobile focus  Mobile advertising revenue accounted for about 89  of total advertising revenue in the quarter  up from approximately 84  in the year ago period The company also said that its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled  41 71 billion at the end of the quarter  2017 was a strong year for Facebook  but it was also a hard one   said Zuckerberg   In 2018  we re focused on making sure Facebook isn t just fun to use  but also good for people s well being and for society  Zuckerberg is starting to touch on a topic here that many investors are concerned about  the company s pledge to spend more money on security and content vetting  The earnings report also showed that Facebook increased its headcount by 47  in 2017  indicating that the company had already hired many new employees to help with this goal Increased spending is something that investors will always worry about  but Facebook s changes should help improve its user experience down the line  For example  a recent change to the News Feed has led to reduced time spent on the platform by roughly 50 million hours every day But the News Feed change has also reduced the amount of clutter and meaningless viral content that a user sees  This means that users can more easily engage with content that they like things that they are more likely to click on or share We also know that Facebook has invested heavily in video content  This has helped lift revenues  as advertisers typically consider video ads to be more valuable than traditional banner ads Another key catalyst to Facebook s growth is its expansion in key markets  Facebook topped our revenue projections for the Asia Pacific region  totaling  2 059 billion  This result was 52 6  higher than the year ago period and ahead of our consensus estimate of  2 040 billion Facebook also witnessed its monthly user base surge by 23  in Asia  This region is now Facebook s largest geographic area based on total number of users Going forward  Asia should continue to be a catalyst for Facebook  The platform has only just scraped the service of its potential audience in the region  and several population rich countries are still expanding their access to the internet  For manufacturers of many traditional consumer staples  the past several years have been a transitionary period  Consumer habits are shifting  product preferences are changing  and companies are responding  But for investors  now might be a good time to avoid these types of companies  including home goods giant Newell Brands Newell Brands is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well known brands  including Paper Mate  Sharpie  Dymo  EXPO  Parker  Elmer s  Coleman  Jostens  Marmot  Rawlings  Oster  Sunbeam  FoodSaver  Mr  Coffee  Rubbermaid Commercial Products  Graco  Baby Jogger  NUK  Calphalon  Rubbermaid  Contigo  First Alert  Waddington and Yankee Candle The company recently accelerated its transformation plan  but investors have not responded well to its results so far  The stock has dipped more than 15  over the past month  including a plunge this week on the back of soft preliminary results for the remainder of fiscal 2017  Newell Brands is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Latest OutlookEarlier this week  Newell lowered its projections for fiscal 2017  The company now expects core sales growth of nearly 0 8   down from the 1 5  to 2  growth predicted earlier  Adjusted earnings are expected to fall in the range of  2 72 per share to  2 76 per share  down from the previous forecast of  2 80 to  2 85 As one would expect  Newell s lowered guidance has led to a plethora of negative earnings estimate revisions  We have now seen six negative revisions to its full year estimates within the past week But this trend has actually extended beyond this timeframe  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current fiscal year has slowly slumped from the  2 83 per share it was at about 90 days ago  Meanwhile  its soft results are having an effect on analyst expectations for the upcoming fiscal year Our consensus estimate for the company s next year earnings has lost 29 cents over the past 90 days  and we are now expecting profits to remain flat year over year  Newell is slated to release its latest quarterly results on Feb  16 Newell s shaky results have forced management to accelerate its transformation plan and consider new strategic options  The company is aiming to trim its portfolio to nine core consumer segments that can garner nearly  11 billion of sales and  2 billion of EBITDA Brands to be evaluated in the industrial and commercial product business include Waddington  Process Solutions  Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa  Meanwhile  Newell s Rawlings  Goody  Rubbermaid Outdoor  Closet  Refuse and Garage  and U S  Playing Cards could be trimmed These changes will likely lead to better shareholder value down the line  But investors know that transformation plans can be volatile and unpredictable  In the case of Newell  it might be better to sit this one out for now Additional content Tableau Software  DATA  Shares Soar on Strong Q4 EarningsTableau Software Inc just released its fourth quarter

159167,380683,NWL,Elude Volatility  Avoid These 3 Stocks Likely To Miss Earnings,opinion,"Stocks opened lower on Tuesday morning  just one day after markets signaled an intent to bounce back quickly from their worst week in two years  No one should be declaring a bottom just yet  but the sell off appears to be more so a return of volatility than a market wide crash and some investors might need to adjust their strategies accordingly 
One method to implement in a volatile market is to avoid companies that are likely to disappoint investors by posting soft earnings results  The busiest stretch of Q4 earnings seasons is already over  but several market moving reports are still on the horizon 
With that said  one of the best ways for investors to elude the possibility of continued volatility over the next few trading periods is to avoid companies that are likely to underperform earnings estimates  Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise  in one way or the other 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
In contrast  a stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or worse  coupled with a negative Earnings ESP  is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season  Today  we are giving our readers a free look at three of these weak stocks in order to help them identify the high risk companies ahead of their upcoming reports

Net sales advanced 5 1  to  4 054 6 million in the quarter  also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 959 million  The increase in sales can mainly be attributed to solid core sales growth  full quarter contributions from Jarden  and the Sistema and WoodWick buys  However  this was partly offset by the sale of the company s Tools  Decor  Fire Starter and Fire Log  Teutonia and Cordage

dipped 2 1  as weak Home   Family results overshadowed the modest improvement in Process Solutions MarginsNewell s normalized gross margin contracted 20 basis points  bps  to 37  as cost synergies and

159344,380860,NWL,5 Stocks With Solid Earnings Growth To Buy Now ,opinion,"Earnings for a company are arrived at after subtracting the cost of production from revenues over a given period of time  This metric is arguably the most important one for an organization s top brass  And why is this so  It s because earnings  commonly referred to as the bottom line  is the ultimate indicator of profitability  It also determines how affluent the company s shareholders are 
Earnings Estimates and Its Influence on Stock Prices
Not very often we have seen a company s stock price declining after reporting earnings growth or for that matter a stock price surging following an earnings decline  But in some cases  the stocks move in the opposite direction of earnings if market expectations are not met 
So earnings estimates also come into play in moving the stock price  In fact  earnings estimate revision is a very important factor in driving stock prices  A change in earnings estimates indicates the health of various factors such as sales  demand  profit margins  expenses  etc 
During any earnings season  it is prudent to invest in stocks that not only have high historical earnings growth rate but are also seeing an increase in quarterly and annual earnings estimates 
Screening Parameters
In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions  we added the following parameters 
Zacks Rank equal to 1  Only Zacks   Strong Buys  allowed  With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there  this is a great way to start things off 
5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry  Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history
  Change EPS F 0  F  1  greater than or equal to 5  Companies that witnessed year over year earnings growth rate of 5  or more in the last reported fiscal year 
  Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks 
  Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week 
  Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero  Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks 
The above criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7 747 stocks to only 18  Here are the top 5 stocks 
Facebook  Inc     NASDAQ FB   
Ingredion Incorporated    NYSE INGR   
Newell Brands Inc     NYSE NWL   
Ellie Mae  Inc     NYSE ELLI   
SkyWest Inc     NASDAQ SKYW   
While backtesting over an almost two year timeframe  May 02  2014 to Apr 08  2016   considering a four week holding period  a portfolio following this strategy provided a total return of 19 2  compared with the S P 500 s return of 7 6   For investors with a reasonably high risk appetite  this strategy provides rich rewards

This may not explain the recent strength in Newell Rubbermaid  NYSE NWL   but it s a start  The strength in the stock might be better explained by looking at the chart below  NWL spiked higher in December only to immediately fall back  That led to a downtrend  which found a bottom in mid January  The bounce that followed was short lived and it fell back to a lower low 
On February 11  it found support and started back higher 

As the price moved back over the February 1 high  it committed to the Shark harmonic pattern shown  This looks for a move up to 46 60  Potential Reversal Zone I  or 49 94  PRZ II  before a possible reversal lower  The chart also shows the current consolidation under resistance at a level that was important support in the last half of December  A push over this resistance would give a Measured Move to 48

159366,380882,NWL,Five Best PEG Stocks For Value Investing,opinion,"When analysts can t stop extolling about the effectiveness of the most common and uncomplicated valuation metric   the price to earnings ratio  one could find another metric  the price to earnings growth ratio  PEG   which is more effective in identifying value stocks  PEG  as its definition goes  uses three parameters   Price  Earnings and Earnings Growth Rate   and hence is a bit complicated to calculate 
However  difficulty does not always mean you should avoid it  In fact  at this stage of global uncertainty  market volatility has reached a peak over the past one year  As a result  all the basic and simplest tools that were earlier sufficient to find safe and sound stocks have been called into question 
Whateverthe market conditions  price to earnings ratio can t single handedly predict winning stocks  We definitely need other yardsticks to assess the intrinsic value or fair value of a particular stock  PEG is in fact one of the most important ratios to judge the fair value of a stock 
The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings   Earnings Growth Rate
A lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors 
Why PEG over P E 
For value investors  considering PEG over price to earnings or P E can be more rewarding as it helps in finding cheap stocks with future growth potential 
Let us crunch some numbers 
A company with a P E ratio of 35 and a growth rate of 20  would have a PEG ratio of 1 75  35   20   1 75  while a company with a P E ratio of 40 and a growth rate of 50  would have a PEG ratio of 0 80  40   50  0 80  
If we only consider the P E ratio  the first company with a lower P E will obviously be in a better position  discounted state   But if we add the growth rate to justify the P E  the scenario gets reversed 
However  PEG cannot perform magic alone  we need other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy  Let s fine tune the screening criteria to arrive at a winning combination 
Screening Criteria 
PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median
P E Ratio  F1  less than X Industry Median
Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  have a proven history of success
Market Capitalization greater than  1 billion  This ensures that the companies have strong liquidity 
Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable 
Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 10   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  leading to stocks price appreciation 
Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening

Newmont Mining Corporation    NYSE NEM
