111517,333032,ISRG,4 Charts That Show Why You Should Buy Intuitive Surgical Stock,news,"Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  delivered a solid performance in 2019  with shares rising more than 23   But that wasn t as good as the S P 500 index  which gave investors a total return of over 31   If you think that Intuitive Surgical is likely to lag behind the market over the long run  though  think again 
The robotic surgical systems pioneer presented on Tuesday at the annual J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco  CEO Gary Guthart made a compelling case for his company s business prospects  In particular  there were four charts that Guthart discussed that show why Intuitive Surgical is a stock you can buy right now and hold for the long run  

1  Procedure trends
Probably the single most important metric for Intuitive Surgical is the growth in procedures performing using its flagship da Vinci robotic surgical system  The more procedures that are performed  the more customers will need replacement instruments and accessories    which translates to higher revenue for Intuitive  The following chart presented at the J P  Morgan conference shows just how strong the procedure growth tailwinds are for Intuitive Surgical 

There are a couple of things that especially stand out with this chart  First  the overall growth in worldwide procedure volume over the last six years has been impressive  Second  Intuitive Surgical continues to enjoy really strong growth in general surgery procedures 
However  you might look at the company s guidance of 13  to 16  growth in 2020 and wonder if da Vinci might be losing its sizzle to some extent  Keep in mind  though  that Intuitive has a history of sandbagging on its guidance  For example  in January 2019 the company projected that full year procedure growth in 2019 would be between 13  and 17   As the above chart shows  Intuitive beat the top end of that range  Don t be surprised if the company again delivers stronger growth than its guidance in 2020 
2  System placements and install base growth
Another important metric for Intuitive Surgical is how many da Vinci systems are installed  Some customers purchase the systems outright while others lease their da Vinci systems  Either way  Intuitive not only makes a lot of money over the near term  but it can also look forward to more future revenue as these customers perform surgical procedures using the da Vinci system  Below is a two in one chart from the company s J P  Morgan presentation that underscores how much progress Intuitive continues to make in expanding its install base 

Note the right chart above shows that Intuitive Surgical s installed base grew by more than 12  last year  That should directly translate to solid procedure growth  as seen in the chart in the first point 
It s a little hard to tell from the small section of purple in the left chart above  but Intuitive is really picking up momentum in Asia  That s great news for the company  which historically has seen higher growth in the U S  market 
3  Recurring revenue
Some companies experience wild swings in revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year because they re highly dependent on new sales  Intuitive Surgical doesn t have to worry too much about such volatility  The chart below shows the reason why 

Intuitive makes 72  of its revenue from recurring sources  That s a phenomenal level of recurring revenue  And it s only going to grow as the company s install base increases  driving procedure growth  which in turn drives sales of replacement instruments and accessories 
But Guthart also discussed another important factor fueling Intuitive Surgical s recurring revenue growth  operating leases  Customers are increasingly opting to lease robotic systems rather than make up front purchases  Intuitive s operating lease revenue more than doubled in 2019 from the previous year to  107 million  Operating leases now account for 34  of total system placements  and the number is likely to head higher in 2020 and beyond 
4  What rivals have to do just to catch up
Several other companies have made news over the last year with key developments in their own robotic surgical systems efforts  Medtronic unveiled its new surgical robot system that will compete head to head against da Vinci  Johnson   Johnson is stepping up its game  acquiring Auris Health  which was founded by Intuitive Surgical founder Fred Moll  and buying Alphabet s stake in Verb Surgical 
Should investors be worried about new competition for Intuitive Surgical  The following chart shown by Guthart at the J P  Morgan conference gives a pretty good reason why the answer should be  no  

The point of this chart is that there s a lot that has to be done to build out an ecosystem to survive and thrive in the robotic surgical systems market  Developing new systems and instruments isn t enough  There are regulatory hurdles to clear  customer training programs to develop  clinical support to establish  and a whole lot more  It s a long  multiphase process 
Medtronic and J J could be successful in the robotic surgical systems market  However  both big companies are well behind Intuitive Surgical  It seems quite possible that the introduction of new robotic surgical systems could even improve Intuitive s prospects as the technology gains wider adoption 
Why buy Intuitive Surgical 
How do these four charts show why Intuitive Surgical is a great stock to buy  They demonstrate that the company has a strong underlying business with excellent growth prospects and an impressive and increasing level of recurring revenue  They also underscore the substantial first mover advantage that Intuitive has over new competitors entering the scene 
Some healthcare stocks require investors to hope for regulatory approvals and strong commercial launches to achieve success  Intuitive Surgical doesn t  Its growth is practically guaranteed  And that s why the company s charts from the major healthcare conference this week highlight why this stock is a great pick for investors to buy and hold ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/piaxo,2059863
111521,333036,ISRG,3 Charts That Show Intuitive Surgical Is Transforming Before Our Eyes,news,"Sometimes  change happens so slowly it s easy to miss  That s what s happening with Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG   The health focused robotics company pre released fourth quarter results this month that continued to impress  This early release has become commonplace  as it allows executives to speak freely at the J P  Morgan Health Conference taking place this week 
But if we look beyond the headline numbers  we see the nascent stages of a healthcare subscription company forming  That s a huge shift investors need to be aware of  Here are three charts that demonstrate this move 

Lowering barriers to entry
Buying a daVinci robotic surgical system is a big investment for hospitals  as each machine costs over  1 5 million    prohibitively expensive for some  
But lately  Intuitive has offered up operating leases to lower these barriers  For much lower up front costs  hospitals can effectively lease the daVinci machines for a recurring rate    and upgrade when newer versions come out  
The number of systems using this alternative financing has boomed over the past two years 

As you can see  one third of all the systems placed over the past year have been operating via leases  This creates a long term trade off that s good news for everyone 

Hospitals and doctors can afford to buy a daVinci and test it out 
Patients benefit from improved outcomes and quicker recovery 
Intuitive Surgical collects as much or more revenue from systems and  more importantly  has a recurring source of revenue instead of one off purchases 

I wouldn t be surprised to see this trend continue  as it works in everyone s best interest to transition to this leasing model 
Gathering and distributing data
Intuitive is taking all of the data it has collected over 25 years and creating a platform for surgeons  In essence  it s offering up the type of data and science that s more reminiscent of a software company 

Think about it  Over 90  of Intuitive s machines are connected to the cloud  All of the data provided by those connected machines form the basis for better training on the company s simulators 
Not only does this help train surgeons  but it also provides an advantage that Intuitive s coming competitors won t be able to match for years 
Tinkering leads to new procedures
Finally  we get to the most important long term metric for investors to watch  procedure growth  Intuitive Surgical s stock currently trades for about 50 times earnings  That s a high price tag    which means high expectations are baked in  
Intuitive matches those expectations by helping more patients via minimally invasive procedures  

As you can see  general surgery is booming  But it isn t the only growth driver  While the core gynecology market is mature  international urology procedures are also adding a lot of operations to the slate 
For the upcoming year  management said it expects to continue seeing robust growth in hernia  bariatric  and colorectal procedures  all of which fall under the broader general surgery label 
There are powerful forces leading me to believe this trend of upward procedure growth will continue  More doctors are using daVinci thanks to operating leases  As they continue tinkering on the platform with new procedures  that data is collected and distributed to other doctors  Over time  that leads to using the machine for more procedures  improving operating outcomes 
Investor takeaway
None of this is to say you should run out and put all of your money behind Intuitive Surgical  Instead  it deserves a spot on your own watch list for due diligence  The growth of operations is nothing new  But the drivers of that growth    essentially  a transition to a subscription based model    can t be ignored  It s the type of development that could keep the company relevant for decades to come ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pis2x,2060861

The full report also includes expenses and net income  which weren t in the initial report since it takes businesses longer to add up all their expenses for the quarter  Income from operations was up 19 8  in the quarter  but grew slower than revenue because research and development expenses  which were up 30  year over year  ate into operating profits 
A lower tax rate and an increase in interest and other income helped the healthcare company grow its bottom line faster than its operating income  Net income for the quarter increased 22  to  358 million  Intuitive Surgical brought in  2 99 per share  also up 22  year over year 

The company sold 336 da Vinci Surgical Systems in Q4  a 16  year over year increase  The number of procedures performed using the machines increased by 19   driven by growth in general surgery procedures in the U S  and urologic procedures worldwide 
The rise in procedures boosted sales of instruments and accessories by 24  year over year in the quarter  Intuitive Surgical generates more than half of its total revenue from sales of instruments and accessories

outlook for 2020  And finally  we will host a question and answer session  With that  I will turn it over to Gary Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsThank you for joining us today  At Intuitive  we measure our efforts by their ability to positively impact the quadruple aim  better outcomes  better patient experience  better care team experience  and lower total cost to treat per patient episode  This fourth quarter of 2019 was another strong one for Intuitive in pursuit of these aims capping a good year for the company  Our performances reflected in healthy total growth in customer use of our systems  new capital installations  sustained quality service of our customers  clinical publications  and the launch of new products and services For the quarter  global procedure growth was approximately 19   Growth was led by general surgery in the United States with positive contributions to the global growth rate from Japan  China  Germany and Korea  Globally  customer utilization of systems increased again in the quarter  indicating greater productivity per installed system  Leasing and alternative placement models have also helped our customers gain access to additional procedure capacity with lower capital outlays  In the United States  year over year procedure growth for the quarter was 18   General surgery accounted for the largest increase accompanied by stable growth in urology and gynecology  Within general surgery  hernia repair  cholecystectomy  bariatric and colorectal surgery showed strength  Outside the United States  several markets are early in their transition from growth in urology to other surgical categories including gynecology  thoracic surgery  and general surgery with growth varying by country  Calvin will take you through global procedure dynamics in more detail later in the call With regard to our installed base  placement of new systems in the quarter was solid  We placed 336 systems in the quarter with growth in total placements rising 16  from Q4 of 2018  Net of trade ins and retirements  our da Vinci installed base grew to approximately 5 582  The mix of system placements this quarter continues to favor our flagship Xi system and trade ins were healthy  The proportion of systems placed under operating leases was 38  this quarter compared with 33  last quarter  As a reminder  total placements in that percentage of systems placed under lease were usage based  Arrangements can vary substantially quarter to quarter  Over the past several years  we ve been working to enable greater access to our products and services  For example  we believe  leasing in usage based models benefit our customers by lowering barriers for them to provide high quality computer aided interventions  We anticipate continuing to expand access and lower cost for our customers as our business progresses into different procedures and geographies Turning to expenses  we believe we are still in the early days of computer aided surgery and acute interventions  As a result  we are investing in building our capability in several important ways including deepening internationally  launching our new platforms  strengthening our computational capabilities  and executing projects that support future scale and provide leverage opportunities as we grow  Our spending for the quarter and for the year was within the upper end of the spend guidance we shared with you in 2019  It is supported by solid procedure growth  capital placements  and product cost reductions  Financial highlights of our fourth quarter results are as follows  Procedures grew approximately 19  over the fourth quarter last year  We placed 336 da Vinci surgical systems  up from 290 in the fourth quarter of 2018  Our installed base grew 12  from a year ago  Revenue for the quarter was approximately  1 3 billion  up 22   Pro forma gross profit margin was 72 2  compared to 71 8  in the fourth quarter last year  Instrument and accessory revenue increased to  671 million  up 24   Total recurring revenue in the quarter was  896 million growing 24  over Q4 of 2018 and representing 70  of total revenue  We generated a pro forma operating profit of  506 million in the quarter  up 23  from the fourth quarter of last year and pro forma net income was  417 million  up 18   Highlights for the full year 2019 are as follows  procedures grew approximately 18  over 2018  We placed 1 119 systems in the year growing the installed base 12  over 2018  Revenue for the year was approximately  4 5 billion growing 20  over 2018 and pro forma net income was approximately  1 5 billion  up 17  over 2018 Turning to progress in our innovation pipeline  I ll start first with systems  We are in our Phase 1 launch of da Vinci SP and we are working to expand its clinical clearances and build SP products at scale  In the quarter  we installed six systems to bring our installed base of SP to 44  Customer response and early clinical results using SP remain encouraging with over 50  Phonetic  peer reviewed clinical articles on SP to date  With regard to additional indications for SP  we ve been in discussion with FDA regarding data requirements for a colorectal indication  We expect this to require an IDE trial that includes follow up analysis  This implies  we do not expect the third indication for SP in the U S  in 2020  While I would like a faster launch of SP  the combination of additional indications for SP and our readiness for deployment at larger scale will pace the speed of our SP commercial expansion In flexible diagnostics  our Ion platform is focused on the need for accurate and timely biopsies to support definitive early diagnosis of suspicious lesions  As of the end of the quarter  there are approximately 16 systems in the field  some commercial and some clinical trial sites with several hundred procedures performed  To date  the roll out is meeting our expectations and user feedback during this initial launch period has been strong  We expect several publications reviewing the performance of Ion to be presented during 2020  Turning to instruments and accessories  our team has been making great progress in building out our instrument portfolio with high quality products  Our experience has shown that procedure adoption occurs when the holistic needs of the care team are met when the right system and imaging products come together with the right instruments and accessories  Our team initiated our first phase launch in the quarter for our SynchroSeal sealing and transection device along with our first integrated energy controller called the E 100  SynchroSeal provides surgeons with wristed precise and fast sealing and transection ability often used in general surgery  Early feedback on its performance has been outstanding  SynchroSeal joins our portfolio of advanced instruments stapling instruments and advanced energy instruments that customers are now adopting in their da Vinci cases Turning to imaging and analytics  we are working on imaging  computing  and real time cloud technologies that allowed for capabilities from big data analytics to telementoring to augmented reality   Technical Issues  alone  Intuitive Surgical simulators have been used for over 17 000 hours by more than 5 800 surgeons  Our IRIS augmented reality system entered clinical use in the fourth quarter of 2019 and we re pleased with our first customer responses  Over the past several years  our analytical capability has increased and we now routinely engage our customers to help assess the performance of their robotic assisted surgery programs relative to other surgical modalities  Armed with local comparative analysis of robotic assisted surgery within their institutions  hospitals with active programs have been building access to da Vinci systems and growing their programs  We expect continued investment and progress in these areas in 2020 As we move into 2020  let s step back and review the da Vinci surgery universe  In the past several years  general surgeons have increased their adoption of our offerings underpinned by improvements in the quadruple aim in procedures they perform from hernia repair  cholecystectomy  and colorectal surgery to bariatric surgery  These surgical procedures span a broad range of complexity and economics  At the same time  Intuitive continues to deepen our capability in key countries to support the adoption of robotic assisted surgery and their healthcare environments  We are flexing our company to better serve these customers with the launch of new systems  new instruments  and updates to our software along with changes to our sales and support models and pricing structures  Given the large global opportunity to pursue the quadruple aim  I believe the next few years for the company will be dynamic  We will guide the company to meet our customers  clinical and economic needs across this wide range of procedures and geographies  Doing so will involve continued investment in innovation in both technology and business models and we see a path to do both Moving into 2020  we are focused on the following  first  supporting adoption of da Vinci and general surgery including hernia repair  colorectal procedures  and bariatrics  second  launching our SP  Ion  imaging  instruments and analytics platforms  third  extending our depth in OUS markets particularly Asia and EU with growth beyond urology  and finally supporting additional clinical and economic validation in our focus procedures and countries  Lastly  we are pleased to publish today our inaugural sustainability report  which you can find on our website outlining our multi year efforts in these areas  I ll now turn the call over to Marshall  who will review financial highlights Marshall L  Mohr    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood afternoon  I would describe the highlights of our performance on a non GAAP or pro forma basis  I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks  A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website  Revenue in procedures are consistent with our preliminary press release of January 9th  Key business metrics for the fourth quarter were as follows  Fourth quarter 2019 procedures increased approximately 19  compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased approximately 11  compared with last quarter  Procedure growth continues to be driven by general surgery in the U S  and urology worldwide Calvin will review details of procedure growth later in this call  Fourth quarter system placements of 336 systems increased 16  compared with 290 systems last year and increased 22  compared with 275 systems last quarter  We expanded our installed base of da Vinci systems by 12  to approximately 5 582 systems  This growth rate compares with 12  in the last quarter and 13  last year  Utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system grew approximately 6   which is the same as the 6  growth last quarter and last year  Our revenue overview is as follows  Fourth quarter 2019 revenue was  1 3 billion  an increase of 22  compared with  1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase of 13  compared with  1 1 billion last quarter Instrument and accessory revenue of  671 million increased 24  compared with last year  which is higher than procedure growth  primarily reflecting customer buying patterns and increased usage of our advanced instruments  Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately  1 980  an increase of 5  compared with the fourth quarter 2018 and was consistent with last quarter  Instrument and accessory revenue per procedure has grown in the low single digits over the past couple of years reflecting increased usage of our advanced instruments  partially offset by higher growth in benign procedures where revenue per procedure is lower than the overall average  While adoption of benign procedures has been a major contributor to the overall INA revenue  to the extent benign procedures grow faster than complex procedures  INA per procedure may decline  In addition  over time as we achieve greater penetration of our advanced instruments in da Vinci procedures  the growth rate for advanced instruments will slow and align with the growth rate of underlying procedures in which advanced instruments are used Systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was  416 million  an increase of 22  compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase of 23  compared with last quarter  Relative to the fourth quarter of 2018  systems revenue reflected higher system placements  higher ASPs  and higher lease related revenue  We completed 126 operating lease transactions representing 38  of total placements compared with 84 or 29  of total placements in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 92 or 33  of total placements last quarter  As of December 31st  we have 658 operating leases outstanding and realized approximately  34 million of revenue related to these arrangements in the quarter compared with  16 million last year and  27 million last quarter Operating leases create a future source of recurring revenue and reduce the volatility of system revenue while the increased number of operating leases placed in the quarter dampens short term revenue growth for the quarter in which they are placed  Operating leases include usage based financings that we provided to certain hospitals with advanced robotics experience  We believe that our lease financing alternatives align with customer objectives and have enabled faster market adoption  Relative to systems purchased over the lease period  we earn a small premium reflecting the time value of money and in the case of usage based arrangements  the risk that those systems may not achieve anticipated usage levels  The proportion of operating lease in usage based arrangements will likely increase long term and will vary quarter to quarter  We recognized  34 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with  20 million last quarter and  17 million last year  Lease buyout revenue has varied significantly from quarter to quarter and will likely continue to do so  138 or 41  of current quarter system placements involved trade ins reflecting customer desire to access or standardize on our fourth generation technology contributing to an Xi installed base growth of 39  year over year  This is an increase compared with 81 or 28  of system placements in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 116 or 42  last quarter Trading activity can fluctuate and could be difficult to predict  However  given prior product trade in cycles  we expect the proportion of the installed base traded in  in future quarters to decrease over time  81  of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi s and 16  were da Vinci X systems compared with 79  da Vinci Xi s and 17  da Vinci X s last quarter  Six of the systems placed in the fourth quarter were SP systems  Our roll out of SP surgical system will continue to be measured putting systems in hand of experienced da Vinci users while we optimize training pathways in our supply chain  We placed seven Ion systems in the quarter  Ion system placements are excluded from our overall systems count and will be reported separately  Procedures and other information associated with Ion are excluded from our prepared remarks and will be reported separately when they become more substantive  Globally  our average selling price  which excludes the impact of operating lease revenue and lease buyouts was approximately  1 61 million compared with  1 46 million last year and  1 57 million last quarter  Our fourth quarter ASPs reflect a favorable geographic mix as we sold 39 systems into China and 26 into Japan where ASPs are higher given the higher cost of doing business in those geographies  Excluding geographic mix  ASPs for the quarter declined slightly relative to the third quarter reflecting pricing arrangements associated with a higher mix of multi system contracts  System ASPs will fluctuate with geographic and system mix and may decline relative to the average total 2019 ASP reflecting increased multi system arrangements Outside of the US  results were as follows  OUS procedures grew approximately 22  compared with the fourth quarter 2018 and increased 9  compared with last quarter  Fourth quarter revenue outside of the US of  422 million increased 37  compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased 27  compared with last quarter  The increase compared with the prior year reflects increased instruments and accessories revenue of  47 million or 39  growth and increased systems revenue of  58 million or 42  growth  The increase in instrument and accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and stocking orders associated with China system sales  The increase in systems revenue is primarily the result of increased placements and increased ASPs reflecting favorable geographic and product mix  Outside of the US  we placed 140 systems in the fourth quarter compared compared with 115 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 90 systems last quarter  Current quarter system placements included 54 into Europe  26 into Japan  and 39 into China compared with 55 into Europe  31 into Japan  and two into China in the fourth quarter of 2018  71  of the systems placed in the quarter were da Vinci Xi s and 24  were da Vinci X systems compared with 55  da Vinci Xi s and 30  da Vinci X s last year  32 of the system placements in the current quarter were operating leases compared with 15 last year and 21 last quarter  The 39 systems into China included customers who had begun their tender processes and we believe expedited their purchase cycles to avoid a tariff increase that was expected on December 15th  The proposed tariff was suspended on December 13th  We would expect remaining purchases under the quota to be completed  consistent with historical timelines and therefore we expect placements to be lower in the first quarter and skew more toward the end of 2020 and into 2021 While overall European system placements were relatively flat in the quarter and for 2019  shipments by country fluctuate significantly  Placements into the four largest European markets increased 29  in the fourth quarter and 19  for the year for the year  Overall placements outside of the US will continue to vary as some of the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption  Some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government limitations Moving on to gross margin and operating expenses  Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 72 2  compared with 71 8  for the fourth quarter 2018 and 72  last quarter  The increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and last quarter primarily reflects higher system ASPs and part of cost reductions  Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products  mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue  system ASPs and our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency  Pro forma operating expenses increased 23  compared with the fourth quarter 2018 and increased 19  compared with last quarter  Spending is consistent with our plan and includes an order of magnitude of increase costs associated with the expansion of our OUS markets  spending on our imaging and analytics capabilities  and investment in our infrastructure in order to scale the business  We believe we have a unique opportunity to expand the benefits of computer aided surgery and acute interventions around the world and have been and will continue to invest in the business accordingly  Our pro forma tax rate for the quarter was 21 1  compared with our expectations of 19  to 20  reflecting geographic mix  Our actual tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the geographic mix of income  changes in taxation made by local authorities  and with the impact of one time items  Our fourth quarter 2019 pro forma net income was  417 million or  3 48 per share compared with  353 million or  2 96 per share for the fourth quarter 2018 and  409 million or  3 43 per share for last quarter I will now summarize our GAAP results  GAAP net income was  358 million or  2 99 per share for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with GAAP net income of  293 million or  2 45 per share for the fourth quarter 2018 and GAAP net income of  397 million or  3 33 per share for last quarter  The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards  employee stock based compensation and IP charges  amortization of intangibles and acquisition related items  and legal settlements  We ended the quarter with cash and investments of  5 8 billion compared with  5 4 billion at September 30  2019  The cash generated from operations was partially offset by investments in working capital and infrastructure during the quarter  Capital expenditures for the quarter and the year are higher than historical averages as we invest in our infrastructure  We expect investments in our infrastructure to continue into 2020  In the quarter  we grew inventory by approximately  16 million to  596 million  representing approximately 142 days of inventory  which is slightly lower than at the end of the third quarter  We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and have approximately  1 7 billion remaining under the Board buyback authorization In summary  I want to highlight certain business dynamics that may impact your models  First  as I noted  we will grow operating expenses appropriately as we see the substantial opportunity to expand the benefits of computer aided surgery and acute interventions  Calvin will provide you with operating expense growth guidance  In addition  as we align with our customer needs  we believe the percentage of leasing and alternative financing arrangements will increase over time  We also believe the number of trade in transactions will level off in the short term and then decline over time  System ASPs will fluctuate with geographic and system mix and may decline relative to the average total 2019 ASP reflecting increased multi system arrangements  While adoption of benign procedures has been a major contributor to overall INA revenue  to the extent benign procedures grow faster than complex procedures  INA per procedure may decline  Lastly  it is likely we will see elongated negotiation timelines and possibly price pressures as competition gets closer to launching their products  We will continue to manage the business for the long term as we believe that the fundamentals of the business are strong  And with that  I d like to turn it over to Calvin who ll go over procedure performance and our outlook for 2020 Calvin Darling    Senior Director of Finance Investor RelationsThank you  Marshall  Our overall fourth quarter procedure growth was approximately 19  compared to 19  during the fourth quarter of 2018 and nearly 20  last quarter  Our Q4 procedure growth was driven by 18  growth in U S  procedures and 22  growth in OUS markets  Overall procedure growth for the full year 2019 was approximately 18   equal to 18  in 2018 comprised of 17  growth in the U S  and 21  growth in OUS markets  In the U S  Q4 procedure growth was consistent with recent trends and was largely driven by continued strength in general surgery with substantive contributions from gynecologic and urologic procedures  In U S  general surgery fourth quarter growth in leading procedures  hernia repair and colorectal  remained solid at rates consistent with last quarter  Cholecystectomy growth continued to accelerate in the fourth quarter and now represents a significant driver of incremental procedures  While da Vinci cholecystectomy adoption has been robust given the high level of lab penetration  it is difficult for us to predict the extent and pace of future adoption chole  Phonetic  adoption  Bariatric procedures also showed continued solid growth in Q4 and will become an increasing area of field focus for us in 2020  For the full year 2019  approximately 421 000 U S  general surgery procedures were performed  up 29  from 2018  representing approximately 48  of overall U S  da Vinci procedures  Q4 U S  gynecology procedure growth was largely consistent with the first three quarters of 2019  For the full year 2019  approximately 282 000 U S  gynecologic surgery procedures were performed  up 6  from 2018  representing approximately 32  of overall U S  procedures  In U S  urology  fourth quarter dVP growth rates continued to exceed our expectations although  Phonetic  growth did moderate from Q3  For the full year 2019 approximately 138 000 U S  urologic procedures were performed  up just under 10  from 2018 representing approximately 16  of overall U S  da Vinci procedures  As a highly penetrated procedure category  we believe that our U S  prostatectomy volumes should track to the broader prostate surgery market and will likely grow more modestly in 2020  Fourth quarter OUS procedure volume grew approximately 22  compared with 24  for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 23  last quarter  Fourth quarter 2019 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in urology procedures and earlier stage growth in general  gynecologic  and thoracic surgery In China  as in Q3  procedure growth accelerated modestly as new systems installed under the latest system quota began to provide capacity for incremental growth  In Q4  the China procedure growth rate slightly exceeded the overall OUS metric  As Marshall mentioned  39 systems were shipped into China in Q4  Note that 35 of these 39 systems went to new hospitals  Teams in these hospitals will need to move through training pathways and establish da Vinci procedure processes before these new systems contribute meaningfully to procedure growth in China In Japan  procedure growth was again strong at just over 40   reflecting growth in procedures granted reimbursement status in April 2018 and continued later stage growth in urology procedures  Our emphasis in Japan remains on surgeon and team training and building proctoring networks  Overall  European procedure growth was largely consistent with prior periods with variation by country  German results were particularly strong while results in the U K  lagged Now turning to the clinical side of our business  Each quarter on these calls we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable  However  to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence  we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years  A recent article by doctors Wexner and Emile et all in the Journal of Techniques in Coloproctology provided results from a systemic review and meta analysis of intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis in minimally invasive right colectomy  This study analyzed data from 25 studies and 4 450 patients  Intracorporeal anastomosis was associated with significantly shorter length extraction site incisions  earlier bowel recovery  fewer complications  and lower rates of conversion  anastomotic leaks  surgical site infections  and incisional hernia as compared to extracorporeal anastomosis  This study highlighted the many clinical outcome advantages associated with intracorporeal anastomosis  da Vinci systems  instruments  and smart stapling technology enabling performing anastomosis of the bowel inside the body and it is our hope that more patients can benefit from intracorporeal anastomosis with continued adoption of our technology  Intuitive s investment in a prospective  multi center intracorporeal versus extracorporeal anastomosis study comparing robotic versus laparoscopic approaches called the ANCOR study is timely and the enrollment for this study is expected to be completed this year with results expected in 2021  The details of the ANCOR study are available online at clinicaltrials gov I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2020  Starting with procedures  as described in our announcement earlier this month  total 2019 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 18  to roughly 1 229 000 procedures performed worldwide  As communicated previously  during 2020  we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 13  to 16   We expect 2020 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U S  general surgery and procedures outside the United States where we are at earlier stages of adoption  We expect similar seasonal timing of procedures in 2019 as we have experienced in previous years with Q1 being the seasonally weakest quarter as patient deductibles are reset  Q1 and full year 2020 will benefit from one extra working day attributable to leap year With respect to revenue  as we have mentioned previously  capital sales are ultimately driven by procedure demand  catalyzing hospitals to establish or expand robotic system capacity  Capital sales can vary substantially from period to period based upon many factors including U S  healthcare policy  hospital capital spending cycles  reimbursement and government quotas  product cycles  economic cycles  and competitive factors  Within this framework  we d expect 2020 capital placements seasonality to generally follow historical patterns by quarter  During the fourth quarter of 2019  126 of the 336 systems shipped or 38  were under operating leases  We expect the proportion of systems placed via operating leases will vary from quarter to quarter and could trend up in the future  During Q3 and Q4  42   indecipherable  41  respectively of systems placements were upgrades to our Gen 4 platform  As we mentioned last quarter  we expect the proportion of trade in transactions to generally trend downwards in 2020 Turning to gross profit  Our full year 2019 pro forma gross profit margin was 71 7   In 2020  we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 70  and 71  of net revenue  The slightly lower gross profit margin anticipated in 2020 reflects higher sales of newer products and infrastructure investments  Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter to quarter depending largely on product  regional  and trade in mix  and the impact of new product introductions Turning to operating expenses  in 2019  our pro forma operating expenses grew 27   In 2020  we expect pro forma operating expenses to grow between 15  and 20   We expect our non cash stock compensation expense to range between  400 million and  440 million in 2020 compared to  336 million in 2019  We expect other income  which is comprised mostly of interest income  to total between  100 million and  115 million in 2020  With regard to income tax  in 2019  our pro forma income tax rate was 19 5   As we look forward  we estimate our 2020 pro forma tax rate to be between 20  and 21  of pre tax income with the increase primarily reflecting the anticipated geographic mix of pre tax income  That concludes our prepared comments  we will now open the call to your questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  good afternoon  Just two questions from me  Gary  I wanted to start with you first on chole  it s probably your largest procedure set in terms of volume  two sequential quarters of acceleration within chole obviously still very low penetration  Historically  that was tied to sort of training  Physicians would use chole as a way of training in broader general surgery procedures  but just talk about the last two quarters of acceleration in this procedure  Do you think that s simply training  a leading indicator of general surgery or do you think something is going on distinct from that within broader chole and a quick follow up Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsOkay  on the first one  just I m going to put a post it note on the assumption of its size relative to everything else  I ll let Calvin come back and put it in context size wise in terms of current run rate  but the underlying question of what are we seeing in cholecystectomy  we think there is a segment there where we re bringing differentiated clinical value  could be underlying clinical ailments like obesity  comorbidities  state of disease of the gall bladder  So while it s a large category as a whole  generally well served by minimally invasive surgery today  there are segments in it that are difficult and for which we think current product sets do really well  There is also a set of training or people deepening their experience as they go through it  So there is a mix of those two  We think there is a durable component segmenting out how big that is over time  We re still working through where we think those endpoints are  We have seen it both grow in the last few quarters and appear to be sticky not to have be a transient  Calvin  in terms of kind of setting in context relative to other procedures Calvin Darling    Senior Director of Finance Investor RelationsNo  I mean the size of the market  you can tell from our commentary  it s gotten to the point where general surgery is a meaningful enough category and a more and more significant contributor to growth within the general surgery category that s growing overall  Again  as we mentioned in the commentary  it s hard for us to gauge given the high lab penetration there to what extent and what pace it may ultimately adopt David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay and Gary  second question for me is just on the capital environment  your fourth quarter U S  net placement growth was a little lower and Europe in 2019 was a little lower on a net placement basis  Maybe just comment on underlying demand for systems in the U S  and the European markets and also curious if has in any respect as competitors introducing new systems or talking about their new systems more publicly  has that in any way impacted demand or change the conversation you re having with large IDNs in the U S  or European customers  Thanks so much Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsOn the outline of the first question  you just sort of think about what the installed base growth was  So if you think about capital demand underneath there is what s happening to installed base  so opening additional capacity in various places or trade ins of older generation systems  I ll let Marshall speak to the quantitative nature of your question with regard to the U S  and in Europe  but I d say there is  it s something    there is some trade in dynamics that I think the team has been discussing with you the last couple of quarters  In general  I think we re feeling like it s reasonably stable On the second piece of what will competitive advertising and conversation do  From time to time  we see it delay deals  We definitely see increasing conversations as they get closer to market with what they want to do or other companies are starting to get some clearances in other regions  In general  our teams have handled that pretty well  but I think the noise level will increase  I think that customers are interested in listening to other pitches  I think we re pretty well positioned to have a conversation about that  but I do see delay from time to time  It kind of comes in waves and then it will settle as the world figures out kind of what they re offering  but Marshall maybe a little bit on    a little more quantitative answer than that Marshall L  Mohr    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  first  the capital environment has been approximately the same  There hasn t been much in terms of change in motives and so forth over the last several quarters  The number of systems that we placed in the U S  which is disclosed in the website is what is healthy in our view  In fact  the other way we measure how healthy we re    how well we re doing is the utilization of systems and utilization of systems growth as I said was 6   which is consistent with where it s been and in Europe we saw as I said  maybe flattish number of systems placed both in the quarter as well as compared to the previous year in total and just be aware of averages and it s going to be lumpy  when you re in earlier stages of adoption in less mature markets  you re going to see a lumpiness to placements of capital  When we look at the four largest markets  we saw nice growth  which again as Calvin commented  procedure growth in Germany was strong and we saw a nice placements in Germany for example  That help David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thank you so much OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with J P  Morgan  Please go ahead Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystHey  thanks  I ll start with SP  just curious following your discussions with FDA  any color you can provide on just when the trial is going to start  a size  and what s expected for follow up analysis and then outside the U S   you re obviously generating data on SP and thoracic and OSA in Korea  Can you just talk about some of the data generations outside the U S  as well Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsSure  on the first one  I think we re settling in on what the trial will look like and I m not ready yet to answer that  but I think we re getting close  So in future quarters we should be able to answer that question  With regard to what we re seeing elsewhere  we re starting to see in terms of Korea where we have more regulatory room and in clinical indications  We ll start seeing a whole series of publications coming out talking about where there is opportunity  It s I think going to be quite interesting and shows real potential for us  it s the thing that drives our underlying commitment and excitement  I don t have them off the tip of my fingers  I do know that in future quarters we will start describing to you what the substance of some of these publications are as they start to release Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystAnd then  just sticking with the pipeline for a minute  Can you just comment on IRIS  Where we are in the roll out  It s obviously early days and then also if you could just comment separately on the Scholly endoscope acquisition and have you worked the supply chain headwinds there Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsGreat  I will do so  IRIS  first couple of accounts up and running  We expect more this quarter  It s really testing the whole order to delivery pipeline  I think of that as a digital pipeline that has to go through  Feedback is really encouraging  So this early part  it s one of these things that s easier to describe  but to do well is hard  Making sure all your cloud connections are right  making sure you have all your security protocols done  getting the turnaround times right  getting all your machine learning algorithms right  Feedback has been really good about its ability to help surgeons visualize pre case  which is fantastic  used in other kinds of ways in terms of patient consultation and then access during the case  So the kind of the core idea I think is being vetted nicely  We have said before  we don t think it s a significant revenue driver in 2020  I think I would encourage people to think about this as baseline core technology  the kinds of things that as you develop systems like this in the future that customers will come to expect a little bit like our Firefly product  it is additive in the way that it s    the system itself becomes greater than the sum of its parts  So IRIS I think looks quite strong On the Scholly acquisition  the team is doing a really nice job  We were right to bring it in  We were right to bring in when we did  That is doing a couple of things for us  It s giving us a little more alignment around next gen products which is exciting for us  it s helping us double down on some investments in terms of capacity and efficiency that goes with that capacity and it will in the medium term start releasing some profitability and financing with regard to the way we produce our endoscopes that can be turned around and reinvested in the business  So  so far so good  It is real work  They are a very good team  I think we knew what we were bringing in and acquiring  I m really pleased with the leadership of the group and our team members that have joined us in Germany and in Boston or in Massachusetts  It s not to say there isn t work to be done  but so far so good Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay and then one just last clarification for Marshall  you called out of China pull forward dynamic around the tariff  Can you just in the context of the 39 systems  are you able to quantify how much of that was tied to the tariff Marshall L  Mohr    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  not    I can t quantify specifically  I would just tell you that there were a number of systems that the customers decided to expedite the process and we were the beneficiary of that obviously Tycho Peterson    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  thank you OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America  Please go ahead Robert Hopkins    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  thank you  Just a first  congratulations on the Ion  Technical Issue  from the case  you highlighted some tailwind potential headwinds  but called out that revenue per case could decline  Phonetic  next year Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsHey Bob  we heard  Speech Overlap  you got kind of broken up on the call  so could you reask the question Robert Hopkins    Bank of America    AnalystSorry about that  just on instrument  Technical Issue  just want to make sure I hear the messaging because there s some positives  Technical Issue   So I just want to make sure the messaging on the INA line for the next 12 months Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsYeah  so what I said Bob was we ve really seen good contribution to INA revenue overall from benign procedures  but as we ve described before the increase in the INA per procedure is really a reflection of additional advanced instrument revenue and then per procedure offset by benign procedure growth  So all I m calling out is if we re successful in growing benign procedures much faster than complex procedures  then you will see then that it will win the tug of war and therefore your INA per procedure might decline  On the advanced instruments  we ve enjoyed further penetration into procedures in which advanced instruments are used and as that has occurred  then our revenue associated with procedures  our revenue per procedure has grown disproportionately to the number of procedures  Over time as you penetrate that  then you will revert to your advanced technology growth  We ll be consistent with the number of additional procedures you add versus adding also incremental procedures that were previously not including it  So all we re saying is that there is the potential that the growth rate will decline  We still expect growth  just a lower rate Robert Hopkins    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  thank you  And then quick question on U S  capital  Over the last couple of years  the growth in procedures per average system has been remarkably consistent at about 5  especially in the U S  Is there a reason in your view why that number might change meaningfully in 2020 or is that trend line expected to continue Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsNo  I think directionally  continued growth in procedures per system is something we would expect  It s something that we re actively working with customers sharing analytics and data to help them to make their practices programs as efficient as they can be  So I think the trend I don t know if it going to continue exactly at the same rates  but increasing utilization is something we would expect Robert Hopkins    Bank of America    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo  Please go ahead Lawrence Biegelsen    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGood afternoon and thanks for taking the question  Hopefully you guys can hear me OK  Just one on the Ion and then one on the P L  How should we think about the ramp of Ion in 2020  Is it still going to be a controlled launch or we just expect a steady increase in placements and I have one follow up Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsAs we ve said in our prepared remarks  Ion is in the early stages of a measured launch and so you should expect that it will grow slowly over time Calvin Darling    Senior Director of Finance Investor RelationsSlowly through 2020 and then more rapidly thereafter Lawrence Biegelsen    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystI got it and gross margins came in better in 2019 versus your original guidance  What are the puts and takes on the gross margin in 2020 and separately Gary  R D as a percent of sales has been increasing steadily  it s almost 10  of sales in 2019  Where do you see that going over time  Thanks for taking the questions guys Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsOkay  sure  So for gross margins  the gives and takes are  as I outlined in my prepared remarks  pricing on systems  reductions in cost  manufacturing efficiency and mix  mix of both customers and types of product and I think that what we re messaging for next year is that the gross margins will decline slightly reflecting primarily product mix and a shift    the effect of new product and investments in the infrastructure Lawrence Biegelsen    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystAnd R D  Marshall as a percent of sales  I m just curious if you expect that to continue to increase  Sorry  Gary Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsYeah  I know I can jump in and take that one  I think about    we haven t  Phonetic  grown R D as a percentage of sales pretty consistently over the last three years and our messaging to you has been  we re going to bring a couple of new platforms to market in parallel with some of our multiport efforts SP and Ion being those two that we think that next gen imaging and non optical imaging is important  non white light imaging is important and we ve been investing in that domain  We have been investing for scale  We ve talked about the fact that I think there is a virtuous cycle here  which is as utilization goes up and volumes go up  it allows us to start taking advantage of automation opportunities and changing the way we manufacture  That has taken the company to be a little more capital intensive than in years past  but some of the things you were just talking about the linkage to your prior question on gross margin are enabled by these capital investments on multi year timelines that allow us to get production scale advantages and that allows us to share some of that cost savings with our customer and be able to be into lower complexity procedures at good economics and good economics for the company as well as the customer  So we ve been doing that as well  And then lastly  it s been building in digital infrastructure  So those are the major buckets that have been taking the R D spend side  I think we are not thinking that that number will leap going forward  but we also think we re still in the early innings of a baseball game here that have real opportunity long term for the growth of the market and we think that we can position ourselves really well by making sure that those four buckets are adequately stacked  Marshall anything Lawrence Biegelsen    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThanks for taking the question OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel  Please go ahead Frederick Wise    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystHi  good afternoon  Gary  everybody  You talked    Marshall mentioned it    I think Calvin mentioned it that system trade ins may slow  may trend down  I just want to make sure that I m understanding the reasons why  Is it the lack of a major new next gen system launch and so you ve seen the trade ins  quote the easy trade ins and maybe just as part of that  Gary  just reflecting back on R D and innovation  obviously  you re launching a lot of new products and innovation  but should we be thinking that you don t need to launch next gen big iron  Phonetic  or how do we think about that  those two aspects of trade ins and the pipeline Calvin Darling    Senior Director of Finance Investor RelationsSo trade ins  we ve been in the middle of a fairly strong cycle of trade ins and you ve seen it go up quarter over quarter  last two quarters kind of flattening out and what we commented on it at the third quarter  Rick  was that the total population of SI s that are out there that can be traded in obviously is decreasing as customers trade in their systems and so the population is decreasing and when we look back at historical patterns for previous generation products  we think that we re at the peak of how much of that remaining base will be traded in  in any particular quarter and so the two of those things lead us to the conclusion that you will see a decrease in the number of trade ins as we go forward Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsThe second half of the question I might quibble with  the description is big iron  so I m not going to own that  but I will talk to innovation in multiport  We re not done innovating in multiport  We re often asked  are you  but I see SP  I see Ion as  is that it and the answer is categorically no  We think there s room for additional innovation beyond our Gen 4 multiport products and we re working on those things Frederick Wise    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystAnd just two other quick ones  I d be curious to hear more about sales force productivity  you highlighted  Gary the improved productivity in the third quarter  it seems like that s has to be part of the equation I m guessing in the fourth quarter  how do we think about that factor as a driver in 2020  I ll just ask my second one  Your competitors or potential robotic competitors are talking about digital surgery and we ve talked about this before but I just wonder if you have competitors marketing something called digital surgery  how do we imagine Intuitive answering that kind of a functional or marketing push  Thank you so much Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsOkay  on the first question of sales force productivity  we saw a move in the right direction in the fourth quarter  some of the underlying dynamics in terms of rapid procedure growth or a healthy procedure growth driving the need for new territories still exists  So I credit our sales leadership team is doing a really nice job both managing growth and helping the organization become more productive while thinking through territory opportunities as well as efficiency opportunities  That s a long way of saying we made a step in the right direction  I think they have opportunity to keep moving in the right direction in terms of productivity  So far so good With regard to some of the commentary around digital surgery  The short answer is  welcome to the party  I think that we ve been working these issues for more than a decade  As I said before  my initial response is it s a valuable thing to be working on and that s why we ve been doing it  We ve been the Internet of Things in surgical robots for a decade  cloud enabled for a decade  We are quite deep  As you go out and talk a little more than the tag line  you talk about what tag lines are  what s the substance  So dig down a little bit and the substance comes down to I think four opportunities  One opportunity is in the use of big data for analytic power and that says that  as you look across large sets of customers doing various things  can you help establish benchmarks that people can improve upon and we have done that  It s been something we ve been working on  So I think we re becoming quite skilled and will become more so  That s one category  Another category is the use of computing power in real time to aid the surgeon or interventionalists during a case to get a better outcome and absolutely interesting There are many  many companies in the world that are thinking about that and making progress and we are one of them  Ion is fundamentally powered by computing to help you make good decisions  IRIS is fundamentally a real time computing capability in addition to Big Data  So that s one  The next bucket is around education and the reduction of variation team to team  We know that care team variation in any acute intervention  be it surgery robotic surgery  laparoscopy  Phonetic  is highly variable and the use of computing and analytics to help that process is clear and I talk to a little bit about how much we have in simulation  200 000 simulated tasks done by surgeons this last year  17 000 hours of simulation capability  These are things that we can help turn into better learning environments and reduction in care team variation  And the last bucket is efficiency improvement  the use of computing technologies and networking to help hospitals become more productive and to help our company become more productive and we re leveraging those opportunities on both to help our customers and otherwise  So I look forward to the conversation  I think it will win  The winner won t be the tag line  I think the winner will be those who deliver real value that s validated against those four categories Frederick Wise    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystThank you so much Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsWe ll take one more question  operator OperatorOkay  The final question    one moment here  That final question will come from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB  Please go ahead Richard Newitter    SVB Leerink    AnalystHi  thanks for taking the questions  Just two quick ones  The first    I ll ask them both just right upfront  The first one  the comments on chole    second is the training procedure and kind of what you re seeing there as a spillover to again comfortable with the general surgery  are you seeing that same dynamic increase in the usage or the utilization within hernia as kind of like a training ground for other types of general surgeries or is hernia kind of also equally as sticky and then the second question just Marshall  on the INA per case  if the benign growth does accelerate relative to the advanced type cases  what s the impact to gross margin there  Thank you Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsI ll take the first one  I ll let Marshall take the second one  One thing I would    just to be clear on general surgery  is general surgery is a quite a diverse set of procedures with quite a diverse set of practice patterns among general surgeon practitioners or practices  I d  first of all  I think they choose procedures to do not simply to be trained but because they think  they and the patient can be benefited by that procedure  So I don t think they run off and train for the sake of training  I think they decide that there is some value here  They will sequence their way into a practice and that would make sense  both by patient selection and by the type of procedure they do  You had asked does the same kind of effect of  well  let s start with the right patient population for cholecystectomy also apply to something like hernia  The answer to that is yes  Some surgeons will elect to go into a hernia set first then if they find value in the product find value in the process  they may elect to move from there to a different procedure  Interestingly  we found that there is not a one size fits all way that a practice adopts  They may choose a different entry point depending on their interests and experiences  Second question  Marshall Marshall L  Mohr    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerINA per case  if benign procedures were to grow faster than more complex procedures  it s a very slight improvement in gross margin and the advanced instruments have just a slightly lower gross margin than our other instruments Gary S  Guthart    Chief Executive Officer  Member of the Board of DirectorsOkay  that was our last question  In closing  we believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions  Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals  physicians  and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim  better more predictable patient outcomes  better patient experiences  better experiences for care teams  and ultimately a lower total cost of care per patient episode  We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human  It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams  their needs and the environment in which they operate  Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey  We look forward to talking with you again in three months Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  64 minutesCall participants Calvin Darling

111536,333051,ISRG,Why Intuitive Surgical Is a Buy After Reporting Q4 2019 Earnings,news,"Connected healthcare company Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  put the final wrap on 2019  reporting a strong finish to the year for the company s daVinci lineup of robotic surgery machines and related services  It s been an epic run over the last decade  and the still nascent robotic assisted surgery industry has plenty of open space ahead of it 
However  Intuitive s guidance to kick off 2020 left some investors looking for more  and the stock has pulled back over 7  from all time highs as of this writing  A breather was perhaps in the cards after the 23  increase the stock notched last year  but short termism looks to be setting up another buying opportunity for long term shareholders   

A strong finish to a strong year
Intuitive s results accelerated in the final quarter of the year  with revenue and adjusted earnings growing 22  and 18   respectively  Business was boosted by both a growth in worldwide procedures  which grew 16  year over year  driven by higher general surgery and urology   new daVinci machines placed in service  up 12   with the total installed systems totaling 5 582 at year end   and instrument and accessory sales  which increased 24     
It all added up to a great year for Intuitive  albeit one in which earnings grew slower than revenue as the company invested in new research to expand the types of procedures its robots can handle 

Pp   percentage point  Data source  Intuitive Surgical   
As for the point regarding new machines  daVinci SP  which stands for single port  designed for deep tissue access  and Ion  for lung biopsies  are early on in the sales cycle  Six SPs were installed in Q4  bringing the installed base up to 44  and the first three Ion systems placed in Q3 grew to an installed base of 16 by the end of Q4  New uses for both machines continue to be developed  as well as new instruments for the flagship daVinci X and Xi platforms  For example  the E 100 generator and SyncroSeal systems designed to help surgeons cut and seal tissue got FDA approval and began to be sold in the last quarter  and the new IRIS augmented reality system for imaging and analytics also began clinical use 
Don t sweat the early 2020 outlook
All of the new developments at Intuitive are well and good  but in spite of the upbeat news  guidance for the new year fell short of hopes  Total procedures using one of Intuitive s robots grew 18  to 1 23 million worldwide last year  but procedure growth was forecast to slow to a 13  to 16  rate in 2020  As the primary generator of revenue sources  a slowdown in procedure growth would imply sales will follow suit after the 22  surge that marked the end of 2019   
It isn t the only way daVinci can make money  though  as new instruments to support new kinds of surgeries and training and support services should also provide a boost  After the post report pullback  Intuitive s stock trades for 44 5 times adjusted earnings    the cheapest it s been in a few years  Based on average analysts  expected profits in 2020  the stock trades for an earnings multiple of 36 8  implying the general view that profits will keep expanding at a double digit pace   
That is nonetheless a hefty premium for this healthcare stock  but such is the case for high quality companies taking the lead in advancing technology  Besides  this is still a high growth enterprise worth holding for the long haul  especially as healthcare starts to feel the effects of the cloud  connectivity  and big data forces that have been at work in other industries in the past decade  Put another way  investors might be expressing a little displeasure with the immediate term outlook  but there is plenty to like with Intuitive Surgical  The recent pullback looks like an opportunity to start or add to positions in the robotic surgery leader ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pog9a,2070645
111540,333055,ISRG,Intuitive Surgical Shows No Signs of Slowing Down,news,"Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  is the company behind the da Vinci surgical system  one of the leading robotic assisted surgery devices on the market  The da Vinci system was first approved by the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  back in 2000  and the innovative piece of tech has helped Intuitive Surgical perform incredibly well over the years  
The company s shares are up by 236 4  over the past five years alone  whereas the S P 500 is up by only 61 4  over the same period  Despite being about two decades old  though  Intuitive Surgical s signature da Vinci system continues to make headway  and the company s impressive run on the market is likely not over  at least if its latest earnings report is any indication 

Impressive fourth quarter results
Intuitive Surgical s fourth quarter financial results were impressive across the board  The company shipped 336 da Vinci systems during the quarter  compared to 290 during the fourth quarter of 2018  Intuitive Surgical now has 5 582 da Vinci systems installed  which represents a 12  year over year increase 
Furthermore  the number of procedures performed with da Vinci systems increased by 19  year over year  while Intuitive Surgical s revenue of  1 28 billion and its net income under generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  of  358 million both grew by about 22   Digging a little deeper  it is worth noting that the company s top line now relies primarily on its recurring revenue  
Intuitive Surgical derives recurring revenue from several sources  First  there is the sale of instruments and accessories for its da Vinci system  and as the number of procedures performed with Intuitive Surgical s signature robotic surgery device grows  so will the company s sale of instruments and accessories  During the fourth quarter  the company s sales of instruments and accessories were  671 million  representing a 24  year over year increase  And according to the company s CFO  Marshall L  Mohr   The increase in instrument and accessory revenue was primarily driven by procedure growth and stocking orders associated with China system sales   
Once a healthcare provider installs one of its da Vinci systems  Intuitive Surgical provides various services    including maintenance and repair services    to that provider  The company also generates revenue from leasing its da Vinci system  These pricey devices cost anywhere between  500 000 and  2 5 million depending on several factors  the model  configuration  etc    a sum that is beyond the means of some healthcare providers 
Intuitive Surgical started offering  operating lease arrangements  back in 2013 to allow some of its customers the flexibility to acquire the da Vinci system without paying the entire lump sum up front  During the fourth quarter  the company shipped 126 systems under operating lease arrangements  compared to 84 during the prior year quarter  
Intuitive Surgical s recurring revenue accounted for about 67 4  of its total revenue during the third quarter  This is important since it means the company doesn t rely exclusively    or even significantly    on the sale of its da Vinci systems  and Intuitive Surgical can easily weather the storm if sales of da Vinci systems decline  
Worth the premium
Intuitive Surgical is currently trading at 49 37 times past and 37 times future earnings  Also  the company s price to earnings growth  PEG  ratio is 3 89  These valuation metrics aren t particularly attractive  but if there s any company that is worth the premium  Intuitive Surgical most definitely is 
The company is the leader in robotic assisted surgery devices  and despite some 20 years of growth under its belt  Intuitive Surgical continues to make headway  What s more  the company s top line is relying more and more on recurring revenue  and as the number of procedures performed with its da Vinci system continues to rise  so will that recurring revenue

111584,333099,ISRG,Healthcare investors weigh bets as election risks loom,news,By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    If 2016 is any guide  pharmaceutical  biotech and other healthcare stocks could be in for a rough summer and fall heading into another round of U S  elections   But investors may be able to hedge such risks while remaining in the sector if they are willing to pay a premium for medical product companies outside the pharmaceutical supply chain  As with the 2016 presidential election  prescription drug costs could become a hot topic as mid term U S  Congressional elections near  inflaming investor concerns that prices for medicines may not be sustainable in the face of government and market pressures  Just on Wednesday  U S  President Donald Trump said major drug companies would announce price cuts in two weeks  underscoring how the issue remains in the political spotlight  Shares of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and other companies in the supply chain will be in the cross hairs of investor unease over a tougher environment for drug pricing  But given their already sluggish performance  many of those stocks trade at relatively discounted levels and are enticing to investors who believe risks from Washington rhetoric or from the election results already are accounted for in share prices  Shares of other medical product companies  like makers of heart devices  knee replacements or tools for drug research  present healthcare options shielded from pricing attacks  But those stocks generally trade at steeper valuations  based on price to earnings ratios   There are opportunities within healthcare that really don t have much concerns they are going to go after pricing   said David Heupel  a healthcare analyst with Thrivent Financial  But  Heupel added   there certainly is a price to pay   ELECTIONS EQUAL VOLATILITY So far in 2018  the S P 500 healthcare sector  SPXHC  is down about 0 2 percent against a 1 4 percent increase for the broader S P 500  SPX    The health sector lagged severely in 2016 over concerns of a victory by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  who made high drug prices an issue in her campaign against Trump  That year  the healthcare sector dropped nearly 10 percent from Aug  1 until the Nov  8 election  versus only a modest overall market drop   Elections bring volatility  especially within healthcare   Heupel said   I don t think this will be any different   Healthcare stocks briefly rallied last month after Trump unveiled an administration plan to lower drug costs for consumers that avoided aggressive measures  But some analysts say the plan could cause volatility as details become clear  Overall this year  shares of pharmaceutical  and large biotechs  have slumped 6 percent and 5 percent  respectively  Those companies  along with pharmacy benefit managers  drug wholesalers and others in the supply chain  comprise over half of the sector  By contrast  healthcare equipment shares overall  are up 10 percent in 2018  with the life science tools and services index  up 7 percent  although a couple of company stocks have lagged  Shares of other companies in the sector  such as health insurer Humana  N HUM  and lab testing company Quest Diagnostics  N DGX   have also climbed this year   In the healthcare space  it really depends on where you re allocated in terms of success   said King Lip  chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management  The San Francisco firm s holdings include animal health company Zoetis  N ZTS  and surgical robot maker Intuitive Surgical  O ISRG   Analysts also point to lackluster outlooks for much of large pharma and biotech  with company specific setbacks afflicting  Celgene Corp   O CELG  and others  versus strong financial results and outlooks by healthcare equipment companies  GOOD FUNDAMENTALS  A lot of the medtech stocks  it s not just that Washington isn t targeting them   said Teresa McRoberts  healthcare portfolio manager at Fred Alger Management   Fundamentally  a lot of them do have interesting new products   she said  adding they are beating earnings expectations and raising forecasts  But buying healthcare stocks away from the prescription pricing glare comes at a cost  The healthcare equipment index  for example  trades at 21 2 times earnings estimate for the next 12 months  according to Thomson Reuters Datastream  16 percent above its five year average  Conversely  pharmaceutical companies trade at 13 7 times forward earnings estimates  14 percent below their five year average  with biotech companies at 12 6 times  a nearly 20 percent discount  Matthew Miskin  market strategist at John Hancock Investments  said he worries about risks facing biotech and pharmaceutical stocks heading into the election  but  you are getting compensated for that risk    The market has already priced a lot of that in and these companies are still turning out really good earnings growth and the demographic backdrop isn t going away   Miskin said  referring to the expanding aging and middle class population globally  Some investors shrug off the political risks  Nathan Thooft  co head of global asset allocation at Manulife Asset Management  expects healthcare to outperform the broader market over the next year  citing potential deal making activity and reasonable valuations without much sensitivity to interest rates   The headline risks come and go  They are always going to come and go   Thooft said   But ultimately people will look at this and say these stocks do deserve some

from the Health Care Benefits segment to the Pharmacy Services one Pharmacy Services revenues inched up 4 2  to  34 84 billion in the reported quarter  driven by growth in total pharmacy claims volume and the brand name drug price inflation  This was  however  partially offset by a continued client price compression and a hiked generic dispensing rate Total pharmacy claims processed rose 4  on a 30 day equivalent basis  attributable to net new business and the steady adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings Revenues from CVS Health s Retail LTC were nudged up 3 7  year over year to  21 45 billion  Per the company  the result was based on higher prescription volume and branded drug price inflation  partially offset by a relentless reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions  Front store revenues represented 22 7  of total Retail LTC revenues in the reported quarter  primarily banking on improved health product sales Total prescription volume grew 5 9  on a 30 day equivalent basis  boosted by the steady uptake of patient care programs and collaborations with PBMs as well as the preferred status in a number of Medicare Part D networks Within Health Care

111795,333310,ISRG,Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This robotic surgery system company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 84 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 03 billion  up 12 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuitive Surgical 
For Intuitive Surgical  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intuitive Surgical will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Intuitive Surgical would post earnings of  2 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 61  delivering a surprise of  3 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Intuitive Surgical doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuitive-surgical-isrg-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200438972,200438972

111825,333340,ISRG,Quick Look At Health Care Heading Into Q1  19 Earnings,opinion,"Every Thursday night  Bespoke publishes a YTD return for all 11 sectors of the SP 500  and last Thursday night s bar chart shows that the Health Care sector was now negative for 2019 YTD  dramatically underperforming the SP 500 YTD 
Using IBES by Refinitiv actual earnings and revenue growth for the sector  here are the historical growth rates for the Health Care sector 
Earnings Growth 

1 year   16 1  avg
3 year   10 8  avg
5 year   12 4  avg
29 mos   10 2  avg

Revenue Growth 

1 year   7 5  avg
3 year   6 8  avg
5 year   8 1  avg
25 mos   7 9  avg

But here is what is interesting for readers  looking at the sector growth rate revisions since April 1   19  both Q1 and Q2  19 Health Care revisions have been higher 

expected Q1  19 Health Care earnings growth has been revised from 4 5  as of April 1 to  5 1  as of April 19  2019 
expected Q2  19 Health Care earnings growth has been revised from 3  as of April 1 to  3 4  as of April 19  2019 
Quarter s 3   4 of 2019 have been revised slightly lower 

But here is what was really surprising  expected Health Care sector revenue growth is 13 3  for Q1  19 and  12 4  for Q2  19 
Those revenue growth rates are well above the historical averages shown above 
Here was a snippet cut and pasted from  This Week in Earnings  on Health Care revenue growth 
 The health care sector has the highest  expected  revenue growth rate  13 3   of any sector  It is expected to earn  506 4B in 19Q1  compared to revenue of  447 1B in 18Q1  All of the 10 sub industries in the sector are anticipated to see higher revenue than a year ago  The health care services  56 4   and managed health care  13 5   sub industries have the highest revenue growth in the sector  If these sub industries are removed  the growth rate declines to 3 1     The one flaw to this blog is that I don t have access to those  sub sector  growth rates or revisions on a weekly basis  I ve asked frequently   
Summary conclusion  Has the drop in Health Care been a head fake for 2019 or is there some worries over  Medicare for All  and nationalized medicine as the Presidential rhetoric heats up  During the Spring and Summer of 2016  when it was widely thought that Hillary Clinton would be our next President  the Health Care sector didn t trade well into the election 
Clients are long biotech in the form of the IBB and the XBI  which didn t really get hit until last week  probably since the sector is below it s all time highs last seen in 2015  and the fact is biotech does seem to correlate with the Russell 2000 which has lagged for some time too  so I felt biotech was a safer way to play Health Care for clients  and whether that was a smart allocation remains to be seen  Our largest single stock position in Health care is Pfizer  NYSE PFE  since it and Merck  NYSE MRK  are working off the 20 year bases formed after the drop from the year 2000 highs  Both pharma giants have substantial free cash generation  good dividends and from a sentiment perspective are completely unloved and unwanted  although Merck  which was added to on Thursday  has seen some success with Keytruda 
So is the Health Care under performance peril or opportunity  As Bespoke noted earlier in the week in one of their research hits  under performing sectors like Health Care  when within a bull market   usually remain under performers  but I d suggest readers look at your favorite names and watch and see what Q1  19 earnings look like and what happens with earnings revisions

111854,333369,ISRG,Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  Up 2 9  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG   Shares have added about 2 9  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Intuitive Surgical due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers

111855,333370,ISRG,Top Stock Reports For Visa  Honeywell   Biogen,opinion,"Tuesday  March 12  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Visa  V   Honeywell  HON  and Biogen  BIIB   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Visa s shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year   22 3  vs   14 3    Visa s results were driven by growth in payments volume  cross border volume and processed transactions  and a lower tax rate  The Zacks analyst thinks numerous strategic acquisitions and alliances  technology upgrades and effective marketing have paved the way for long term growth and consistent increase in revenues  
Visa is well poised to gain from growing electronic payment processing and a solid brand name  Its strong capital position enables investments in business  Nevertheless  high client incentives and operating expenses  and foreign exchange volatility might put pressure on margins  Softness in cross border volumes is another concern 
 You can   
Shares of Honeywell have underperformed the Zacks Diversified Operations industry in the past three months  gaining  10 3  vs  a  12 8  increase  Honeywell believes that strength in its commercial aftermarket and sensing businesses as well as solid demand for its productivity and commercial fire products will boost its revenues in the quarters ahead  
The Zacks analyst thinks stronger sales volumes  increased productivity and ongoing commercial effectiveness actions will likely boost near term profitability  Notably  the company anticipates generating organic sales growth in the range of 2 5  in 2019  Rising costs of revenues are a worry for the company s gross margin  
Also  analysts have become increasingly bearish on the company over the past couple of months  Increases in debt levels can increase its financial obligations

Biogen s shares have underperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry year to date   3 5  vs   11 9    Biogen has a strong position in the MS market with a wide range of products  The Zacks analyst likes its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer s  Parkinson s and stroke  among others  Meanwhile  its newest drug Spinraza is performing well and has multi billion dollar potential  
Biogen s efforts to regularly in license assets to build its pipeline are encouraging with several having transformative potential  Multiple data readouts are expected in 2019 with multiple potential launches in the early 2020s  However  its core MS business  excluding Ocrevus royalties  has been largely flat 
Also  potential competition to Spinraza from competitors  gene therapy programs for SMA is a concern  Though Biogen s CNS pipeline is attractive  it is a high risk area

111858,333373,ISRG,Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 18  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This robotic surgery system company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 7  
Revenues are expected to be  980 40 million  up 15 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuitive Surgical 
For Intuitive Surgical  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 96  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intuitive Surgical will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Intuitive Surgical would post earnings of  2 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 96  delivering a surprise of  1  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Intuitive Surgical doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuitive-surgical-isrg-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200405960,200405960

111890,333405,ISRG,Ericsson  ERIC  To Report Q4 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,Ericsson  BS ERICAs    NASDAQ ERIC   is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2018 financial results before the opening bell on Jan 25  In the last reported quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 200  The company is likely to report higher revenues in the to be reported quarter on the back of healthy growth dynamics  Whether this can result into an earnings beat remains to be seen Let s find out how things are shaping up prior to the announcement Factors at PlayEricsson conducted 4G LTE trial using 600 MHz of spectrum  together with Agri Valley Services and NewCore Wireless  in the beginning of the fourth quarter  The trial  which took place in Caro  MI  represents the first of its kind with a regional carrier in the United States  The 600 MHz low band spectrum enables operators to extend coverage by utilizing low band radio wave propagation  resulting in more coverage per cell site in rural areas  This is considered to be a major step forward by Ericsson in offering 600 MHz 4G LTE coverage to its rural customers on existing network infrastructure During the fourth quarter  the Swedish firm entered into a strategic partnership with Fujitsu   a leading Japanese information and communication technology company   to deliver 5G network solutions and related services  They jointly aim to develop their combined portfolios  covering radio access and core network  for the 5G market in Japan and connect communications service providers to the global 5G ecosystem  Moreover  Ericsson inked a new deal with Telenor Group   a Norwegian multinational telecommunications company   to transform the latter s core network in Sweden  Denmark and Norway  by deploying Ericsson Cloud Core solutions for 5G across multiple data centers During the quarter  Ericsson was chosen by Volvo Car Group under a five year contract to provide the industrialized Ericsson Connected Vehicle Cloud platform to facilitate the latter s digital vehicle services in more than 120 markets worldwide  Notably  the deal  which would enable Volvo Car Group to provide car owners with its latest developments in connected car digital services  is the largest to date for Ericsson Connected Vehicle Cloud Further  Ericsson was chosen by Swisscom   the largest telecommunications service provider in Switzerland   to augment the latter s customer experience through deployment of the Ericsson Expert Analytics solution into its existing Big Data ecosystem  Ericsson also secured a multi year contract from Millicom s commercial brand   TIGO  Per the deal  Ericsson will work on modernizing TIGO s radio access network across Honduras and Paraguay  involving the rollout of Ericsson Radio System The healthy demand for Ericsson services is likely to translate into higher revenues in the quarter  However  management expects flat business from North America while the rest of the world is likely to deliver normal seasonality  For the fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at  6 884 million  up from  6 881 million reported in the year earlier quarter

111923,333438,ISRG,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Intuitive Surgical  ISRG ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Instruments industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this robotic surgery system company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 9 04   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Intuitive Surgical came out with earnings of  2 83 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 65 per share  representing a surprise of 6 79   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  2 48 per share and it actually produced earnings of  2 76 per share  delivering a surprise of 11 29  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Intuitive Surgical lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Intuitive Surgical has an Earnings ESP of  1 34  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 24  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-intuitive-surgical-isrg-200374856,200374856

111929,333444,ISRG,What Makes Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Intuitive Surgical currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ISRG that show why this robotic surgery system company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For ISRG  shares are up 7 13  over the past week while the Zacks Medical   Instruments industry is up 2 36  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 9 33  compares favorably with the industry s 4 29  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Intuitive Surgical have risen 6 79   and are up 19 68  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  6 46  and  3 85   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to ISRG s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  ISRG is currently averaging 815 189 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with ISRG 
Over the past two months  2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost ISRG s consensus estimate  increasing from  10 97 to  11 01 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Taking into account all of these elements  it should come as no surprise that ISRG is a  2  Buy  stock with a Momentum Score of A  If you ve been searching for a fresh pick that s set to rise in the near term  make sure to keep Intuitive Surgical on your short list ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-intuitive-surgical-isrg-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now-200376763,200376763
111930,333445,ISRG,Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This robotic surgery system company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 04 billion  up 16 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 64  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuitive Surgical 
For Intuitive Surgical  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 34  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Intuitive Surgical will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Intuitive Surgical would post earnings of  2 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 83  delivering a surprise of  6 79  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Intuitive Surgical appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuitive-surgical-isrg-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200376695,200376695

Surgical  Inc    NASDAQ ISRG    Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT   and NuVasive  Inc    NASDAQ NUVA   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks                                                 Recent headlines have highlighted the issues some American companies are having with recent tariffs imposed on imports and the retaliatory tariffs imposed by our trading partners on goods exported from the U S  to other markets Harley Davidsonhas been specifically singled out by President Trump for its decision to shift some manufacturing overseas in order to sell its motorcycles to European markets while avoiding approximately  2 200 per vehicle in tariffs While sales of motorcycles and other recreational equipment are on the rise in the U S  thanks to a strong economy and record low unemployment  manufacturers who have the smallest reliance on imported raw materials or sales outside the country will be in an advantaged position to continue to operate normally with minimal regard for tariffs and could even gain market share and or pricing power versus imported products Polaris Industriesmanufactures and sells Powersports equipment primarily in the U S  including Motorcycles  Off Road ATVs  Snowmobiles and a wide range of parts and accessories  Through its brands Polaris  Ranger RZR and Indian motorcycles  Polaris is far and away the leader in sales of Powersports equipment in North America It s worth noting that Indian Motorcycles   a revival of an iconic American brand produced from 1901 to 1953   makes large V Twin road cycles that compete directly with Harley Davidson s products Polaris operates 16 In House manufacturing facilities worldwide  10 of which are in the U S   as well as 1 in Mexico  3 in France  1 in Poland and 1 in China  In the current environment  managers of public companies have a difficult job weighing the cost benefits of manufacturing overseas  while minimizing the negative effects of taxes and tariffs   and now  apparently even avoiding the ire of the President Polaris recently opened a new manufacturing plant in Alabama and announced plans for a new distribution center in Nevada Their diverse manufacturing footprint allows Polaris to continue producing good for the U S  in the U S   while serving while serving markets abroad   which are growing at an annual rate of 27    with goods manufactured in jurisdictions which minimize tariffs  BlackRock Capital is a class of investment known as a  Business Development Company   BDC  which were created by a 1980 amendment to the Investment Company Act of 1940  BDCs are unregulated closed end investment companies that invest in small and mid sized businesses  They are similar to Private Equity or Venture Capital Funds  except that they are usually traded on an exchange like a stock  instead of being open only to very wealthy investors BlackRock Capital provides middle market companies with flexible financing solutions  including senior and junior  unsecured and subordinated debt securities and loans and equity securities  Unlike a traditional private equity firm  BlackRock Capital makes non control investments in middle market companies The goal of a BDC is to invest in non public companies that investors would not otherwise have access to and to provide cash distributions to shareholders based on the cash flows of its investments  Taxed as a Regulated Investment Company  RIC   BlackRock Capital pays little or no corporate income tax as long as it passes through at least 90  of taxable income as dividends to investors Unfortunately  credit quality across the middle market lending space has been declining lately and BDCs like BlackRock Capital have seen a smaller pool of poorer performing loans than in the past  In their most recent earnings press release  Chairman and interim CEO James Keenan commented   Generally speaking  the loan market remains issuer friendly with tighter spreads  higher leverage levels and weaker structures  which is a continuation of market conditions seen over the last 12 18 months  This is a familiar sentiment across the middle market lending sector  As large investment vehicles with cumulative trillions of dollars that need to be invested   like Pensions  Public Retirement Funds and Endowments   reach for yield in a low interest rate environment  loan quality is getting squeezed  with less deserving issuers getting more attractive deals BlackRock Capital Shares have declined nearly 40  over the past 4 years as the company has missed numerous quarterly estimates  even as the consensus has steadily declined  Due to declining earnings estimates  BlackRock Capital is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  3 Stocks to Tap the Minimally Invasive Surgery Market BoomThe United States has hit rough waters of late  Few analysts label the troubles as self invited while others foresee a revolution  Rising trade war tensions between the United States and China are showing no signs of abatement  The issue has escalated to a point where imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may go up to  450 billion on both the sides Moreover  President Trump s mulling over a restriction for Chinese companies when it comes to investing in U S  tech firms to avert technology export is likely to worsen the scenario  If this wasn t enough  the United States is urging countries to stop importing oil from Iran by November  raising supply related concernsFurthermore  Trump s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China  the European Union  Mexico and Canada along with threats of higher tariffs for imported cars and auto parts have raised concerns MedTech on Stable GroundIn the wake of such a rocky scenario  investors are consistently on the lookout for safer sectors  With tailwinds

Anthem  ANTM  ran higher  peaking at the end of January  It pulled back and then settled into a 5 month consolidation with a slight upward drift  Recently it pulled back from making a higher high to a higher low  And Friday it started moving higher again  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone with the MACD level but positive  Look for continuation to participate higher 
Apache  NYSE APA 

Apache  APA  started higher in March and has continued to move up  Last week it closed a gap from January  ending the week at resistance  The RSI is in the bullish zone with the MACD positive and rising  Look for a push over resistance to participate to the upside 
Costco  NASDAQ COST 

Costco  COST  started higher out of consolidation in June and ran to an all time high toward the end of the month  It pulled back from there to the 20 day SMA in a bull flag  Friday saw it breaking the bull flag to the upside  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone with the MACD flat but positive  Look for continuation to participate higher 
DaVita HealthCare  NYSE DVA 

DaVita  DVA  moved higher over its 200 day SMA with a gap up in December  It ran to a top in January and then started to pullback  It bottomed as it moved under the 200 day SMA again and consolidated for a month  In May it started back higher again and is moving up in steps  Friday looks to have begun the next step up  The RSI is turning back up and the MACD leveling and positive  Look for continuation to participate 
Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG 

Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  has continued to march higher but with some volatile pullbacks  It gapped higher in April and then refilled the gap before a push higher  The price paused in May and then made another move up in June to resistance  Friday it moved back to resistance after a minor pullback 2 weeks ago  The RSI is rising in the bullish zone with the MACD about to cross up and positive  Look for a push over resistance to participate 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with the 4th of July behind  sees slow holiday trading ahead and it seems to be good for equities so far 
Elsewhere look for gold to bounce in its downtrend while Crude Oil may pause in its uptrend  The US Dollar Index is also pausing in its uptrend while US Treasuries are breaking out to the upside  The Shanghai Composite continues to look better lower but may have a short term pause while Emerging Markets may be reversing to the upside after a several months long pullback 
Volatility looks to continue to creep lower keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  Their charts all look good in the long term with the IWM the strongest in the short run  but the SPY and QQQ reversing higher out of support

112205,333720,ISRG,Market Overlooks Summit To Focus On The Fed,opinion,"Programming Note  Sheraz Mian  the Director of Research here at Zacks  was talking about the Q2 earnings season on WGN Radio s The Opening Bell this morning  Check out his appearance right here  
	As expected  the meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong un didn t have much of an impact on the market  The agreement signed at the summit proved to be too vague to cause much of a reaction 
	The market is more interested in tomorrow s Fed announcement  A rate hike on Wednesday is a foregone conclusion  but the focus will be on the Dot Plot  Are we still set for only three hikes this year  one more after tomorrow   Or is a fourth hike still on the table  We ll see   
	Unlike yesterday  the major indices moved sharply higher in the final hour of Tuesday s session  The NASDAQ finished with a 0 57  advance to a new high of 7703 8 and the S P climbed 0 17  to 2786 9  However  the Dow couldn t make it all the way back and finished with a slight 0 01  slip to 25320 7  Despite the media coverage of the meeting between Kim and Trump  the summit had little effect on the markets   said Jeremy in Counterstrike   The Fed is really all that matters  We will likely see a rate hike again tomorrow  but what will be more important is what kind of language will be used  For short term trading reasons  anything taken as dovish will likely help rip markets above 2800  
	Other than the summit  the biggest news today didn t come until after the close  A federal judge approved the  85 billion acquisition of Time Warner by AT T  NYSE T   Now  the market is getting ready for a deluge of new M A coming down the pike 
	The portfolios were very active today and included a lot of profit taking  Stocks Under  10 cashed in a triple digit winner to make room for a new buy  while Surprise Trader secured a double digit return in less than a week  Meanwhile  Counterstrike sold all or parts of three positions to fit in a new buy  while Short List swapped out four names  Read more in the highlights section below  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Stocks Under  10  The portfolio is completely full  so Brian Bolan needs to sell a name before he can add a new one  Fortunately  the service is sitting on a triple digit winner in Extreme Networks  EXTR   a maker of wireless networking products and services  The stock was sold today for a profit of about 120  
	The move gives Brian a chance to take advantage of some shorts in the retail world  A lot of shorts have been getting squeezed in the last few days on some good reports from retailers  and the editor thinks the same thing is happening right now with Big 5 Sporting Goods  BGFV   The stock has a  ferociously high  short interest of 45  of the float  and Brian thinks those shorts have overstayed their welcome  He believes BGFV could be set to move to  11 or more on some good news  Read the full write up for more on today s moves Counterstrike  The rising market has Jeremy in a buying mood  but first he needs to clear some space and take a few profits  On Tuesday  the portfolio made these moves 
	  Sold half of Echo Global Logistics  ECHO  for a 10 8  return
	  Sold all of Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  for a 9 9  return
	  Sold a third of Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  for a 5  return
	These moves gave the editor enough space to add Parsley Energy  PE  with a 7  allocation  The stock has pulled back from a solid quarterly report in May that included a positive earnings surprise of 40   Jeremy thinks the stock has bottomed and is poised to move if crude oil ticks higher again  which it is likely to do this summer  Read the complete commentary for more specifics on all of today s moves Surprise Trader  The portfolio sold Restoration Hardware  RH  on Tuesday for a nice 40 7  profit IN LESS THAN ONE WEEK  Dave added this name last Wednesday in a  bet the jockey  not the horse  move due to his confidence in Chairman   CEO Gary Friedman  Well  shares of this upscale furniture retailer soared today after a positive earnings surprise in its latest quarterly report  which also included a strong outlook for this quarter  The editor says the shorts are getting routed  so this is a great time to cash in a double digit winner with RH

that stocks with an impressive Growth Style Score of A or B combined with a bullish Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2 offer the best upside potential Accordingly  IDEXX Laboratories has an encouraging net margin  net income sales  of 13 9  as well against the industry s negative 14 9   Also  the company s sale to assets ratio of 1 26 compared with the industry s 0 63 makes it a sturdy growth pick Let s find out is the recent positive momentum is sustainable or not The company is a leading manufacturer of products and services  primarily for the companion animal veterinary  livestock and poultry  It exited the first quarter of 2018 on a commendable note with better than expected earnings and revenue performances The stock s stellar performance was driven by robust sales at the CAG  Companion Animal Group  business  In the first quarter  CAG revenues rose 13  organically year over year  supported by CAG Diagnostics  recurring organic revenue growth Moreover  IDEXX VetLab consumables organic revenue growth was firm on the back of an expanding premium instrument base in the United States and the international markets  including growth in competitive instrument placements  increasing utilization and a consistent customer retention Notably  in January 2018  the company made Catalyst SDMA Test available in North America  With this  IDEXX s point of care customers will now be able to add SDMA as an essential element to the routine chemistry panel  Apart from the United States and Canada  IDEXX expects to launch the Catalyst SDMA Test in other parts of the world over the next several months Continuing with a slew of developments  IDEXX Laboratories entered into a global agreement in January with the diagnostic company called Applied BioCode  Per the deal  IDEXX Laboratories will bring its Reference Laboratories customers on the digital multiplex platform built by Applied BioCode  Management aims at commercially launching this technology in 2019 The companion animal market fundamentals remain consolidated on the global runway for tremendous growth  Management s innovation based  multi modality global strategy accelerated the recurrent CAG Diagnostics revenue growth in the reported quarter  Moreover  a substantial top line rise was contributed by considerable contributions from other business segments  Furthermore  a raised guidance for 2018 bottom line per share instills confidence in the stock We are also optimistic about the company witnessing double digit organic revenue growth in its international business  This upside indicated steady consumable revenue gains riding on Catalyst instrument base and average testing utilization Additionally  the company boasts a secure cash balance  allowing it to carry out share repurchases Meanwhile  IDEXX Laboratories  heavy dependence on third party distributors raises a concern  Moreover  a rigid competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on the company s margin Other Key PicksA few other top ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Abiomed  Inc    NASDAQ ABMD    Genomic Health  Inc    NASDAQ GHDX   and Intuitive Surgical   NASDAQ ISRG   Abiomed

112270,333785,ISRG,US North Korea Summit Talks Resume  4 MedTech Stocks To Watch ,opinion,President Donald Trump s calling off of the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last Thursday was quite a shocker The abandonement of summit plans dealt a blow to the underpenetrated and emerging markets of Asia  which are a solid source of revenues for more than 80  of U S  based multinational companies  The effects of the political mayhem caused the MSCI s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan  South Korea s KOSPI and Japan s Nikkei to plummet Major Wall Street indices  S P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost ground as well Considering this trend of downward movements  the White House decided to conduct the meeting  The United States announced its plans to send a  pre advance team  to Singapore to prepare for Trump Kim summit on Jun 12 MedTech appears to be one of the very few sectors that might shelter investors from the political tension  Shrugging off the current volatility  the Medical Products industry has returned 0 2  since the call off against the S P 500 s fall of 0 4   In fact  analysts believe that the MedTech sector will be able to strengthen its foothold at a faster rate if the meeting goes on as planned This is because there are a number of U S  based MedTech companies operating in Asia  Post the success of the summit  these companies will be able to spread their network in North Korea and augment overall production  Per research by Statista  the MedTech market in the Asia Pacific region is estimated to reach a worth of around  78 billion in 2018 Buoyed by the encouraging projections  it would rather be interesting to see how the  companies are placed amid the political turmoil 4 MedTech Stocks to GainMeanwhile  the Medical Product companies have already been gaining from organic growth  R D innovation  higher consolidation  tax abolition as well as focus on emerging markets including Japan  South Korea  China  Vietnam  India  Philippines and more In fact  stakeholders in the medical universe have been eyeing these markets over the last couple of years  These companies are bullish about growing medical awareness  economic prosperity  an aging population  increasing wealth  government s focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage in the APAC space Below  we take a look at four leading MedTech players that are gaining from the prospects in the APAC market Becton  Dickinson and Company   NYSE BDX    popularly known as BD  particularly focuses on broader emerging markets like India  China  Brazil and Turkey  whose economic and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly  In particular  safety engineered products continue to drive growth in the emerging markets  We believe that exposure in these markets will boost the top line  which in turn will accelerate EPS growth This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s shares have returned 16 2  in a year  significantly higher than the S P 500 index s gain of 11 4  Baxter International s   NYSE BAX   solid presence in Asia  precisely India  is worth a mention  The company has research hubs in Japan and China  Recently  Baxter completed the acquisition of India based Claris Injectables  a global generic injectables pharmaceutical company  for almost  625 million This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock has outperformed the S P 500 index in a year s time  The stock has returned 21   Intuitive Surgical Inc s   NASDAQ ISRG   growing interest in the emerging markets  specifically in the APAC region  bodes well  In the past two years  the company s procedure performance in Asia projected consistent strength  The company registered solid growth in China  Japan and Korea The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company s shares have returned 49 1  in a year  You can see  Boston Scientific Corporation s   NYSE BSX   growth strategy comprises the pursuit of development opportunities outside the United Station through strengthening of global presence  inclusive of emerging markets  Against the backdrop of flattening or declining sales growth in developed markets like the United States and Europe  Boston Scientific is fortifying its foothold in the emerging markets of Brazil  Russia  India and China  BRIC  In first quarter 2018  business from the emerging markets registered 17  growth  Business in China was once again remarkable  up 23  year over year   The company is currently projecting an improvement in performance in China banking on the recent approval of SYNERGY This Zacks Rank  2 stock has returned 11 7  in a year  Things to Remember Things are not so easy as they appear to be  Americans should never forget that former president George W  Bush referred North Korea as an  Axis of evil   as it sponsored terrorism and had solid access to nuclear weapons Further  North Korea s multiple trials of nuclear warheads have dampened the inter country relationship  Analysts believe that an unforeseen summit may not solve these age old problems  Further  no one can guarantee that Kim Jong Un s  tremendous anger and open hostility  will not offend Trump anymore as it did last week However  Trump s team is expecting to reach an agreement to settle the North Korean nuclear and other issues in the meeting Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the

112374,333889,ISRG,Orthofix  OFIX  Stock Declines 13  On  18 Earnings View Cut,opinion,"Shares of Orthofix International N V    NASDAQ OFIX   have lost 13  over the past two weeks since the company s first quarter 2018 earnings release on Apr 30  2018 
Despite better than expected bottom line numbers  shares dropped due to lowered earnings outlook for the company in 2018  Over this period  the company has also significantly underperformed the  it belongs to  The stock has lost 12 5  against the industry s 3 7  gain 
Let us delve deeper into the earnings details of Orthofix 
The company reported first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 39 cents from continuing operations  The figure was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 3   The bottom line surged 44 4  year over year primarily on strong sales growth at the company s BioStim  Extremity Fixation and Spine Fixation strategic business units  SBU  

 
Excluding one time items  net income from continuing operations in the first quarter came in at 27 cents per share versus the net loss from continuing operations of 13 cents  thereby showing a remarkable year over year improvement 
Sales Details
Orthofix s first quarter sales improved 5 8   up 3 3  at constant exchange rate or CER  to  108 7 million  almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  109 million  As a result of the company s adoption of the revenue recognition accounting change at the beginning of 2018  Orthofix noted that if it converts the consolidated revenues of first quarter 2017 into the new standard  growth would have been 2 4  at CER in the reported quarter  Sales were primarily driven by a strong performance by the company s three SBUs  namely BioStim  Extremity Fixation and Spine Fixation  partly offset by a year over year decline in Biologics business 
SBU Details
For the first quarter  the company posted BioStim sales of  46 2 million  reflecting 3 6   same at CER  growth from the prior year period  
Extremity Fixation sales were  27 5 million in the quarter under review with 14 9  improvement  up 4 3  at CER  from first quarter 2017  The company realized a continued uptake of new products and a commendable performance in most of the company s global markets including the United States Orthofix International N V  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Orthofix reported Spine Fixation SBU sales of  20 7 million  reflecting 7 5   up 7 2  at CER  growth over the year earlier quarter  This uptick can be attributed to product launches and the adopted strategic initiatives 
Biologics SBU sales totaled  14 3 million  down 4 4   same at CER  from the year ago quarter  This decline resulted from the contractual reduction in the marketing service fee percentage that Orthofix receives from MTF Biologics 
Margins
In the first quarter  gross margin contracted 23 basis points  bps  to 77 8   Unfavorable sales mix impacted the quarterly gross margin 
Sales and marketing expenses rose 3 6  year over year to  50 2 million  General and Administrative expenses were up 6 6  to  19 5 million  The company witnessed a 6 6  decrease in research and development expenses to  6 9 million  Overall  adjusted operating margin expanded 148 bps to 7 2  owing to increased operating expenses 
Cash Position
Orthofix exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of  77 1 million compared with  81 2 million at the end of 2017  For the first quarter  net cash used in operating activities was  3 6 million compared with  10 8 million a year ago 
2018 Guidance
Orthofix has lowered its 2018 earnings view as it expects Biologic sales to be flat or less by low single digits for the full year due to contractual decrease in the marketing service fee the company is going to receive from MTF Biologics  Adjusted EPS from continuing operations are expected in the range of  1 58  1 78  falling below the earlier projected band of  1 76  1 84  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year adjusted EPS stands at  1 67  within the company s projected range 
Full year net sales projection has been increased to the band of  458  464 million  earlier prediction was  450  455 million   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year revenues is pegged at  462 7 million  lying within but near the upper end of the guided range 
Our Take
Orthofix exited the first quarter of 2018 on a mixed note  While earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate  sales almost matched the consensus mark  Investors are upset about poor Biologics prospects  which will continue to be a drag on the overall performance throughout the remainder of the year  Accordingly  the company has to reduce its full year earnings expectation 
This apart  currency fluctuations  a competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges to the company  Moreover  higher costs and operating expenses are a matter of grave concern for Orthofix  Also  heavy dependence on a third party for final distribution of products exposes the company to heightened risks  
On a positive note  the top line was substantially driven by strength in Extremity Fixation as well as Spine Fixation businesses  which are expected to continue in the near term on the back of sales force enhancements  expanded distributorship network and introduction of products

Orthofix carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Some better ranked stocks in the broader medical space  having posted solid results this earnings season are  Intuitive Surgical   NASDAQ ISRG    Chemed Corp    NYSE CHE   and Baxter International Inc    NYSE BAX    While Intuitive Surgical sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Chemed and Baxter carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

112531,334046,ISRG,Top Stock Reports For BlackRock  Charter Communications   Intuitive Surgical ,opinion,"Monday  April 23  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including BlackRock  BLK   Charter Communications  NASDAQ CHTR  and Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
BlackRock s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Management industry in the last six months    10 7  vs   1 5    This performance was supported by impressive earnings surprise history as the company surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  Its first quarter 2018 results were supported by higher revenues and growth in assets under management  AUM  
The company is undertaking initiatives to restructure its actively managed equities business and expand globally via acquisitions to further boost top line growth  Also  its efficient capital deployment activities will continue to enhance shareholder value  However  mounting expenses  mainly due to continued rise in marketing costs  might hurt the bottom line growth to some extent  The company s high dependence on overseas revenues remains a matter of concern 
 You can   
Shares of Charter Communications have outperformed the Zacks Cable TV industry over the past three months   17 4  vs   18 1    Charter s residential and commercial internet and voice customer growth continues to accelerate  which is evident from the revenue growth and subscriber gain  The Zacks analyst thinks the recently announced partnership with Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  to develop back end software to support services for Xfinity and Spectrum mobile offerings is significantly positive for the company s growth prospects 
The collaboration will help in saving costs for both the companies  However  the company continues to struggle due to sluggish growth in a saturated and competitive multi channel U S  video market  Charter also faces stiff competition from online TV streaming service providers  The company s high debt level and consolidation related woes are other potential hazards 
 You can   
Strong Buy ranked Intuitive Surgical s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Instruments industry over the last year  gaining  66 5  vs  1   Intuitive Surgical ended the first quarter of 2018 on a solid note  with both earnings and revenues surpassing expectations  The company s flagship da Vinci procedures recorded solid growth and holds promise for the quarters ahead  
The company also saw solid expansion outside the United States in the recent past  A suite of regulatory approvals buoys optimism  Solid growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes lent Intuitive Surgical a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market  However  the company expects U S  sales to decline in the quarters ahead  which raises concern 
Furthermore  looming foreign exchange volatility also adds to the woes  Intense competition in niche space and long sale and purchase order cycles of da Vinci unit has been currently plaguing the company

112567,334082,ISRG,Top Research Reports For UnitedHealth  Morgan Stanley   Anheuser Busch,opinion,"Tuesday  March 20  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including UnitedHealth  UNH   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  and Anheuser Busch  BUD   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
UnitedHealth s shares have marginally underperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry in the last one year  up  34 2  vs   34 5    The Zacks analyst likes the company s robust Government business and continued strong growth at Optum  Its international business and strong capital position that allows for business investment are other positives  
It has been witnessing an increase in membership over many years  The company raised its 2018 earnings guidance led by tax reform upside  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised 15 4  upward over the last 90 days  Nevertheless  membership loss in its fee based commercial business and Brazilian business will pull down overall membership growth 
 You can   
Shares of Morgan Stanley have outperformed the Zacks Investment Banking industry over the last three months   7 7  vs   6 1    supported by the company s impressive earnings surprise history  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters 
The Zacks analyst likes the company s efforts to lower balance sheet risk  strengthen wealth management operations along with its cost saving initiatives  Further  lower tax rates will aid profitability in the quarters ahead  However  persistent fall in net interest income  despite rising interest rates  remains a concern  Also  overall trading weakness is expected to hurt the company s top line growth in the near term 
 You can   
Anheuser Busch s shares have underperformed the Zacks Alcoholic Beverages industry over the last three months  gaining  0 8  vs  an increase of  2 2   However  both top and bottom line outpaced estimates and improved year over year in the fourth quarter  In fact  the quarter marked earnings beat after seven consecutive negative surprises while revenues surpassed estimates after two straight misses  
The Zacks analyst likes its robust brand portfolio and solid geographical reach  The company keeps introducing near beer alternatives along with no  and low alcohol beers to resonate with changing demand  Further  SABMiller s buyout has enhanced its position in the global beer market  
Though the company anticipates delivering strong top line growth for 2018  backed by solid brands performance and robust commercial plans  it sees volatility in certain key markets  Moreover  it envisions a soft first quarter  owing to difficult comparisons  and phasing of marketing and sales initiatives

And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation

Robots and AI are improving and becoming an integral part of our lives  Almost every day  we learn about some new real life benefits of these innovative technologies 
Jeremie highlighted some of the key growth areas in this field and why investors should not ignore this rapidly evolving and exponentially growing space 
We then discussed the index created by Robo Global  The company has a team of experts that looks at the entire robotics and automation landscape to identify the companies to be included in the index 
Jeremie explained the process of selection of constituents bellwether as well as non bellwether   He also talked about the benefits of equal weighing approach  which largely eliminates single stock risk 
About 40  of ETF assets are invested in US companies and rest in international companies  Japanese companies get about 28  allocation  which makes sense since Japan has been a leader in robotics 
So  in addition to familiar US names like iRobot   NASDAQ IRBT    Intuitive Surgical   NASDAQ ISRG    Rockwell Automation   NYSE ROK   and Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA    we see a lot of non US companies in the ETF 
Jeremie talked about some foreign companies that are at the forefront of these technologies 
Finally  we discussed impressive earnings growth of some of these companies  which resulted in the index s impressive return of 47  in 2017  Jeremie explained that despite this surge  many companies still look very attractive from valuation perspective

Bruker has been trading above the broader  over the past three months  The stock has returned 18 7   higher than the 6  gain of the broader industry during the period 
In the last three quarters  Bruker s NANO Surfaces group business realized profitability owing to prior restructuring and cost actions  In the last reported third quarter 2017  high single digit growth was driven by contributions from Hysitron nanoindenting product s acquisition in January 2017 and improved results at the AXS business

More good news is that Bruker s MALDI Biotyper franchise has grown into an impressive system worth approximately  90 million per annum  We are happy to note that demand for the MALDI Biotyper is increasing in the applied markets  specifically for food  feed and beverage categories segments 
Based on recent developments witnessed in its product portfolio  management believes that Bruker is poised to double its microbiology business over the next four five years  The company s raised 2017 guidance is also indicative of brighter prospects

high in the region  Furthermore  the need for cutting edge MedTech products and services is significantly high across the world  with APAC being no exception In fact  a research report by McKinsey

112654,334169,ISRG,Top Stock Reports For Nike  PayPal   BNY Mellon ,opinion,"Wednesday  December 20  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Nike  NYSE NKE   PayPal  PYPL  and BNY Mellon  BK   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Nike s shares have outperformed the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry over the last one year   22 8  vs   22 4    driven by strength in international business and the global Nike Direct business  Also  Nike has been focused on its Consumer Direct Offense plan  
Driven by its Triple Double strategy  this restructuring plan focuses on using digital methods for rapid innovation and product development  along with strengthening consumer relations by operating through core regions  It also has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters  
However  lackluster sales trend in the company s key North American market remains a headwind  Also  gross margin in the last quarter was hurt by currency woes and a higher mix of off price sales  Further  management anticipates near term results to be hurt by the tough retail environment  which led to a bleak second quarter view  Nevertheless  second quarter estimates have been stable ahead of the earnings release 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated PayPal have outperformed the Zacks Internet Software industry in the year to date period   88 8  vs   32 9    PayPal is currently riding on partnerships and mobile centrism  The company continues to perform strongly in global payments  especially mobile  PayPal s ongoing strategic partnerships with Visa and MasterCard offer great flexibility and choice to consumers 
It recently extended its partnership with Mastercard in Europe  Latin America  Canada  Africa  the Caribbean and the Middle East  Partnerships with Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Pinterest  Alibaba  NYSE BABA   Intuit  NASDAQ INTU  and other major retailers and financial institutions are also delivering positive results  However  continuous exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks are concerns 
 You can   
Buy rated BNY Mellon s shares have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the last six months   9 3  vs   16 9    The company s earnings have surpassed expectations in two of the trailing four quarters  Easing margin pressure  driven by gradual rise in interest rates  and rising loan demand are expected to further aid revenue growth  
Also  potential lesser regulations and cost saving initiatives will likely drive profitability  Given a solid capital position  the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities  However  concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee based income remains a matter of concern in the near term

missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents  Further  earnings declined from 14 7  on a year over year basis Total revenues increased 5 1  year over year to  3 92 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 89 billion  The year over year improvement was mainly attributable to a 3 8  rise in patient service revenues to  2 62 billion and 16 5  increase in capitated revenues to  1 02 billion from the year ago quarter DaVita carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc  Price and Consensus     Segment UpdateDavita Medical Group   DMG  DMG  the nation s largest operator of medical groups and physician networks  provides integrated care management as an operating division of DaVita  focusing on delivering healthcare through a broad range of services For the third quarter of 2017  DMG incurred adjusted operating loss of  5 million  which excludes  601 million non cash goodwill impairment and other adjusted items  In the third quarter  DaVita announced the restructuring of the DMG segment that eliminated 350 non clinical positions  Thus  management at DaVita expects annualized savings of around  40 million per year starting 2018 DaVita Kidney CareAs an operating division of DaVita  DaVita Kidney Care focuses on setting worldwide standards for clinical  social and operational practices in kidney care  DaVita saw solid results from the Kidney Care business Adjusted operating income in the third quarter at the segment was  404 million  up 1  year over year  primarily driven by an extra treatment day in the quarter  Notably  the company saw a negative financial impact of Hurricane Harvey and Irma  which is estimated to be approximately  7 million for higher costs and approximately  7 million of lost contribution from missed treatment and uncollected revenues owing to disruption of the company s billing process during the natural disasters U S Dialysis and Related Lab ServicesRevenue per treatment for U S  dialysis and lab business was essentially flat with the last quarter  In fact  management at DaVita expects revenue per treatment to essentially remain flat in the fourth quarter as well  The company s patient care costs were up approximately  1 76 per treatment compared with the last quarter Financial UpdateFor the twelve months ended Sep 30  2017  DaVita had an operating cash flow of  2 08 billion and free cash flow of  1 49 billion  Operating cash flow was  553 million in the third quarter and  1 56 billion year to date Share Repurchase UpdateDaVita bought back almost 2 million shares of the company s common stock for approximately  117 million at an average price of  59 09 per share  In October  DaVita s board of directors approved an additional share repurchase authorization worth approximately  1 253 billion As of Nov 7  2017  DaVita repurchased a total of 11 4 million shares of the company s common stock for a total of  702 million at an average price of  61 30 a share GuidanceDaVita expects adjusted consolidated operating income for 2017 in the range of  1 620 billion to  1 685 billion  lower than the previously issued range of  1 675 billion to  1 775 billion The company estimates adjusted operating income at the Kidney Care segment in the band of  1 570 billion to  1 600 billion  Notably  the previously issued range was  1 565 billion to  1 625 billion For the full year  DaVita expects adjusted consolidated operating income in the range of  50 million to  85 million  significantly lower than the previous guidance of  110 million to  150 million Our TakeDaVita ended third quarter fiscal 2017 on a mixed note  Strong growth in patient services is likely to boost the company s growth trajectory in the coming quarters  DaVita s continuous improvement in Kidney care is commendable as well  The company s efforts to control expenses hold promise  A compelling inorganic growth story supported by its strong financial position is another positive  However  DaVita is challenged by adverse effects of healthcare reforms  rise in Medicare costs  and an increase in Medicare Advantage  MA  beneficiaries  Also  MA rate cuts are likely to hurt the bottom line in the near future  Lackluster performance by the company s DMG segment and a slashed guidance for the full year indicate looming concerns ahead for the stock  Sluggishness in the dialysis and lab businesses adds to our

This is a New Jersey based leading globally diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company  Over the last three months  it has been trading above the broader   The stock has declined 8 7  compared with a 3 1  gain of the broader industry 
Notably  Phibro ended the second quarter of fiscal 2017 on a mixed note with the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues declining marginally on a year over year basis  Segment wise  Medicated feed additives  MFA  business was weak in the United States   4 2 million of that business decline was due to reduced sales of medically important antimicrobials  primarily on the change in consumer preferences and the less use of certain antimicrobials in the market  This apart  an unfavorable timing of certain customer orders hampered the business Phibro Animal Health Corporation Price

   Also  a persistent decline in Mineral Nutrition segment sales is likely to be a drag on business  Customer consolidation can also affect Phibro s revenues  Plus  an unfavorable currency movement and a tough competitive scenario continue to pose as other headwinds 
On a positive note  Animal Health has continued to remain a key contributor  delivering growth over the last few quarters  Per Phibro  its animal health products are excellent in preventing  controlling and treating diseases in animals as well as increasing nutrition to improve health  We believe  a diverse product portfolio will allow the company to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions of the world 
Phibro has extended its reach beyond the United States to enter Brazil and other countries in South America  China  India and Asia Pacific  Russia and Africa  This we feel will help the company counter competition 
The company continues to invest in the Far East Asia where the poultry and dairy industries are expected to grow exponentially  The company currently expands its dairy business in the markets of Australia  Brazil and Mexico  We believe that despite the economic turmoil in Russia  Greece  Brazil and China  Phibro has performed quite well and has the potential to maintain the momentum

The year over year decline in earnings was due to disappointing Retail LTC numbers as well as lower margins 
Without one time adjustments  EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter came in at  1 26  down from  1 43 in the prior year quarter CVS Health Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Net revenues in the quarter increased 3 5  year over year to  46 18 billion  almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Strong revenue growth in the Pharmacy Services segment was partially offset by a decline in Retail LTC revenues in the quarter 
Quarter in Details
Pharmacy Services revenues increased 8 1  to  32 89 billion in the reported quarter  driven by growth in specialty pharmacy volumes  higher pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation  This was  however  partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression 
Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 8 3  to 374 2 million on a 30 day equivalent basis  backed by net new business growth  Also  the Mail Choice processed claim count was 66 9 million  up 6 1  on a 30 day equivalent basis on continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims 
Revenues from CVS Health s Retail LTC dropped 2 7  year over year to  19 59 billion  primarily due to a 3 2  decrease in same store sales  continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate 
Front end same store sales were down 2 8  year over year  Front store sales were affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies  which were partially offset by an increase in basket size 
Pharmacy same store sales also declined 3 4  in the reported quarter  Sales were affected approximately 435 basis points  bps  due to recent generic drug introductions  Also  Pharmacy same store prescription volumes inched up 0 3  on a 30 day equivalent basis  This apart  marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 420 bps negative impact on same store prescription volumes 
The generic dispensing rate  the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed  increased approximately 100 bps to 87  at the Pharmacy Services segment and around bps to 87 2  at the Retail LTC segment 
Gross profit dropped 4 9  to  7 12 billion and gross margin contracted 140 bps to 15 4   Total operating margin in the quarter declined 93 bps to 5 4  
CVS Health exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  2 56 billion compared with  2 16 billion at the end of second quarter 2017  Year to date  net cash provided by operating activities was  8 14 billion  up 1 5  from the year ago period 
During the third quarter  CVS Health opened 56 new retail stores and shut five retail locations  Further  the company relocated five retail stores  As of Sep 30  2017  CVS Health operated 9 751 retail stores  including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 U S  states as well as the District of Columbia  Puerto Rico and Brazil 
2017 Outlook
CVS Health has narrowed its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to  5 87  5 91 from the earlier band of  5 83  5 93 The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 88 is within the guided range  However  full year operating cash flow guidance has been reiterated at the range of  7 7  8 6 billion and free cash flow at the band of  6 0  6 4 billion 
For the fourth quarter  the company expects adjusted EPS of  1 88  1 92  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at  1 91  within the company s projection 
Our Take
CVS Health exited the third quarter on a solid note  However  weak year over year Retail LTC comparisons along with margin decline resulted in a dull earnings performance 
Nonetheless  the year over year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment  benefiting from the upside in the specialty services

Our Take
Hill Rom exited fiscal 2017 on a strong note with the fourth quarter earnings and revenues exceeding the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company saw a solid year over year increase in revenues on strong international growth  Hill Rom is currently aiming to gain traction in the untapped international market on successful execution  courtesy its efficient international team and organizational realignment  The company is putting efforts in product innovation through research and development  A slew of product launches in the fourth quarter is encouraging 
However  a decline in revenues at the Patient Support Systems segment is quite disappointing  Also  foreign exchange remains a headwind

2017 Guidance
IDEXX narrowed its 2017 revenue outlook to  1 950  1 960 million from the previously provided range of  1 945  1 965 million  reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 9 5  and 10   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is pegged at  1 95 billion  pegged at the lower end of  the guided range 
Management also raised its EPS guidance to  3 22  3 26 from the earlier  3 12  3 22  supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long term goals  The updated outlook represents EPS growth of 32 34  on a reported basis  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 EPS is pegged at  3 17  below the guided range 
Our Take
IDEXX exited the third quarter on a mixed note  with earnings beating and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  solid year over year growth in organic revenues buoys optimism  The company s raised EPS guidance for 2017 is also encouraging 
The stellar quarterly performance was driven by strong sales within the company s companion animal business  The companion animal market fundamentals remain solid with tremendous global runway for growth  Management s innovation based  multi modality global strategy  enabled by enhanced commercial capability  accelerated recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth  Moreover  the strong top line growth in this quarter was driven by considerable contributions from the rest of the business segments 
However  foreign currency fluctuations are expected to continue to hurt the company s operating results  although lower than the extent expected earlier

Guidance Raised
Backed by a solid third quarter performance  a favorable foreign exchange environment forecast and also considering the recently closed acquisition of Patheon  Thermo Fisher has raised its full year 2017 financial guidance 
The revenue guidance has been raised to a range of  20 50  20 66 billion  growth of 12 13  from the previous year  from the earlier band of  19 71  19 89 billion  growth of 8 9    The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  20 48 billion falls below this guided range

Bottom Line
Thermo Fisher ended the third quarter on a promising note with both adjusted earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
We are encouraged by the company s series of product launches along with major progress in precision medicine initiatives  Thermo Fisher s acquisition of FEI Company has already started to boost its analytical instruments portfolio 
In the quarter  the company launched four new electron microscopy systems for structural biology and materials science research  Also  it has released a new iQ Series air quality monitoring platform and enabled the first FDA approved gene therapy  This apart  the company has opened Precision Medicine Customer Experience Center in Guangzhou  China 
We are currently looking forward to the recently completed  7 2 billion acquisition of Patheon  This is going to significantly enhance the company s value proposition for biopharma customers by adding leading contract development and manufacturing outsourcing services The raised guidance is all the more impressive and indicative of this overall bullish trend to continue through 2017

Intuitive Surgical  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Business HighlightsSolid Procedure Trends  Intuitive Surgical posted solid numbers in the quarter  courtesy of rising customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements  The company outperformed in the Mature and Growth procedures  especially in general and thoracic surgery Precisely  third quarter procedures increased approximately 15  on a year over year basis  U S  procedures grew approximately 12  and outside of the United States  OUS  procedures grew approximately 23  year over year  Procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength on solid growth in China  Japan and Korea  Added to this  solid growth in prostatectomy procedure volumes lent Intuitive Surgical a competitive edge in the broader prostate surgery market in the third quarter Launches Bode Well  In the third quarter  Intuitive Surgical expanded the launch of two additional instruments and accessories for da Vinci X and Xi platforms in seven countries  In fact  the company initiated a limited launch of a refined vessel sealer in Europe in the reported quarter  Management announced plans to file the first 510 k  for FDA approval of da Vinci SP program by year end  and submissions for additional indications thereafter International Sales  Globally  Intuitive Surgical s system placements included 25 in Europe  14 in Japan  five in India  four in New Mexico and one in China  However  as the OUS markets are in early stages of adoption  sales might be lower than estimated in the region Revenue SegmentsInstruments and Accessories  Revenues at the segment grew 15  to  401 million in the quarter  driven by strong procedure growth and increased sales of stapling and vessel sealing products  Revenues realized per procedure were approximately  1 880 compared with  1 870 in the year ago quarter System Sales increased 15  to  237 million buoyed by higher system placements  partially offset by lower average selling prices  Notably  Intuitive Surgical generated approximately  7 million in revenues associated with operating leases in the reported quarter compared with  4 million in the third quarter of 2016  Coming to the company s flagship da Vinci surgical platform  the company shipped 169 surgical systems  up from 134 in the third quarter of 2016 Service The company registered revenues of  147 million  up 13  on a year over year basis on growth in the installed base of da Vinci systems MarginIntuitive Surgical s adjusted gross margin in the reported quarter contracted 130 basis points  bps  to 71 8  of net revenues  The decrease in margins was due to a  7 million medical device tax refund  which was received in 2016 Notably  management at Intuitive Surgical expects margins to fluctuate based on the company s mix of new products  mix of systems in instrument and accessory revenue  reduction of product costs and the reinstatement of the medical device tax in 2018 Financial UpdateIntuitive Surgical ended the third quarter of 2017 with  3 8 billion in cash  cash equivalents  and investments  up by  379 billion on a year over year basis  This was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and employee stock option exercises Bottom LineIntuitive Surgical exited the third quarter on a solid note  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts  Procedure performance in Asia showed continued strength with solid growth in China  Japan and Korea  The company gained significantly on the CE Mark approval for da Vinci X in Europe  The stock has got a further boost on the recent FDA approval of the same in the recent past  A positive outlook for the coming quarters also raises our confidence in the stock  Further  incremental spending on product development and higher investments in international markets are likely to drive long term growth  However  the da Vinci Surgical System has a long sale and purchase order cycle which might act against the company  In fact  the stock looks a tad expensive  adding to our concerns  Intuitive Surgical expects sales to be lower outside the United States Key PicksA few better ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are SONOVA HOLDING   OTC SONVY    EnteroMedics Inc    NASDAQ

States  THVT sales in the quarter totaled  311 6 million  up 20 1  year over year  Growth was driven by excellent clinical performance by SAPIEN 3 as well continued strong therapy implementation across all regions Surgical Heart Valve Therapy sales in the quarter were  195 6 million  up 2 4  from the prior year quarter  This was led by strong demand for the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and strong uptake of core products outside the United States  partially offset by the continuing shift from surgical aortic valves to the SAPIEN 3 valves in the United States and Europe Critical Care sales were  144 7 million in the reported quarter  representing an increase of 4 5  from third quarter 2016   Solid growth across all product categories was driven by strong growth in the company s

profitable product mix  led by growing sales of transcatheter valves as well as a favorable comparison of supply chain expenditures  This was however partially offset by expenses incurred due to

3  to  38 9 million on the back of solid performances by the CyberKnife  TomoTherapy Systems and Radixact platforms of the segment  The increase in product revenues was driven by backlog conversion of

to  52 million  Per management  growth at the segment was primarily driven by continued install base expansion Gross Order Update  In the reported quarter  gross product orders totaled  55 6 million

112892,334407,ISRG,NuVasive  NUVA  Q3 Earnings Top  Revenues Lag  Guidance Cut,opinion,NuVasive  Inc    NASDAQ NUVA   reported third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share  EPS  of 52 cents  reflecting a 30  rise from the year ago quarter  The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents Solid revenue growth primarily led to this year over year bottom line improvement Including one time items  the company reported third quarter 2017 net income per share of 64 cents  a significant improvement from the year ago figure of 7 cents per share Revenues in the reported quarter increased 3 2  year over year to  247 4 million  up 3 4  at constant exchange rate or CER   The figure however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  255 million The above upside in revenues was driven by a robust performance in the international market on strong growth across all geographical regions  In the United States  procedural volumes were sluggish  unable to meet the company s expectations NuVasive  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    However  putting together the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on NuVasive s U S  results and Maria on the company s international results along with one less selling day  the revenue growth would have been approximately 6  year over year In the reported quarter  the company s U S  Spinal Hardware business registered more than 2  growth backed by introduction of new products  Adjusting the impact of the hurricanes and offsetting the effect of one less selling day  the U S  Spinal Hardware business approximately grew 5  year over year The U S  Surgical Support business declined 12 7  in the third quarter  primarily on continued softness in biologics business  With new competitive products entering the market  the company faces challenges in the field  Also  procedural issues are affecting revenue volumes However  the international business recorded 46  growth at CER on continued strong demand of the company s spine technology outside the United States  particularly in the key markets of Italy  Germany and Japan In the quarter under review  there was a 10 8  increase in cost of goods sold  Despite that  gross profits inched up 0 8  to  181 8 million  Yet the company reported a 180 basis point  bps  year over year contraction in gross margin to 73 5  in the third quarter that includes a 90 bps year over year impact from low margin businesses Sales  marketing and administrative expenses went down 4 6  to  125 8 million  while research and development expenses increased 1 6  to  12 7 million NuVasive posted adjusted operating income of  43 3 million in the reported quarter  reflecting a 20 1  rise from the year ago number  Adjusted operating margin expanded 247 bps to 17 5  in the quarter under review The company exited third quarter 2017 with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  62 2 million  down from  130 9 million at the end of the previously reported quarter OutlookIn view of the continued impact of Maria in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter as well as the anticipated lower U S  procedural volumes  NuVasive has updated its full year 2017 guidance Currently  the company expects to report revenue growth of 7 2   lower than the earlier expected rate of 11 1  at CER to approximately  1 030 billion  earlier it was  1 065 billion  in 2017  The figure also remains lower than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 billion NuVasive also lowered its guidance for full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share to  1 91 as compared to the previous expectation of  2 per share  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 99 remains significantly above the company s guidance  Additionally  adjusted operating margin for the year is currently expected at 16 6  compared with the former projection of 17 1  Our TakeNuVasive exited the third quarter with better than expected earnings and revenue numbers  This quarter  the company s performance was significantly dependent on stellar international growth  The company noted that the reported quarter marked the fourth consecutive one  registering more than 20  growth in international business  However  overall sales in the quarter were grossly impacted by procedural volumes related challenges in the United States and the adverse impact of Harvey and Irma on NuVasive s U S  results and Maria on the international front With chances of the fourth quarter revenues being affected by Maria in Puerto Rico and due to the anticipated lower U S  procedural volumes continuing into the same period  NuVasive is pressed to reduce its full year guidance  which is disappointing Zacks Rank   Key PicksCurrently  NuVasive has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  A few better ranked stocks in the broader medical

112948,334463,ISRG,Analyst Reports For GM  VMware And Southwest Airlines ,opinion,"Thursday June 8  2017
Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including General Motors  GM   VMware  VMW   and Southwest Airlines  LUV   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
General Motors shares have been strong performers over the past year  the stock is up  17  vs   11 4  for the Zacks Auto sector    16 6  for Ford   though they have struggled lately  The Zacks analyst likes the company s capital allocation strategy  investments in plants in the U S  and emerging markets  product launches and focus on technology development  Moreover  the company s focus on capital deployment is expected to boost shareholder returns  However  the automaker is under pressure due to lower U S  vehicles sales in 2016  a recent settlement related to the 2014 ignition switch recall and a large fine by China for monopolistic pricing behavior  General Motors  quarterly earnings estimate has been going up lately 
 You can   
VMware shares have gained  17 9  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Software industry  up  21 5   but outperforming the S P 500  up  7 2    VMware s revenues continue to register strong growth driven by its innovative product offerings like NSX  AirWatch  vSphere and vSAN  The Zacks analyst likes its innovative product pipeline  strategic partnerships  frequent contract wins and robust international sales  The company continues to benefit from its strength in the virtualization and hybrid cloud market  VMware s impressive first quarter results and positive fiscal year guidance  up from the previous guidance  driven by expanding product portfolio  partnerships and continuing enterprise deal wins will help the stock maintain momentum in the rest of fiscal 2018  However lackluster IT spending and mounting competition are headwinds 
 You can   
Southwest Airlines shares have been standout performers this year  they are up  19 5  in the year to date period vs   11 5  gain for the Zacks Airline industry and  8  gain for the S P 500 index  The stock s positive momentum has been particularly notable since mid March  which got a boost from the company s quartelry report when it modestly came short of estimates but raised guidance and announced a dividend hike and raised the buyback authorization  
 You can   
Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Johnson Controls  NYSE JCI   Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  and ArcelorMittal  MT  
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research 
It s not the one you think

112950,334465,ISRG,Dave   Buster s  Ebix  Siemens  Applied Materials And Intuitive Surgical Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 13  2017   Dave   Buster s  NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  Ebix  NASDAQ        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Siemens  OTCMKTS         Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   NASDAQ        and Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG   NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

  

	One of the best stories in the restaurant sector over the past few years has definitely been that of Dave   Buster s  NASDAQ         The company has seen its stock price surge  and it has largely fought through an environment that has taken down many of its top competitors 

	But after the most recent earnings report  shares have struggled  even though the company beat earnings yet again  Comps growth was slowing down  and investors focused in on this issue to sell shares of the company  So  now that we have seen a dip in the shares  many have to be asking  is this the end of the road for the dream run in Dave   Buster s stock 

Why PLAY Could Have Room to Run

	In the company s most recent earnings report  earnings easily beat the consensus estimate as the company posted EPS of 87 cents compared to 81 cents per share for the expectation  Revenues were also higher by double digit percentage levels when compared to the year ago period 

	The firm also increased the bottom end of its earnings guidance range  looks to grow comps in the range of 2  3   and is continuing with its expansion plans as they seek to develop another dozen locations  So  guidance for the company wasn t bad by any stretch  meaning that investors are selling off the partial slowdown in the company s growth trajectory 

	However  PLAY remains an incredible growth story  even if things are slowing down just a tad  This is especially true when you compare some of PLAY s key growth metrics to the industry at large 

	PLAY currently has cash flow growth that is roughly four times the industry average  projected EPS growth that is roughly three times the industry average  and an ROE in excess of 20   Add in industry crushing projected sales growth and a sales to asset ratio below 1 0  and you start to question why anyone is worried about this stock from a growth perspective at all  No wonder PLAY has an  A  growth score right now and is one of the best growth stories out there in the market today 

Earnings Estimates

	Strength is further confirmed when we look to recent earnings estimate revisions for PLAY stock  While estimates have slumped for the current quarter  the next quarter and then full year period remain pretty bright 

	In fact  we have seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days for the current year compared to zero lower  and the same level for the next year time frame too  But it isn t just the number of increases  as the magnitude has been impressive as well  We have seen the consensus estimate increase by over 7  in the past sixty days for the full year  and a full four percent for the next year time frame 

	And while the current quarter estimate has declined by about 3 6  in the past two months  it is more than made up for by the 7 4  increase in the next quarter period  Overall  the stock has a great earnings estimate picture to go along with an incredible history in earnings season including a lack of misses since its debut on the market making PLAY a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  and one that is a good candidate to persevere through its recent malaise  and power back to new highs 

  

	Recent trading in the tech world is giving investors pause about more picks in the sector  forcing many to refocus on only the most promising names in the field  This strategy looks to leave many companies in the dust  and could put a premium on stocks that are actually growing revenues too 

	This is bad news for stocks like Ebix  NASDAQ         as this software supplier to the insurance industry has seen weakness leading into recent trading  and has some sluggish fundamentals too  Such underlying trends may prove to be a rough environment for EBIX investors no matter what is happening in the broad tech sector  Let s take a closer look at why we are so bearish on this struggling stock right now 

Weak Fundamentals

	Ebix currently has a VGM Score of  F   putting it in the very bottom from a fundamental look  The company actually doesn t receive a component grade value  growth  momentum above  C   so the poor fundamentals are pretty widespread for this name 

	From a value look  EBIX struggles with its P CF that is far higher than the industry average  and a PEG ratio that is quickly approaching two  In terms of growth  the company s EPS track record isn t exactly inspiring  as it has a historical EPS growth rate of under 2   and a projected EPS growth rate less than 0 5  for the future too  Add in a  D  Grade for momentum  and it is easy to see why the fundamental picture is so poor for this company right now 

Sluggish Estimate Trend

	Though Ebix has a solid history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  the company does not have a great trend when we look to the most recent analyst estimates  We haven t seen any analysts increase their estimates for Ebix stock in the past two months for either the current year or the current quarter time frames 

	The magnitude of these declines has also been troubling  as we see a double digit percentage decline in the consensus estimate for both the current quarter and the following quarter  over just the past two months  Add in a nearly six percent decline in the consensus estimate for the full year over the past two months  and it shouldn t be a surprise that EBIX has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  right now

	After last Friday s sudden tech stock sell off  will momentum traders   in NY and London alike   keep selling pressure on the risk markets going into this meeting 
	Or will bargain hunters overwhelm them  Buy the dip  right 
	On Wednesday  a two day United States Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting produces a 2 pm ET statement  This will be accompanied by fresh forecasts 
	Consensus expects a 25 basis point rate hike  Expect further FOMC detail surrounding its reinvestment plans    on a huge QE inflated balance sheet 
	Chair Janet Yellen s presser should be the main trader event 
	Regarding the FOMC summary outlook  expect a cautious tone  The  dot plots  of all the individual contributors will be watched for internal dynamics  Realize the Fed members are mostly trained economists  They will remain data dependent 
	Recent U S  macro prints foretell dovish guidance 
	1  Consumer Inflation is feeling downward pressure of late  Ditto for wages 
	2  Job growth averaged just  121K the past three months 
	3  U S  GDP grew by  1 2  in Q1  GDPNow for Q2 is  2 8   Average quarterly first half growth sums to a  muddle through   1 5  rate 
	After this mid June meeting  the FOMC should shift to the sidelines  Coming meetings can steadily evaluate second half U S  and global risks  growth rates  jobs and the dollar   and monitor the waning pressure underlying recent inflation data 
	The September meeting should give up a third and final 25 bps rate hike this year On Thursday and Friday  traders get follow on money policy from abroad  
	1  United Kingdom  Don t expect policy changes from the Bank of England  BoE   The BoE should state it is looking at any upside risks to inflation as transitory  Watch for any statements that concern the recent parliamentary election 
	2  Japan  The Bank of Japan s  BoJ  policy and guidance should center on whether the central bank lessens bond purchases    in a mini taper of sorts 
	3  Indonesia  Expect the Bank Indonesia to leave its 7 day reverse repo rate unchanged at 4 75   That country s all important inflation rate is running at  4 3  y y  This is close to their  3  inflation target  Growth this year should be similar to last year  at  5 0  y y 
	4  Russia  Expect the Bank of Russia to deliver another rate cut of 25 to 50 basis points 
	5  Switzerland  Expect the Swiss National Bank to leave its policies intact  This small nation s monetary policy outlook relies heavily on the European Central Bank 
	This sums up to a monetary policy pile up  It should make for a packed end to the Global Week Ahead Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  stocks Siemens  OTCMKTS        This is the  122 billion market cap Germany electronics giant  The Zacks long term VGM score is a D  but that comes with a B in Value Applied Materials  NASDAQ        Yes  the long term Zacks VGM score is B  But do the tech stock short sellers care  Watch the price dynamics on stocks like this all week long Intuitive Surgical   NASDAQ        Much has been made of overpriced stocks  This one is priced at a cool  916 a share when I looked  That comes with an easily won Zacks VGM score of F  with a conclusive F in Value

112951,334466,ISRG,Why Does Intuitive Surgical Score As A Strong Buy Right Now,opinion,"Intuitive Surgical Inc    NASDAQ ISRG    the provider of the famous da Vinci surgical system is on a healthy growth trajectory of late  Over the last three months  the stock was trading consistently ahead of the S P 500 Index  It has rallied 20 9  in this period  compared with the market s mere 2 7  gain  The stock has a market cap of  33 1 billion 
Also over this period  the company s share price has outperformed the Zacks categorized  sub industry s gain of nearly 8  

With solid growth prospects  this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock is an attractive pick at present  Let s find out whether the recent positive trend is a sustainable one 
A stellar first quarter 2017 result was a major market sentiment booster  thanks to the rising customer adoption of procedures and growth in system placements 
Also  the company gained significantly on the certifying CE Mark approval for da Vinci X in Europe  The stock has further received a boost on the recent U S  FDA approval of the same 
Notably  Intuitive Surgical has been riding high on solid prospects on its da Vinci platform  In this regard  da Vinci procedure volumes grew worldwide approximately 18  year over year in the first quarter of 2017  Reasons cited for this uptrend are stellar performances in the U S  general surgery and worldwide urologic procedures 
The company has shipped 133 da Vinci surgical systems  up from 110 in the first quarter of 2016 
Taking the stock s stable performance of into consideration  the Intuitive Surgical is expected to scale higher in the coming quarters  The company s positive long term growth of 9 4  also holds promise 
The company s estimate revision trend for the current year has been favorable  In the past 60 days  three analysts moved north  with one movement in the opposite direction  The magnitude of estimate revision increased around 2 3  to  20 16 per share  over the same time frame 
However  downsides may come from the fact that the da Vinci Surgical System has a long sale and purchase order cycle as it is a major capital investment for hospitals that requires approval of the senior management at purchasing institutions 
The above time lag may act against the company s interests  Also the stock s valuation looks stretched at this moment 
Key Picks
Other top ranked medical stocks are Align Technology  Inc    NASDAQ ALGN    Inogen  Inc    NASDAQ INGN   and Accelerate Diagnostics  Inc    NASDAQ AXDX    Notably  Align Technology and Inogen sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Accelerate Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

NASDAQ  Ticker  NDAQ
NASDAQ  started higher in December  It paused on the move higher for a month and then resumed to a top the first of March  Since then it pulled back in a 2 steps to a low in May and then reversed  Last week it made a high near the March top and pulled back  Friday saw a bullish engulfing candle  suggesting more upside  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising while the MACD is also moving higher  Look for a push to new highs to participate   
Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   Ticker  PSX
Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   pulled back from a top in December finding support finally in April  The price action from February through to last week has been a consolidation of that drop  It ended when the price broke to the upside  It failed early and fell back but Friday pushed back higher  The RSI is bullish and rising while the MACD is also rising  Look for continuation to participate higher   
Toronto Dominion  Ticker  TD

Up Next  Bonus Idea
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which saw with Options Expiration and the June FOMC meeting in the rear view mirror  equities looking to emerge on the other side mainly unscathed  There is consolidation in the SPY  NYSE SPY  and Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  but perhaps more damage in the QQQ 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue to pullback while crude oil trends lower  The US Dollar Index has moved to consolidation in its pullback while US Treasuries are biased to continue higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets  NYSE EEM  are biased to the upside with the Chinese market drifting up  while Emerging Markets consolidate in their longer trend up 
Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping a breeze at the backs of equities  Their charts show continued strength in all 3 Index ETF s on the longer timeframe but consolidation in the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  and pullbacks in the IWM and QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ  on the shorter timeframe  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

112980,334495,ISRG,4 Healthcare Megatrends For Investors,opinion,"When you think about investing to powerfully grow your money into the future  what giant long term trends come to mind first 
Certainly anything on the cutting edge of technology does    from mobile  the cloud  and AI to robotics  alternative energy  and autonomous cars 
But do you know what sector is bigger than technology and has trounced it by 3 times since 1999 
Healthcare  And it offers just as much innovation  if not more    with more diversification  If you are investing for the future  you need exposure to the healthcare sector to grow truly life changing wealth 
Opportunity Disguised
But what about the impending  repeal and replace  of Obamacare and all the Washington saber rattling over drug prices  Don t these make the sector  un investable  
To the contrary  any policy moves offer only more opportunity in the 750 companies and 12 industries to choose from  And bigger picture  healthcare profits are still being driven by four big forces that won t stop for another decade at least 
The 4 Megatrend Drivers of Healthcare Profits
1  Boomer Power  An aging population living longer means more care is needed into the  active 90s  
The demographic trends are clear  US and global populations are aging  as the Millennial baby boom may not be rivaled any time soon 
Plus  people are living longer on average just because of improving economic standards  the quality of food  water  and medical care  and an awareness of health dangers like smoking 
More      
                                                                                                      

We are approaching what could be the investment opportunity of a lifetime  A new medical breakthrough has the potential to impact humanity on a scale that compares to the discovery of microbes and the introduction of vaccines 
Zacks has just launched an initiative to target maximum profits from it  Gains could rival Incyte s leap of  951  in 6 years and Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  s explosion of  4 237  in 13 years 
You re invited to be among the first to see our recommendations  Don t delay  access to this information closes Sunday  April 23 

                                                                                                      
This adds up to a big increase in the number of people living into their nineties  And that means more innovative care will be needed from several medical industries  including pharmaceuticals  cardiovascular technologies  neurological treatments  hospital equipment and instruments  biotechnology  and cancer research discoveries 
2  Science Power  The breakthroughs in genetics and technology are creating new life saving and life enhancing companies as I write 
The age of genetics has ushered in unprecedented advances in scientific and medical research  We have gone from understanding and battling disease with scalpels and poisonous chemotherapies to treating cancer with targeted genetic breakthroughs and vaccines created from one s own immune system 
This megatrend is nowhere near slowing down as companies  investors  and charities pour billions of dollars every year into new R D to cure everything from heart and digestive ailments to pediatric and neuro degenerative diseases 
3  Earnings Power  The follow on from all that R D are new products and solutions creating new channels of sales and profits 
In 2016  the healthcare sector was responsible for over 40  of the earnings in the S P 500  bigger than the financial  energy  and telecom sectors combined  And the strength of this profit engine is only enhanced by its diversity across hundreds of companies and a dozen space age industries 
The beauty of this wealth of investing opportunities is that when one area is out of favor due to political or regulatory headwinds  there are always three or four other industries creating dynamic sales and profit growth 
4  M A Power  The big Pharma companies need to keep their pipelines full and avoid the revenue drops created by  patent cliffs  
During this bull market  over  500 billion in deals have been done  mostly by big drug companies buying emerging biotech plays for 50 100  takeout premiums 
One of my favorite biotech investments of the past few years was a company called Medivation  which got snatched up by Pfizer  NYSE PFE  for  14 billion in 2016    but not before a bidding war was fought by some of the biggest names in pharma  forcing Pfizer to pay top dollar 
While the pace of M A may slow down from the frenzy we ve seen the past few years  it will always be a positive force driving values in the sector    especially if any tax reform policy unleashes a tidal wave of overseas corporate cash onto US shores 
The Power of Vision

112983,334498,ISRG,Investors Are Latching On To Robotics ETFs,opinion,"Technology is one of those sectors where consumers and investors are constantly looking for the next big thing  The truly innovative service or product that is going to have life changing impact and ultimately lead to extensive profits for shareholders  One of the emerging frontiers in this race is the application of robotics and artificial intelligence in our everyday lives 
Companies that research  develop  and bring to market ground breaking robot technology can make a significant contribution to both businesses and ordinary consumers  Not surprisingly  there are now several ways for investors to play this thriving industry through diversified and globally focused exchange traded funds  ETFs  
The largest and most established ETF in this class is the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF  NASDAQ ROBO   This fund has  576 million dedicated to a group of 85 stocks around the world engaged in the hardware  software  and management of automated products or services  That may include autonomous vehicles  3D printers  navigational systems  medical devices  and more 
Because this fund is index based  it s portfolio construction and stock weighting criteria are determined by a strict rules based methodology  For stocks to be considered  they must meet minimum market capitalization and historical daily trading minimums  Under normal circumstances  the index allows for 40  of the portfolio to be dedicated to foreign stocks as well 
The top holding in ROBO isiRobot Corporation  NASDAQ IRBT   which accounts for just over 2  of the asset allocation  The smaller footprint of this stock within the diversified ETF helps minimize the single stock risk that is inherent with stock picking or more focused investment strategies 
ROBO debuted in 2013 to a smattering of attention and relatively modest growth  However  over the last twelve months  the ETF has soared  40 92  and recently hit a new all time high  That easily bests the sector specific benchmark TTechnology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK  return of  32 82  and significantly outperforms the broader market as well 

ETF investors have clearly taken notice of this trend as evidenced by a steadier trading pattern and surging volume in the chart above  According to   this fund has gained  416 million in net new money over the last year  That makes up approximately 72  of ROBO s current assets under management  The combination of strong returns and an attractive growth story likely make this an appealing thematic fund for tech savvy investors to identify with 
There is also another relatively new competitor to ROBO that is off to a great start in its first year of existence as well  The Global X Robotics   Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index ETF NASDAQ BOTZ  is a more concentrated approach to the industry that holds just 28 stocks  The top holding  Intuitive Surgical Inc  NASDAQ ISRG  represents nearly 8  of the exposure within the index 
This top heavy distribution of capital may appeal to those who are seeking a differentiated approach in the robotics industry  According to the fund fact sheet  48  of the holdings are Japanese companies and just 21  reside in the United States  The smaller selection of stocks in BOTZ truly represents an enhanced international footprint than ROBO 
The performance of this fund has slightly trailed that of ROBO over its short eight month lifespan  It has still managed to accumulate nearly  100 million in assets under management  which is impressive for an upstart thematic ETF with little track record 
Those who are considering these types of ETFs should also be aware of their expenses as well  ROBO charges an annual expense ratio of 0 95   while BOTZ comes in at 0 68   These management fees are high when compared to ultra low cost sector ETFs  However  it s common practice that niche strategies or uncommon industries will entail a proportionately larger expense to run 
The Bottom Line
The recent success of the robotics ETFs has brought with it a concomitant rush to capitalize on an outperforming area of the market  The real test for these funds will be whether the assets stay put during a prolonged slump or enhanced volatility 
Thematic funds can be useful for investors that want to capitalize on an industry specific trend or simply overweight a portion of their sector exposure using a unique ETF  Before considering these funds for your portfolio  it s important to evaluate how they fit with other existing positions and if their risks are appropriate for your investment style

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  6 16 on  754 09 million in revenue  20 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  6 million on the top
da Vinci sales increased by 9  in the fourth quarter with full year procedures jumping 15  from a year earlier
New products and international expansion remain a key area of focus moving forward
Intuitive Surgical prepares to announce fourth quarter results after Tuesday s closing bell  Increasing adoption of its flagship da Vinci surgical system helped deliver 6 consecutive quarters of better than expected earnings and revenue  Analysts expect the ongoing success of the robotic arm along with international expansion  new partnerships and a robust pipeline of new products to aide financial performance 
For the fourth quarter  analysts at Estimize expect earnings to come in at  6 16 per share  about 4  higher than the same period last year  Estimate activity in the past 3 months hasn t changed  likely in response to the Trump administration  Revenue for the period is forecasted to increase by 11  to  754 09 million  marking a 5th consecutive quarter of double digit growth  The stock increased by 16  in the past 12 months but took a downturn following the election  Practically speaking  Trump s proposed policies don t appear to take aim at the robotic arm maker  In an early look at the upcoming report  management noted that it sold 163 systems during the period and total of 537 for all of 2016  That figure presents a 9  gain from a year earlier and also brings the total number of systems in production near 4000  Procedures for the year increased approximately 15  from 652 000 in 2015 to 753 000 in 2016  The growth in overall procedures validates the efficacy of the system and help drive sales moving forward  More importantly it increases the need for high margin disposable instruments that generates more than 70  of ISRG s total revenue 
In international markets  ISRG made similar progress with the volume of total system sales and procedures trending higher  The company did see some weakness in areas of Europe causing a 12  decline in system placement in the region  Dollar appreciation along with macroeconomic uncertainty could pose additional problems moving forward
Intuitive continues to look for new ways to bring robots to surgery  One of the exciting developments in the pipeline is a patient side cart that could be used in conjunction with the company s Xi platform  The device is still in development but could be well on its way to regulatory review in the near future

113001,334516,ISRG,Health Care And Technology  A Perfect Combo For Stock Investors Now ,opinion,"When you try to talk to investors about the health care sector these days  the discussion inevitably leads to the ongoing battle over Obamacare and the AHCA  The future is very uncertain for this sector  and investors have seen some volatile trading for ETFs tracking the broad market  such as XLV  or worries over pricing issues for funds in the biotech sector  like IBB 
And given the ongoing discussion for this sector  it is hard to say what the final outcome will be for Americans  or the stocks tracking this key market either 
How to Play This Situation
One thing that isn t going to change about the health care industry going forward  however  is its continued adoption of technology  The health care world has been a bit slow to adopt new technological practices  but the area is finally coming on strong as of late 
Honestly  it is about time  as the area is definitely long overdue for a technological shakeup  Still  it can be hard to separate the areas of this market with high potential  and those that are just a passing fad  After all  there are plenty of buzzwords when it comes to the intersection of technology and health care  and like many things in health care  the jargon can be confusing 
Some of the latest buzzwords that investors have been talking about in this market include informatics  telemedicine  and even  cyborgization   though some of these areas are definitely hitting the mainstream lately  But to get to the bottom of this story and to understand what is really going on with the adoption of technology in the health care world  I spoke with Andrew Chanin  the CEO of PureFunds  His company is probably best known for its cybersecurity ETF  HACK   but they also have a suite of other sector focused funds  including the PureFunds ETFx HealthTech ETF  IMED  
As such  he was able to shed some light on this interesting topic for the latest edition of the Dutram Report  and clue us in on why this market might be worth focusing in on now 
My Chat with Andrew
In the interview  Andrew and I discuss why it has taken so long for health care companies to adopt technology  and what they are doing about this lack of investment these days  Andrew and I also converse about the prospects of this corner of the market in today s market environment  and if an Obamacare replacement will be a concern for investors in this area 
We also talk about IMED in a bit greater detail  and we dive into some of the fund holdings  such as Teladoc  TDOC   Additionally  we take a long at the large cap vs  small cap breakdown  noting how this fund might differ from some out there that are just focused on medical devices and companies like MDT  and how PureFunds  IMED which includes both device stocks like ISRG but also more software oriented plays such as MDRX could be a bit different for investors 
Lastly  we discuss how this might be an area for investors to focus on for growth  and what some of those buzzwords I mentioned earlier mean for investors right now  In particular  this idea of cyborgization could have transformative effects for many people out there  but that is really only the tip of the iceberg in this quickly growing  but little discussed health tech market 
Bottom Line
Andrew and I also talk about why numerous companies are focusing in on this corner of the health care market now  and what investors need to know about how this sort of strategy might fit into a portfolio too  So  if you have been unsure of what to do with your health care investments in light of the legislative uncertainty  this podcast is definitely a must listen

In this episode  Tracey is joined by Kevin Cook  Zacks Senior Strategist and the editor of the newly launched newsletter service the  
Healthcare stocks have gotten a bad rap over the last few years as the biotech rally faltered and on worries about drug pricing and the repeal of Obamacare 
But healthcare covers many industries  Zacks includes 800 stocks in its medical sector including those involved in devices  eye care  dentistry  staffing  rehabilitation  information systems and nursing homes 
While there have been disruptive technologies in tech  social media and even in retail  few are paying any attention to the possibilities in healthcare  That means there is an opening for investors 
Uncovering the Hidden Gems in Healthcare
Some companies get a lot of publicity for their medical breakthroughs  and rightly so  But there are a group of smaller companies that are creating devices and therapies that are enhancing patient lives that you might never have even heard of 
Tracey recently stumbled across two of those 
1        While doing a Hidden Gem video  she ran across BioTelemetry  BEAT  which makes wireless cardiac monitoring devices  It s expected to see double digit earnings growth in 2017 and 2018 
2        She came across Insulet  PODD   the maker of insulin management systems  after insiders bought shares  Tracey held it in her Insider Trader portfolio for several months  It s not yet profitable  but it s also expected to see double digit earnings growth the next 2 years 
Immuno oncology Could Be Huge
An area that Kevin is watching closely  as is the rest of the world  is immune oncology  This is a technique of using the body s own immune system to fight cancer 
Several companies are involved in this hot area including Incyte  INCY   Merck  NYSE MRK  and Bristol Myers Squibb 
There are several Phase III trials ongoing which is the critical juncture for these treatments   Fingers crossed  
What Other Companies Are Pushing the Envelope 
1        Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  is looking to break out to new highs again  It makes robotic surgical systems  The stock isn t cheap  It trades with a forward P E of 38 but you re buying it for the growth story 
2        Edwards Lifesciences  EW  is a leading manufacturer of heart valves  Shares are trading at 28x but earnings are expected to grow in the double digits in 2017 and 2018 
3        Neurocrine Biosciences  NBIX  researches drugs for neurological and endocrine disorders  It s been in the news lately because the FDA approved its first drug for movement disorder tardive dyskinesia  or TD 
There are a lot of opportunities in the healthcare stocks

	Healthcare stocks have gotten a bad rap over the last few years as the biotech rally faltered and on worries about drug pricing and the repeal of Obamacare 

	But healthcare covers many industries  Zacks includes 800 stocks in its medical sector including those involved in devices  eye care  dentistry  staffing  rehabilitation  information systems and nursing homes 

	While there have been disruptive technologies in tech  social media and even in retail  few are paying any attention to the possibilities in healthcare  That means there is an opening for investors 

Uncovering the Hidden Gems in Healthcare

	Some companies get a lot of publicity for their medical breakthroughs  and rightly so  But there are a group of smaller companies that are creating devices and therapies that are enhancing patient lives that you might never have even heard of 

	Tracey recently stumbled across two of those 

	1  While doing a Hidden Gem video  she ran across BioTelemetry  BEAT  which makes wireless cardiac monitoring devices  It s expected to see double digit earnings growth in 2017 and 2018 

	2  She came across Insulet  NASDAQ           the maker of insulin management systems  after insiders bought shares  Tracey held it in her Insider Trader portfolio for several months  It s not yet profitable  but it s also expected to see double digit earnings growth the next 2 years 

Immuno oncology Could Be Huge

	An area that Kevin is watching closely  as is the rest of the world  is immune oncology  This is a technique of using the body s own immune system to fight cancer 

	Several companies are involved in this hot area including Incyte  NASDAQ           Merck  NYSE MRK  and Bristol Myers Squibb 

	There are several Phase III trials ongoing which is the critical juncture for these treatments   Fingers crossed  

What Other Companies Are Pushing the Envelope 

	1  Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG   NASDAQ          is looking to break out to new highs again  It makes robotic surgical systems  The stock isn t cheap  It trades with a forward P E of 38 but you re buying it for the growth story 

	2  Edwards Lifesciences  NYSE          is a leading manufacturer of heart valves  Shares are trading at 28x but earnings are expected to grow in the double digits in 2017 and 2018 

	3  Neurocrine Biosciences researches drugs for neurological and endocrine disorders  It s been in the news lately because the FDA approved its first drug for movement disorder tardive dyskinesia  or TD 

	There are a lot of opportunities in the healthcare stocks 

	How do you narrow down the choices 

	Kevin discusses his methods for picking stocks  starting with the Zacks Rank  and how he will pick the 20 or so companies that will make up his Healthcare Innovators portfolio

113010,334525,ISRG,After ISRG Q1 Earnings  3 Medical Instrument Stocks Looking Up,opinion,"The first quarter earnings season has commenced on an encouraging note for most sectors  Per the latest   the first quarter earnings for the S P 500 companies are expected to be up 7 6  from the year ago quarter on 6 3  growth in revenues 
Unfavorably  the Medical sector is likely to be among the worst performers of the 16 Zacks sectors  with earnings expected to decrease 0 6  versus growth of 4 5  in the preceding quarter  year over year basis   Margins are also expected to decline 0 7  from the year ago quarter 
On the brighter side  the new format of the  Trump care   AHCA  with the proposal of Patient and State Stability Fund  PSSF  amendment looks optimistic for the medical space at the moment  Per the postulates of the PSSF  the government would set aside  15 billion as a  risk sharing  program to provide payments to health insurers for individual claims of the prospective patients 
We believe the sharing of the cost burden by the government would result in lower premiums  Furthermore  this would pave way for the insurance companies to provide services to maximum people in need 
Undoubtedly  the promising approach of the new  Trump care  regime  if brought into being  would immediately result in broadening of customer base for the Medical Instrument companies as well  who could have otherwise suffered  owing to their exorbitant products and services  
On a dismal note  the medical instrument companies liked the old template of AHCA as well  as it promised to repeal the infamous 2 3  medical device tax  While the old proposal failed to gather support in the House  thanks to solid opposition from both conservative and moderate lawmakers  the fraternity is currently worried whether the final plan will still call for the repealing of the medical device tax 
Meanwhile  the Zacks classified  industry traded below the S P 500 over the last one year  The industry gained roughly 2   way lower than the S P 500 s return of 11 4   Furthermore  a weak industry rank  bottom 42  of more than 250 industries  raises investor concern 

Intuitive Surgical Broke the Ice
In the wake of such a volatile backdrop  Intuitive Surgical Inc    NASDAQ ISRG    a bigwig in the niche space  reported its earnings results on Tuesday  registering stellar year over year growth 
Notably  the company posted adjusted earnings of  4 67 per share  up 27 2  on the back of 13 3  growth in revenues  year over year   Adjusted earnings of this medical instrument stock crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 97 
Intuitive Surgical s performance in the quarter was backed by solid international growth  Per management  the company posted revenues of  183 million outside the U S   up 12  from the first quarter of 2016  The company placed 56 system orders  compared with 36 in the year ago quarter and 63 in the fourth quarter  These included 21 orders in Europe  seven in Korea  six in India  six in Japan and two in China 
Intuitive Surgical shares gained 21 4  in the last year 

3 Medical Instruments Stocks in Focus
While the Medical Instrument industry has been oscillating between hope and despair  Intuitive Surgical s impressive earnings performance instills investor confidence  Meanwhile  let us take a look at three other stocks from the sector  which are expected to put up an impressive show this earnings season  Notably  we have zeroed in on companies with strong fundamentals  a favorable  and a significant share of overseas business 
Inogen Inc    NASDAQ INGN   develops  manufactures and markets portable oxygen concentrators  POC   POCs are used by patients who suffer from chronic respiratory conditions and need long term oxygen therapy 
Of the major positives  revenues at Inogen multiplied at a CAGR of 39 4  over the last four years  Notably  the stock sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
The company is expected to release its first quarter results on May 8  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings is currently pegged at 12 cents per share  a penny higher than what the company had recorded in the year ago quarter 
Inogen generates a significant portion of its revenues from international markets  In fiscal 2016  the company s business to business international sales accounted for almost 25  of net revenues  increasing 41 8  on a year over year basis 
Over the last year  the stock added 55 8  

Masimo Corporation   NASDAQ MASI   develops  manufactures and markets a family of non invasive monitoring systems 
This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock has a compelling growth story with revenues and adjusted earnings multiplying at CAGR of 9  and 18   respectively  over the last four years  You can see  
The company is scheduled to report first quarter results on May 3  after the closing bell  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings is 60 cents per share  up from 53 cents in the year ago quarter 
Masimo s top line has been leveraging on its international operations for long  In fact  the stock gained considerably in fiscal 2016  especially outside the U S  as total international sales jumped nearly 12   with Latin America and Asia showcasing solid growth 
The stock represented a stellar return of 119  over the last year 

Teleflex Incorporated   NYSE TFX   designs  develops  manufactures  and supplies single use medical devices for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications worldwide 
The Zacks Rank  2 stock has strong fundamentals as well  Teleflex s revenues multiplied at a CAGR of 4 8   while adjusted earnings jumped 14 1  over the last five years 
The company is expected to report first quarter results on Apr 27  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at  1 67  15 cents higher than what the company had posted in the year ago quarter 
Teleflex has strong overseas business  In the last reported quarter  revenues from Europe  Middle East and Africa expanded 3  on a constant currency basis to  135 7 million  The improvement in European revenue was largely driven by increased sales in the company s urology  interventional  vascular  and respiratory products  Notably  China continues to be an important area of growth for Teleflex 
Teleflex gained almost 26  in the last year 

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research

In addition  the recent change in consumer demand and market dynamics have led to a dramatic transformation in the healthcare system  This is evident from the growing prevalence of minimally invasive surgeries  rising demand for liquid biopsy tests  use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value based model  among others 
Adding to the advantage is the temporary two year suspension of the controversial and dreadful 2 3  medical device excise tax which took a toll on the entire MedTech industry since its enactment in 2013 Data published in a report in FierceMedical Device stated that in 2014  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   JNJ  made a payment of  180 million in medical device tax payments  while Medtronic  NYSE MDT   MDT   legacy Covidien and Smith   Nephew  LON SN   SNN  paid  112 million   60 million and  25 million  respectively

Going by the last available EvaluateGroup data  the first half of 2015 saw 86 mergers and acquisitions  totaling  83 billion  a rise of 166  from the year ago period  Although the next report is not yet released  the unofficial talk is that the full year target of  100 billion of M A valuation was effortlessly reached with the legacy continuing into 2016 
Medtronic  MDT   after its path breaking  42 9 billion acquisition of Irish rival Covidien  in Jan 2015   has not taken a breather from strategic M As  Among many others  the company recently entered into an  for a total value of  1 1 billion  This acquisition is expected to significantly boost Medtronic s cardiac rhythm and heart failure business  alongside providing a strong foothold in the global niche 
Some other significant consolidation deals of recent times are discussed below 
Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   ABT    St  Jude Medical  STJ   In April  Abbott announced its decision to consolidate with St  Jude Medical for a deal value of  25 billion  Post completion  this will create a leader in high growth cardiovascular markets  including atrial fibrillation  structural heart and heart failure as well as earn a leading position in the high growth neuromodulation market 
DENTSPLY International  NASDAQ XRAY   XRAY    Sirona  A  that closed in March  this consolidation is aimed at forming a leading global manufacturer of professional dental products and materials 
Thermo Fisher  TMO    Affimetrix Thermo Fisher  following the Life Technologies buyout  has undertaken several meaningful acquisitions as part of its strategy to effectively deploy capital  The latest in the league was the company s  for a value of  1 3 billion  The acquisition is expected to boost Thermo Fisher s biosciences and genetic analysis portfolio 
Thermo Fisher   FEI Company  FEIC    for  4 2 billion will enable it to access FEI s industry leading high performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study  which in turn facilitates life science research 
Medtronic  MDT    HeartWare  HTWR   This June  Medtronic entered into an   for a total value of  1 1 billion  This acquisition is expected to significantly boost Medtronic s cardiac rhythm and heart failure business  alongside providing a strong foothold in the global niche 
Zimmer Biomet   LDR Holding Corp   LDRH   Zimmer Biomet s spine portfolio is expected to get a major boost with the    LDRH   for a total deal value of  1 billion 
Divestments 
The medical device majors continue to offload their non core business segments  specifically to focus on the main segments and also to divest assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers  as required by the U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  and other international anti trust regulators  This restricts the chance of monopoly practice in the market 
Let s take a look at some of the significant divestments of recent times 
Bayer  DE BAYGN   who had sold off its diabetes devices unit to Japan based Panasonic Healthcare Holdings Co   for  1 13 billion in Jan 2016  is once again preparing to spin off its radiology supplies business valued at  3 billion  According to the company  while the sale of the loss making diabetes devices unit will enable it to focus more on its profitable life sciences operations  the radiology business divestment is a part of the company s initiative to acquire agrochemical giant Monsanto  NYSE MON  under a mega   62 billion deal 
In Mar 2016  Mindray Medical International Limited declared its sell off to Solid Union Limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of Excelsior Union Limited  for  28 per American Depositary Share  ADS  
In Jan 2016  VCA Inc   WOOF   a healthcare major  sold off a majority interest in its subsidiary Vetstreet  Inc     a software as a service  SaaS  provider of marketing solutions and health information analytics to veterinary practices and animal health product manufacturer   to Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC   a provider of health care products and services to office based dental  animal health and medical practitioners 
Huge Emerging Market Openings
As per recent data from Euromonitor International  the global medical device production value is likely to register strong growth of almost 6  in 2016  to reach  315 billion  While the traditional market continues to be plagued by difficulties  thanks to growing regulatory scrutiny and pricing pressure and the emerging markets of Latin America and Eastern Europe are showing no signs of turnaround  the healthcare industry s turnover in Brazil and Russia is estimated to decline by 3  and 2   respectively  over 2016   it s the Asia Pacific region on which all the bets are placed this year 
The MedTech market in Asia Pacific grew the fastest at a CAGR of 10  during 2008 2014 and is expected to continue to grow rapidly over 2016 as well  According to the report  China s and India s healthcare service revenues are expected to grow by 12  and 9   respectively  in 2016 alone  resulting in a large number of new hospital construction projects and soaring demand for medical and surgical equipment 
Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50  of sales from this region  In the first quarter of 2016  sales in key emerging markets climbed 12  driven by growth in India and China 
At Medtronic  while growth in the rest of the world was low to declining  the emerging markets demonstrated strong growth in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  which contributed 185 basis points  bps  to the company s overall revenue growth  Post Covidien integration  the combined entity is likely to generate about  27 billion in total revenue  including  3 7 billion from emerging markets 
Boston Scientific Corporation  NYSE BSX   BSX  achieved 21  organic growth in emerging markets in the first quarter of 2016  ahead of the company s target of reaching 15  of sales by 2017 from 8  in 2013 
Strongest Links
Among the medical product stocks  companies like NuVasive  Inc   NUVA  and GW Pharmaceuticals plc  GWPH  look attractive  with both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Boston Scientific Corp   BSX   Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc  and St  Jude Medical Inc   STJ  are also well positioned with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
In the medical instrument space  we are positive on ABIOMED  Inc   ABMD   Masimo Corp   MASI  and Mesa Laboratories Inc   MLAB  among others  all carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Besides  Steris Plc  STE   Natus Medical Inc   BABY  and Hologic Inc   HOLX   all with a Zacks Rank  2  are also expected to do well 
Weaker Stocks
Coming to the weakest links in the MedTech sector  we advise investors to stay away from names that offer little growth opportunity in the near term  These include companies for which estimate revision trends reflect a bearish sentiment

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  5 02 on  648 51 million in revenue  7 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  5 million on the top
Intuitive Surgical s robust growth the past year comes from the success of its surgical systems  particularly the da Vinci
Q1 featured a 17  increase in procedures performed with the da Vinci and an 11  jump in systems sold
What are you expecting for   
The past year has been extremely volatile for the healthcare industry  but that hasn t held true for Intuitive Surgical  Over the same period  the stock is up 15 72  primarily due to the success of its flagship product  the da Vinci surgical system 
Earnings have followed suit and have topped expectations in each of the past 4 quarters  Early signs suggest that the company will continue its streak of strong earnings when it releases Q2 results this Tuesday 
The Estimize consensus is looking for earnings per share of  5 02 on  648 51 million in revenue  7 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  5 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents an 8  increase in earnings with sales expected to jump 10  
Estimates have been trending upwards over the last 3 months which typically means a strong report is on the way 

Intuitive Surgical has been fortunate to have found success with its da Vinci surgical systems  In each of the past 5 quarters  the company has posted double digit gains on both the top and bottom line 
Q1 in particular saw worldwide da Vinci procedures grow by 17  compared to the first quarter of 2015  This was primarily driven by an increase in general surgery and urologic procedures in the U S  Shipments of its flagship product also rose to 110 systems compared to 99 in the first quarter of 2015 
Minimally invasive robotic surgeries are still in their early stages  leaving Intuitive Surgical with a lot room to run  The company makes its biggest margins from new accessories such as the Xi Vessel Sealer  Xi Firefly and Xi Stapler  If system wide sales continue to grow at their current pace and Intuitive Surgical can capitalize on global expansion  then sky s the limit for earnings potential

113055,334570,ISRG,Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  Tops Q2 Earnings   Sales  Stock Up,opinion,Shares of Intuitive Surgical Inc    NASDAQ ISRG   surged almost 7  in after hours trading following another impressive quarterly result  The da Vinci system maker posted adjusted earnings of  5 62 per share in the second quarter of 2016  up 23  on a year over year basis on significant revenue growth and margin expansion Including stock based compensation  adjusted earnings came in at  4 86 per share  which crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 65 cents and surged 28 3  from the year ago quarter  Revenues increased 14 3  year over year to  670 1 million  driven by higher procedural volume and growth across all segments  Revenues were higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  643 million as well  Recurring revenues totaled  447 million  representing almost 75  of the revenues in the quarter  Procedure DetailsWorldwide da Vinci procedure volumes grew approximately 16  year over year to 176K  Procedures in the U S  grew approximately 13   while that outside the U S  increased about 25  Increasing adoption in general surgery procedures in the U S   continued growth in urology procedures worldwide and modest growth in the U S  urology and gynecology drove the procedure growth in the quarter Management stated that under the general surgery  inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair growth remains strong  while growth in colorectal surgery was solid Procedure growth was variable by country in Europe  with strong performance in Germany offsetting a slight sequential decline in the U K  Procedure growth improved modestly  both in the Nordic countries and France   In Asia  procedure growth in Japan was solid while growth in Korea was robust and accelerated sequentially  Growth in procedures in China was also strong in the reported quarter  INTUITIVE SURG Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Revenue DetailsInstruments and Accessories revenues grew 14 3  to  339 3 million in the quarter driven by a higher number of procedures  Revenues realized per procedure were approximately  1 810 which decreased slightly on a sequential basis System sales increased 15 2  to  202 7 million driven by higher revenues from operating lease activities as well as system average selling price  ASP   Intuitive Surgical placed 130 systems in the quarter  up from 118 in the year ago quarter Management at Intuitive Surgical noted that 15 systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the second quarter  compared with 19 in the first quarter  and 5 systems in the year ago quarter  At the end of the second quarter  there were 66 systems out in the field under operating leases Intuitive Surgical generated approximately  4 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the reported quarter  compared with  1 million in the year ago quarter  and  4 million in the first quarter 2016 The company also generated almost  13 million of revenues from lease buyouts compared with  6 million in the first quarter  and  4 million in the year ago quarter Of the total systems placed during the first quarter  77  were da Vinci Xi as compared to 72  in the preceding quarter Globally  system average selling price  ASP  increased to  1 56 million  almost  60 000 higher than the year ago quarter ASP  The year over year growth primarily reflects a higher mix of dual console systems and sales of Table Motion Hospital financed approximately 37  of the systems installed in the quarter under review  down from 17  in the last quarter  Intuitive Surgical directly financed 31 systems of which 19 were structured as operating leases Outside the U S   the company placed 51 systems compared with 46 systems in the year ago quarter and 36 systems in the first quarter  The company noted that 22 were placed in Europe  4 in China  and 13 in Japan Service revenues were up 13 1  to  128 1 million on growth in the installed base of da Vinci Surgical systems Margin DetailsAdjusted gross margin expanded 410 basis points  bps  to 70 6  in the reported quarter buoyed by lower product and product repair costs  improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable revenue mix Adjusted operating margin expanded 610 bps to 38  owing to lower selling  general   administrative expenses  SG A   which as a percentage of revenues  decreased 240 bps on a year over year basis  Research   development  R D  expenses  as a percentage of revenues  also decreased 30 bps Balance SheetIntuitive Surgical had cash  cash equivalents and investments of  4 2 billion as of Jun 30  2016  as compared with  3 8 billion as of Mar 31  2016 GuidanceIntuitive Surgical now forecasts 2016 procedural volumes in the range of 14  to 15   up from the earlier guided range of 12  to 14   However  the company expects procedure growth to slow down in the second half of 2016 Intuitive Surgical noted that its da Vinci Sp  Single port  program is progressing as planned  Management expects first markets for the device to include head and neck surgery  urology and colorectal surgery The company now expects fewer lease buyouts and lower upgrade and other system revenue in the third and fourth quarter as compared to the second quarter  Second half 2016 system ASPs will likely be lower than the second quarter driven by product and channel mix Management expects 2016 gross margin in the range of 70  to 71   up from the previously guided range of 69  to 70   However  gross margin is expected to decline in the second half of 2016 Further  the company anticipates a 12  to 15  year over year increase in operating expenses in 2016  as the company continues to invest in robotic assisted surgery Our TakeWe believe that growing adoption of Intuitive Surgical s da Vinci system among physicians for general surgery  oncology  urology and gynecology procedures is a key growth catalyst  Moreover  increasing procedural volumes outside the U S  presents significant growth opportunity for the company Further  the integrated Table Motion has gained significant traction within a short span of time  which will boost top line growth Meanwhile  incremental spending on product development and higher investment on expanding the company s footprint in international markets  particularly in Europe  are prudent moves that will drive long term growth The company expects to invest in developing imaging products  new kinds of endoscopes and expanding its fluorescence imaging portfolio  However  higher spending can weigh on margins in the near term Moreover  we believe the positive trends are quarter specific and the company has a long way to go in order to sustain the momentum  These include continued growth in the U S  as well as international procedural volume  particularly in China  Japan and Europe  Notably  markets outside the U S  are still in the early stages of adoption  hence system placements are expected to remain inconsistent in

Commentary  the S P 500  SPY  staged a sharp reversal  Today s strong 1 7  gain places the index just below a major test of strength and within a shout of completely reversing all of August s sell off 

The S P 500 leaves the prior day s weakness in the dust  A major test of resistance now looms 
T2108 jumped as well but refused to break into overbought territory  My favorite technical indicator closed at 63 8  and even faded a bit off its highs  So the tease just below overbought conditions continues  In  I declared T2108 had gotten close enough because  after all  T2108 has now gone 329 trading days without breaking through official overbought territory  With this context   close enough  is sufficient 

More important is the meaning of overbought in this case  Until the S P 500 breaks through 200DMA resistance AND follows through  my trading call will stay some shade of bearish  right now  mild    If the index follows through on a breakout  I flip right back to bullish with the assumption that a major overbought rally is underway  Again  one step at a time 

The volatility index was hit hard by the sudden return of excited buyers  The VIX hit a fresh 2 month low on a 13 5  decline and is once again below the 15 35 pivot   I call it a pivot for a good reason 

The volatility index quickly resumes its descent even as the 15 35 pivot serves as a magnet
A major driver of the action was the European Central Bank  ECB   Whatever President Mario Draghi said  I hope to write a quick piece on it over the weekend   thumped the euro  FXE  and sent traders scrambling for  risk on  trades  I closed out my short on EUR USD  The dollar index was a major beneficiary   Super Mario  helped to save the dollar s current trading range  The U S  dollar even surged against the Japanese yen  FXY  

The euro plunges and faces its own critical 200DMA test against the U S  dollar  A total breakdown looms 


The dollar index confirms nice bounce from the lower depths of its on going trading range  Can it finally break out from the short term downtrend in place since March 
Once again  the currency markets are key to the stock market  This swift move is a game changer  If the euro proceeds to break down  the stock market could get a turbo boost  The next looming caveat would be yet another Fed meeting next week  The Fed may  decide  to counteract the U S  dollar s resurgent strength with an extra dose of deference to the uncertain economic conditions preventing it from starting its rate tightening cycle  Paradoxically  the market could like that kind of talk as well 

Although my trading bias is now set to mildly bearish  I found myself all day hunting down buying opportunities  especially in biotech  When I looked up and noticed my bullish posture  I hunted down Goldman Sachs  N GS  and faded its bounce  I am looking for the 50DMA to hold as resistance 


Goldman Sachs  GS  does not quite reverse the previous day s sudden selling  For now  the declining 50DMA rules trading 
Even if GS eventually wiggles its way above its 50DMA I like it now as a hedge on bullishness  The stock overall looks very weak  If the next calamity for the market is a financial incident  GS could be right at the center 

Speaking of hedges  Caterpillar  N CAT  was the big post earnings reversal of the day  It managed to stay green for the day even after its 50DMA resistance held strong  I was fortunate to rush in to call options near the open after I noticed buyers piling into the gap down  It turned into a quick double  I am still holding shares short 

Caterpillar attempts a contrary move to breakout above its 50DMA resistance after first doing a post earnings gap down 
Back to biotech 

Earlier this month    O GILD  as a good bio tech  catch up  play  Since then  it has steadily  albeit in choppy fashion  marched higher even as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  IBB  has barely followed support off its lows  Today was a big day as GILD soared 5 8  for a double 50 and 200DMA breakout 


Gilead Sciences  GILD  rallies to the edge of a major breakout and end of its downtrend from recent highs
Given I had already made several successful trades on IBB and Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX   I was very content to sit on my GILD call options  they do not expire until next year   As I noted in   I was primed to lock in profits on my IBB call options  I also decided to lock in profits on my shares  That decision turned out well as it freed me to buy another intraday dip that I in turn flipped  VRX was in focus for me given its extreme sell off the previous day  I bought a call option soon after the open given the stock gapped down an additional 7   I was on the lookout for signs of strength  as soon as I noticed some  I added shares 

I later discovered that the short selling firm Citron that took down VRX confirmed that Andrew Left would appear on BloombergTV at 12 30pm Eastern  I locked in profits on the shares ahead of that interview  Sure enough  the stock began to wane after 12 30pm  I set a limit order to double down on my call option in case the selling got bad  I got filled in due time  I was not watching the interview  but I am guessing the strength returned after the interview ended  Going into the close  VRX was about 21  off its low of the day and I locked in substantial profits on my call options  VRX still ended the day down 7 4   roughly flat with its open  This kind of wide ranging volatility is a trader s dream 

Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  is struggling to get back on its feet after Citron s squeeze


A roller coaster ride intraday equals a lot of trading opportunities 
One reversal I completely missed   by mere minutes   was in Build a bear Workshop  BBW    sent investors selling in a panic  I hesitated just a few minutes and quicker  more calm traders and investors  stepped right in and relieved BBW of most its losses  Clearly  the market is jittery  but these jitters are often turning into major buying opportunities  even if short term  

Build a bear Workshop craters momentarily as panic quicky gives way to cooler heads

Build a bear Workshop s buying opportunity lasted less than 10 minutes
A reversal I inexcusably missed was Intuitive Surgical  O ISRG   I was looking to follow up   I was watching the stock like a hawk 

 but after concluding that ISRG was on pace to completely fill its gap  I relaxed  Big mistake  ISRG eventually continued its sell off  but when signs of life appeared it took off like a rocket into the close  The stock recovered from its 50DMA and even closed above the upper Bollinger Band again 

Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  comes back from a 50DMA breakdown and barely misses a complete fill of its post earnings gap up 
Needless to say  after all this  I was not in a bearish mood  Now  Alphabet  GOOG  and Amazon com  O AMZN  got 10   after hours gains after reporting earnings  It will be difficult to get in a bearish mood tomorrow  Friday  October 23rd   Stay tuned

Allstate  N ALL 
Allstate started moving lower in May  culminating in a bottom with the broad market in late August  Since then it has had a strong trend higher  That trend met initial resistance in early November and pulled back slightly to the 100 day SMA  Finding support there  it bounced and is back at resistance  The RSI is in the bullish zone and the MACD is crossing up after a mild pullback  Both support a further push higher 
DuPont  N DD 
DuPont broke through support heading lower in June and keep on going  It did not find a bottom until late September  But when it did  it moved higher quickly  Since early November  it has been consolidating in a tight range though  The RSI is bullish and has worked off an overbought condition while the MACD is falling  A mixed story  Look for the break of the channel in either direction to participate 
Intercontinental Exchange  N ICE 
Intercontinental Exchange moved higher off of a tight flat SMA combination in October  It met resistance in early November and has been consolidating under it since then  Friday saw the price push back to resistance with the RSI jumping higher off of the mid line  The MACD has not turned yet though  Look for a break of resistance to participate in the upside 
Intuitive Surgical  O ISRG 
Intuitive Surgical jumped to a high near 565 in July only to trickle lower to a low to start October  From that point it made a Double Bottom and pushed back higher  A quick spike to near the September resistance was pushed back and then after some consolidation  it moved back to that same resistance  Friday saw a strong candle push higher to that level again  The RSI is bullish and moving higher while the MACD is turning up towards a cross  Look to participate in upside on a break over that resistance 
Illinois Tool Works  N ITW 
Illinois Tool Works hit 100 in February  March and April  and then started a move lower  Who says a there is no such thing as a triple top  That move found support in a double bottom at 80 and started higher  Last week the price failed at prior resistance  printing a Shooting star reversal candle  After 2 days though it found support and moved higher in a strong Marubozu candle to end the week at resistance again  The RSI is bullish and the MACD is flat after a pullback  Look for a break of resistance to participate in the upside 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into next week sees the equity markets looking mixed in the short run and at resistance  while better in the intermediate term 
Elsewhere look for gold to continue the bounce in its downtrend while crude oil continues lower  The US dollar index is biased lower in the short term in its uptrend while US Treasuries look lower in the broad consolidation 
The Shanghai Composite looks better to the upside  but with resistance nearby while Emerging Markets are biased to the downside  Volatility looks to remain subdued  keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETFs N SPY  N IWM and O QQQ  Short term the QQQ looks best and ready to challenge the all time high  while the SPY and IWM lag  Longer term they are all at prior consolidation areas and need a catalyst 
After a week where the ECB disappointed  the FOMC is pushing hard with rhetoric it will tighten  that they equity indexes did not crater can also be viewed as strength  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

The biggest catalyst to Intuitive Surgical s growth is the widespread adoption of its da Vinci surgical Systems
Intuitive Surgical is expanding internationally  opening up significant upside growth potential

ISRG data by YCharts
The darling of health care equipment  Intuitive Surgical is scheduled to report Q4 2015 earnings this Thursday  after the markets close  This past week  ISRG reported guidance of  677 million for Q4 revenue  which invoked Wall Street to revise their previous revenue estimate of  617 million  That said  the Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  5 09  eight cents higher than the Street  and revenue of  650 17million  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a projected YoY increase in EPS and revenue of 3  and 7   respectively 

Intuitive Surgical specializes in developing and manufacturing robot assisted devices for use in simple medical procedures to general surgery  Over the past 15 years  the company has experienced uninterrupted growth due to the widespread adoption of their flagship machine  the da Vinci surgical systems  At its core  the da Vinci provides surgeons and patients with a device that reduces length of stay  readmission  complications and infections traditionally associated with minimally invasive surgery  Intuitive Surgical s systems were initially used by urologists and gynecologists and only recently have been gained mainstream adoption in general surgery  oncology and cancer treatment  Moreover  Intuitive Surgical is expanding internationally  opening up significant upside growth potential 

The biggest catalyst to Intuitive s growth has been the success of the da Vinci surgical systems  In just Q4 2015  the number of procedures performed with da Vinci systems increased by 15   The biggest slight against these systems have been their astronomical price tag  The retail value of a da Vinci robot can be as high as  2 5 million  That said  these machines are very costly to manufacture and produce very low margins  Intuitive generates most of its profits from servicing and accessories The upside potential for Intuitive Surgical is sky high  especially since they have only begun expanding into international markets  International procedures have grown by double digits each of the handful of years  even as a strong dollar hinders worldwide sales  If Intuitive Surgical is able to successfully capitalize on widespread adoption  cancer treatment procedures  and global expansion  then sky s the limit for earnings potential ",2016-01-21,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-intuitive-surgical-report-strong-q4-earnings-381122,381122

This quarter  the Estimize community is calling for EPS of  4 41 on revenue expectations of 592 51 million  11 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  6 5 million higher on the top  However our Select Consensus  a weighted average of our most accurate analysts and recent estimates  is calling for a larger beat of 13 cents and  7 5 million  This margin has expanded in past three months with EPS revisions increasing 4   If all goes as expected  profitability will grow 23  on a 12  increase in revenue  year over year 

Intuitive Surgical s robust growth the past year comes from the success of its surgical systems   particularly the da Vinci  In Q4 2015  the number of procedures performed with a da VInci system increased 15   Procedures volume should continue to see these gains with expectations of increasing by 10  this year  The biggest slight against these systems have been their astronomical price tag  which could hamper sales in the near future  However  Intuitive makes its biggest margins from new accessories such as the Xi Vessel Sealer  Xi Firefly and Xi Stapler  System wide sales are expected to be carried by new accessories and have been forecasted to rise 9 6   If Intuitive Surgical is able to successfully capitalize on widespread adoption  and global expansion  then sky s the limit for earnings potential 
Do you think ISRG can beat estimates ",2016-04-19,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-intuitive-surgical-top-expectations-yet-again-here’s-what-to-watch-200125517,200125517
113092,334607,ISRG,Watch These Health Care ETFs,opinion,"The Health Care sector comprises many different types of companies  From biotechs to pharmaceuticals to equipment manufacturers  it can be difficult to know in which portion of the sector an investor should place their money 
While industries within the Health Care sector can be completely different  they each face volatility that investors can capitalize on  For instance  Intuitive Surgical Inc   NASDAQ ISRG   a company specializing in medical robotics  saw its share price soar 23  over a four day stretch in April 2014  only to fall 33  from the high by the end of the same month 
Price Fluctuations May Vary
While ETFs do not usually experience price fluctuations this rapidly  their holdings can  and these fluctuations will affect the overall value of the ETF  As I ve said before  a fund s performance is only as good as its holdings  iShares DJSU Medical Devices Index  NYSE IHI   which allocates over 3  of its assets to ISRG  serves as a great example  Coinciding with ISRG s move  the value of IHI rose nearly 4  to begin April  and ended the month by declining 7  from the high 
Knowing the quality of a fund s holdings is key when determining investment opportunities  The movement of a few bad stocks held by IHI dramatically impacted investors in the fund 
Dangerous Sector
The Health Care sector overall is particularly dangerous for investors  as it ranks 7th out of 10 in my   It receives my Dangerous rating  and as expected  investors must tread carefully  Bottoms up analysis of ETFs based on their holdings drives my  on ETFs  These ratings allow investors to know more about the relative merits of ETFs 
We cover 22 Health Care ETFs which hold anywhere from 20 to 309 different stocks  This difference in holdings means that each funds  performance can be drastically different from the next 
A good way to navigate a Dangerous rated sector such as Health Care is through the use of an ETF pair trade  i e  long short strategy   The following ETF pair trade can be used to capitalize upon the volatility of the Health Care sector for both upside or downside 
Long  SPDR   Health Care  ARCA XLV 
Short  PowerShares Dynamic Heathcare  NYSE PTH 
XLV  ranks second out of the 99 Heath Care ETFs and mutual funds I cover and earns my Very Attractive rating  This ETF allocates 30  of its value to Attractive or better rated stocks and also has very low Total Annual Costs of 0 20   XLV holds high quality stocks while not charging investors too much to do so 
On the other hand  PTH receives my Dangerous rating and is my second worst rated Health Care ETF  PTH allocates over 50  of its value to Dangerous or worse rated stocks while allocating 0  to Attractive or better stocks  Despite this poor allocation  PTH charges investors 0 66  in Total Annual Costs  Why should someone want to pay a manager three times more to invest his or her money in worse holdings 
This pair trade gives investors exposure to one of the best Health Care ETFs while minimizing risk of loss by shorting one of the worst Health Care ETFs 
Attractive Play
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  is one of my favorite stocks in XLV and earns my Attractive rating  As I wrote back in   JNJ is a consistently growing company that remains undervalued  Over the past decade  JNJ has grown after tax profits  NOPAT  by 8  compounded annually  The company currently earns a top quintile return on invested capital  ROIC  of 15   The best part about JNJ is its valuation  If JNJ is able to grow NOPAT by only 7  compounded annually for the next 15 years  the stock is worth   156 share today  a 51  increase from its current price of  103 share  With consistent history of profit growth  a diversified product line  and multiple expansion markets throughout the world  JNJ is in a great position to exceed even these expectations  While JNJ s price has increased since April  it still remains a strong value play with very little downside that will greatly benefit long term investors 
The The Spectranetics Corporation  NASDAQ SPNC  is one of my least favorite stocks in PTH and earns my Dangerous rating  Since 2010  SPNC s NOPAT has declined by 21  compounded annually  The company has a bottom quintile ROIC of 1   SPNC has also generated negative economic earnings in every one of the last 15 years  The stock fell over 8  earlier in the year  but despite this decline still remains overvalued  To justify its current valuation of   23 share  Alkermes  NASDAQ ALKS  would have to grow NOPAT by 20  compounded annually for the next 46 years  This expectation is highly unlikely for any company  especially one that has seen its profit decline and one that operates in a highly specialized industry  Investors should avoid SPNC and PTH 
Going long XLV allows investors to take advantage of the upside in the Health Care sector and see consistent long term growth from companies like JNJ  Being short PTH allows investors to hedge against companies like SPNC and other high momentum stocks held by PTH  As I recently   momentum stocks will plunge from their highs at a moment s notice  and its best for investors to buy quality companies whose prices will appreciate long term  This pair trade allows you to do just that  short the momentum stocks and go long on those that will benefit over the long haul

113093,334608,ISRG,Distractions Removed  S P 500 Now Fully Bullish,opinion,"T2108 Status  50 3 VIX Status  12 3 General  Short term  Trading Call  Can add to existing buys now that the S P 500 has broken out above its 50DMA  Stop on a close below the 50DMA  Cannot consider shorting until such a breakdown or T1208 overbought conditions Active T2108 periods  Day  289 over 20   includes day  280 at 20 01    Day  3 over 40   Day  1 over 50   overperiod   Day  28 under 60   Day  29 under 70 
Commentary Monday s surge for the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   above its 50 day moving average  DMA  provided great validation of  to avoid trading on headlines  The 0 85  gain also took the index above the previous bear bull line  With oversold conditions fading in the mirror and likely leaving behind overly aggressive bears who yet again failed to chase the market down  yesterday s move on the S P 500 is fully bullish 
The S P 500 breaks out  closes at its high of the day  and punctuates the bounce from oversold conditions

Of course  only new highs  all time and 52 week  will validate this bullish push  As I assess the odds I just remind myself what has happened after each bounce back from sell offs inspired by negative headlines 
Incredibly  the NASDAQ  PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   punched to fresh FOURTEEN year highs  I think this is a great occasion for showing a monthly chart 
The picture is enough said  the NASDAQ is an awesome recovery to behold 

I am truly embarrassed to have to look back on this chart with hindsight to report that buying a simple breakout above the highs of the last bull market could have been just one of two trades over the last three years  The other trade would have been either to buy the subsequent dip in 2011 for truly committed bulls or to buy again on the next breakout in 2012  This is classic  trend is your friend  kind of action  Heck  it is even  buy the dip  kind of action 
In the wake of the dot com crash in 2000  two friends and I placed bets on the number of years the NASDAQ would need to establish a full recovery  I was the most bearish at 25 years  My friends bet 10 and 15 years  At least that bet was made in 2001 dollars 
T2108 closed at 50 3   climbing another five percentage points  It continues to confirm the bullish bounce from oversold conditions earlier this month 
The volatility index  the VIX  has of course continued to plunge  Last week s surge toward the 15 35 pivot is almost ancient history as the VIX now tests the lower edge of the presumed upward channel 
Can the VIX s upward trending channel hold 

ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY  is of course getting freshly crushed and ground  Its breakout above the 50DMA is definitely ancient history now 
UVXY playing a familiar tune  a close at all time lows

Now for some interesting stock charts befitting the current trading setup 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  are experiencing Bollinger  Band  BB  squeezes  In both cases  post earnings moves took the stocks well above their respective upper Bollinger Bands and essentially exhausted buyers  Both stocks are struggling to regain post earnings momentum 
A breakout  or breakdown  from here should be quite decisive  In particular  if FB manages to break out higher  it could should be part of a fresh rally in tech and the stock market in general  I cannot imagine a major sell off in the middle of a fresh FB run up 
Facebook is still struggling to regain its post earnings momentum so this BB squeeze should be decisive

Intuitive Surgical has yet to make a fresh post earnings high so its BB squeeze should be decisive

Another sign buyers are on the move  U S  Steel  NYSE X  continues its strong post earnings rally as it punches a fresh 3 year high  I am guessing buyers are hunting out relatively  cheap  stocks that can help them play catch up with the stock market 
At the beginning of this year  I said I would pay more attention to steel stocks again and start writing about them  I never got around to it  and I certainly regret it now   AK Steel  NYSE AKS  is still in my portfolio   I can only watch now 
A person on Twitter reminded me about Nucor  NYSE NUE   The stock is around post recession highs but is essentially flat on the year  Perhaps there is still good catch up potential there 

U S  Steel surges to fresh 3 year highs  buyers looking for  cheap  stocks for playing catch up with the stock market

Akamai Technologies  Ticker  AKAM
Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM  has moved between multi year support and resistance since February  as it rises along the 200 day SMA  It is now at trend resistance and the neckline of an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern with support or more upside from a rising RSI and MACD 
The Bank of New York Mellon  Ticker  BK
The Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK  is at resistance at 40 as it may be completing a consolidation that began in July  The RSI is rising and bullish and the MACD about to cross up to support a push higher  to continue the trend that began in April 
Domino s Pizza  Ticker  DPZ
Domino s Pizza  NYSE DPZ  is at resistance that has been in place since April  The recent trend higher has support to continue from the bullish RSI and MACD 
Intuitive Surgical  Ticker  ISRG
Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  is bouncing along at a resistance zone between 480 and 490  The RSI held in the bullish zone on the recent pullback and is rising along with a MACD that has leveled 
Knight Transportation  Ticker  KNX
Knight Transportation  NYSE KNX  is making a third touch at the 26 30 area  this time after only a minor pullback  The RSI is strong and bullish near 70 with a MACD rising  both supporting a push through higher 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which  heading into September Options Expiration Week sees the equity markets looking tired and ready for a pullback  Elsewhere look for Gold to continue lower while Crude Oil does the same  The US Dollar Index is strong and looks to continue higher while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite is also strong and biased higher with Emerging Markets looking to continue their pullback  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000 Index  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show more consolidation in the zone for the IWM and a possibility of consolidation or even a pullback for both the SPY and QQQ  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

Commentary On Friday  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   made a very marginal new all time high  T2108 failed to cooperate and instead pulled back marginally  Yesterday  Monday  April 27th  marked mild follow through on that bearish divergence  The S P 500 pulled back a mere  0 4  but T2108 tumbled all the way below 60   Once again  overbought conditions are proving elusive on this 199th day straight without T2108 trading into overbought territory   And now we are going for an extended period without oversold conditions too   The chopfest essentially continues even with the very subtle upward  tilt  to the index 

A chopfest that is managing an ever so subtle upward bias
The Federal Reserve is coming up on Wednesday  but I find myself unable to pull the trigger on my typical  fade volatility  pre Fed trade  Volatility in the form of the VIX is generally trending down into this meeting  The Fed has done such a great job in calming the markets and sending volatility lower that I am left wondering how in the world could it pull off the trick again at these levels  So this time around I took a bit of a flyer and doubled down on my  just in case  ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  ARCA UVXY  call options 

ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  is back to familiar territory with a downtrend in place for most of 2015
The fascinating part of this return to low volatility is that central banks continue trying  mostly in vain  to warn financial markets of growing risks in the current complacency and on going reach for yield     But of course  markets can hardly take time to listen to the warnings because they follow what the central banks DO  And what they continue to do is reassure markets with their actions and policies 
Anyway  I mainly wrote this to call your attention to an uptrend that is in grave danger from some notable topping action and distribution  Distribution occurs when a stock ETF fails to make progress while at the same time selling volume greatly outpaces buying volume  This is exactly what is unfolding for iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB  
IBB has been a market darling  providing tremendous returns despite the tremendous risk embedded in many of its individual components  The monthly chart below shows the relentless nature of the uptrend  The daily chart shows the technical damage happening in the short term  All eyes should now be watching to see whether the uptrend support can hold yet again  If not  look out 

You simply cannot find a better trend than this one  since 2010 2011  almost every month has traded consistently with upward momentum

However  the party for IBB may finally come to a significant pause if not an end if this pattern of distribution widens and buyers do not soon step up yet again to defend the uptrend
Oh  and speaking of medical related stocks  Intuitive Surgical  NASDAQ ISRG  failed to maintain its pre earnings bullish posture  The selling has yet to end post earnings 

Intuitive Surgical disappoints

113096,334611,ISRG,5 Charts To Trade Now  HDP  ISRG  FTNT  BOX  WIX,opinion,"This is a quick post on five charts that caught my eye on Tuesday  May 19th  All charts annotated at and downloaded from  
Hortonworks  NASDAQ HDP  has struggled to make a good post IPO impression  The first earnings report underwhelmed and led to a fresh all time low  The last earnings report was initially well received and then faded to a slightly negative close  However  on Tuesday  May 19th  HDP made a tremendous 15  surge that not only resumes momentum for the stock but also represents a breakout  All it took was a Barclay s  upgrade to outperform and a price target of  30 

Hortonworks  Inc   HDP  makes a fresh breakout attempt after an ominous post earnings fade
Intuitive Surgical  Inc   NASDAQ ISRG  is the stock I want to love  The last earnings report was uninspiring and traders and investors bailed fast  The selling finally ended around 200 day moving average  DMA  support  Now  a Bollinger  Band  BB  squeeze is developing  I would love to anticipate a breakout here  However  given the poor post earnings performance  I will instead follow the break out of the BB squeeze in whatever direction it moves 

Intuitive Surgical  Inc   ISRG  is stabilizing post earnings with a critical retest of 200DMA support
Fortinet Inc   NASDAQ FTNT  is another BB squeeze candidate  Its technical profile is much better than ISRG here  The stock gapped up nicely post earnings and has consolidated ever since  This setup makes FTNT look like a coiled spring   ready to break out and resume the very strong upward trend in the stock 

Fortinet Inc   FTNT  looks ready to extend its run up further
Ever since Jim Cramer   NYSE BOX   I have been wary of betting this is eventually a single digit stock  I now have put options after the stock has slowly but surely sagged despite periodic hype fests from Cramer gushing over the stock  It is rarely a good sign when an IPO comes right out the box  so to speak  with a very poor earnings report  especially one that immediately retests post IPO lows  The chart below shows a pattern of lower highs  It seems only a matter of time before a lower low occurs 

Box  Inc   BOX  looks ready to breakdown as it hugs all time lows
Finally  Wix xom  NASDAQ WIX  is the stock that has really called me to return  I was hoping for a pullback from a strong response to the last earnings report  The current breakout makes such a pullback unlikely  So  instead  I will have to buy back into this one on momentum  Note the persistence of strong  high volume  buying since earnings

Commentary 322 trading days and counting since T2108 last traded in overbought conditions  I thought THIS would be the week for finally bringing the streak to an end  but T2108 took a sharp detour yesterday 

Like a forcefield  overbought conditions once again defy a breakthrough by T2108
In parallel  the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  N SPY   lost a fraction of a percent as the index turned its back on the recent 50DMA breakout 

The S P 500  SPY  may have stalled out for now
The small loss on the day helped the volatility index  the VIX  finally end its 10 day losing streak  The VIX jumped 9 3  yesterday with a bounce off its 200DMA 

The angst of August has become a distant memory  The drama with Glencore  L GLEN  helped spark a very brief revival of angst 
The big rally in the Australian dollar came to a screeching halt  As I have indicated before  I am VERY skeptical about the sustainability of this rally 

The Australian dollar printed a higher low against the Japanese yen as Glencore collapsed on September 29  2015
Earnings season has begun so  as always during this time  I am staying away from overplaying my hand with the technical calls  However  I think it is very surprising that the volatility index declined so steadily going into earnings season  This decline sets up the potential for some very disruptive moves if any major company delivers particularly bad news  So with T2108 scraping at overbought levels  a volatility index hovering above the 15 35 pivot  and a market taking a suddenly calm outlook on earnings  I am definitely avoiding any major bullish bets   Trading call is still neutral  
On a related noted  I have pumped the brakes on the trade on iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  O IBB   I have written  on this trade  ever since Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton bashed the sector  The rally off the bottom has definitely stalled and could even be poised to make at least one more lower low  I think at this point  it makes sense to wait to see whether IBB can generate another big swoosh of selling and or a retest of the big low last month on high selling volume  Note well that a breakout from the current consolidation might run IBB right into declining 50DMA resistance  My upside target remains a complete reversal of the post Clinton selling 

iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  ran into effective resistance at its downtrending 20DMA even as a trading range extends from September s washout selling 
Speaking of the health care sector  Intuitive Surgical  O ISRG  has my attention again as the stock briefly cracked 52 week lows  The stock is on the edge of a major breakdown ahead of earnings next week on October 20th  I am always biased on ISRG to look for a buying opportunity  but the current trading action looks very bearish 

Intuitive Surgical  ISRG  flirts with a fresh breakdown as it trades well below flash crash levels and levels from the last three earnings reports

113128,334643,ISRG,Key Levels On Intuitive Surgical  Inc  ,opinion,Intuitive Surgical  Inc   ISRG  took a beating yesterday  Many investors are wondering where the support levels can be found  Below on the chart you will find them ,2013-07-10,Nicholas Santiago,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/key-levels-on-intuitive-surgical,-inc.-174705",174705
113129,334644,ISRG,Intuitive Surgical Gets Crushed   Opportunity Looms ,opinion,In the  it is better to be born lucky than smart  category  we sold all of our Intuitive Surgical  ISRG   with the last position being purged from client accounts  at  510 per share  about 60 days ago The double top in the chart  from mid 2012  and then early 2013  meant the stock was on our radar screen  and its failure to move materially higher after decent earnings reports also left me puzzled As a growth stock  we were always leery given ISRG s lofty valuation  at 22 x  price to cash flow and 8 x  price to 4 quarter trailing revenues  not to mention the 27 x  P E ratio  for the 17  expecetd growth in 2013  Some investors are absolutely opposed to owning such a stock to begin with  but our philosophy is to own a blend of growth and value  and to keep the growth stocks with the higher valuations on a very short leash  That being said  yesterday s 17  price drop to the  410 area has us interested again in getting long ISRG  albeit with some qualifications  Morningstar   prior to the pre announcement   had an intrinsic value on ISRG of  420 per share  We would really like the stock under  400  with the caveat that we will look at the change in forward revenue and earnings estimates over the next few days to see how bad the damage is One of my favorite technicians and a guy whose work I have very high regard for   Gray Morrow of Yosemite Asset Management in San Luis Obispo  California   wrote the following technical summary for ISRG given yesterday s action  Gary is a far better technician than I  although he does very little fundamental analysis From Gary S  Morrow Intuitive Surgical has taken a crushing blow this morning  The earnings inspired flush began with a huge gap lower open that dropped shares over 15   This breakdown move has pushed ISRG below not only its 2013 lows but its 2012 bottom as well  Its no surprise that volume is running extremely heavy in the early going  By the close of trade today will be the heaviest downside day since the first quarter of 2009 Despite this powerful breakdown a low risk entry opportunity may soon develop  The longer term charts show considerable support near the  400 00 area  ISRG s 40 week moving average  which has not be tested since mid  09  rest at  405 00  Slightly below is a major retracement level  With the exception of a steep pullback in the second half of 2010  ISRG traced out a huge bull run from its 2009 lows  This mega bull move carried the stock from  100 00 all the way up to the 2012 peak of  600 00  At the  400 00 area ISRG will have retraced 1 3 of this rally  Slightly below this important level is the 2010 high just above  390 00  This was a key turning point during the stock s 2009 2012 rally  A spike high was left behind here before ISRG began working through a nine month pullback  The second  and more powerful  leg of the bull run began when this pullback ended in January of 2011 I expect the  400 00 area to provide significant support as this week s breakdown plays out  A base built in this support zone would be ideal rather than a quick upside reversal  A laddered entry would be the optimum strategy with initial purchases made as shares dip below  405 00  Additions would be made below  400 00 and again under  395 00  As this basing process plays out an oversold reading matching that of the 2010 bottom could be reached  Once this bottoming action is complete I believe patient ISRG bulls will be rewarded with a healthy recovery move  Initial target would be the previous 2013 lows set back in March at  455 00 Finally  on a personal note  as someone who was diagnosed with a malignant  cancerous  prostate tumor that required surgical removal in December  2007  the DaVinci and the quality of life that it offers I m sure has left many males with a high regard for the company  the machine and the urological surgeons that spent the time to get trained on the machine  However  the company may have tried to push the procedure into too many other areas  too quickly This decline will re set expectations We think opportunity looms for ISRG  We ll try and keep readers updated as we move along  although we can t promise such ,2013-07-10,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/intuitive-surgical-gets-crushed-–-opportunity-looms-174750,174750
