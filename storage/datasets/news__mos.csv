166404,387920,MOS,Canadian railways ration space as commodity congestion problems worsen,news,"By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG  Manitoba  Reuters    Canada s two major railways are rationing space on trains traveling to the country s biggest port and recently prioritized some commodities over others to deal with congestion  the latest indication of their struggle to meet demand from new trade deals   That move prompted Canada s transport regulator last week to start an investigation into rail services around Port Metro Vancouver  after shippers complained of  discriminatory treatment of certain commodities  by Canadian National Railway  CN   TO CNR  and  Canadian Pacific Railway   CP   TO CP   Canada is a top shipper of crops  fertilizer  oil and pulp  but has in recent years needed government intervention to keep commodities moving  from ordering railways to clear grain backlogs to Alberta s crude oil curtailments this month due to full pipelines  Free trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Nations are boosting demand for commodities  adding further strain to Canada s transportation infrastructure  Currently  the United States and Mexico account for at least 75 percent of Canadian exports  Both railways last month rationed the volume of traffic around Vancouver by restricting movement of some commodities  such as peas  lentils  pulp and paper  according to shipper notices seen by Reuters   The restrictions  called embargoes  are usually a tool of last resort for railways to ease congestion by temporarily limiting traffic  But in December  shippers allege that CN and CP used them more often than normal  harming some commodity sellers more than others in an effort to push through the maximum overall volume  CP imposed embargoes on three specific transloaders   facilities that empty rail cars into containers for loading onto vessels  These transloaders handle peas and lentils  but were prevented from doing so in December for days at a time  said Greg Northey  director of industry relations at Pulse Canada   TOTAL MESS  The delays caused some containers to miss their vessels  triggering contract breach penalties  Northey said   It was a total mess   he said  Embargoes also added costs for pulp and paper producers  who are trying to bolster ties with Asian buyers amid ongoing tariff disputes with the United States  For a second consecutive year  the railways imposed more embargo restrictions on pulp and paper than usual in December  leading to shipping delays  according to the Forest Products Association of Canada  whose members include  Canfor Corp   TO CFP  and West Fraser Timber  TO WFT    We can t do business like this if we want to diversify markets   said association Chief Executive Derek Nighbor   It s just a missed opportunity    Poor rail service costs the forest products industry C 500 million   376 million  annually  the association said  December s problems cost mills as much as a further C 1 million each  it said  Several shippers said the transportation agency will be asked at a hearing in late January to consider whether the railways discriminated against shippers that fill manifest trains   those carrying a variety of products  The investigation could also consider whether the railways violated their common carrier obligations to haul a full range of freight  For CN and CP  the investigation raises the risk of further regulation in an industry where they already complain of too much government control  In a statement  CN said the transportation agency s investigation should examine the full supply chain and take into account the impact that rain and wind had on operations late last year  CN said freight shipments are up 10 percent from November to mid January year over year  CP Chief Executive Keith Creel said he takes  great exception  to CP being included in the agency s investigation  adding in a statement that he is not aware of formal complaints  Since the railways  embargo and permit system was implemented in December to clear backed up freight  the flow of cars to grain terminals has improved  But it is unclear how the backlog happened in the first place  said Wade Sobkowich  executive director of Western Grain Elevator Association  It indicates that railways have failed to invest in adequate capacity to move goods at peak times  he said

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mosaic 
For Mosaic  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  8 09  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mosaic will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Mosaic would post earnings of  0 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 12  delivering a surprise of  60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

What s Next for Mosaic 
While Mosaic has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

166503,388019,MOS,Mosaic  MOS  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Mosaic  MOS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 23 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15  
Revenues are expected to be  1 89 billion  down 2 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 19  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mosaic 
For Mosaic  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  13 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mosaic will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Mosaic would post earnings of  0 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of  35 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19 05   A quarter ago  it was expected that this fertilizer maker would post earnings of  0 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 77  delivering a surprise of 35 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Mosaic  which belongs to the Zacks Fertilizers industry  posted revenues of  1 90 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 76   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 93 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Mosaic shares have lost about 12 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 5  
What s Next for Mosaic 
While Mosaic has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Mosaic was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 60 on  2 42 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 17 on  9 89 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

bell  In the last reported quarter  this diversified global manufacturer of engineered and applied products delivered year over year improvement of 23  in earnings as higher sales level  improved

average earnings surprise of 3 37   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement  Earnings Whispers  Our proven model does not conclusively show that TriMas is likely to beat

makes surprise prediction difficult  Conversely  we caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions  Factors to Consider General industrial activity levels have improved  particularly in the United States  and this bodes well for TriMas  fourth quarter performance  The company is well poised to take advantage of the incremental volume opportunities and continues to capitalize on its internal sales growth programs  The company has also refocused certain commercial efforts  including realigning and enhancing its sales functions  and improvement of cost structure  TriMas will also benefit from the recently implemented tax reform  However  the company s results will be impacted by higher commodity costs  particularly steel  aluminum and oil based commodities  It also has to contend with increased tariffs on imported goods  TriMas continues to counter the impact of higher commodity costs and tariffs through commercial actions  supply chain management  leveraging its global manufacturing footprint and continued management of businesses under the TriMas Business Model  Further  the fourth quarter normally generates lower sales and profit owing to decreased levels of production activity on account of holidays and year end customer shutdown  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 38 cents for the to be reported quarter  reflecting growth of 22 6  from 31 cents per share reported in the prior year quarter  Coming to segment  the Specialty Products segment  which contributed 35  of third quarter 2018 sales  is likely to sustain momentum from improving energy and industrial end markets  Management also continues to assess the cost structure of the segment  The packaging segment  which contributed 43  of third quarter 2018 sales   its most profitable business  is likely to benefit from new products and realignment of the segment s manufacturing footprint  The business continues to develop specialty dispensing and closure applications for higher growth global markets  industrial  food and beverage and heath  beauty and home care   The company is developing its global marketing and salesforce to better align with end markets and customers  Further  the segment continues to witness robust quoting activity within its existing and new product lines  In the Aerospace segment  22  of third quarter revenues   the company is witnessing solid order intake and order activity  It also witnessed some pickup in the military and defense area primarily through its distribution customers  The segment continues to focus on expanding the use of products on new and existing fixed and rotary wing platforms  and the unmanned aerial market   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for fourth quarter 2018 is pegged at  206 8 million  projecting year over year growth of 5 9   Stocks to Consider Here are some stocks

166535,388051,MOS,New Potash Corp CEO sticks with output strategy as competition builds,news,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG Manitoba  Reuters    The new chief executive officer of Potash Corp of Saskatchewan  TO POT  says he will stick with the Canadian company s focus on supporting the price of potash by matching output of the crop nutrient to demand  rather than maximizing sales volume to fend off competition 
Profits at Potash Corp  the world s second biggest potash producer  have dropped sharply as potash prices hit a six year low earlier this year  The breakup nearly a year ago of global potash trading partnership Belarusian Potash Co  BPC  accelerated the slide in price  as it created more competition among producers 
 The principle and the strategy of aligning production with demand has been a very successful one  and so therefore the answer is  there s no reason to change that going forward   CEO Jochen Tilk told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday  Tilk  an engineer raised in Germany  replaced longtime Potash Corp CEO Bill Doyle on July 1 
Potash Corp sells potash outside North American through its Canpotex partnership with Mosaic Co  N MOS  and Agrium Inc  TO AGU  
Tilk said  your guess is as good as mine  on whether potash producers Uralkali OAO  MM URKA  and Belaruskali forge a new BPC partnership  which could boost potash prices 
Tilk also faces the prospect of additional competition in his own backyard in Canada  as Germany s K S AG  DE SDFGn  and Anglo Australian miner BHP Billiton PLC  L BLT  build new mines in the province of Saskatchewan 
A former CEO of Inmet Mining  a now taken over copper  zinc and gold producer  Tilk said it s too soon for him to outline specific plans for Potash Corp  But he said lowering operating costs is a priority  as that would leave the company well positioned for a conservative demand scenario while maintaining idled capacity that would be available if markets heat up 
Global expansion of potash mining capacity  led by Potash Corp s own decade long buildout  has exceeded the pace of demand growth  adding further pressure to prices 
In December  the company said it would slash its workforce by 18 percent as it struggled with slumping demand and weak prices  It has since recalled nearly 100 workers due to tight conditions in the granular potash market 
Tilk said that although it has surplus capacity  the company is committed to completing the last piece of its potash expansion next year  with less than  1 billion still to spend on the program  Once it s complete  Potash Corp should have more free cash flow  and Tilk said the company will look at whether to use it to buy back shares  increase its dividend or for other purposes 
Examining internal opportunities to grow is a bigger priority than making acquisitions  he said 
 The No  1 focus right at this point in time  the priority is  really  look at Potash Corp and the organic opportunities that we have  
The company owns minority stakes in three other potash companies  Israel Chemicals Ltd  TA ICL   Chile s SQM  SN SQMa  and Arab Potash Co PLC  AM APOT   Former CEO Doyle abandoned efforts to take over ICL last year because of strong opposition in Israel 
Those equity stakes will have to prove they can create value for shareholders  Tilk said 

 If that s indeed the case  they re great investments  If it turns out they don t create that value  at least not in the setting they are  then the company has to look at that  
Doyle will stay on as a senior adviser to Tilk through June 2015

adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share for the third quarter topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 64 cents  translating into a 17 2  positive surprise Net sales jumped roughly 48  year over year to  2 928 1 million in the quarter  mainly driven by the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition and higher average sales prices across all segments  The figure  however  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 936 5 million Mosaic beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of roughly 7 3  Mosaic has outperformed the  it belongs to over a year  Its shares have popped 20  compared with roughly 7  rise recorded by the industry  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model shows that Mosaic is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Mosaic is  2 11   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at 58 cents and 57 cents  respectively  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Mosaic currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or  5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors to ConsiderMosaic  during its third quarter call  raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2018 to the range of  1 80  2 00 from the prior view of  1 45  1 80  considering strong business performance and lower expected effective tax rate for the year The company also expects adjusted EBITDA for 2018 in the range of  1 90  2 billion  up from the previous view of  1 80  1 95 billion Mosaic expects phosphates sales volumes in the band of 1 7 2 million tons for the fourth quarter  The segment s adjusted gross margin is expected in the band of  65  75 per ton  Per the company  outlook for the Phosphates segment reflects underlying firmness in demand and supply dynamics as well as normal year end seasonality The company expects Potash segment

company also projects adjusted gross margin for the unit in the band of  35  45 per ton  Per the company  impact of the higher average realized selling prices is likely to be partly offset by the strengthening of the Brazilian Real relative to the U S  dollar Additionally  Mosaic continues to integrate production and distribution assets to drive revenues  The move is expected to boost margins in the fourth quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter total revenues is currently pegged at  2 348 million  reflecting an expected increase of 12 3  from the year ago quarter s tally

for the company s Potash segment is expected to rise 30 8  year over year in the fourth quarter  as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  649 million   Mosaic is gaining from higher fertilizer prices  which boosted growth in its top line in the third quarter  Higher average realized sales prices also enabled the company achieve double digit sales growth in Phosphates and Potash segments  Prices of major crop nutrients have gained strength on the back of strong global demand and tightened supply  Higher prices should continue to drive the company s sales and margins in the fourth quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average selling price per ton for the Phosphates segment for the fourth quarter is pegged at  470  reflecting an expected increase of 17 8  on a year over year comparison basis  The same for the Potash segment is expected to rise 22 8  year over year  as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  275   The Vale Fertilizantes acquisition should also drive revenues in the to be reported quarter  The buyout has allowed Mosaic to capitalize on the rapidly growing Brazilian agricultural market  The company achieved more than  100 million in synergies from the acquisition as of the third quarter  It expects to achieve  140  160 million in synergies for full year 2018 The Mosaic Company Price and Consensus

EBITDA RatiosPrice to earnings  P E   without a shadow of a doubt  is the most popular metric used by investors to work out the fair value of a stock  Many prefer to take the P E route in their quest for stocks that are trading at a discount  But even this universally used valuation multiple is not without its flaws Why EV EBITDA is a Better Choice Although P E enjoys great popularity among value investors  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative  EV EBITDA gives the true picture of a company s valuation and its earning potential  Moreover  it has a more complete approach to valuation Also known as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   The first constituent of the ratio  EV  is a firm s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash The other element of the ratio  EBITDA  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it eliminates non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice versa While P E just considers a firm s equity portion  EV EBITDA determines its total value  Unlike the P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into consideration  This is also the reason why EV EBITDA is commonly used to value likely acquisition targets  The ratio shows the amount of debt that the acquirer has to bear  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another flaw of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is harder to manipulate and can also be used to value companies that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms with a debt laden balance sheet and have a

166579,388095,MOS,Mosaic  MOS  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Mosaic  MOS  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This fertilizer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 57 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  67 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 35 billion  up 12 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mosaic 
For Mosaic  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 11  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Mosaic will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Mosaic would post earnings of  0 64 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 75  delivering a surprise of  17 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Mosaic appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mosaic-mos-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200389365,200389365

166603,388119,MOS,MOS Or SMG  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Fertilizers stocks have likely encountered both Mosaic  MOS  and Scotts Miracle Gro  SMG   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Mosaic is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Scotts Miracle Gro has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that MOS has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
MOS currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 01  while SMG has a forward P E of 18 05  We also note that MOS has a PEG ratio of 1 86  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  SMG currently has a PEG ratio of 1 87 
Another notable valuation metric for MOS is its P B ratio of 1 12  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  SMG has a P B of 16 54 
Based on these metrics and many more  MOS holds a Value grade of B  while SMG has a Value grade of D 
MOS sticks out from SMG in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that MOS is the better option right now ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mos-or-smg-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200386779,200386779
166605,388121,MOS,Why Mosaic  MOS  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Mosaic  MOS   which belongs to the Zacks Fertilizers industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this fertilizer maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 9 88   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  Mosaic came out with earnings of  0 75 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 64 per share  representing a surprise of 17 19   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 39 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 40 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 56  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Mosaic  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Mosaic currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 11   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-mosaic-mos-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200387086,200387086

featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Verso Corp    NYSE VRS    The Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS    Cameco Corp    NYSE CCJ   and Israel Chemicals Ltd    NYSE ICL   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  4 Basic Materials Stocks that Survived the 2018 Sector CrashThe Basic Materials sector has had a turbulent 2018  A host of factors including U S  China trade war  concerns over lower demand from China and higher raw materials costs have hurt stocks in this space The broader Zacks  sector has lost 20 3  year to date  significantly underperforming the Zacks S P 500 composite s declined of around 4 7   A number of major industries in the basic materials space including steel  chemicals and mining had a challenging year  weighed down by several headwinds The steel industry is hamstrung by trade tensions between the United States and China and a slowdown in steel demand in China  Sluggish steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  amid a cooling Chinese economy spells trouble for the steel industry  The trade war has taken a heavy toll on the Chinese economy  Signs of weakness in the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by a slowdown in real estate investment growth and declining car sales have shrouded the steel demand outlook  The steel industry also continues to reel under the effects of sustained oversupply of steel in the market  exacerbated by a surge in production in China to record highs in recent months  The ramping up of output in China amid sluggish domestic steel demand has raised industry wide concerns that a glut of Chinese steel will exert pressure on global steel prices Moreover  the prospects of the chemical industry are marred by lingering trade tensions between the United States and China  The Trump administration imposed tariffs on  50 billion in Chinese goods earlier this year that led to China retaliating with tariffs on American products of equal value  The U S  administration  in September  also slapped a 10  tariff on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  In response  China hit back with tariffs on an additional  60 billion in American products Beijing s list of U S  goods hit with tariffs includes a wide range of chemicals  China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals  The tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in this major market Trade tensions have clouded the overall demand outlook for chemicals  Softer demand from the automotive space of late is a concern for chemical makers  The U S  China trade friction has led to a slowdown in demand in China in this major chemical end use market Companies in the chemical space are also hamstrung by feedstock cost pressure  These companies face headwinds in the form of a spike in costs of raw materials as a result of short supply partly due to production outages and plant shutdowns  China s environmental crackdown has led to the tightening in supply of certain key raw materials as a result of plant closures For the mining space  gold and silver prices have dipped this year primarily owing to a stronger dollar and escalating trade tensions  Gold prices have lost around 6  so far this year and are now just above the psychological level of  1 200  Silver prices have tumbled roughly 16  year to date So far this year  the constant threat of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China led investors to seek safe haven in dollar  in turn hurting gold prices  Upbeat U S  economic data fueled the dollar rally  Higher U S  interest rates also dented the appeal of gold Stocks That Survived the SlumpDespite the challenges  some companies have stood firm  indicating investors  unswerving confidence  If bought now  these stocks are likely to outperform the rest and help build long term wealth  We have taken help of the Zacks Stock Screener to zero in on stocks that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have gained so far this

166695,388211,MOS,4 Basic Materials Stocks That Survived The 2018 Sector Crash,opinion,The Basic Materials sector has had a turbulent 2018  A host of factors including U S  China trade war  concerns over lower demand from China and higher raw materials costs have hurt stocks in this space The broader Zacks  sector has lost 20 3  year to date  significantly underperforming the Zacks S P 500 composite s declined of around 4 7   A number of major industries in the basic materials space including steel  chemicals and mining had a challenging year  weighed down by several headwinds  The steel industry is hamstrung by trade tensions between the United States and China and a slowdown in steel demand in China  Sluggish steel demand in China  the world s top consumer  amid a cooling Chinese economy spells trouble for the steel industry  The trade war has taken a heavy toll on the Chinese economy  Signs of weakness in the country s major steel end use markets   construction and automotive   as reflected by a slowdown in real estate investment growth and declining car sales have shrouded the steel demand outlook  The steel industry also continues to reel under the effects of sustained oversupply of steel in the market  exacerbated by a surge in production in China to record highs in recent months  The ramping up of output in China amid sluggish domestic steel demand has raised industry wide concerns that a glut of Chinese steel will exert pressure on global steel prices Moreover  the prospects of the chemical industry are marred by lingering trade tensions between the United States and China  The Trump administration imposed tariffs on  50 billion in Chinese goods earlier this year that led to China retaliating with tariffs on American products of equal value  The U S  administration  in September  also slapped a 10  tariff on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  In response  China hit back with tariffs on an additional  60 billion in American products Beijing s list of U S  goods hit with tariffs includes a wide range of chemicals  China is one of the biggest export markets for U S  chemicals  The tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U S  chemical products in this major market Trade tensions have clouded the overall demand outlook for chemicals  Softer demand from the automotive space of late is a concern for chemical makers  The U S  China trade friction has led to a slowdown in demand in China in this major chemical end use market Companies in the chemical space are also hamstrung by feedstock cost pressure  These companies face headwinds in the form of a spike in costs of raw materials as a result of short supply partly due to production outages and plant shutdowns  China s environmental crackdown has led to the tightening in supply of certain key raw materials as a result of plant closures For the mining space  gold and silver prices have dipped this year primarily owing to a stronger dollar and escalating trade tensions  Gold prices have lost around 6  so far this year and are now just above the psychological level of  1 200  Silver prices have tumbled roughly 16  year to date So far this year  the constant threat of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China led investors to seek safe haven in dollar  in turn hurting gold prices  Upbeat U S  economic data fueled the dollar rally  Higher U S  interest rates also dented the appeal of gold Stocks That Survived the SlumpDespite the challenges  some companies have stood firm  indicating investors  unswerving confidence  If bought now  these stocks are likely to outperform the rest and help build long term wealth  We have taken help of the Zacks Stock Screener to zero in on stocks

166850,388366,MOS,What Makes Mosaic  MOS  A Strong Momentum Stock  Buy Now ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Mosaic  MOS   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Mosaic currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if MOS is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this fertilizer maker holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For MOS  shares are up 14 79  over the past week while the Zacks Fertilizers industry is up 0 09  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 10 27  compares favorably with the industry s 0 88  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Over the past quarter  shares of Mosaic have risen 21 98   and are up 55 93  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  3 26  and 7 61   respectively 
Investors should also take note of MOS s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  MOS is averaging 5 036 271 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with MOS

166953,388469,MOS,Can The Worst S P 500 Stocks Of 2017 Rebound In 2018 ,opinion,Markets have enjoyed a strong and enduring rally for nearly all of 2017  Benchmarks have broken several milestones on multiple occasions and are on course to create new annual records  Year to date  the S P 500 is up more than 20  and is on course to registering its highest gains in four years  Successively strong earnings numbers and robust economic growth have been the primary factors powering these gains However  this extended market rally was not without its occasional losses  Lingering fears about inflated valuations have dogged stocks for some time now  Geopolitical concerns  particularly those related to North Korea also threatened to spoil the party on more than one occasion  Also  there was much hand wringing over the likelihood of tax cuts receiving legislative approval before they were finally signed into law last week However  it is increasingly likely that the actions of the new administration will boost stocks further in the days ahead  In such a scenario  S P 500 stocks which have failed to chalk up gains this year should also stand a chance  This is particularly true for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank  which are well placed to ride the continuing market rally in 2018 Factors which Acted as a Drag on 2017 s RallyEven though benchmarks are now close to notching up annual records  a variety of factors have threatened to end their long running rally  Concerns about inflated valuations  particularly relating to tech stocks  have had investors worried on more than one occasion  Even though such fears have yet to come true  they continue to persist to this day  Further  geopolitical concerns have also clouded market sentiment at times  Such worries were especially heightened during North Korea s recent nuclear tests  Both South Korea and the U S  government warned of a strong response during these events  leading to losses for stocks Coming to specific sectors  energy stocks remained depressed over the year with the Energy Select Sector SPDR  XLE  NYSE XLE   down 3 6  year to date  During the year  the OPEC and other major oil producers successfully adhered to an output control agreement which lent some support to oil prices  However  a step up in production by U S  shale producers has led to the persistence of oversupply conditions Further  traditional safe haven sectors have been largely ignored during the year  with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU  up only 7 4  year to date  Instead  investors have favored high growth sectors such as technology in the quest for superlative gains  Industrywide changes have also acted as drags for specific stocks  For instance  the tendency to shop online has caused numerous store closures and created a near brick and mortar apocalypse Can Tax Cuts  Infrastructure Spending Boost Gains in 2018 On last Friday  President Trump finally signed the much anticipated tax Bill into law   The exact earnings impact of the tax legislation is yet to become clear  but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost  S P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11 8   with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation   Read   And now that President Trump has scored his first major legislative victory  it is likely that he will press forward with another major issue on his agenda  infrastructure reforms  It is now widely expected that the Trump administration will announce a new infrastructure package in 2018 During his presidential campaign  Trump had promised to implement a  1 trillion infrastructure package  This plan was intended to improve the state of roads  airports and bridges as well as other public works across the country Recently Trump has commented that his attempt to improve the country s infrastructure will easily garner bipartisan support  The major obstacle to be overcome is related to funding and if that does happen  markets could receive yet another boost in the year ahead 5 Losers Set to Gain in 2018Even though stocks have notched up strong gains this year  some factors have acted as impediments to gains on several occasions  However  the projected impact of tax cuts and heightened prospects of a new infrastructure package are likely to sustain markets  rally well into next year This is why it makes good sense to bet on those S P 500 stocks which have taken a beating this year but stand a good chance of notching up gains in 2018  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics Foot Locker   NYSE FL   reported strong third quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark  This led the stock to take a huge leap and outpace the industry in a month  Clearly  third quarter results have given a fresh breath of life to the stock  which in the recent past had struggled on account of dismal performance in the preceding two quarters Foot Locker has lost 33 3  year to date  However  it has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 0 9  over the last 30 days  Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018  Be among the first to see our  The Mosaic Company s   NYSE MOS   acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes will help the company to capitalize on the rapidly growing Brazilian agricultural market  Mosaic should also benefit from its cost reduction measures and its efforts to boost production

 over the last 30 days  The stock has a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Western Union Co  s   NYSE WU   strategic investments in new products  services and technology are likely to pave the way for long term growth  Relentless focus on expansion of customer base and creation of digital infrastructure to boost the electronic channels business should also fuel growth Western Union has lost 12 2  year to date  However  it has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Moreover  it has expected earnings growth of 4 3  for the current year  Also  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 5 2  over the last 60 days Halliburton Company   NYSE HAL   reported strong third quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America  In fact  Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the oil industry to its advantage  mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less Halliburton has lost 11 2  year to date  However  it has a Zacks Rank  2  Moreover  expected earnings growth for the current year is more than 100   PPL Corporation   NYSE PPL   is poised to gain from its capital investment plan  which

   Factors to ConsiderMosaic expects higher realized prices of phosphate and potash in the second quarter  which are likely to improve the company s earnings  The company anticipates phosphates sales volumes in the band of 2 2 3 million tons for second quarter 2017 compared with 2 4 million tons for the same quarter in 2016  Average selling price  FOB plant  is expected to be in the range of  320  340 per ton  The segment gross margin rate is expected to be around 10   Potash sales volumes have been forecast in the range of 2 2 3 million tons for the second quarter  compared with 2 million tons in the prior year quarter  Average selling price  FOB plant  is expected in the band of  170 to  185 per ton and the gross margin rate is anticipated to be roughly in the low 20  range  Total sales volumes for the International Distribution segment are expected to range from 1 4 million 1 7 million tons for second quarter 2017  compared with 1 4 million tons in the prior year quarter  The segment gross margin is estimated to be around  20 per ton  Mosaic is gaining from its cost reduction measures  The company is also likely to benefit from its efforts to boost production capacity and acquisitions  Moreover  the company is expected to gain from improving global demand for fertilizers  Mosaic sees a more stable operating environment in 2017 and envisions higher demand for both phosphate and potash   However  Mosaic faces a challenging operating environment in the agriculture space  The company is also exposed to a difficult pricing environment which may continue to weigh on its margins  Mosaic has underperformed the  over the last three months  The company s shares have declined around 11 1  over this period  compared with roughly 2 8  gain recorded by the industry  Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mosaic is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below  Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Mosaic is currently  4 00  This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 24 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 25 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks Rank  Although Mosaic s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  Note that Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions  Stocks to Consider Here are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  The Chemours Company   NYSE CC   has an Earnings ESP of  4 44  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Westlake Chemical Corporation   NYSE WLK   has an Earnings ESP of  5 04  and a Zacks Rank  2  Endeavour Silver Corp    NYSE EXK   has an Earnings ESP of  100  and a Zacks Rank  3  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2017-07-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mosaic-(mos)-to-report-q2-earnings:-what's-in-the-cards-200204200,200204200
166974,388490,MOS, Mosaic Company  MOS  Down 12 7  Since Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS    Shares have lost about 12 7  in that time frame  underperforming the market 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers 
Mosaic s Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates in Q2Mosaic reported net income of  97 3 million or  0 28 per share in the second quarter of 2017  as against net loss of  10 2 million or  0 03 per share recorded a year ago Earnings  barring one time items  were  0 29 per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 25 The company s revenues rose roughly 4 8  year over year to  1 754 6 million in the reported quarter  The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 649 4 million  The company gained from strong global demand for phosphates and potash during the quarter 
Segment HighlightsRevenues from Mosaic s Phosphates segment were flat year over year at  975 million in the second quarter of 2017  as lower prices of finished products offset higher sales volume  The segment s gross margin declined to  76 million from  100 million a year ago  owing to higher ammonia costs and lower finished product selling prices  partly offset by reduced sulfur and phosphate rock costs Potash division s sales rose around 2 4  year over year to  468 million in the quarter  driven by higher sales volume  Gross margin in the quarter was  110 million compared with  53 million reported a year ago  The improvement was mainly driven by lower cost of production as a result of lower plant spending and higher operating rates   Revenues from the International Distribution segment went up around 9 2  year over year to  583 million owing to increased sales volumes  partly offset by lower selling prices  Gross margin was  39 million  compared with  5 million reported a year ago FinancialsMosaic s cash and cash equivalents amounted to  660 6 million as of Jun 30  2017  down around 37 6  year over year Long term debt rose to  3 799 7 million as of Jun 30  2017  from  3 772 6 million as of Jun 30  2016 Mosaic s capital expenditures were  169 million in the reported quarter Operating cash flow was  243 million in the quarter  down 58 4  from  584 million in the year ago quarter OutlookMosaic expects phosphates sales volumes in the band of 2 2 2 5 million tons for the third quarter of 2017 compared with 2 5 million tons for the same quarter in 2016  Average selling price  FOB plant  is expected to be in the range of  310  330 per ton  The segment gross margin rate is expected to be in the band of 7 9  Potash sales volumes have been forecast in the range of 1 9 2 2 million tons for the third quarter  compared with 2 2 million tons in the prior year quarter  Average selling price  FOB plant  is expected in the band of  165  180 per ton and the gross margin rate is anticipated to be in the band of 15 18  Total sales volumes for the International Distribution segment are expected to range from 2 3 2 6 million tons for the third quarter of 2017  compared with 2 2 million tons in the prior year quarter  The segment gross margin is estimated to be in the low  20 per ton range The company now expects phosphates sales volumes in the range of 9 5 to 10 million tons for 2017  narrowed from 9 5 to 10 25 million tons expected earlier  It has also narrowed its potash sales volumes guidance to the range of 8 1 to 8 6 million tons from 8 to 8 75 million tons expected earlier  Moreover  Mosaic now sees International Distribution sales volumes in the range of 6 75 to 7 25 million tons  down from prior view of 7 to 7 5 million tons

166975,388491,MOS,2 Stocks Bearing Fruit Amid Lingering Fertilizer Woes ,opinion,"The fertilizer industry is not out of the woods yet and remains buffeted by certain headwinds that continue to weigh on stocks in the space this year  Sustained pressure on crop commodity prices is scuppering a meaningful recovery The overall weak fertilizer industry fundamentals have kept investors away this year  Does that mean you should pluck the entire industry out of your portfolio If you look beyond the negatives  there are a few bright spots such as improving pricing and demand dynamics for potash  a major crop nutrient  and signs of stability in the farm economy      The  has underperformed the broader market year to date  While the industry has gained roughly 8 2   the S P 500 has returned around 11 9   
  Let s do a quick health check of the fertilizer industry by delving deeper into certain key factors Crop Commodity Pricing Still a DragThe prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies as it is hindering fertilizer usage by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on growers  income Prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  remain at their multi year lows as markets remain awash with grains  An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017  The U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  harvest outlook indicates another bumper year of production  The USDA  in its September report  raised its corn and soybean harvest forecasts for the 2017 18 crop year  It now sees corn production to be 14 184 billion bushels  up 32 million from its August forecast The USDA also predicts record soybean production of 4 431 billion bushels compared with its August view of 4 381 billion bushels  This is expected to aggravate the grain glut and restrict crop prices Has the Farm Economy Hit Bottom U S  farm income is expected to tick up this year after three straight years of decline due to low commodity prices  Per the USDA s August 2017 forecast  net U S  farm income is expected to go up 3 1  to  63 4 billion in 2017  This compares to the USDA s February 2017 forecast of an 8 7  decline to  62 3 billion  The upturn in profits will likely be driven by higher cash receipts from the sale of crop inventories However  despite the projected rise  net farm income would still be lower in 2017 than all the other years since 2010 and a far cry from the record  123 8 billion achieved in 2013 Nevertheless  the USDA s profit forecast for this year gives signs of stability in the farm economy and suggests that the sector may have finally hit the bottom  Higher anticipated farm income is expected to positively influence farmers  nutrient purchasing decisions Potash Prices on Recovery ModeThe potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows  Potash prices have recovered after feeling gravity s pull last year due to subdued demand for the nutrient  Most producers of the nutrient  including Potash Corp  of Saskatchewan Inc    NYSE POT    Agrium Inc    NYSE AGU   and The Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS   witnessed a spike in prices in the second quarter that drove their potash margins Potash Corp   a major producer of the nutrient  saw healthy demand for potash in the second quarter and expects consistent customer engagement through the balance of 2017  supported by healthy consumption trends With Canpotex contracts for the second half in place  the company sees strong consumption in China driven by higher crop acreage and nutrient affordability  The demand environment also remains healthy in Brazil  another important market Moreover  the government of India s move to cut the Goods and Services Tax  GST  rate on fertilizers from 12  to 5  is a welcome news for famers in that country  It also augurs well for potash demand in India  one of the world s top buyers of the nutrient  As such  higher demand from major consumers should drive up potash prices in the second half Picture Not So Good for Nitrogen   PhosphateHigher supply has contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment  Abundant nitrogen supply driven by new production capacity is expected to weigh on global prices in 2017  Additional nitrogen capacity including a significant increase in North America is expected to come online globally in the back half of the year Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices  Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is hurting prices  causing farmers to delay buying activities  As such  nitrogen margins of fertilizer producers remain thwarted by a weak pricing environment Excess capacity  outpacing demand  also continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed in the first two quarters of 2017  Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied in the second half  with incremental capacity from Saudi Arabia and Morocco  as noted by Agrium and Mosaic in their second quarter earnings calls   thereby putting pressure on prices  Weak prices are expected to continue to affect phosphates margins in third quarter 2017 2 Fertilizer Stocks Worth Betting OnDespite some positives  the fertilizer market is yet to rebound and there is continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term Nevertheless  the constant need of farmers to nourish their crops  replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing world support the bullish case for fertilizers Below we highlight two fertilizer stocks  armed with a solid Zacks Rank  that are worth considering for investment in the prevailing operating environment Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S A    NYSE SQM  Santiago  Chile based Sociedad Quimica is a solid choice armed with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see The company has an expected earnings growth of 52 2  for 2017  It also has a long term expected earnings per share growth rate of 32 5   The stock has also gained a whopping 100 5  year to date  significantly outperforming the Zacks Fertilizers industry s gain of 8 2  over the same period Annual estimates for Sociedad Quimica have also moved north over the past 60 days  reflecting analysts  confidence in the stock  Over this period  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 for the company s earnings has increased by around 11 8  and 24   respectively Intrepid Potash  Inc    NYSE IPI  Headquartered in Denver  CO  Intrepid Potash is another attractive pick with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   The company has an expected earnings growth of 73 8  for 2017  It also delivered positive earnings surprise of 50  in the last

earnings of 3 cents per share in fourth quarter 2016  down from 44 cents per share recorded a year ago  Earnings  barring one time items  were 26 cents per share that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors to ConsiderMosaic expects phosphates sales volumes in the band of 2 million to 2 3 million tons for first quarter 2017 versus 2 2 million tons for the same quarter in 2016  Average selling price  FOB plant  is expected to be in the range of  315  335 per ton  The segment gross margin rate is expected to be in the upper single digits Potash sales volumes have been forecast in the range of 2 15 million 2 3 million tons for the first quarter  compared with 1 5 million tons in the prior year quarter  Average selling price  FOB plant  is expected in the band of  165 to  180 per ton and the gross margin rate is anticipated to be roughly 20  Total sales volumes for the International Distribution segment are expected to range between 1 2 million 1 5 million tons for the first quarter  compared to 1 3 million tons in the prior year quarter  The segment gross margin is estimated to be around  20 per ton The company is a global leader in potash and remains committed to expand its annual potash production capacity  Mosaic is also gaining from its cost reduction measures  which is helping it to offset headwinds from depressed nutrient prices  The company remains on track with its  575 million cost cutting program  leading to an improvement in its operating cost structure Mosaic also sees improving global demand for nutrients  The company sees a more stable operating environment in 2017 and anticipates higher demand for both phosphate and potash The buyout of CF Industries  assets also expands Mosaic s phosphate business and production capacity of the nutrient in Florida  The acquisition will bring Mosaic s annual phosphates capacity to roughly 11 5 million tons  Moreover  the  2 5 billion buyout of Brazil based Vale S A  s Vale Fertilizantes business is expected to help the company to capitalize on the rapidly growing Brazilian agricultural market and improving business conditions  It is projected to generate more than  80 million of post tax synergies Mosaic has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over the past six months  The company s shares rallied around 16 7  over this period  compared with roughly 8 4  gain recorded by the industry However  Mosaic faces a challenging operating environment in the agriculture space  The company is also exposed to a difficult pricing environment which may continue to weigh on its margins Mosaic recently announced a production outage at its Esterhazy K2 potash mine in Saskatchewan  This incident is likely to reduce production by 200 000 300 000 tons  Although the production disruption is unlikely to impact first quarter potash results  the company expects a negative impact on its second quarter sales volumes Mosaic Company  The  Price and EPS Surprise    Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mosaic is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Mosaic is currently  10 53  This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at a loss of 17 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 19 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  Although Mosaic s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Note that Sell rated stocks   4 or 5

167031,388547,MOS,Mosaic  MOS  To Report Q3 Earnings  A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Mosaic   NYSE MOS   is set to release its third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Nov 1 
In the last quarter Mosaic reported a loss of  10 million or  0 03 per share  as against a profit of  391 million or  1 08 per share recorded a year ago  Earnings  barring one time items  were 6 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents 
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Mosaic  in its second quarter 2016 call  said that it expects potash prices to rise moderately in the back half of 2016  The company anticipates phosphates sales volumes in the band of 2 4 2 7 million tons for the third quarter of 2016 versus 2 million tons in third quarter 2015 
Average selling price for the third quarter is projected to be in the band of  310  340 per ton  The segment s gross margin for the quarter is expected to be roughly 10   while operating rate is estimated to be around 85  
Potash sales volumes have been projected in the range of 1 8 2 1 million tons for the third quarter versus 1 6 million tons a year ago  Average selling price for the quarter is expected in the range of  160  175 per ton  The segment s gross margin is expected to be in the mid single digits in the third quarter 
Mosaic is facing a challenging business environment in agriculture and there is a prevailing negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term  Depressed crop pricing has created an uncertainty on nutrient consumption 
Mosaic  like other fertilizer makers  is exposed to a still challenging pricing environment  Agricultural commodity prices in general remain weak  Moreover  potash prices remain under strain due to elevated supply  Global capacity expansion  lower farm income and a strong U S  dollar continue to exert pressure on fertilizer prices 
Further  Mosaic has idled its potash mine in Colonsay  Saskatchewan  The fertilizer maker took this action to meet customer demand amid challenging potash market conditions  Roughly 330 employees received temporary layoff notices as a result of this move  The Colonsay mine s proven production capacity is 2 6 million tons a year  Idling of the mine is part of Mosaic s actions to cut production to cope with lower global potash demand and prices  It will allow the company to meet its customers  needs and reduce production costs 
Mosaic should benefit from its efforts to boost production capacity and acquisitions  The company will also gain from improving global demand for fertilizers in second half 2016  The company sees a strong second half with improving global demand for the balance of the year  Potash demand is expected to rise with the signing of new contracts with Chinese customers that will trigger pent up demand from other major consumer markets including India MOSAIC CO THE Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model shows that Mosaic is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is the case here as you will see below

Nevertheless  Potash Corp  will benefit from expanded operational capability and improved demand for potash in the balance of 2016  The company expects strong customer engagement in fourth quarter 2016 and healthy demand in North America in the fall application season 

Potash Corp  and Agrium   NYSE AGU    in Sep 2016  agreed to combine their businesses to create a fertilizer giant with a pro forma enterprise value of  36 billion  The proposed merger would create the world s largest crop nutrient supplier and the integrated company will be better placed to counter the headwinds in the crop nutrient markets  The combined company is expected to generate as much as  500 million of annual operating synergies

167103,388619,MOS,2 Cheap Dividend Stocks Currently On Sale,opinion,"Mike Tyson once said   Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth  
Now  we may not be climbing into the ring with a professional boxer anytime soon  but the financial markets we tangle with on a daily basis also have an uncanny ability to surprise  inflict pain  and otherwise ruin our best laid plans 
The stock market decline in late August is a perfect example 
A wave of selling pressure culminated in a flash crash on August 24  Many traders and investors simply couldn t withstand the pain and sold into the panic 
However  those who were prepared were far better able to withstand the barrage   and having a healthy allocation of volatility dampening fixed income securities has certainly helped 
For instance  the Vanguard GNMA Fund  VFIIX   which I profiled in June 2014 has produced a nice and steady 3 8  total return since then  Meanwhile  the SPDR S P Dividend ETF  NYSE SDY  has limped to a 0 3  total return with erratic ups and downs 
Once again  dividend stocks aren t bond substitutes  Besides being properly diversified  your plan may also involve gradually reducing your fixed income allocation and increasing your equity exposure during times of market stress 
The question then becomes what stocks to buy 
Focus on Cash Flow
Investors should look for stocks that have become inexpensive  but still have strong underlying businesses generating healthy free cash flow  FCF  
Corning Inc   NYSE GLW   a specialty glass maker  and The Mosaic Company  NYSE MOS   which produces crop nutrients such as potash  are two prime examples 
These stocks have respectable dividend yields above 2 5   Plus  dividend payout increases and share buyback activity are indicative of management s confidence in ongoing FCF generation   and both stocks  total yields  dividend yield plus net share buybacks  are well above average 
Of course  we want to make sure that these buybacks are being conducted at low valuations and that the firms aren t becoming overly levered in order to distribute cash to shareholders 
As you can see in the table below  both companies have low enterprise value to EBITDA ratios  which are also at steep discounts to their 10 year averages  Their price to sales ratios are also well below their long term means 

Based on all these metrics  both Corning and Mosaic qualify as cheap dividend growers  And they re the kind of stocks we want to look to buy when everyone else is liquidating 
By being properly diversified and having a plan  we reduce the likelihood that we ll panic when the market  punches us in the mouth  
That s even more important  given that quantitative easing stimulus is over and global economic growth is slowing to a crawl  which means there are likely some vicious right crosses headed our way ",2015-09-16,Alan Gula,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-two-cheap-dividend-stocks-are-on-sale-265205,265205

167137,388653,MOS,Mark Lackey  What Happens To A Mine Deferred ,opinion,"The shuttering of huge copper and iron ore projects gives the Street the blues  but the resulting squeeze in supply can lead to explosive price hikes  Meanwhile  Mark Lackey  executive vice president of CHF Investor Relations  is eyeing infrastructure buildouts in China  Korea  Brazil and India that point to a swelling of demand  In this interview with The Mining Report  find out how Australian partnerships  the deepening of the Panama Canal and the South Korean Canada trade agreement could result in major returns on investment  and why 2014 looks like a bounce back year for potash 
The Mining Report  Mark  the price of copper recently dipped to its lowest level since 2010  Are we going to end the year below  3 pound   3 lb  
ML  We don t think so  We believe that the price of copper will actually recover as we progress through the year  In fact  we actually are still calling for the price of copper to trade in the  3 60 3 70 lb range by year end  We really haven t changed our view because if we look at supply and demand conditions  we think there s definitely been an overreaction to some of the recent Chinese economic data  Investors are losing sight of the fact that there are reasons for demand to pick up later in the year  and that the postponed production projects will impact the supply side 
TMR  Are weaker Chinese economic data the only reason behind this shortsightedness 
ML  It s certainly a major factor  It s seems that the export data in particular got the market concerned  because if you look at retail sales and industrial production  they ve been only a little bit weaker than analysts had expected  We re really talking about just two months of trade data here  so this is not necessarily a long term trend  We would also point out that the Russian situation with Crimea has caused some concerns about European growth 
TMR  In other words  prices will remain weak in the short term  but investors should be long copper 
ML  That s right  If you look at the new infrastructure programs planned in China  South Korea  India and Brazil  they all are scheduled to kick off this year  so we should start to see more spending later this year  That s one positive for copper 
Don t forget that China is by far the biggest consumer of copper in the world  and half the copper goes into the wire and cable business  which is growing at about 15 20  year  We see China ending up with one of the biggest and best electrical grids in the world  but this growth should go on for the next five or six years  So there is a fairly significant built in amount of copper consumption that s already in place  Whether the country grows at 8   7 5  or maybe 7  isn t nearly as relevant as some people think 
TMR  Most of the copper heavy miners have been sold off  What s happening with the juniors 
ML  Across the board  I d say most junior companies have lower share prices than they had three or four months ago  although some have gone sideways  You d be hard pressed to find a copper company  other than Augusta Resource Corporation  AMEX AZC  or an Orvana Minerals Corp   ORV TO   which were in takeovers  that s actually up 
TMR  What are some of the juniors you re following reasonably closely 
ML  We like NovaCopper Inc   AMEX NCQ   It has a significant play in Alaska  It was once part of Novagold Resources Inc   AMEX NG   which is a very well known gold company  and Novagold spun out its copper assets  which made sense because the market wasn t giving it really much value for the Upper Kobuk Mineral projects  which are some of the best copper projects in North America  What we like about NovaCopper  first of all  is that management knows the jurisdiction the Ambler district in northwest Alaska which is a very good jurisdiction  What s also appealing is that the Bornite deposit found in this area is a significant  high grade project that also hosts some zinc  lead  gold and silver credits  We like the management team since it has a proven track record in Alaska  We think it s a good way to play copper when the copper price recovers 
TMR  Does it have enough capital 
ML  Yes  they have millions of dollars 
TMR  It has an updated NI 43 101  right 
ML  That s right  On March 18  the company released an updated NI 43 101 compliant resource estimate for the Bornite deposit  The new result contains 5 7 billion oz copper  5 7 Boz copper  Inferred and 334 million pounds copper  334 Mlbs copper  Indicated  In just under three years  the company has increased the scale of the Bornite deposit six fold 
TMR  Can you share another name in that space 
ML  Freyja Resources Inc   FRA TSX V  is another one that we ve recently started following after it took over an excellent near term production project in Northern Mexico  Near term producers appeal to us because the market seems to prefer those over companies with earlier stage greenfield projects  Another positive factor about Freyja is that the management team has had two other companies in Northern Mexico that were quite successful  one in copper  one in silver  So the company knows the area very well  and it has a proven track record in the jurisdiction  Plus  Freyja has just been able to raise money in this market  which is positive because it hasn t been easy for small cap mining companies to acquire funds in the present market conditions  We see this as another very interesting play for investors who want leverage to a rising copper price 
TMR  One of the management team members you refer to is Alain Lambert  What do you know about him 
ML  Alain has been around Quebec business for a long time  He s been involved in quite a number of projects and is really well known  certainly in the Quebec financial community and is also known here in Toronto  I think he was an interesting choice to bring in to the operation because of his background and experience with capital markets 
TMR  You mentioned that Freyja is a near term producer  How near term 
ML  We would expect production later this year 
TMR  Moving on to iron ore  some market experts believe the steep drop in the price for iron ore in early March was based on poor economic data from China  while others believe it was largely caused by a speculative play gone wrong  likely at a Chinese brokerage  What s your perspective 
ML  First of all  some of the economic data in China in the past two months clearly affected the iron ore price  But there was also a slight buildup in inventories before the trade numbers came out  so there had already been a little bit of weakness in the market 
China also announced that it wants to shut down some small marginal steel plants that are not particularly positive for the environment  and that announcement got some analysts concerned about potentially less demand for iron ore  I think that concern is overblown  I expect bigger steel producers in China to make up for this modest drop in steel production  So we don t see a loss in demand for iron ore as a result of the consolidation that is taking place 
As far as a speculative play gone wrong  there have been a few rumors of that out there  It s hard to know if that s true  We would suggest that if it is true  it s one of those factors that is not going to have any significant impact on the medium or long term iron ore market 
TMR  What s your forecast range for iron prices over the course of 2014  Is it above  120 ton 
ML  We expect prices to get back above  120 ton  closer to the  125 130 ton range by the end of this year  Again  like copper  we do see this increase in infrastructure spending in China  South Korea  India and Brazil as a bullish signal for steel demand  We also expect China to produce over 20 million  20M  vehicles this year  so we see steel demand rising out of the consumer sector  Meanwhile  China is also trying to increase the quality of its steel  This generally means that there will be increased demand for iron ore  Finally  supply  which increased significantly last year  should level off this year since Australia is producing at close to full capacity given the infrastructure constraints currently being experienced in the country 
TMR  Big iron miners  like Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   produce iron at  30 ton or even  20 ton at some operations  but smaller miners generally have much higher production costs  Midtier producer  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc  NYSE CLF   is already experiencing a shareholder revolt over poor share price performance  What does all this mean for investors in this space 
ML  It s true that Rio Tinto does have some production in that cost range  If you looked around the world  the cost production for the majority of iron ore mines is considerably higher  Some Chinese production has costs of around  100 ton  So the question becomes  will companies produce at a small profit  or will they take some of that iron ore out of the market  Our expectation is that the Chinese will take some of those smaller inefficient mines out of operation 
TMR  What are some of the companies you re keeping an eye on  Mark 
ML  One of the ones we like is Champion Iron Mines Limited  CHM TO   which has operations in the Labrador Trough  It s well run  It s also just recently done a deal with Mamba Minerals Ltd   MAB ASX   an Australian company  We like this deal and recommend that shareholders agree to it  We think bringing in Michael O Keeffe and his people  as well as increased access to capital helps to derisk the projects  because now Champion Iron Mines has a major player behind it with a proven track record in Australia s iron ore business  From our vantage point  we think this merger really is a positive situation for Champion and its shareholders 
TMR  Does Mamba bring enough cash to cover the capital expenditures  capex  
ML  Certainly  Mamba brings enough money to move the projects to the next stage  Ultimately  any company that is going to develop these mines is going to need more cash down the road  but once you have the Australians involved  the chances of getting offtake agreements with Chinese and Indian stakeholders goes up significantly  The problem for some of the Labrador Trough players  frankly  is that they don t have any big strategic partner  We re only following companies that have these partners  So this merger has made Champion a much more viable option 
TMR  Any other names on that list 
ML  We like Century Iron Mines Corporation  FER TO   Of course  Century is also an exploration and development company of iron ore projects in the Labrador Trough and Western Quebec  Century s management team  led by CEO Sandy Chim  has a background in the Labrador Trough  as it developed Consolidated Thompson Iron Ore Mines Ltd   which was ultimately taken over  That was one of the big developments that took place in the Labrador Trough  Century has a winning formula relative to most of the junior iron ore developers  The company is focusing on the production of Direct Shipping Ore  DSO   which has relatively low technical risk  does not require a large capex  and has a fast development time  Century is therefore a near term producer  which appeals to us  In addition  Century has two key strategic partners in Wuhan Iron and Steel Co  Ltd  and MinMetals Resources Ltd   which are large state owned Chinese companies  These corporations have the financial and technical resources to assist Century with the funding and technical expertise for the development and exploration of its projects 
On a more general note  there are a number of factors that look good for the Labrador Trough  including the fact that the deepening of the Panama Canal will be finished by the end of the year  This will allow larger ships to leave Quebec and then go through the Panama Canal  thus cutting time and costs  The other recent development is the South Korean Canada free trade agreement  which is actually very positive for Canadian iron ore producers because it eliminates the iron ore tariff  Canadian iron ore companies have a competitive disadvantage vis   vis some other producers who already had these trade agreements with the South Koreans 
TMR  Let s move from metals to minerals and potash  Like most mined commodities  potash had a turbulent 2013  What do investors need to know about what s happening in the potash space in 2014 
ML  The basic underlying supply demand scenario has not changed  In fact  we continue to see less arable land in the world per capita every year  As a consequence  there is a need for higher crop yields  and thus a continually growing market and demand for potash  particularly the muriate of potash  MOP   which is 90  of the potash market  We believe that potash prices actually will start to recover this year  There is also some other positive news on the demand side  It looks like this will be the best soybean planting season in Brazil in history  and it looks like a strong year in the Midwestern U S  Plus there s been less potash used in the last few years in India  and you cannot go more than a couple of years if you want to continue to have enough nutrients in your fields  So we see this as a bounce back year for potash and the MOP market as we go through the year 
TMR  One of the interesting names in the potash space right now is Western Potash Corp   WPX TO   There seems to be something of a bit of a bidding war on for it  What do you know about what s happening there 
ML  Western is not one that we follow  but we ve also heard through the grapevine that people tend to look at Western and Potash Ridge Corporation  PRK TO  as potential takeover candidates  We always try to take things with a bit of a grain of a salt  no pun intended 
Potash Ridge Corp  has a potential mine in Utah with its Blawn Mountain Project  What makes it special is that it is in the sulphate of potash  SOP  market  as opposed to the MOP market  The SOP market represents only 10  of the world s current potash production  SOP is a vital nutrient for high value crops such as nuts  fruits and vegetables and is essential in nourishing crops and strengthening and aiding disease resistance  SOP performs well with crops that have a low tolerance to the chloride in MOP and in saline arid  and heavily cultivated soils  Thus  there is a growing market for SOP  which trades at about  600 ton as opposed to  305 ton for MOP  There are very few SOP companies around  so we think that Potash Ridge  with its SOP project in a very good jurisdiction  is an interesting opportunity for investors 
TMR  So Potash Ridge is one  GreenStar Agricultural Corporation  GRE V  
ML  GreenStar is not actually a potash play  but is in the agricultural sector  The company is currently trading around  1 share and it pays a 6  dividend  The company has a low price earnings ratio  which is quite unique among small cap resource based companies  GreenStar produces various canned products oranges  peaches and its biggest product  tomato paste  This is a growing market  The company had record agricultural shipments in 2013 and in the last five years has seen revenue and EBITDA both raise four fold 
With its recent takeover of Beichen Tomato Products Co   GreenStar will produce about four times as much tomato paste in the next year as it does now  Given the drought in California and the fact that tomatoes are fairly water intensive to grow  it looks like there s going to be some rationing of water in the agricultural system in California this year  This means that some farmers are not going to produce the same amount of tomatoes that they produced in 2013  We see GreenStar attaining a very large increase in revenue and earnings over the next few years 
TMR  Can you share one more agricultural name with us 
ML  Karnalyte Resources Inc   KRN TO  is developing a major project in Saskatchewan that initially could produce 625 000 tonnes of potash per year and increase this to 2 125 million tonnes per year  We like the management  as they have considerable experience in the potash industry  Karnalyte is also a possible takeover candidate because it s one of the few midcap companies in the space  which will make it attractive to some of these bigger potash players  like Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan  NYSE POT   Agrium Inc  NYSE AGU  and Mosaic Company  NYSE MOS   We also think it s very interesting that Karnalyte has a magnesium byproduct  which is actually in short supply in the world these days 95  of it is produced in China  This is an interesting company because it has a fairly low capital expenditure project with low operating costs and a byproduct that could have a fairly significant impact on its bottom line 
TMR  What are your parting thoughts for us 
ML  Don t overreact to every data point that comes out of China such that your medium  or long term view of the world changes  Clearly  one has to recognize that there are going to be ups and downs in the commodity markets  I would suggest we re still in a long run bull market for commodities because at least 4 billion people in the world are trying to become middle class  whereas in the 1970s  it only took about 400M people to create enough demand to give us a very strong commodity cycle  Finally  in many commodities like copper and iron ore  we re seeing more and more deferred projects  So over the next five years  there is not going to be the supply that some people may anticipate  If you have no exposure to equities in the commodity markets  then you could very well miss an excellent opportunity over the next couple of years to enhance your portfolio return 
TMR  Thanks for joining us today
