1843,223358,DGICA,Is Donegal Group  DGICA  A Suitable Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Donegal Group  Inc    NASDAQ DGICA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks P E RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Donegal has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 27  as you can see in the chart below Again  this level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 50  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DGICA s current PE level puts it almost on par with its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks categorized  industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 35  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers However  we should also point out that Donegal has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 25 69  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Donegal has a P S ratio of about 0 48  This is lower than the industry average  which comes in at 3 18 right now If anything  DGICA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Donegal currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This is because some of its other key metrics are favorable For example  the price cash flow ratio  P CF  for DGICA is 6 35  a level that is lower than the industry average of 9 79  The P CF ratio ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business  Additionally  it s P B ratio  used to compare a stock s market value to its book value  stands at 0 93  lower than the industry average of 1 30  Clearly  DGICA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall There are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  c  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives DGICA a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging as both the current quarter and year have seen no upward estimate revision in the past 30 days compared to one downward As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower from 24 cents per share to a loss of 7 cents in the past one month  while the full year estimate has dropped by 34 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Donegal Group  Inc  Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineDonegal is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 10  out of 265 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past six months  the Zacks Insurance   Property And Casualty industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiments  estimates and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana  Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just

1844,223359,DGICA,Insurance Stocks  Q2 Earnings On Jul 25  CB  WRB  RNR  AWH,opinion,"The second quarter earnings season is gathering pace with 19  members of the S P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far  Per the latest   total earnings for 97 index members  accounting for 28 1  of index s total market capitalization  that have reported financial numbers  have increased 8 4  on 5 1  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 78 4  companies surpassing bottom line expectations and 72 2  outperforming top line estimates The Finance sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has delivered a strong performance so far  53 3  of the sector s total market cap in the S P 500 index that have revealed quarterly results shows 7 2  earnings growth on 5 4  increase in revenues  both on a year over year basis  The beat ratio of 81 1  for the bottom line and 66 7  for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S P 500   The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses  which will weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers  Per Aon Benfield  the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc   NYSE AON    catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at  53 billion in the first half of 2017   Few insurers have estimated to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events occurred during April and May in the U S Horace Mann Educators Corp    NYSE HMN   estimated between  31 million and  34 million  hurting the bottom line by 49 53 cents  While Donegal Group Inc    NASDAQ DGICA   estimates a catastrophe loss of about  20 1 million and sees loss between 7 and 9 cents per share Nonetheless  prudent underwriting standards should have helped insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion that has built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment  Net investment income  a major component of an insurer s top line  has witnessed improvement  albeit far lower than the historical highs  The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates  reflecting their confidence in the improving economic conditions  The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters  An improving rate environment not only aided an increase in Net investment income but has also improved investment yields Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates  Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates  Nonetheless  life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest sensitive product lines Also  improving economy means more disposable income and better consumer sentiment  This in turn  is likely to have supported more policy writings  driving premiums higher  which contribute a lion s share in an insurers  top line On the flip side  we do not expect pricings to have been strong  To write new business and retain renewals  insurers have been easing pricing  leading to soft pricing   Commercial property  workers  compensation and general liability were the once mostly experiencing soft pricing Nonetheless  core business growth  geographic expansion  strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have benefited insurers This week will see more than 800

its quarterly investment income run rate to remain in the range of  830  840 million  However  escalating expenses might weigh on margin expansion while exposure to catastrophe loss likely has induced
