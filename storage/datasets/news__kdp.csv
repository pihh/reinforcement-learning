 If it was all about money  we d do it all in Mexico   said Vashaw   When your main cost driver just went up 8 percent and in Mexico it didn t go up at all  it just makes any foreign confectionary supplier more cost competitive  That s why a lot of companies moved out of the United States  ",2017-06-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mexico-sugar-deal-hard-to-swallow-for-last-u.s.-candy-cane-maker-493634,493634

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 8  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of beverages such as 7Up  Sunkist and Mott s is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 86 billion  up 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Keurig Dr Pepper 
For Keurig Dr Pepper  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Keurig Dr Pepper will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Keurig Dr Pepper would post earnings of  0 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 25  delivering a surprise of  8 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Keurig Dr Pepper due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Keurig Dr Pepper Q1 Earnings Beat  Sales SoftKeurig Dr Pepper reported first quarter 2019 results  wherein earnings beat estimates while sales missed  Further  the company s top line declined year over year due to adverse effects of changes made in its Allied Brands portfolio and negative comparisons due to a calendar shift this year  However  earnings improved due to higher operating income and lowered debt  The company also reiterated its guidance for 2019 Quarterly HighlightsAdjusted earnings per share of 25 cents improved 32  year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents  This improvement was aided by higher adjusted operating income and considerable decline in interest expenses due to reduced indebtedness and unwinding of several interest rate swap contracts  Further  a lower tax rate benefited the bottom line Notably  the company reduced debt by  414 million in the first quarter  driven by strong operating performance and effective working capital management Net sales of  2 504 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 545 million and declined 1 1  from adjusted pro forma net sales of  2 533 million  including the merger adjustments  in the year ago quarter  This decline was attributed to adverse effects of changes made to its Allied Brands portfolio as well as negative comparisons due to a calendar shift this year  including the shift of Easter into the second quarter of 2019 and one less shipping day in the first quarter of this year  This growth was partly negated by underlying net sales increase of 2 5  Underlying net sales was aided by 1 4  growth in volume mix and 1 1  net price realization  offset by 2 5  adverse effects from changes in Allied Brands portfolio  0 6  impact of calendar shift and 0 5  negative currency translations  However  net sales more than doubled  up 164   from the year ago quarter s reported net sales of  948 million mainly due to the benefits of the merger During the first quarter  the company benefited from strong retail market performance measured by IRI  Keurig Dr Pepper witnessed dollar consumption growth across the majority of its portfolio and KDP holding  with market share gains across all categories  Market share growth in its CSD premium unflavored still water  RTD coffee and shelf stable apple juice portfolios were backed by strength in Dr Pepper and Canada Dry CSD brands  CORE waters  Peet s and Forto RTD coffees  and Mott s apple juice  Further  retail consumption for the single serve pods manufactured by KDP rose almost in line with category unit growth of 5  Adjusted operating income grew 10 5  year over year to  621 million  driven by strong productivity and merger synergies that leveraged costs of goods sold and SG A expenses  Nevertheless  this was partly offset by inflation  particularly in packaging and logistics  Moreover  adjusted operating margin expanded 260 basis points  bps  to 24 8  Segmental DetailsRevenues for the Beverage Concentrates segment rose 4 8  year over year to  304 million from adjusted pro forma net sales of  290 million in the year ago quarter  Net revenues primarily benefited from a 7 1  increase in price realizations  partly negated by a 2  decline in volume mix and 0 3  currency headwinds Sales for the Packaged Beverage segment were  1 12 billion  down 5 3  from adjusted pro forma net sales of  1 18 billion in the year ago quarter  This decline mainly resulted from a 5 4  impact of changes in the Allied Brands portfolio  1 2  impact of calendar shift and 0 1  adverse currency effects  This was  however  slightly offset by underlying sales growth of 1 4   which reflected a 2 3  increase in prices  offset by a 0 9  decline in volume mix Revenues from the Latin America Beverage segment improved 2 7  to  116 million from adjusted pro forma net sales of  113 million in the prior year quarter  Gains from 4 1  rise in price realization and 1  volume mix growth were partly offset by 2 4  unfavorable currency effects The Coffee Systems segment s sales increased 1 7  to  968 million from adjusted pro forma net sales of  952 million in the year ago quarter  This increase was backed by improved volume mix  offset by lower pricing and unfavorable currency  Volume mix grew 5   benefiting from a 7  increase in K Cup pod volume and 12 4  rise in brewer volume  offset by lower pod sales mix due to rise in volumes of branded partners in the first quarter FinancialsKeurig Dr Pepper ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  85 million as of Mar 31  2019  compared with  83 million as of Dec 31  2018  Long term obligations totaled  13 246 million and total stockholders  equity was  22 674 million  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled nearly  591 million as of Mar 31  2019 OutlookKeurig Dr Pepper reiterated its guidance for 2019  The company continues to anticipate adjusted earnings per share growth of 15 17  in 2019  which is in line with the long term target for the 2018 2021 period set at the time of the merger  This brings the company s adjusted earnings per share guidance to  1 20  1 22 for 2019 The earnings view for 2019 is supported by net sales growth of about 2   which is also in line with Keurig Dr Pepper s long term sales growth target of 2 3   Further  it anticipates capturing merger synergies of nearly  200 million in 2019  consistent with the long term target of capturing  200 million synergies every year between 2019 and 2021 Other net expenses are projected to be  30 million in 2019  Adjusted net interest expenses are likely to be  570  590 million  driven by ongoing efforts to lower debt and benefits from the unwinding of interest swap contracts  Adjusted effective tax is expected to be 25 25 5   with outstanding shares estimated at 1 420 million Additionally  the company expects significant cash flow generation and rapid deleveraging  targeting a leverage ratio of less than 3 0 in two to three years from the closing of the merger in July 2018

156258,377774,KDP,What Makes Keurig Dr Pepper  KDP  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Keurig Dr Pepper  NYSE KDP  could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Keurig Dr Pepper is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Keurig Dr Pepper  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Keurig Dr Pepper
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this maker of beverages such as 7Up  Sunkist and Mott s is expected to earn  1 22 per share  which is a change of 17 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Keurig Dr Pepper  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 2  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

156286,377802,KDP,Why Is Keurig Dr Pepper  KDP  Up 11 2  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Keurig Dr Pepper  NYSE KDP   Shares have added about 11 2  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Keurig Dr Pepper due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Keurig Dr Pepper Q4 Earnings In Line  View SoftKeurig Dr Pepper Inc  reported fourth quarter 2018 results  wherein earnings matched estimates while sales missed  The sales lag was caused by decline in sales for the coffee systems business mainly due to lower volume for coffee brewers  However  the company s top and bottom lines improved year over year due to gains from the merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper in July  Additionally  the company witnessed strong in market gains as well as market share growth for carbonated soft drinks  CSD   single serve coffee and other categories  which helped it reach target for 2018  Nonetheless  the company provided a lower than expected earnings view for 2019 Quarterly HighlightsAdjusted earnings per share of 30 cents improved 25  year over year and were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The improvement was aided by an increase in adjusted pro forma operating income and considerable decline in interest expenses due to reduced indebtedness and unwinding of several interest rate swap contracts Notably  the company repaid about  940 million of bank debt after the closing of the merger  driven by strong operating performance as well as effective working capital management Net sales of  2 813 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 852 million but more than doubled  up 140 4   from the year ago quarter figure of  1 170 million  The solid year over year improvement was attributed to benefits of the merger  Pro forma net sales improved 0 5  on the back of 2 7  growth in volume mix  offset by 1 8  adverse effects from changes in Allied Brands portfolio in the Packaged Beverages segment and 0 4  impacts from currency headwinds During the fourth quarter  the company also benefited from strong retail market performance measured by IRI  It reported market share gains in both units and dollars for its CSD portfolio  backed by strength in Dr Pepper and Canada Dry brands  Further  its coffee portfolio gathered market share in units and dollars  driven by share gains for pods produced by Keurig Dr Pepper Adjusted pro forma operating income grew 12 9  year over year to  720 million  driven by solid sales growth  strong productivity  reduced SG A expenses and lower marketing costs  offset by higher input and logistics costs  Additionally  negative comparison from  21 million gain on Bai recorded in the year ago quarter impacted operating income  Moreover  adjusted operating margin expanded 280 basis points  bps  to 25 6  Segmental DetailsRevenues for the Beverage Concentrates segment rose 4 8  year over year to  352 million  backed by higher realized prices and favorable volume mix  offset by unfavorable currency rates Sales for the Packaged Beverage segment were  1 18 billion  up 0 1  from the year ago quarter  The increase reflected from volume mix gains and increased price realization  partly offset by negative effects of the changes in Allied Brands portfolio and currency translations Revenues from the Latin America Beverage segment improved 1 7  to  120 million  driven by higher price realization and volume mix growth  offset by unfavorable currency The Coffee Systems segment s sales dipped 0 5  to  1 16 billion from  1 17 billion in the year ago quarter  The decline stemmed from lower pricing as well as adverse currency effects  partly compensated by volume mix growth  Volume mix grew 2 9   benefiting from increase in K Cup pod volume  offset by lower volume for brewers due to shipment timing between the third and fourth quarters of 2018  and the discontinuation of certain legacy Keurig brewer models  However  recently launched innovation products are witnessing favorable trends in the market FinancialsKeurig Dr Pepper ended 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of  83 million as of Dec 31  2018  compared with  90 million as of Dec 31  2017  Long term obligations totaled  14 201 million and stockholders  equity was  22 533 million  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled nearly  1 613 million as of Dec 31  2018 OutlookDespite a strong end to 2018  Keurig Dr Pepper expects the operating environment to be more challenging in 2019  Consequently  the company expects adjusted earnings per share of  1 20  1 22  or 15 17  growth  in 2019  which is below analyst expectations Nonetheless  management pointed out that the earnings growth forecast of 15 17  was in line with the long term target for the 2018 2021 period  which was set out at the time of the merger The earnings view for 2019 is supported by net sales growth of about 2   which is also in line with the company s long term sales growth target of 2 3   Further  it anticipates capturing merger synergies of nearly  200 million in 2019  consistent with the long term target of capturing  200 million synergies every year between 2019 and 2021 Other non operating income expense is projected to be  30 million in 2019  Adjusted net interest expense is likely to be  570  590 million  driven by ongoing efforts to lower debt and benefits from the unwinding of interest swap contracts  Adjusted effective tax is expected to be 25 25 5   with outstanding shares estimated at 1 420 million Additionally  the company expects significant cash flow generation and rapid deleveraging  targeting a leverage ratio of less than 3 0 in two to three years from the closing of the merger in July 2018

156310,377826,KDP,Earnings Preview  Keurig Dr Pepper  KDP  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Keurig Dr Pepper  NYSE KDP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 28  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of beverages such as 7Up  Sunkist and Mott s is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  74 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 85 billion  up 73 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Keurig Dr Pepper 
For Keurig Dr Pepper  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Keurig Dr Pepper will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Keurig Dr Pepper would post earnings of  0 27 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 30  delivering a surprise of  11 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

Let s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly release and see if this food and beverage company can maintain positive earnings surprise streak Buyouts   Other Efforts to Build BrandsMondelez is always keen on expanding its business through acquisitions  In July 2018  the company completed the buyout of 13 8  ownership in the Keurig Dr Pepper  NYSE KDP  business  Prior to this  in June 2018  Mondelez concluded the buyout of Tate s Bake Shop  Tate s is one of the fastest growing biscuit brands in the United States and complements Mondelez s portfolio  In fact  during the third quarter  Tate s Bake Shop contributed significantly toward the top line   Also  in 2018  the company teamed up with Post Consumer Brands  a business unit of Post Holdings   NYSE POST    to create two new cookie inspired breakfast cereals  Further  acquisitions of LU biscuit business and Cadbury are highly significant for Mondelez  as these buyouts helped it expand internationally  The

company believes that e commerce  its fastest growing platform  can generate  1 billion annual revenues by 2020  We note that such efficient brand building efforts combined with effective pricing strategies are aiding volume growth across major market regions and product categories  These efforts are likely to boost the company s performance in the fourth quarter Mondelez International  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Savings Efforts to Fuel Bottom LineMondelez is taking major steps to enhance productivity savings to boost margins  cash flow and returns on invested capital  Such savings initiatives were a fundamental aspect driving profits in the third quarter of 2018  Additionally  the company is gaining from higher cocoa cost  Moreover  the company continues to strike the right balance between volume and profit through disciplined pricing  Backed by such upsides  the company expects adjusted operating margin to be 17  in 2018  up almost 70 basis points from 2017 s tally  Further  it anticipates double digit growth in currency neutral adjusted earnings per share in 2018 Such aspects boost our expectations regarding a sturdy bottom line performance in the impending quarter  Incidentally  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings  which is currently pegged at 63 cents per share  reflects a rise of almost 10 5  from the prior year quarter s reported figure  Further  the current estimate has been stable in the past 30 days Weak Business Regions   Currency Woes LingerOperational challenges are limiting Mondelez s North America business unit  This weighed upon the region s volumes and revenues in the third quarter of 2018  Although the company is working toward uplifting the region s performance by investing in improved systems and expansion of capabilities  a turnaround is likely to take time  Moreover  the quarter continued to witness weaknesses in Brazil  thanks to price gaps  Also  management anticipates negative impacts from currency fluctuations in 2018  Such headwinds are likely to impede top line growth in the upcoming quarterly result  In fact  the consensus mark for revenues for the fourth quarter  which is

156636,378152,KDP,Should ConAgra  CAG  Stock Be Part Of Your Portfolio Now  ,opinion,"On Nov 14  2016  Zacks Investment Research downgraded ConAgra Foods  Inc    NYSE CAG   to a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  from a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Going by the Zacks model  companies with a Zacks Rank  3 are likely to perform in line with the broader market over the next few quarters 
Existing Scenario
On Nov 10  2016  ConAgra successfully divested its Lamb Weston business arm on the wake of becoming a high performing flexible organization  In order to capture the growing market demand for frozen potato products  the company has been undertaking various measures to reinforce its Lamb Weston trade 
For instance  the company s  200 million Lamb Weston Richmond facility investment and the Lamb Weston Meijer deal inked with Belaya Dacha  in Jun 2016  are expected to boost revenues going ahead  Notably  higher revenues and lower expenses are estimated to bolster the company s margin growth trajectory in the quarters ahead  In addition to this  ConAgra s latest acquisitions are likely to drive both the top and bottom lines over the long term 
Despite the above mentioned bullish aspects  we believe that ConAgra s growth prospects might be partially offset due to certain headwinds 
The Zacks Rank  3 stock conducts its business in a highly competitive market  Stiff industry rivalry not only exposes the company to risks of margin loss  but also compels it to incur lofty research   development projects  We even notice that the appreciating U S  currency has been weighing over the company s international sales and increasing the competitive power of its smaller rivals in low cost nations CONAGRA BRANDS Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank  3 stock has been revised downward for both fiscal 2017 and 2018  Share price of the company was  34 93 per share as of Nov 11  2016 
Stocks to Consider

Sanderson Farms  Inc    NASDAQ SAFM   currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has an average positive earnings surprise of 25 01  over the four trailing quarters  You can see

156681,378197,KDP,Why We Should Avoid ATM And ITM Put Strikes In Bear Markets,opinion," Selling cash secured puts is the exact same strategy as covered call writing   We hear that over and over except that it s not  These two strategies have the same risk reward profiles and that is why the claim is made so frequently  On page 214 of my book  Selling Cash Secured Puts  I highlight a comparison chart showing similarities and differences between the two strategies  In this article  I will add another distinction as it relates to position management in a bear market environment and specifically when our underlying security is declining in value  A declining stock is not our friend whether we are selling calls or puts 
How to we manage a declining underlying security 
All exit strategies start the same way we buy back the option  In covered call writing  we have a series of  next steps  based on several parameters including overall market assessment  chart technicals and time frame within a contract  When selling puts and our 3  guideline is reached  we generally use the cash freed up by closing the original short position to secure another put on a better performing underlying  It s the cost to close our short positions that will underscore another contrast between the two strategies 
Delta and option premiums
Delta is the amount an option premium value will change when share price moves up or down by  1 00  It is the likelihood a strike price will end up in the money by expiration  Since the moneyness of calls and puts are inversely related  option premiums take different roads when share prices declines call value moves down while put value accelerates  therefore  the cost to close a short position will be greater for puts than for calls

On 2 19 2016  Dr  Pepper Snapple Group  NYSE DPS  was trading at  90 01  right at a strike price and perfect for our analysis  Here is a screenshot of the options chain highlighting the  90 00 and  95 00 strikes for the March 18  2016 1 month expirations 

This is also a great learning tool because there is an ex dividend date projected prior to contract expiration  This will reduce the call value and increase the put value but the call seller  share owner  will capture the  0 48 dividend  Without the ex date  the two premiums are expected to be quite close  The call seller will generate the bid premium of  1 85 plus the dividend of  0 48 for a total credit of  2 33  The put seller generates a bid premium of  2 25  The initial returns on both calculate to a 2 6  1 month  initial return 
What if share price declines  5 00 to  85 00 
The  90 00 call strike moves deep out of the money causing option value to decline  The current  95 00 call strike   5 00 out of the money  shows an  ask  premium of  0 50  much lower than the premium generated from the original call sale  As share value declines the cost to buy back the call option becomes less expensive  Of course  we must keep an eye on the debit created by share devaluation 
The  90 00 put strike moves deep in the money causing the premium value to accelerate substantially  The current  95 00 put strike   5 00 in the money  shows an  ask  premium of  6 80  much higher than the premium generated from the original put sale  As share price declines  the cost to buy back the put option gets more expensive 
Closing our positions when share price is  85 00 for covered call writing
Let s assume the  ask  prices are in play when we close  We have a share loss of  5 01 and an option and dividend credit of  2 33   1 85    0 48   This nets to a debit of  3 17 on a cost basis of  90 01   a loss of 3 5   This assumes no position management along the way  something that would never happen to us right 
Closing our positions when share price is  85 00 for put selling
We have an option debit of  4 55   6 80    2 25  on a cost basis of  87 75   90 00    2 25    5 2   almost 50  worse than the covered call writing scenario  share value decline should also be factored in   This assumes no position management along the way  something that would never happen to us right 
Discussion
In bear markets  we must be aware of the fact that the cost to buy back a put option on a declining stock will be more expensive than closing a short call  This does not eliminate put selling from our arsenal in bear markets but does highlight the need to use deeper out of the money puts for downside protection  In addition  we must be diligent about employing our 3  guideline and not allow share value to decline to the extent discussed in this article  In this scenario  we would have closed our short put when share value reached  87 30  cutting our losses approximately in half  We also must have a higher cash reserve to buy back options when share value decreases after selling puts 
Market tone
I am devoting this week s market tone segment entirely to Brexit 
On Thursday the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union  EU   The UK is the world s fifth largest economy representing 3  of the world s economy  This decision was unexpected by most experts  The vote itself is not a binding decision and the full impact may not be clear for a few years  The results will be incorporated into an Act of Parliament in the UK which will be passed on to the EU  This will take place in a few months which is why Prime Minister Cameron has announced that he will resign in October so a new prime minister can take the lead from there  This will then start a two year process of negotiating the UK exit from the EU  Suffice it to say that the period of uncertainty will last longer than a few days or even weeks or months 
Much of the concern relates to the favorable trade agreements the UK currently has with the EU which will change in context  the UK s sovereign credit rating being downgraded and how changes in UK s immigration policy will impact the job market in the EU nobody knows for sure  Despite all the experts weighing in  and I don t consider myself an expert in this area   as always  half will be right and half will be wrong  Remember  these are the same folks who predicted a  stay vote 
There is also concern of a domino effect with other countries currently in the EU expressing similar dissatisfaction with the globalization of their economies and politics 
When markets have days like we had on Friday or huge up days after unexpected positive news  we know from past history that the  real stock market  lies somewhere in between the two  So from all the ugliness that we experienced on Friday were there any positives to be gleaned 
To start  the central banks made it clear that they would work together to suppress volatility and provide liquidity to the financial institutions  A rate cut by the Bank of England in July is more likely and a rate increase by the US Federal Reserve has now become extremely unlikely for this calendar year  Friday s market action was surely nothing to smile about but it could have been a lot worse and perhaps certain buying opportunities were created  Even in bearish and volatile markets there are always best performers and it is our job to find them  For example  from our latest Premium Member ETF Report dated 6 22 2016  here are five exchange traded funds results from yesterday s market decline 
VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX    5 91 
VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners  NYSE GDXJ    4 98 
Utilities Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLU    0 56 
iShares Silver  NYSE SLV    2 43 
iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond  NYSE TLT    2 68 
From there  how we enter our positions can be crafted to an uncertain market environment  using in the money calls  out of the money puts  low implied volatility ETFs  low beta stocks to name a few approaches   Not all investors are comfortable trading in volatile and uncertain markets and only you can make that decision but if we do  let s do it smart  non emotional and base our decisions on sound fundamental  technical and common sense principles  Many corporations are run by brilliant and experienced board members who seem to find ways to readjust and flourish even in challenging environments  My expectation is that Brexit will not be an exception to this observation just one man s opinion 
For the week  the S P 500 declined by 1 64  for a year to date return of    0 32  
Summary
IBD  Uptrend under pressure
GMI  5 6  Buy signal since market close of May 25th  published prior to Brexit vote 
BCI  Not entering new positions or investing unused cash until the dust settles from the Brexit vote  Any new positions taken will be defensive in nature 
WHAT THE BROAD MARKET INDICATORS  S P 500 AND VIX  ARE TELLING US
The charts are demonstrating signs of a bearish short term outlook although this 100  due to the Brexit vote  In the past six months the S P 500 is flat and the VIX has increased by 65  to 25 76  I like to see the VIX under 20 ",2016-06-26,Dr. Alan Ellman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-we-should-avoid-atm-and-itm-put-strikes-in-bear-markets--a-discussi-200138210,200138210
