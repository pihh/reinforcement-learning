1671,223186,DSG,Is Now The Time To Buy Canada  ,opinion,"A recent  report indicated that the Bank of Canada is confused as to why Canadian exports aren t picking up 
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz called the persistent weakness in Canada s non energy exports  puzzling  in the central bank s latest assessment of the economy  And a former colleague of the central bank governor at Export Development Canada  EDC  is confused by the shortcoming in exports as well 

 We can attribute some of this  But a bunch of it we can t   Governor Stephen Poloz told reporters in the question and answer session that followed the Bank of Canada s second rate cut of the year 
After crude oil and natural gas  Canada s largest exports to the U S  include vehicles  machinery  and plastics 
Peter Hall  vice president and chief economist of Export Development Canada  says the lower loonie is only an effective stimulant to the export economy when it coincides with a groundswell of demand from our neighbours to the south  The problem  he explains  is that groundswell hasn t materialized despite a bevy of strong U S  economic indicators 
 They ve got job growth  They ve got real income growth  They re confident again  They ve reorganized their debts  and they have lower gas pump prices that are giving them  100 billion extra to spend  Put that all together  They should be spending  What are they doing  They re saving at the moment  They re as nervous as everybody else about the wiggles in the economy after six years of flat performance   said Hall  who worked alongside Poloz at EDC for nine years 

Here is the reasoning  The Canadian economy is reasonably well diversified between the resource producing regions and the industrial heartland  When commodity prices boom  the resource provinces benefit and the CAD USD exchange rate rises  When they retreat  the exchange rate falls  which makes the manufacturing centres more competitive  which raises exports to Canada s largest trading partner  the United States 
This time  the BoC is puzzled as to why manufacturing exports aren t rising  In a separate report  the  quotes BoC governor Stephen Poloz as being puzzled 
Canada s non resource exports have  faltered  of late and remain  a puzzle that merits further study   according to central bank Governor Stephen Poloz  One thing is clear  however  Canada s share of U S  goods imports has eroded over the past four decades   Notably  the U S  now imports roughly equal dollar amounts of goods from Mexico and Canada  versus 10 years ago when they brought in  1 70  U S   from Canada for every  1 from Mexico   Robert Kavcic  senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns  said in a note 

Canadian market share of US imports

Faltering competitiveness
I addressed this issue in a post in early June  see Uh oh Canada    The competitiveness of Canadian manufacturing has markedly deteriorated between 2004 and 2014  A  showed that the cost structure of Canadian manufacturing is behind that of its NAFTA partners  the US and Mexico  The Canadian dollar  or loonie  would have to fall to between 0 72 and 0 78 before it starts to become competitive with these other countries 

Since I wrote that blog post  CADUSD has fallen to below 0 78 

Canadian equities have fallen as well  The chart below depicts the S P TSX Composite  priced in CAD  in the top panel and the iShares MSCI Canada ETF  NYSE EWC  priced in USD   The TSX is holding at a key support zone  but a look at the USD denominated ETF shows that it has violated support 

So  what now  Should you buy Canada 
Hollowed out manufacturing
If the question is whether you should buy the Canadian equity market  the answer is an emphatic no  In the past  the manufacturing heartland of Ontario and Quebec were populated by lots of manufacturers that would benefit from a falling exchange rate  So I took a look at the components of the TSX Composite to see what non resource exporting companies might benefit from a falling loonie  note that this is only a list and does not constitute a recommendation to buy any of these stocks   What I came up with is a rather sad list 
Amaya Gaming Group  Amaya Inc  TO AYA 
Avigilon Corp  TO AVO 
Bombardier Inc  TO BBDb 
BRP Inc  TO DOO 
Descarte Systems Group  TO DSG 
Enghouse Systems Ltd  TO ESL 
Gildan Activewear  TO GIL 
Intertain Group  TO IT 
Intertape Polymer Group  TO ITP 
Magna International  TO MG 
Martinrea International  TO MRE 
Open Text Company  TO OTC 
I may have left out one or two  but this is an extremely small list and some of those stocks are not very liquid  The two large caps on that list are Bombardier  aircraft manufacturing  and Magna  auto parts   The rest are mainly software service providers with a global customer base  Is that all that s left of Canadian manufacturing 
I deliberately left out companies that are unlikely to significantly benefit from a falling loonie because their costs are not in Canadian dollars  such as Thomson Reuters  whose operations are not really located in Canada  Restaurant Brands International  which operates Burger King and Tim Hortons  and Lululemon  which produces its products mainly in Asia 
The remainder of the TSX Composite are resource companies  energy and mining   REITs and financials and consumer products and retailers serving the Canadian market  Both of the latter are vulnerable should the Canadian economy roll over into recession as it seems to be doing 
Given current macro conditions  why on earth would anyone want to buy Canadian equities 
As for the loonie  I have estimated the equilibrium rate at between 0 72 and 0 78  However  we know that markets overshoot equilibrium  I would therefore be not surprised to see the loonie trade at 0 65 or even lower before the current adjustment period is over 
Even though I live here  my inner investor continues to prefer US over Canadian assets as much as possible
