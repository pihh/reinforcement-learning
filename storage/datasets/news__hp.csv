14933,236448,HP,Helmerich   Payne  HP  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s Up ,opinion,"Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP   is scheduled to release fiscal third quarter 2019 results on Jul 25  before the opening bell  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is a profit of 35 cents per share on revenues of  683 million 
In the last reported quarter  the Tulsa  OK based contract driller  the consensus mark by 73 68  on better than expected revenues from the U S  Land business  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the drilling rig provider has a good record  having met gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports  This is depicted in the graph below Helmerich   Payne  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the company can surpass earnings estimates this time around as well  However  our model indicates that Helmerich   Payne might not beat on earnings in the to be reported quarter 
Which Way Are Top and Bottom Line Estimates Headed 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third quarter earnings has been downwardly revised by a penny in the past 30 days to 35 cents per share  Nonetheless  it indicates an impressive turnaround from the year ago reported loss of a penny per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  683 million  suggesting an improvement from  649 million reported in the prior year quarter 
Factors at Play
Oilfield service provider Helmerich   Payne s U S  Land segment  which accounts for about 83  of revenues  is likely to post improved y y results in the to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from its largest segment   U S  Land   is pegged at  577 million  higher than nearly  537 million recorded in the year ago quarter 
Helmerich   Payne s technologically advanced FlexRigs are much in demand and command strong daily rate margins  which bode well for the segment s profits in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average rig margin per day at the U S  Land unit is pegged at  11 390 compared with  8 760 in the prior year quarter 
While the firm is likely to gain from higher y y contribution from the U S Land unit  weaker results from Offshore and International Land segments may limit overall results  
Fiscal third quarter revenues for International Land and Offshore segments are estimated at  46 83 million and  36 13 million  respectively  lower than and  63 million  37 67 million  respectively  in the year ago period  Declining rig margins in International Land and Offshore units remain a concern  and may dent the firm s overall earnings to some extent 
What Our Model Says
Our proven model does not conclusively predict that Helmerich   Payne will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter to be reported  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  4 29  
Zacks Rank  Helmerich   Payne currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which increases the predictive power of ESP  But we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of a positive surprise 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Helmerich   Payne  here are some companies from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarterly reports 
Cenovus Energy   TSX CVE   has an Earnings ESP of  5 80  and a Zacks Rank  3  The firm is expected to release second quarter earnings on Jul 25  You can see

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL   DAL   Newmont Goldcorp  NEM  and FirstEnergy  FE   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Delta s shares have outperformed the Zacks Airline industry in the past six months  18 2  vs  2 5    The Zacks analyst thinks that this was mainly due to upbeat passenger revenues backed by robust demand for air travel 
Evidently  passenger revenues  which account for the bulk of the company s top line  increased 7  in the first half of 2019  For the current year  Delta anticipates its top line to grow in the 6 7  band on account of strong passenger revenues  In July  Delta s board cleared a dividend hike of 15  to 40 25 cents per share 
Initiatives to reduce debts are an added positive  However  rising operating expenses are limiting bottom line growth  Increase in operating expenses is mainly because of high non fuel unit costs  Technological glitches and weather related issues can also hurt profitability 
 You can  
Shares of Newmont have gained 5 3  in the past three months  underperforming the Zacks Mining   Gold industry s rise of 16   The Zacks analyst believes that the company is making notable progress with its growth projects  It is likely to gain from a number of projects including the Tanami Expansion  Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion 
The company also remains committed to reduce debt and improve efficiency  Moreover  the merger with Goldcorp is expected to be value accretive to the company s cash flow and generate significant synergies 
Also  higher gold prices will likely support the company s earnings in 2019  It faces headwinds from high production costs on a year over year basis  Lack of growth in the company s gold reserves is another concern

recently featured in the blog include  Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc    NYSE DO    Noble Corp  plc   NYSE NE    Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP    Independence Contract Drilling  Inc    NYSE ICD   and Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog Drilling Industry Continues to Suffer  Is Relief in Sight The drilling industry has witnessed a significant downfall in the last few quarters  With WTI Crude price struggling to stay above the  60 per barrel mark for a sustained period  drilling companies are experiencing a slow pace of recovery  This lean period forced drillers to cut costs to a bare minimum  and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil and gas  Impressively  they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques  While this has improved profit levels to an extent  the sentiment around the industry still remains mostly negative Industry Performance Let s take a look at the price performance of the oil and gas drilling industry  In the past year  the S P 500 Index has improved 2 3  against the oil and gas energy sector s 23  slump  During this period  the  plunged a whopping 55 7   Moreover  the industry currently ranks in the bottom 26  of the Zacks Industry Rank Headwinds Plaguing the IndustryExplorers and producers kick started 2019 with a conservative capital budget as they witnessed massive crude downturn during the fourth quarter of 2018  Moreover  explorers are more bothered about bottom line growth   being forced by investors following years of dull returns   than oil and gas production  Hence  conservative spending by upstream companies is likely to hurt demand for drilling services Environmental groups are pushing politicians to take necessary regulatory steps to reduce hydrocarbon consumption  Recently  the United States House of Representatives passed two bills  which ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in the Pacific and Atlantic coasts  Several environmental groups are lobbying the United States Senate to follow suit  Notably  in Europe  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar pledged to phase out oil exploration in the country s territorial waters Low oil price  triggered by a dampening global demand outlook and oversupplied market  had kept a lid on upstream projects  Especially in the offshore drilling scenario  low crude prices delayed final investment decisions for several major projects  Decreasing cost of production   attributed to operating efficiency gain   is helping the industry to recover but slowly  The situation had led to lower revenues for many offshore drillers including Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc   Noble Corp  plc and others  While Diamond Offshore s revenues decreased for eight consecutive years  we saw Noble Corp  s top line decline seven times in the last decade Downward Estimate RevisionsDue to the reasons stated above  the drilling industry has witnessed negative earnings estimate revisions by brokers  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 and 2020 has been revised downward Weakness in the drilling industry is haunting the companies that are part of it  including Helmerich   Payne  Inc   Independence Contract Drilling  Inc  and others  Both these companies currently have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  You can see  ConclusionThe players in the drilling industry are now focusing more on cost reduction  technological improvements and efficiency gains  Major drillers are cold stacking their relatively older rigs and pushing forward high end ones to boost margins  Companies like Transocean Ltd   given technologically advanced and versatile drilling fleet  are leading the course of the industry  Systematic and strategic plan of action can drive long term growth for the drillers Looking

14965,236480,HP,What s In Store For Helmerich   Payne  HP  In Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on Friday Nov 15  before the opening bell The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is pegged at earnings of 25 cents on revenues of  654 2 million Highlights of Q3 Earnings   Surprise History  In the last reported quarter  Helmerich   Payne delivered comprehensive earnings beat on the back of better than expected revenues from the U S  Land business  the company s largest segment The company posted adjusted quarterly earnings of 40 cents a share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents and also reversing the year ago adjusted loss of a penny Moreover  operating revenues of  688 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  683 million and increased 6  from the year ago level as well As far as earnings surprises are concerned  this oil and gas well drilling company s beat streak sustained through all the trailing four quarters  the average being 26 96   This is depicted in the graph below Helmerich   Payne  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Let s delve into the factors that might have influenced the company s performance in the to be reported quarter Factors at PlayDue to minimal activity  this oilfield service provider s U S  Land segment  accounting for about 83  of revenues  is likely to have posted lower year over year revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues from U S  Land  the company s largest segment  is pegged at  541 million  indicating a decline from  587 million reported in the year ago quarter However  Helmerich   Payne s technologically advanced FlexRigs is much in demand and command strong daily rate margins  This  in turn  bodes well for the segmental profits in the upcoming quarterly results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average rig margin per day at the U S  Land unit stands at  10 710  suggesting growth from  10 340 reported in the prior year Even though we anticipate that the U S  Land segment s revenues might have declined in the quarter to be reported  Helmerich   Payne s high in demand technologically advanced FlexRigs is likely to have boosted the segment s operating income  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the U S  Land Operating segment is pegged at  72 million  implying a 10 7  increase from  65 million reported in the year earlier quarter While the company is expected to have gained from solid year over year contribution from the U S Land unit  weaker sales from Offshore and International Land segments might have dented its overall results The Zacks Consensus Estimate for International Land and Offshore segments  revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at  49 16 million and  37 98 million  respectively  indicating a decrease from  59 million and  38 48 million  each  reported a year ago  Declining rig margins in International Land and Offshore units remain a concern and might partly affect the company s overall earnings figures in the impending quarterly release Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Helmerich   Payne this season  The combination of a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  increases the chances of a positive suprise  But this is not the case here Earnings ESP  Helmerich   Payne has an Earnings ESP of  6 12   representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Helmerich   Payne currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies worth considering from the same space  Per our model  these have the right combination of elements to surpass estimates in the upcoming quarterly reports Canopy Growth Corporation   NYSE CGC   has an

With that said  I ll now turn the call over to John Lindsay John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Dave  and good morning  everyone 2019 was a challenging year for the industry overall  but it is during these seasons when our industry comes together to create stronger partnerships and embrace new ways of thinking and innovation  This is what we re experiencing  and it contributes to our results Today we will share some additional context about how H P s leadership position and performance  both of which continue to improve because of the Company s ability to simultaneously deliver incremental value for customers  adapt to increasingly difficult market conditions and advance the future of automation and drilling  This quarter s results reflect the momentum of shared successes with customers and the Company s ability to remain agile and focused on results from our customers and for H P stakeholders I m going to begin talking about our experience with what we are seeing exploration and production companies  value drivers  Our customers are looking for every opportunity to invest optimally  They are seeking the best partner with the best expertise and experience that can transcend today s challenging market environment  We strive to align ourselves with the customers  objective to enhance economic returns through better performance and technology  We are working hard to put this shared focus and decision making at the forefront of all of our partnerships  Our strategy is focused on strengthening all of our current customer relationships and building more along the way We believe technology and automation will be the catalyst for value creation in upstream oil and gas operations  There is power and predictability through reliable and repeatable performance provided by process excellence and automation  and we are seeing that pay off for H P and for our customers  This concerted effort will continue to set us apart  and I believe it s one of the reasons why we are gaining traction We see significant value capture opportunities resulting from our autonomous drilling platform  For our customers  maturing basins and normalize well cycle times are drawing more attention to the advantages that wellbore quality delivers  Our automation solutions  specifically AutoSlide  which is automated sliding while directional drilling  have numerous points of differentiation from competing services in the market today  The primary and most customer centric differentiation is that our AutoSlide algorithms are tuned with wellbore economics and each customer s value drivers in mind  Specifically  these algorithms optimize the trade off between drilling days  time in the hydrocarbon zone and wellbore tortuosity  As the industry continues to migrate to factory like drilling  economically focused automation will be the key enabler What we have found is this predictability allows for optimization of other key drivers that positively impact the total life of the well  Examples are optimizing completions and providing an opportunity to push the envelope on new methods and techniques that ultimately lead to production increases and lower costs associated with completions  In addition to creating value for our customers through improved well economics  our technologies reduce the environmental impacts of drilling operations by creating more precise and safer ways to maximize extraction  thus unlocking even more value with a smaller environmental footprint and as we de man at the rig site  fewer exposures at the rig and driving back and forth to the rig Since 2017  we ve made several digital technology acquisitions and have added significant expertise to our team to complete our digital technology strategy roadmap  The first step of that strategy is wellbore quality and economically focused automation with AutoSlide  and we plan to launch more levels of our autonomous platform during 2020  We believe we have the expertise and capabilities today to take the next step for our industry without further acquisitions  The power of process automation that drives predictability is paramount for the future of oil and gas Last year we introduced the need for new commercial models  where we are focused on creating a win win value capture for our customers and for H P s stakeholders  Given our customers  focus on spending within budgets  optimizing investment and value  we are continuing to develop new pricing solutions to reflect the growing partnership between H P and our customers  These solutions reinforce that approach  enabling us to share in an equitable portion of the value we are delivering Last quarter we announced that new commercial contracts made up approximately 10  of our contract mix during the first fiscal quarter  Although today we have approximately 15  of our active FlexRig fleet contracted under non traditional day rate contracts  the majority of which are performance based contracts  As Mark will discuss in more detail in his remarks  these performance based contracts align H P s performance and compensation with the customers  goals and provide for a commensurate distribution of the incremental value creation We are seeing momentum across our primary drilling business segments  As the US Land rig count fell during 2019  H P s market share grew from approximately 22  to over 24   indicating a growing preference for super spec rigs and the performance these rigs deliver relative to legacy SCR rigs and lower performing AC rigs  Along with market share gains  our quarter end rig count was sequentially higher than the previous quarter s ending rig count  We believe capital discipline by our customers will remain a prevailing theme  and we expect industry activity to look similar to the average level experienced during the second half of calendar 2019  which implies a modest increase from current levels As drilling performance continues to improve  a significant portion of these gains are attributable to the added capabilities and efficiencies from super spec capacity rigs  A knock on effect of this progress are higher daily maintenance costs and higher capital costs related to the third mud pump  7500 psi capacity  multi well pad capability and more horsepower requirements but that trade off is well worth it Our experience shows that over a three year trend that super spec capacity FlexRigs can drill 15  to 20  more footage than non super spec rigs  Moreover  a super spec FlexRig incorporates a number of enhancements that improve safety for employees and reduce the environmental impact at a drilling location  That said  in order to reflect continued efficiency and value gains for E Ps  revenues for rig services that provide optimized drilling solutions need to increase to cover the cost of increased maintenance and supply and capital costs as well as returns that our shareholders demand Mark will address the details of pricing more completely in his prepared remarks  but pricing remains firm for FlexRigs in US Land  And why shouldn t it  Super spec utilization is strong  especially in the most active basins  and the rigs are delivering high levels of performance and value for customers Before shifting to our International segment  another success during 2019 for H P was growing our partnerships with the major oil and gas companies  We ve grown our FlexRig fleet market share to 16  from 6  at the beginning of 2019  and we believe the Company is best positioned to continue to grow our partnerships with the majors and IOCs  So let s shift to our International segment This quarter also proved to be positive for our business outside of the US  We remain optimistic about the opportunities we re seeing in the Middle East  and we were pleased to put a rig back to work in Colombia  Our rigs in the Middle East are now fully utilized and prospects for further growth in this region are encouraging and would likely result in the exporting of additional FlexRig drilling rigs from the US to satisfy any demand As we hear about unconventional resource plays in the Middle East and South America  our experience  our expertise and our technologies will continue to put us in a great position to grow in the future So in closing  financial discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet are hallmarks of the Company and set us apart from many industry peers  H P has paid a cash dividend to shareholders since 1960  and last year we increased the annualized dividend per share for the 48th consecutive year In thinking about culture and how that can fit a company apart in an industry  we are in the midst of a momentous year at H P  2020 is our centennial year  and we are using some of this time to reflect on our history  But primarily  we re looking at our path forward  In keeping with this milestone  we will remain focused on maintaining our position as the industry s most trusted partner in drilling productivity and technological innovation  Our people have always been dedicated to helping our business through the ups and downs of our industry  and we know that our employees  combined with our rig fleet and technology solutions  are the key to our continued long term success And now I ll turn the call over to Mark Smith Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  John Today  I will review our fiscal first quarter 2020 operating results  provide guidance for the second quarter  update full fiscal year 2020 guidance as appropriate and comment on our financial position Let us start with highlights for the recently completed first quarter  The Company generated quarterly revenues of  615 million versus  649 million in the previous quarter  The quarterly decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the average number of rigs working in the US Land segment  as expected Total operating cost incurred were  401 million for the first quarter versus  432 million for the previous quarter  The decrease is primarily attributable to the aforementioned activity decline  General and administrative expenses totaled  50 million for the first quarter  in line with our expectations Our Q1 effective tax rate was approximately 32   which is slightly higher than our guided range due to a discrete tax expense Summarizing the overall results of this quarter  H P incurred a profit of  0 27 per diluted share versus earning a profit of  0 37 in the previous quarter  First quarter earnings per share were positively impacted by a net  0 14 per share of select items as highlighted in our press release  Absent the select items  adjusted diluted earnings per share were  0 13 in the first quarter versus an adjusted  0 38 during the fourth fiscal quarter Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 were  46 million  This amount is under our implied guided run rate due to the timing of various projects Turning to our four segments  beginning with the US Land segment We exited the first fiscal quarter with 195 contracted rigs  which was  as John mentioned  the first time since calendar year 2018 that we ve seen a sequential increase in activity  H P increased its US Land market share to 24  by quarter end due to the continued sidelining of less capable legacy rigs in the industry  As John discussed  we expect to see a modest increase in rig count during the second fiscal quarter  Pricing remained firm in the super spec market space during the first fiscal quarter  Our average rig revenue per day  excluding early termination revenue  increased to  25 397 for the quarter  which was slightly above our guidance  As a reminder from our November call  this figure excludes our FlexApp offerings  which are now included in our H P Technologies segment Helmerich   Payne s average pricing per day varies from basin to basin due to both underlying hydrocarbon economics and competitive rig supply dynamics  Further  as John stated  our pricing is differentiated due to the unique value we deliver our customers as evidenced by our leading market share  In addition to the dynamics specific to each market  pricing variations are also driven by other variables  including term coverage and customer concentration  Our current pricing remains in the low mid 20s with an overall average around  23 000 per day  As a reminder  flex services including trucking  casing running  rental equipment  etc  are additive to day rate and are included in revenue per day of  25 397 As John discussed  our performance contracts are gaining ground as a larger portion of the fleet is shifting to this commercial model  As H P provides value to our customers such as by reducing their overall well spread costs  then H P participates in that savings creation  These performance contracts are now generating approximately  500 per day more in margin than our average day rate model margins produce The average adjusted rig expense per day increased to  14 987  This is above our previously guided range  primarily due to higher than expected self insured medical expenses incurred in the fourth calendar quarter  which is the final quarter of the medical plan year Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2020 for US Land  We exited the first quarter with 195 rigs working  and currently we have 197 rigs  turning to the right  Customer conversations lead us to believe there will be a decrease of approximately 10  in capex spend in calendar 2020 compared to calendar 2019 levels  This implies that the number of wells drilled in 2020 would decline by 2 300 from the 16 400 wells drilled during calendar year 2019  an approximate 14  decrease To close some of this gap  we would expect to see a modest accretion to the exiting rig count at calendar year end  With that caveat  we are also anticipating that our customers will spend budgeted rig capex in a more even rate throughout this calendar year  Given that  we expect to exit the second quarter with between 193 and 203 active rigs  This would result in a modest sequential increase in the quarterly number of revenue days which translates to an average rig count of approximately 196 rigs during the second quarter As the market tightens and as opportunities to displace legacy rigs arise  our initial objective is to put the 45 idle super spec rigs we currently have back to work  Also  we still have 44 FlexRigs that are upgradable to super spec when and if market conditions warrant that investment Compared to the first quarter at  25 397 per day  we expect the adjusted average rig revenue per day to be within a range from  25 000 to  25 500  Our average day rate in both the spot and term markets remains in the low to mid 20s range and leading edge super spec FlexRig pricing is also at that same level  The average rig expense per day is expected to be in a range of  14 650 to  15 150 for the second quarter  While our overall rig count has stabilized  we will continue to incur costs to recommission idle rigs and or stack our active rigs due to ordinary rig churn across basins  The per day cost here can vary considerably depending on the type of rig and the market dynamics in the basins where the activity is occurring  We will also continue to incur costs associated with maintaining the idle portion of our fleet At the start of this fiscal year  we elected to set up a wholly owned insurance captive to ensure the deductibles for our workers compensation  general liability and automobile liability insurance programs from October 1  2019 forward  Our operating segments pay monthly premiums to the captive for the estimated losses based on external actuarial analysis  The result is a transfer of risk from our operating subsidiaries to the captive for the deductibles  which is our self insurance retention  We do not expect any significant changes in our ongoing segment per day expenses as a result of this shift The insurance premiums are included in the operating segment expenses and are included in inter segment sales in the other non reportable segment  These intercompany premium revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation  The actuarial estimated underwriting expense for the three months ended December 31 was approximately  8 5 million and it was recorded within the other operating expenses line item in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations We had an average of 129 active rigs under term contracts during the first fiscal quarter  and today that number remains at 129 or about 65  of our 197 working rigs  We expect to have an average of 126 rigs under term contract in the fiscal second quarter and earning the current average day rates  103 rigs currently remain under term contract through the last three quarters of fiscal 2020 Regarding our International Land segment  the number of quarterly revenue days was relatively flat in the first fiscal quarter  slightly above our guidance  The adjusted average rig margin per day in the segment increased by  1 731 to  7 208 in the first fiscal quarter  The increase was primarily due to lower than anticipated costs associated with some of our rigs in Argentina  among other factors As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal 2020 for International  quarterly revenue days are expected to decrease approximately 7  with an average second quarter rig count of approximately 16 to 17 active rigs in the segment  We have been successful in redeploying all five of the rigs we currently have in the Middle East  And while these additions have not been incremental to our International rig count  they have served to mitigate the rigs that have rolled off contract in Argentina  We remain optimistic that there will be opportunities in Argentina to put rigs back to work  However  the timing is uncertain The average rig margin is expected to decrease to a range of  6 000 to  7 000 per day during the second fiscal quarter  as decreasing start up cost in the Middle East are more than offset by the impact of idling Argentina rigs rolling off of their five year NOC contracts  Additionally  we incurred unplanned maintenance expenses during the start up of phase of putting an idle rig back to work in Colombia Turning to our Offshore Operations segment  We average six platform rigs working in the first fiscal quarter  We exited the quarter with six contracted rigs  However  one rig has since been released and demobilized  The average rig margin per day increased sequentially due to the unexpected maintenance downtime incurred in the previous quarter As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal 2020 for the Offshore segment  we currently have five of our eight offshore rigs contracted  One of those five rigs is in the shipyard as it transitions from one Gulf of Mexico customer to another  and this is expected to recommence drilling operations in late March  The average rig margin per day is expected to decrease to a range of  10 000 to  11 000 during the second quarter due to the reduced activity Finally  looking at our H P Technologies segment  HPT revenues were largely in line with our expectations  HPT operating income was approximately  2 million when excluding research and development cost of  6 million  We are expecting Q2 revenue for HPT to be between  16 million to  19 million inclusive of FlexApps As our teams leverage recent successes  we expect continued growth in customer adoption during a stable to modestly increasing rig count environment  In December 2019  we closed on the sale of TerraVici Drilling Solutions Inc   resulting in a gain on sale of approximately  15 million  As a reminder  we wrote off the intangibles related to TerraVici in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 Now let me look forward on corporate items for the second fiscal quarter and the remainder of the fiscal year At December year end and as of today s call  our revenue backlog from our US Land segment was roughly  900 million for rigs under term contract with early termination provisions Capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2020 year are still expected to range between  275 million to  300 million based on our current outlook for fiscal 2020  which  as a reminder  is approximately a 40  reduction to fiscal 2019 capex  We expended  46 million in the first quarter  which is less than the implied quarterly run rate of our guidance due to timing differences of procurement activities and project progression  As we mentioned in the press release  asset sales are primarily customer reimbursement for the replacement value of drill pipe that is damaged or lost in hole during drilling operations  These sales offset a large portion of our tubular purchase bucket of capex Our previously communicated expectations for full fiscal 2020 general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  depreciation and effective tax rates are unchanged Now looking at our financial position  Helmerich   Payne had cash and short term investments of approximately  412 million at December 31 versus  401 million at September 31  2019  We earned cash flow from operations of approximately  112 million in fiscal Q1  The sequential decrease in cash flow was due to several convergent factors  including reduced activity  annual payment of accrued short term incentive compensation plan  seasonal holiday slowdown in receivable collections and the payment of the legal settlement that was accrued and disclosed in the previous quarter  We expect cash flows from operations to be higher in the remaining quarters of our fiscal year Our debt to capital at quarter end was 11   which is a continued best in class measurement among our peer group  A reminder  we have no debt maturing until 2025  Our expectations for the remainder of fiscal 2020 include operating activity levels and pricing to generate sufficient free cash flow to cover our selling  general and administrative expenses  debt service costs  planned capital expenditures  and current dividend  while modestly accreting our cash on hand  Our balance sheet strength  liquidity level and term contract backlog provide H P the flexibility to adapt to market conditions  take advantage of attractive opportunities and maintain our long practice of returning capital to shareholders through our dividend That concludes our prepared comments for the first fiscal quarter  Let me now turn the call over to Nikki for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  I will take our first question from Jacob Lundberg from Credit Suisse  Your line is open Jacob Lundberg    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey  good morning  guys John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Jacob Lundberg    Credit Suisse    AnalystJust to start off  I wanted to drill down on the performance based contracts that you mentioned  Could you just help us think about how quickly that mix can grow as a percent of your total work  You had a nice increase in fiscal 1Q  Do you anticipate that to continue  And then anything you could provide in terms of your desired mix of traditional versus performance base would be helpful John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Jacob  this is John  It s hard to know for sure how we can impact the mix  What I do feel positive about is that we are taking a customer centric approach to these new commercial models where every customer obviously looks at things  looks at cost  looks at their particular program a little bit differently  So we re trying to align it with what their drivers are  Most of these contracts have been performance based contracts So there is a true win win for both the customer and H P in this case  So our hope is that we ll be able to continue to do more of that  One way to think about it is  most of the rigs that have the potential of entering into these types of contracts are generally in the spot market rigs as opposed to those that are already under term contract  But  again  I think there is an opportunity for us to do more  As you said  we had a nice improvement  Our sales force continues to adapt to this  We ve made lots of investments in the organization to create the infrastructure that we need to manage these types of contracts  So  again  our hope is to continue to grow it As far as the total mix  again  that s hard to say as well  But I suspect that as we get more mature and our customers see the benefits we ll be able to enter into more of those Jacob Lundberg    Credit Suisse    AnalystAnd do you have a desired ultimate mix  Would you go pure performance based if the market was there  Or would you like to maintain some portion of the fleet still on the traditional structure John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I think Mark had mentioned it in his remarks that our average revenue is higher on our performance based contracts  Obviously  we re taking some associated risk when you do that  Again  it s hard to say what kind of a mix in terms of total  But we re definitely interested in doing more  I think the likelihood    the reality of it  at least anytime soon  to have the whole fleet on performance or some other type of commercial model besides day rate probably isn t achievable  realistically Jacob Lundberg    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  And then a follow up  if I could  staying on the performance based contracts  Could you just talk about the spreads  So  if on average you re seeing  500 a day more on the performance based contracts  what does that spread look like  Presumably  there are some jobs that don t go your way  And maybe it s even a negative impact  I would imagine there are some where it s significantly more positive than  500  Maybe what does that spread look like  And then over time  where do you think you can bring that total average incremental day rate on those contracts John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  That s a tough one  You are accurate in that we re not going to achieve    if you re talking about performance contract  you re not going to achieve it every time  Obviously  the goal is to    at the end of the day    to be able to have a higher revenue than what we would achieve with a day rate contract  So we re still in the early stages  even though we ve been at this for a year  Our industry in some respects moves pretty slow on things like this I really want to stress that it is a partnership with our customer  You re only going to be able to have these sorts of arrangements types of contracts with customers that you have a pretty good relationship with  and are able to get in and negotiate something that again is a true win win for both parties Jacob Lundberg    Credit Suisse    AnalystDo you think it would be fair to say that over time there is an ability to increase to  500 number  though John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerI would sure hope so  I mean  we have examples where it s several thousand dollars  Obviously  you do have those that don t work at your way for one reason or another  But again  we re an organization that has a lot of data  a lot of information I think that we can continue to help our customers drill wells more effectively Jacob Lundberg    Credit Suisse    AnalystAll right  I appreciate it  Great quarter  guys  Thank you John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorWe ll take our next question from Tommy Moll from Stephens  Inc  Your line is open Tommy Moll    Stephens Inc     AnalystGood morning  and thanks for taking my questions John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Tommy Tommy Moll    Stephens Inc     AnalystSo  I wanted to start on H P Technologies  specifically AutoSlide  which it looks like is now in six basins  In an environment    in a macro environment  as you indicated you expect for this year  so maybe slight uptick in rig count but continued capital discipline among customers  how do you feel about the adoption going forward for AutoSlide  Is it still    are we still in the early days where the adoption rates slow  Or do you feel like we re getting closer to an inflection point John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Tommy  I think we have had a nice improvement in adoption since our since September 30  Our AutoSlide rig count is at 15 today  I think we were around seven  So we ve more than doubled since September 30  So we ve had some nice adoption  There is  I think  in some respects  because of capital discipline and    there are some adverse effects I think that you end up dealing with on the adoption side  And then the other side  it s just    as we ve said before  it s a pretty significant change in workflow at the rig side  so there is a real need for change management But over the last several months  we ve obviously achieved a lot of success in  as you said  we re on the six basins today that are most of the most active basins  and we re having some success  so we are getting some adoption  So our expectation is that we continue to grow  We d love to be able to lay out for you what our ultimate    what would be an eighth  Phonetic  successive quarter  but so much of that really depends on how quickly customers can adapt to the AutoSlide situation in that we are changing the workflow and we are de manning in most cases  I think 60  or 70  of the AutoSlide jobs we have today are fully de manned as far as the directional driller not being on the rig  which is a great thing  It s a great thing for the customer  It s a great thing for the industry because of the reliability piece  less exposure  but it is disruptive Tommy Moll    Stephens Inc     AnalystThank you  John  And just sticking with the technology theme  You mentioned in your remarks that there could be more announcements coming in 2020 on the autonomous drilling theme  I expect we ll have to wait for some press releases to get the full details on any of those  But could you give us  even just high level  some of the different pieces of the drilling process that you think are ripe for disruption with some autonomous solutions John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerI think what I d prefer to do  Tommy  is wait and roll out with greater clarity than what I d be able to give you right now  But the fact is there are still some highly    or some things that are done at the rig site that are highly people oriented  obviously  and there is a lot of variability in the performance because of the human interaction  And there are things that are ripe for automation  ripe for developing algorithms to replace that into at a more factory like outcome So  there will be more to come on that  I wish I could tell you exactly when that is  But I think in the next quarter or two  we ll be able to have another commercial announcement that we ll roll in nicely with AutoSlide Tommy Moll    Stephens Inc     AnalystOkay  We will stay tuned for the updates  and I ll turn it back  Thank you John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Thanks  Tommy OperatorWe ll take our next question from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan  Please go ahead Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystThanks  Hey  good morning John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Sean Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystCan we talk about the change in quarterly profitability for HP Technologies and how you ll be guiding investors going forward  I guess I m just trying to think about the buckets that are driving the change  Is it just absorption on higher volumes  The R D is separated  Other mix considerations  Just trying to think about how to understand the fundamentals  I think it s going to be probably a little bit tough to navigate that quarter over quarter Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Sean  There are several moving parts in there  And because of that we re going to keep our guidance for the near term really at a top revenue line item  To your point  there is increased adoption of some products  especially the new AutoSlide product that John has been speaking of this morning  We also have some price accretion on a per unit basis as we work with different contracting models AutoSlide  importantly  is not on a day rate model  We have various forms of contract  And as we move through some of these early days we will probably land on the best few forms of contract that are mutually beneficial to the customer and ourselves  So  until we get to that point  it s really sort of a top line guidance  Obviously  we have much more discrete internal goals  But those are moving as well as we learn more through this process Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystThat s very helpful  Are you able to give us any hindsight color on the prior quarter relative to the one before that Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNot at this stage  Sean  Not at this stage Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  Fair enough  Maybe switching to International  Could you maybe just give us a sense of what you see as an opportunity set in terms of number of rigs that could be exported from the US over whatever time frame that you feel comfortable with  next 12 months or something  And just curious how those latest contract terms are looking relative to prior between Latin America and the Middle East Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  as John mentioned  we are excited to put a rig back to work in Colombia and we continue to have marketing discussions in that country  We still  on a long term basis  are excited about the unconventional play in Argentina and are being patient there as our customers are as we sort through the new dynamics in that country  We do have rigs rolling off of their original YPF five year contracts through the rest of this calendar year  And we had been in and continue to be in discussions with IOCs and other players related to the redeployment of those rigs As it relates to the Middle East  I d be a bit more cautious  if you will  in trying to provide any specific guidance  We have numerous discussions happening in various countries in the Middle East and are very excited about being able to participate in unconventional plays as they begin to really take shape and at scale in some countries there So  excited to be participating in discussions  Those range from preliminary discussions all the way through to bid tender type discussions  And it s early days  but we have 45 idle super specs in United States that are great candidates to put to some of those opportunities when they come to fruition Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystAnd so you wouldn t be able to characterize changes in rates or term at a high level across any of those markets Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNot yet  no  The FlexRig we think can really add value in the Middle East  and we also have some HPT trials happening with some of the HPT technology products as we speak there as well  And who knows  as we ve discussed in previous calls  the technology could be a rig pull through Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystRight  Okay  Thanks a lot John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Sean OperatorOur next question comes from Marc Bianchi from Cowen  Your line is open Marc Bianchi    Cowen and Company    AnalystHey  thank you  Just following up to the question on HPT and profitability  I appreciate that you don t want to give us any guidance  But if I just kind of assume what we had in the most recent quarter is  10 million of gross profit and then I take US Land and International and Offshore  all at the midpoints of your guidance  I kind of get  210 million of gross profit  I m wondering what else we need to deduct from that to get to your EBITDA  Because we ve got this insurance thing this quarter that s a new item and then obviously G A and perhaps R D from there Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThere are several things built into your question there  Marc  As it relates to the    first of all  let me just address the insurance captive  From a segment operating expense perspective  there is no change there  It s just transferring of those premiums to the captive  And  again  its inter segment revenue to the captive  which is then eliminated in consolidation  And it s a big self insurance retention  that deductible  and so we re managing that retention a bit differently through the captive  But from a segment expense perspective  really no change As it relates to the HPT    sorry Marc Bianchi    Cowen and Company    AnalystYeah  Go ahead Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAs it relates to HPT   Marc Bianchi    Cowen and Company    AnalystJust to clarify    Mark  could I just clarify now just because you re on it  on the insurance piece  So of that  210 million of gross profit  that s all in the segments  there is no additional deduction that I would need to make to that to get to your EBITDA as it relates to the insurance Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo Marc Bianchi    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd you can see that in the segment reconciliation which is in the press release and will be in the 10 Q filed later today Marc Bianchi    Cowen and Company    AnalystOkay  And then    yeah  go ahead Dave Wilson    Director of Investor RelationsI can walk you through kind of the reconciliation offline Marc Bianchi    Cowen and Company    AnalystYeah  I think it s good to talk about it live because I m getting a lot of questions about it  so perhaps other investors are very interested  Mark  you were going to talk about the G A and the R D Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  The G A    I think we have all the components to get to your EBITDA number  Marc  really  But specific to your HPT question  in particular on any more details within there  we have a growing revenue base  As we ve said before  we re excited about it because the technology is really software as a service  So in these initial deployments we re really getting started  we have a bit of variable operating expenditures  But through time  we expect that to be a really margin accretive portion of the business as we ve talked about The G A related to HPT  in particular  is pretty fixed  and the R D is as well  As I mentioned in my opening comments  we don t have any changes to the full year guidance  Once we get through the technology roadmap that John s articulated  we will  through time  have R D drop off  obviously  and once you move to a sort of maintenance  if you will  on the software  so you go from version to version as opposed to new software  But that s a bit out in our planning horizon  So if you stick with the numbers we mentioned in November for yearly G A  R D  etc   you ll be able to get to your EBITDA Marc Bianchi    Cowen and Company    AnalystGot it  That s great  Mark  Thanks  And then just if I could on kind of M A  I caught the comment that you don t need to do any more M A to build out the automation capability  But you did make the comment in the press release about having kind of ample flexibility to take advantage of additional investment opportunities  So I m just curious what that might be referring to and help maybe set some expectations for M A for us John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Marc  from an M A perspective  you ve heard in the past what we don t plan to do  which is any consolidation in the industry as far as rigs go  I think the investments that we ll be making are on the technology side  There is obviously the potential to grow internationally as Mark mentioned  continuing to enhance the fleet based upon customer demands  and that s what we re going to be investing Marc Bianchi    Cowen and Company    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thanks very much  I ll turn it back John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Marc OperatorOur next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays  Your line is open David Anderson    Barclays    AnalystHi  So  gentlemen  talking about AutoSlide and how to improve the performance  also talking about performance contract  so I m just wondering how the two work together on kind of the 15  of your business  which is these new commercial models  Are you employing AutoSlide in any of those contracts yet John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerThere have been some overlap in bids that we ve made  I can t speak to any particular right now that we have  but it s definitely in the discussion  To your point  I think it does make a lot of sense as we grow the AutoSlide functionality and automation in general  I think there is that potential there David Anderson    Barclays    AnalystAnd then  also could you just talk a little bit of the customer mix  I m just kind of curious of that 15   Is that more skewed toward the bigger operators  I m just curious which types of customers are more receptive to that  Because I also certainly noted how you would talk about your share of the majors gone up  I m wondering if those are related John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerReally  the answer to the first part of your question is  we have interest and have contracts right now with large and small E Ps  And I expect that that s going to continue  These performance contracts are not related to the growth on the major side of the equation  But I wouldn t rule it out longer term  I mean  let s face it  The majors are very much value oriented  and I think as they look at ways to enhance value  not only time based value but overall life cycle of the well value  I think we have a lot of opportunity to grow there  So  hopefully that gives us some opportunity going forward David Anderson    Barclays    AnalystYeah  I would certainly think so  I was just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit about the growth opportunity in the Middle East  I think we saw the last time I saw that you had a couple of rigs operating in Bahrain and a couple of rigs idle in UAE  Could you just tell us    and you said you have five rigs operating at Middle East today Could you just talk a little bit about where those are  It looks like you ve reactivated them in UAE  We just saw an announcement that came out about a big unconventional play in UAE  which I wonder if that s related  And also  if you don t mind  also just telling us  are you qualified in all the major GCC countries in the Middle East  particularly Saudi  I don t remember you ever working in Saudi  Just wondering if you re qualified there Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo we have    I ll just start us off with the five that you mentioned specifically  I think if you went back a year ago at this time  we had one rig working in Bahrain  two idle there and two idle in Abu Dhabi  And interestingly  last year we closed our Ecuador operation because of its sub scale size  and we really have the same size operations in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi that we ve purposely kept those open as marketing venues sensing what could be a developing unconventional play in several countries there  And that s coming to fruition as all five of those rigs are now working    continue to have prospective customers going to visit them as well  And yes  there s exciting opportunities in many countries there  including the UAE  Now  we do   David Anderson    Barclays    AnalystAnd what about Saudi  Are you qualified there Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe do have entities  We do have an entity in Saudi Arabia  a legal entity  I should say  And we have entities in various countries actually in the Middle East David Anderson    Barclays    AnalystThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup  Your line is open Scott Gruber    Citigroup Global Markets Inc     AnalystYes  Good morning John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Scott Scott Gruber    Citigroup Global Markets Inc     AnalystA question on working capital for Mark  The working capital  it sounds like it should improve going forward  Do you have any color for us on whether the working capital will be a benefit or a cash drag for HP for the full year Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt should improve  as I mentioned in the comments  I think we re going to be relatively stable activity level  So I think working capital will be relatively stable as well as opposed to being a big benefit or a drag  honestly  Having said that  we at H P are still trying to turn over every rock we can  and we had some successful working capital projects last fiscal year  And this year we have more that we re looking at  including an assessment of our inventory levels Scott Gruber    Citigroup Global Markets Inc     AnalystGot it  And just back on US Land  Do you think your rate premium to peers in US Land has widened  and not just relative to smaller players  but even relative to some of your bigger  kind of primary competitors  Do you think your rate premium has actually widened a bit there John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerScott  I know our other drilling peers    at least  I don t believe they ve reported yet  I don t know    I don t have the details of the data to know if it s widened  I think in general we ve had pricing discipline in our sector  As I had mentioned  the rigs are performing at a high level and adding a lot of value  And so I think in general it s in everyone s best interest to continue to keep pricing at reasonable levels  at today s levels  And again  I think there is an argument to be made that because of the cost side of the equation and rigs working harder that there is an element for increasing revenues in order to cover those expenses Scott Gruber    Citigroup Global Markets Inc     AnalystGot it  That s it for me  Thank you  Thanks for the color John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Scott Mark W  Smith    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks OperatorAnd our next question comes from Chase Mulvelhill with Bank of America  Your line is open Chase Mulvelhill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  thanks for squeezing me in  I wanted to come back to the performance base of the new commercial models that you re pushing out to the market  So  if you kind of do some back of the envelope math  it kind of looks like you may be saving  15 000 to  20 000 per well  Could you kind of walk through the different pieces of cost savings that you re saving for your customer  How much of it is you re drilling faster versus kind of taking people off or maybe cannibalizing some of the other drilling services  So just kind of help us understand the different buckets for the value proposition to your customer John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerChase  I d say most of the shared savings are related to time  And as you look at    a real simple example is  15 day well and two days of savings and a total spread rate of  150 000 total between those two days  and then you essentially share those savings  So let s say you split the savings  So on a 15 day well  you ve got  5 000 a day type of additional revenue  I m trying to give you a simple example There are other KPI type  key performance indicator type models as well where customers want to focus on specific items during the course of the well  I don t have    I don t have all those at the tip of my tongue right now  But most of those are areas that they re having challenges and or there is an opportunity for us to come in and perform at a higher level than what our peer would be doing and we re able to do that by essentially going in with a little bit lower rate and then earning a higher rate Chase Mulvelhill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Okay  A quick follow up just on the performance based contracts  If we think about how you are trying to attack the risk side    if you think about what kind of risk you re absorbing on the third party service providers  how do you protect yourself there  I mean  then also  with performance based contracts  it s always    it seems like a perpetual kind of resetting of the baseline as performance continues to improve  So how do you protect yourself on that element as well John W  Lindsay    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  that s a very good question  You ve obviously seen these types of contracts over time and there can be some negative results as a result of either resetting framework or the third parties  I think as we look at our experience and expertise and the dataset that we have  we have a pretty good handle on obviously the customer that we re working with  the partnerships that we share  have a pretty good understanding of those areas that have been particularly a problem in the past  And obviously  one of those is the directional drilling component We obviously have significant expertise in directional drilling internally with directional drillers and then obviously AutoSlide algorithms  And so lots of data at our fingertips that we didn t previously have before  So I think it helps us actually work with our customers to even potentially high grade  Phonetic  some of the third parties that are working jointly with us on location  So overall  I m not overly concerned or bothered by the third party piece of the equation  Obviously  the reset that you mentioned is just something that you have to work out in the contract But  again  as I think about our industry and how we have really changed and improved over time in that  we are working together more as partners with our customers  and I think that    obviously  they want us to win because if we win  they win  right  And so there is an opportunity for both parties to come out in a better place Chase Mulvelhill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystAwesome  Good to hear that your customers are willing to work with you  All right  Thanks  John John W

Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Helmerich   Payne  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Helmerich   Payne has an Earnings ESP of  7 60  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 4  2020

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas well drilling contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 38 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  860  
Revenues are expected to be  713 96 million  up 23 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 5  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Helmerich   Payne 
For Helmerich   Payne  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 35  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Helmerich   Payne will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Helmerich   Payne would post earnings of  0 28 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 32  delivering a surprise of  14 29  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Helmerich   Payne doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/helmerich--payne-hp-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200407759,200407759

145858,367373,HP,Impact Of New Economic Downturn,opinion,"It is going to take a miracle for the U S  economy to pull out of this tailspin  because the economic numbers are really starting to deteriorate very rapidly now  On Tuesday we got some more new numbers  and they were just as bad as we thought they might be  But even before today s numbers all of the data were telling us the exact same thing  The New York Fed s Empire State manufacturing index just suffered the worst one month decline in U S  history  Morgan Stanley s Business Conditions Index just suffered the largest one month decline that we have ever seen  global trade numbers are the worst they have been since the last recession  and just last week I detailed the complete and utter  bloodbath  that we are witnessing in the U S  trucking industry right now  So considering what we already knew  it shouldn t have been a surprise that new home sales in the U S  were down a whopping 7 8 percent during the month of May 
Sales of new U S  homes slumped 7 8  in May  as sales plunged in the pricier Northeastern and Western markets 
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626 000 in May  down from 679 000 in April  During the first five months of the year  purchases of new homes have fallen 3 7  compared to the same period in 2018 
Those are absolutely horrible numbers  and this is precisely what a recession looks like 
On Tuesday we also learned that U S  consumer confidence is rapidly declining 
Consumer confidence is on the decline 
The Conference Board s Consumer Confidence Index tumbled to 121 5 in June  dropping from a downwardly revised reading of 131 3 in May and snapping three consecutive months of improvements 
June s results missed consensus expectations for a reading of 131 0  according to Bloomberg compiled data  and marked the lowest level in nearly two years 
Once again  this is precisely what we would expect to see during a recession 
And yet I continue to see some clueless mainstream media reports that insist that the U S  economy is doing well  Apparently FedEx  NYSE FDX  didn t get that memo  because they lost nearly 2 billion dollars in the quarter ending May 31st 
In the fiscal fourth quarter  which ended May 31  FedEx reported a loss of  1 97 billion  compared with profit of  1 13 billion a year earlier 
FedEx blamed this horrible number on the ongoing global economic slowdown  and unfortunately things are not likely to get any better for them any time soon 
Many in the mainstream media continue to speak of  the next recession  as some future event  but when we get the final economic numbers many months from now we may discover that it had already started by now  In fact  one prominent economist recently stated that he believes that  we re probably already in a recession  
Gary Shilling  an economist and financial analyst who is credited with predicting several recessions over the past 40 years  thinks the U S  is in a relatively mild slump 
 I think we re probably already in a recession but I think it will probably be a run of the mill affair  which means real GDP would decline 1 5  to 2   not the 3 5  to 4  you had in the very serious recessions   Shilling  president of economic and financial research firm A  Shilling   Co   said in a recent interview broadcast this week by Real Vision 
And even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is now admitting that our economic outlook has become  cloudier   The following comes from ABC News 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday the economic outlook has become cloudier since early May  with rising uncertainties over trade and global growth causing the central bank to reassess its next move on interest rates 
Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York  Powell said the Fed is now grappling with the question of whether those uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and require action 
I find it very interesting that Powell chose the Council on Foreign Relations as the venue for this address  I think that tells us a lot about where Powell s true loyalties are  The Council on Foreign Relations has dominated the political landscape in Washington for a long time  and this has been true no matter which political party has been in power 
Meanwhile  the global trade war continues to intensify  and over 300 companies are literally begging the Trump administration to find a way to end it 
More than 300 companies are talking to government officials in Washington this month about how detrimental the trade war between the U S  and China has been and will be to their business 
Testifying in front of the Office of the U S  Trade Representative  major U S  companies including Best Buy  NYSE BBY   HP and Hallmark Cards are voicing concerns about how the additional tariffs that President Donald Trump threatened to slap on China would impact their businesses and cause them to lose business to foreign competitors 
Sadly  it isn t likely that the trade war will end any time soon 
In fact  it is probably much more likely that a shooting war will start in the Middle East instead  And if that happens  our current economic problems will dramatically escalate 
The wheels are starting to come off  and the U S  economy is beginning to spin out of control  Perhaps the Federal Reserve will be able to pull another rabbit out of the hat and pull off a miracle once again  but I doubt it  We haven t seen conditions like this since the great financial crisis of 2008  and the remainder of 2019 threatens to be extremely  interesting  indeed ",2019-06-26,Michael T.

145864,367379,HP,U S  Supreme Court sides with Venezuela over oil rigs claim,news,"By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Monday tossed out a lower court s ruling that had allowed an American oil drilling company to sue Venezuela over the seizure of 11 drilling rigs in 2010 but allowed the business another chance to press its claims   Siding with Venezuela  the justices ruled 8 0 that a lower court that had given the go ahead for the suit must reconsider whether claims made by Oklahoma based Helmerich   Payne International Drilling Company  N HP  can proceed  Writing for the court  Justice Stephen Breyer said the U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2015 used the wrong standard in denying Venezuela immunity from the lawsuit   Helmerich   Payne shares fell about 2 percent in midday trading after the ruling  The company sued both the Venezuelan government and state owned oil companies under a U S  law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act  saying among other things that the property seizure violated international law  The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act allows for foreign governments to be sued in U S  courts under certain circumstances  including when private property is seized  On Monday  the justices said the appeals court wrongly allowed claims to move forward merely because a company had presented a  nonfrivolous  case against a foreign government   Breyer called that too low a bar to allow a suit against Venezuela  The lower court must decide whether any property had been taken in violation of international law   For present purposes  it is important to keep in mind that the Court of Appeals did not decide on the basis of the stipulated facts that the plaintiffs  allegations are sufficient to show their property was taken in violation of international law   Breyer added   Helmerich   Payne had long provided drilling services for the Venezuelan government  The company disassembled its rigs in 2009 after Venezuela failed to pay  100 million in bills  In response  Venezuela s government in 2010  assisted by armed soldiers  seized the property  Then President Hugo Chavez ordered the seizure  saying the rigs could be used by government owned companies  The company said Venezuela seized the rigs  in substantial part because of the Chavez regime s pervasive anti American animus   It noted in court papers that a Venezuelan official had accused domestic opponents of the expropriation of taking orders from the United States and trying to  subsidize the big business transnational corporations  so that they can promote what they know best to do  which is war  led by the military industry of the American  empire and its allies   The legal question before the justices was whether the company s lawsuit succeeded in meeting the legal criteria that would allow the case to continue  Venezuela  backed in the case by former President Barack Obama s administration  argued it did not  A U S  district court previously ruled largely in favor of the drilling company  The appeals court then blocked the company s separate breach of contract claim while allowing the expropriation claim to proceed

came in at  624 3 million  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  613 million  The top line also surged around 31  from the year ago level    Helmerich   Payne  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Segmental Performance U S  Land  During the quarter  operating revenues totaled  624 2 million  accounting for 84 3  of the total revenues   up 35 2  year over year  The average rig revenue per operating day was  25 265  up 12 8  from the year ago period and the average rig margin per day also increased 10 9  to  9 822  Moreover  utilization levels of 68  in the quarter under review  versus 57  in first quarter fiscal 2018  resulted in an operating income of  79 7 million at the segment  reflecting a massive jump from the year ago profit of  24 7 million  Offshore  Helmerich   Payne s offshore revenues came in at around  36 9 million compared with  33 4 million in the prior year quarter  on the back of increased activity levels  Notably  rig utilization was 71   up from the year ago level of 63   However  daily average rig revenues came in at  35 635  a tad lower than the year ago figure  The average rig margin per day moved down 19 2  from a year ago  as a result of which  the segmental profits decreased to  7 2 million from  8 7 million in the prior year quarter  International Land  Helmerich   Payne s International Land operations generated revenues of  66 3 million  up from  63 2 million in the prior year quarter on increased revenue days and higher activity levels  Rig utilization rose to 60  from 45  a year ago  However  the average daily rig revenues in the quarter under review were  35 575  down 6 4  from the corresponding period last year  Nonetheless  average rig expense per day reduced 15 6  from the year ago quarter  Further  rig margin per day was  12 871  higher than the year ago figure of  11 351  As a result  the segment s operating earnings totaled  6 6 million  higher than the year ago quarter s  3 5 million  Further  the bottom line of the segment significantly turned around from the last reported quarter s loss of  7 8 million on the back of higher revenues and rig margins  H P Technologies  In late November 2018  Helmerich   Payne announced the creation of its new segment  H P Technologies  for the purpose of boosting the development of advanced technologies and directional drilling solutions  While technological advancement has always been a priority for the company  the creation of the new entity further accentuated its focus in this direction  The unit comprises two rig technology companies  namely MagVar and Motive Drilling  along with Angus Jamieson Consulting  which is an industry leader in wellbore positioning  The segment witnessed higher demand during the quarter  leading to revenues of  9 9 million  which reflected a skyrocketing increase of 248  from the year ago figure  Nonetheless  higher revenues were more than offset by increasing costs  related to depreciation  R D and G A expenses   resulting in segmental loss of  10 3 million  wider than the year ago figure of  8 8 million   Capital Expenditure   Balance Sheet During the quarter  Helmerich   Payne spent approximately  196 1 million on capital programs  As of Dec 31  2018  the company had approximately  228 5 million in cash  and a long term debt amounting to  490 8 million  debt to capitalization ratio of 10 2    Guidance The Tulsa  OK based company expects activity in the U S  land segment to increase 3 5  sequentially during the second quarter of fiscal 2019  While average rig revenues per day are likely to be in the band of  25 500  26 000  daily average rig cost is expected within  14 700  15 100 during the said quarter  Coming to the offshore segment  Helmerich   Payne expects average rig margin per day within  6 000  7 000 in second quarter fiscal 2019 and revenue days to increase 3  sequentially  However  international land segment revenue days will likely decrease 10  sequentially during the quarter amid lower activities in Columbia  Average rig margin per day is expected within  10 500  11 500  For fiscal 2019  Helmerich   Payne has revised down its capex by more than 20  from its prior projection  The company now expects its outlay in the band of  500  530 million versus the prior guided range of  650  680 million  Zacks Rank and Key Picks Currently  Helmerich   Payne carries a

145888,367403,HP,Healthy Growth Outlook For Oil   Gas Drilling Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of companies that provide rigs on a contractual basis to explore and develop oil and gas  These operators offer drilling rigs  both land based onshore and offshore   equipment  services and manpower to exploration and production companies worldwide Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes Oil prices have rallied almost 40  since hitting a 17 month low of  42 53 a barrel on Christmas Eve  Consequently  work for drillers   particularly onshore   has picked up again  With the ongoing momentum  there appears to be more room on the upside for oil prices  Again  thanks to the emergence of major shale plays yielding impressive results over the last few years  there has been an overwhelming requirement for complex drilling  This has led to huge demand for new premium land rigs  The positive crude narrative coupled with the shale drilling frenzy has helped prop up the growth prospects for land drillers  On the other hand  recovery in oil prices have not led to significant activity for offshore drillers  The three year price slump has forced the top energy companies to cut spending  particularly on the costly drilling projects  due to lower profit margins  This  in turn  has meant less work for the beleaguered drillers as offshore exploration for new oil and gas projects are nowhere near the pace of rising oil prices  With old contracts rolling off  the companies are either getting rigs stacked or bear high reactivation costs and accept much reduced dayrates  As a result  overall revenues are impacted  However  steadiness of oil prices at the current levels is driving operators to make longer term plans  as deepwater projects become cost effective if taken up for a long term  This could increase demand for offshore drilling rigs  The highly cyclical nature of the industry makes its participants   who generally build big and expensive drilling rigs   heavily dependent on the prevailing business environment  In other words  it s extremely difficult for any driller to perform well during a commodity downturn  However  the ability to come up with technologically superior products with higher efficiency can help companies gain a competitive edge in the market  Within the industry  it s interesting to note that volatility associated with offshore drilling companies is much higher than their onshore counterparts and their share prices are more correlated to the price of oil  But investors should keep in mind that these stocks are prone to quick falls too  unlike the stocks of land drillers Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sunny OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas   Drilling is a 14 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  89  which places it in the top 35  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates impressive near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags Sector   S P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas   Drilling industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil   Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 19 7  over this period compared to the S P 500 s gain of 5 1  and broader sector s increase of 0 5  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current Valuation  Since oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt  For capital intensive companies  EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses On the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 9 18  lower than the S P 500 s 10 99X  It is  however  well above the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 5 33X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 14 37X  as low as 3 93X  with a median of 7 14X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio   Bottom LineWith the energy sector emerging from the crude slump and debt driven overhaul  renewed interest in the drilling space is finally raising hopes for the industry s recovery  But even if commodity prices improve  structural oversupply and pricing pressure will weigh on the sector constituents  operating margins However  sector consolidation  adoption of superior technologies  new operational systems  optimization of the fleet by strategic sell offs and acquisition  seeking profitable collaborations  among other strategic strides  will certainly help boost future prospects of the drilling companies  While one does not expect the sunny days of the drilling industry to return immediately  signs of recovery can definitely be seen We are presenting two stocks with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  that are well positioned to grow  There are also a few stocks with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  that investors may currently hold on to You can see  Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP   Inc   HP   This Tulsa  OK based company is

145889,367404,HP,Why Helmerich   Payne Is A Must Add Stock To Your Portfolio,opinion,Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP   looks compelling at the moment  Given the company s strong fundamentals and positive estimate revisions  along with the present macro environment  it seems like this is the right time to add the stock to your portfolio Tulsa  OK based Helmerich   Payne is engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells in the United States and internationally  The company supplies drilling rigs  equipment  personnel  and camps on a contractual basis to explore and develop oil and gas from onshore areas  and from fixed platforms  tension leg platforms  and spars in offshore regions  Notably  Helmerich   Payne currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which means the company is poised to outperform the market Now let s focus on the  space to better understand the macro scenario  which makes buying shares of a drilling contractor like Helmerich   Payne beneficial  This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  Out of more than 250 industries  the drilling space currently belongs to the top 34  of the Zacks Industry Rank  suggesting that it is well positioned to flourish The positive factors driving the drilling industry are Stabilizing Price  Oil prices have rallied more than 43  to above  60 per barrel level since hitting a 17 month low of  42 53 recorded last Christmas Eve  Consequently  work for onshore drillers has picked up again  Thanks to the emergence of major shale plays that yielded impressive results over the past few years  there has been an overwhelming requirement for complex drilling  leading to huge demand for new premium land rigs  The positive crude narrative and shale drilling frenzy have helped prop up growth prospects for land drillers Offshore Resurgence  Steadiness of oil prices at the current levels is driving operators to make longer term plans  as deepwater projects become cost effective  Producers like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   which holds huge potential in the U S  Gulf of Mexico  recently put up an interesting picture for investors at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy Conference in New Orleans  These companies expect offshore production to come out of the shadows of shale drilling  Another upstream company Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   pointed out that production of 120 000 barrel oil equivalent per day from the famous Permian Basin requires investment of around  12 8 billion  while equivalent production from the Liza Phase 1 project offshore Guyana necessitates  3 7 billion investment  The revival in production is likely to increase the demand for offshore drilling rigs With growth outlook for the drilling space looking healthy  investors can consider the current positivity in the segment as a buying opportunity  While the sector as a whole has bright prospects  Helmerich   Payne in particular offers good investment opportunities  The reasons are outlined below Efficient Drilling Fleet  Helmerich   Payne is a major land and offshore drilling contractor in the western hemisphere  having the youngest and most efficient drilling fleet  In particular  the U S  land drilling business   the major contributor to the company s sales and earnings   enabled growth of its utilization and dayrates amid pricing improvements  The company expects activity in the U S  land segment to increase 3 5  sequentially in the upcoming quarter Immune to Volatility  Helmerich   Payne s technologically advanced FlexRigs are the key to its success  These rigs help in increasing the company s count of active rigs and maintaining relatively strong daily rate margins even during times of market uncertainty  As it is  the contract driller is relatively immune to economic turmoil  as it has contracts with well capitalized oil majors and larger independent companies  Term contracts and shale drilling demand for its rigs have helped Helmerich   Payne maintain a relatively high level of utilization Opportune Acquisitions  Helmerich   Payne s buyout of two rig technology companies  namely MagVar and Motive Drilling Technologies  which focus on precise drilling and real time monitoring evaluation  bodes well  The transactions have not only improved the company s directional drilling performance  but also enabled Helmerich   Payne to drill wells more efficiently and accurately  The acquisitions are likely to give a boost to the company s  H P Technologies  unit created in November 2018 Balance Sheet Strength  The debt levels of Helmerich   Payne are not only low on an absolute basis but also on a relative basis  The company s leverage stands at just around 10  compared with many of its peers that are hugely burdened with debts  accounting for around 50  of their total capital structure  The company s low debt levels and high cash coverage reflect the ability to effectively utilize its borrowing to generate enough cash flow  Markedly  the company is a dividend aristocrat and has managed to hike its payout in each of the last 47 years Bottom Line Prospects  Over the past 60 days  three analysts have upwardly revised earnings estimates for 2019  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has been revised upward from  1 61 per share to  1 64  which is significantly higher than the year ago figure of 14 cents  For first quarter 2019  the bottom line is expected to surge from the year ago loss of 5 cents to earnings of 38 cents per share Wrapping UpA clear picture can be derived from the above mentioned growth drivers  which differentiate Helmerich   Payne from peers  Its efficient drilling fleet  technologically advanced FlexRigs  favorable buyouts and strong balance sheet will enable it to achieve top and bottom line improvements amid secular growth in the drilling space Another Stock to ConsiderInvestors interested in the energy sector can opt for another top ranked stock as given below Houston  TX based Key Energy Services  Inc    NYSE KEG   is an onshore rig based well servicing contractor  Its bottom line in

145890,367405,HP,4 Energy Stocks To Buy As Oil Prices Breach  60 To 2019 High,opinion,"Following the oil crash toward the end of 2018 that caught everyone off guard  crude ended up posting the biggest first quarter gain in a decade  With oil popping up to  60 55 a barrel  the March quarter witnessed the fastest rate of oil price increase since 2009 
Prices rose 30  during the quarter  underpinned mainly by OPEC  supply cuts  and U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran  Despite concerns about global economic slowdown  demand for crude oil is likely to remain stable in the near term 
What s Driving Oil Prices Higher 
The OPEC  deal has certainly been one of the major drivers behind the uptick in oil prices   OPEC and Russia led oil exporters  decision to cut crude oil supplies by 1 2 million barrels per day  bpd  beginning January 2019 has aided in the stabilization of oil prices 
Under the OPEC  deal  Russia planned to cut oil production by 228 000 bpd over a six month period starting January 2019  While it curtailed production by 47 000 bpd in January and 97 000 bpd in February  the Russian Energy Minister believes that the country should have managed to curb the same by 228 000 bpd within March end or early April 
In addition to the OPEC  led supply cuts  U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran havealso tightened the commodity s fundamentals  Amid escalating tensions between Venezuela and the United States  the U S  government announced sanctions on Venezuela s state owned oil company  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  PDVSA  as part of which American companies have been restricted to conduct business with PDVSA 
Since shipments to the United States constituted around 75  of the cash received by Venezuela for crude shipments  this move has hit the country hard  with reduced exports on one hand and oil price boost on the other hand  According to the International Energy Agency  IEA   Venezuela s crude output is likely to decline from 1 3 million bpd in 2018 to 750 000 bpd in 2019  
Notably  the IEA predicts that crude demand will rise 7 2 million bpd through 2024  The worldwide oil demand in 2019 will be 100 5 million bpd  up 1 2  year over year  Despite the surge in electric cars and green initiatives  usage of oil in petrochemicals and aviation industry will be the demand drivers  Around 30  of the demand will result from these factors  Moreover  increasing demand of oil from China and India is propelling crude prices 
After imposing levies on each other s products for months  the United States and China are likely to ease things down  With hopes of trade tensions between the United States and China to subside  crude oil price will get a major boost  in turn reducing the likelihood of a global economic slowdown 
Supply Issues Appear to Be Supportive
While Trump urged OPEC via Twitter to relax the supply cuts in order to boost prices  the OPEC  members didn t respond  The OPEC  cohortis likely to meet in June to decide whether to continue with supply cuts or not  While Saudi Arabia is likely to continue with the supply cuts  Russia is likely to show less willingness to continue with the agreement  especially after September  Further  hefty draws in product inventories  gasoline and distillate  led to bullish sentiments in the energy market 
Last week  the rig count dropped to the lowest level in nearly a year  marking the biggest drop in a quarter in three years  Importantly  this is an indicator of lower future output in North America 
Our Take
In short  with the dynamics currently in place  we see oil supply balance heading in the right direction  This not only puts a floor beneath prices for the time being but is likely to aid the continuation of commodity s recent gains  eventually to around  65 per barrel

145927,367442,HP,Why Rowan   Ensco s Merger Deal Is Flawed  Canyon s View,opinion,"Rowan Companies plc s   NYSE RDC    with its bigger rival Ensco plc   NYSE ESV   recently witnessed strong opposition from its shareholder Canyon Capital Advisors LLC  a Los Angeles based alternative asset manager  Canyon owns 6 3  of Rowan s outstanding shares  more than 8 million   valued at  82 million at the close of market on Jan 7  This makes Canyon one of Rowan s biggest shareholders 
Following the news  the stock rallied around 7 9  in the last session 
Canyon s Take on the Deal
Per Canyon  the recent oil market volatility has made offshore assets less attractive  With oil prices plunging more than 30  in the last few months  expensive deep water drilling projects have become less profitable  leading to a tough business environment for offshore drilling service providers like Rowan 
Moreover  based on the following factors  Canyon thinks the merger can undervalue Rowan s assets and performances  which will affect the company s operational and financial profile 
Balance Sheet Superiority  While one third of Rowan s 2 5 billion long term debt will not mature until 2042  Ensco s  5 2 billion long term debt comprises  3 6 billion obligation due to mature in the next 10 years  Moreover  Rowan s cash balance of more than  1 billion is much higher than Ensco s  630 million  Additionally  the completion of the merger deal will likely lead to debt maturity of more than  4 5 billion between 2024 and 2027  of which  3 6 billion is attributed to Ensco 
Better Assets  Rowan expects the merger to create a  uniquely positioned offshore drilling company with capabilities across all water depths   However  Canyon anticipates Ensco s older and less reliable assets to reduce the quality of the combination s overall asset base 
Rowan s premium jack ups primarily capitalize on shallow water projects with less risk  Moreover  its joint venture with Saudi Aramco provides it a low risk asset base  which leads to cash flow predictability  Contrarily  Ensco s focus on costly midwater and deep water projects with lower profitability can dampen results of the combined entity in a volatile oil price environment 
Undervalues Rowan Shares  For each Rowan share  shareholders will get 2 215 Ensco shares  On completion of the merger  Ensco and Rowan shareholders will own about 60 5  and 39 5  of the outstanding shares of the combined entity  respectively 
While Rowan expects the all stock deal to maximize its shareholders  value  Canyon argued that the transaction does not provide enough premium  which can offset the rising risks associated with Ensco s business 
Due to the reasons stated above  Canyon intends to vote against the merger  which can potentially create a leading offshore driller based on fleet size  geographic presence and customer base  Per Canyon  even if the merger deal gets voted down by shareholders  Rowan will still be able to provide shareholders significant value

145929,367444,HP,Helmerich   Payne  HP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas well drilling contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1550  
Revenues are expected to be  716 12 million  up 27  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9 2  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Helmerich   Payne 
For Helmerich   Payne  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Helmerich   Payne will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Helmerich   Payne would post earnings of  0 18 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 19  delivering a surprise of  5 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Helmerich   Payne appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/helmerich--payne-hp-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200378444,200378444

145957,367472,HP,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Ranger Energy  Enterprise Products  Phillips 66  Cimarex And Helmerich,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  December 4  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Ranger Energy Services  Inc    NYSE RNGR    Enterprise Products Partners L P    NYSE EPD    Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  Partners   NYSE PSXP    Cimarex Energy Co    NYSE XEC   and Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 Stocks That Braved Oil s Biggest Monthly Loss in 10 YearsOil registered its biggest monthly decline in more than 10 years as the specter of abundant global supply swamping demand scared off investors  Black gold dropped 1  to  50 93 on Friday  bringing its monthly loss to around 22   That s the steepest drop since October 2008  when the commodity tumbled 33 5  during the height of the global financial crisis  Crude surged to a four year high in early October But after sinking to its lowest in more than a year  we expect oil to bounce back over the next month or so based on a slew of positive trends Oil Posts Largest Monthly Loss Since 2008There is increasing evidence that a fundamental change is occurring in the oil market  WTI crude  the American benchmark  popped above  76 a barrel and was trading at multiyear highs in early October  A looming shortage of the commodity on Iran sanctions helped in driving oil prices higher  Then  in a reversal  oil faced a two pronged attack  rising supply from major producers and fear that an economic slowdown will dampen the outlook for demand  Oil s troubles pushed the index into a bear market last month  leading to a 20  drop from recent highs Global oil supplies are looking plentiful and are expected to outstrip demand at the beginning of 2019  Predictions of more crude coming to the supply side through rising production in the United States  Saudi Arabia and Russia added to the bearish sentiment on the market  Even the demand side looked jittery with OPEC and the IEA forecasting weaker consumption President Trump s support for low oil prices also contributed to the losses  while the dollar strength played spoilsport by making the greenback priced crude dearer for investors holding foreign currency Prices Set to Rebound from Current LevelsFollowing last month s oil rout  most industry experts feel that prices have bottomed out and are on the cusp of a pick up  Much of their optimism lies in the anticipation of a production cut at OPEC s December meeting  The cartel members and Russia are expected to commit to cutting output by 1 million 1 4 million barrels per day from October levels in an attempt to drain inventories and boost prices The temporary truce in the trade war between the United States and China also support the positive oil market narrative  The 90 day ceasefire among the world s two biggest economies   on imposition of additional tariffs   is likely to buoy global crude demand Further  one must note that there is still an air of uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration s sanctions against Iran  While exports out of Iran are likely to decline gradually  the much talked about waivers to some of the country s biggest buyers of oil are only temporary in nature  Fast falling production in Venezuela should provide further support to crude prices How to Identify the Outperformers The possibility of rising crude prices over time does not necessarily indicate that all energy scrips would be wise picks  Moreover  with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns  While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  this is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight five stocks that fell considerably less than

145958,367473,HP,Is Helmerich  HP  The Best Pick In The Drilling Space Now ,opinion,With oil prices rebounding from the dark days in February 2016  the drilling industry has been gradually picking up pace  Nonetheless  structural oversupply and margin pressure still weighs on most of the companies within the industry  However  one company that is shining in the drilling space is Oklahoma based Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP    In fact  this is the only company within the industry that sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see Notably  shares of Helmerich have gained 7 7  over a year against its industry s decline of around 19  Let s delve deeper and analyze what s working in favor of the company Differentiating Technology Drives DemandAs we know  the demand for Helmerich s drill rigs had taken a beating amid the crude slump  with its rig count in the U S  segment plunging from 297 in 2015 to 87 in just a year and a half  Moreover  even during the downturn  Helmerich kept spending on its drilling fleet upgrades  which spiked costs  Needless to say  the company s top line and bottom lines were severely impacted However  Helmerich s efforts did pay off as prices were on a rise since the start of the year  owing to crude uptick  Consequently  the demand for rigs also started fueling up  with its active fleet bouncing back to 227  Moreover  the company has already upgraded most of its drilling feet with the latest technology  and is currently having the youngest as well as most efficient drilling feet  In fact  Helmerich s technologically advanced FlexRigs are actually much in demand and command strong daily rate margins While oil prices have been on a decline of late owing to oversupply conditions and geo political tensions  most industry experts feel that prices have bottomed out and are on the cusp of a pick up  Much of their optimism lies in the anticipation of a production cut at OPEC s December meeting  wherein the members are expected to commit to cutting output by 1 1 4 million barrels per day from October levels  in an attempt to drain inventories and boost prices  With oil prices expected to escalate again  the scenario will become more positive for drilling companies  including Helmerich As it is  the contract driller is relatively immune to economic turmoil as it has contracts with well capitalized oil majors and larger independent companies  Additionally  term contracts and shale drilling demand for its rigs have helped Helmerich maintain a relatively high level of utilization Robust Financials   Investor Friendly Moves Bode WellThe debt levels of Helmrich are not only low on an absolute basis but also on a relative basis  The company s leverage stands at just around 10  compared with many of its peers that are hugely burdened with debts  accounting for around 50  of their total capital structure  Recently in November  Helmerich also expanded its revolving credit facility  boosting its liquidity buy another  450 million  Its low debt levels and high cash coverage reflect the ability to utilize its borrowing effectively to generate enough cash flow  The company is a dividend aristocrat and has managed to hike its payout in each of the last 47 years Upbeat Guidance Buoys OptimismThe company expects activity in the U S  land segment to rise 4 5  sequentially during the first quarter of fiscal 2019  While average rig revenues per day are likely to be in the band of  24 500  25 000  daily average rig cost is expected within  14 500  14 900 during the said quarter  Coming to the offshore segment  Helmerich   Payne expects average rig margin per day within  8 500  11 000 in first quarter fiscal 2019 and revenue days to increase 5  sequentially Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors

145978,367493,HP,You Won t Believe What The Insiders Are Buying Right Now ,opinion,"In February 2016  as bank stocks hit new lows  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  CEO Jamie Dimon dove in with a  26 million open market stock purchase of JPMorgan s stock 
Other bank insiders followed suit that year and continued to buy in 2017 
It was a sign that the financial stocks were cheap 
Quietly  in 2017 and 2018  the insiders of another sector have been equally as enthusiastic  the energy insiders 
Do you know who Vicki Hollub is 
She s the President and CEO of oil giant Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  
On Mar 13  2017  she bought nearly  1 million worth of Occidental shares after the stock had sunk 13  to start the year 
And she wasn t the only Occidental insider to buy in 2017 
As energy stocks remained out of favor  and Occidental shares remained weak  the CFO bought shares in June and two directors bought shares in August 
What did Hollub and the other Occidental insiders know last year 
The shares have surged 23  since she bought 
Energy Insiders Went on a Buying Spree in 2017
But she wasn t the only energy company insider to buy in 2017 
At driller Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP   the shares had taken a dive in 2017  By Sep 12  2017  they were down 39  on the year 
That s when the Helmerich   Payne CEO stepped in to buy  238 000 worth of shares  Since that purchase on Sep 12  2017  the stock is up 41  
At exploration giant Pioneer Natural Resources  three directors bought stock on the open market within a week of each other starting on Aug 9  2017  Since that first Aug 9 purchase  the shares are up 49  
They re Still Buying in 2018
But the insiders weren t done buying in 2017 
Energy stocks remained in the doghouse to start 2018 and have significantly lagged the rebound in crude 
The insiders are again seeing this weakness as a buying opportunity in their stock 
On Apr 26  the CEO of Superior Energy Services bought 30 000 shares just two days after the company reported first quarter earnings that beat by a penny 
The shares have fallen 9  over the last year  although they are up 5 6  year to date 
And he s not the only insider buying this year 
Insiders at big oil service companies  Canadian exploration and production companies and small US domestic oil exploration companies were all buying more shares 
Insider Buying Sends a Strong Signal
Why would these CEOs and corporate insiders spend so much of their money on their own companies  stock when they already own a ton shares already 
Greed 
Pure and simple 
The opportunity to make more money motivates people    even people who are already millionaires like Jamie Dimon 
If top insiders are buying  it s because they know something very good is going on at the company  Maybe it is a new product  Or contract  Or pending merger 
Whatever the reason  they are very confident that shares will be on the rise  After all  who would buy more stock in a company if they knew it was sinking   
Buy When the Insiders Buy
When high level insiders buy  they are required to report the purchases to the SEC within 48 hours of the trade  The trade then becomes public information 
Hedge funds and other professional investors routinely use this information to get an edge on their trades 
For most of us  though  it s not easy to get access to the insider information  While the media will trumpet huge insider buys like Dimon s  26 million buy  did you hear anything about Occidental CEO Hollub s 2017 purchase 
The challenge is getting easy and reliable access to all the insider trades and then figuring out which ones to buy 
Where to Find the Insider Buys
Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information but it s time consuming to search by individual companies 
Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you as a weekly list  Have you ever seen one of those lists  The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming 
In some instances  the insiders have been known to buy en masse  Then what s an investor to do 
This happened during the stock market dip in August 2011  As stock prices fell  insiders felt that their companies were undervalued and rushed out to buy shares 
That August  insiders bought stock in 50 different S P 500 companies in just one week  Even if you got a list of those stocks  how would you narrow it down to the stocks that were truly worth buying 
To solve this problem  our Zacks research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and excellent valuations  We do the work of sifting through all the insider buys so you don t have to 
Just a handful of stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Zacks  Insider Trader  Right now  we ve narrowed it down to 9 insider buys that make the grade 
One of the most exciting buys involves a cluster of high ranking insiders at another energy company scooping up shares 
The CEO and 2 members of the Board of Directors pulled out their wallets and bought shares of their company with their own money    all on the same day  This was the very first open market purchase for both Directors 
Five days later  the CEO went back and bought even more shares  and a third Director made her first purchase of shares from ANY company since 2014

Buy ranked UnitedHealth s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry year to date  up  11 2  vs   8 2    The Zacks analyst thinks the company s robust Government business and continued strong performance at Optum are driving long term growth  Its international business and strong capital position driving business investment are the other positives  
The company has been witnessing an increase in membership over the past many years  It again lifted its 2018 earnings guidance  buoying optimism among investors in the stock  
However  membership loss in its fee based commercial as well as Brazilian businesses will contract the overall membership growth for UnitedHealth Group  Additionally  higher medical care ratio raises concern 
 You can   
Shares of United Technologies have gained  4 7  in the last year  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has lost  11 6  over the same period  United Technologies serves various end markets  
The Zacks analyst thinks that this allows it to remain profitable even during tough economic conditions  The company has offered a bullish guidance for 2018 on healthy demand trends and is likely to deliver sustainable earnings growth in future with Rockwell merger  United Technologies remains focused on four key priorities  flawless execution  innovation  structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation to fuel its growth engine  
However  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the company s bottom line growth  In addition  a disruption in deliveries from suppliers  capacity constraints  production disruptions  price changes or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on the company s ability to meet delivery schedules  thereby increasing its operating costs 
 You can   
Eni s shares have gained  13 2  in the last year  underperforming the Zacks Integrated Oil industry which has gained  30  over the same period  Eni has prospective upstream projects in Angola  Egypt  Ghana  Indonesia and Kazakhstan  This is likely to aid the company achieve 4  targeted output growth through 2021  In fact  year over year increase in oil and natural gas production has supported the company s strong first quarter 2018 earnings 
Eni intends to raise the dividend for 2018 to  0 83 per share  up 3 75  from the level in 2017  This reflects the integrated energy player s strong commitment of returning cash to the shareholders  However  Eni s debt level is higher than the industry average  Also  the recovery of crude prices has been affecting the company s refining businesses

145981,367496,HP,New Worry For U S  Oil Investors  Growing Human Toll And Litigation Costs,opinion,"US oil prices have fallen below  70 a barrel since the record high production of 11 million barrels per day announced in July  But price drop aside  investors in the country s shale crude sector have another thing to worry about  the growing human casualty in an industry that is expanding faster than safety measures can cope with 
Accidents are becoming more common at US oil drilling sites  affecting not just workers but also shareholders as litigation grows at a rapid clip against the companies involved 
In the world of energy markets  headlines are often dominated by the price  supply and demand for oil  While huge environmental disasters tend to stay in public memory  isolated human tragedies quickly move on in the booming industry  But the growing financial impact from the human toll demands investors pay more attention to them now 
The US Department of Labor s Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA  last week cited three shale industry companies   Patterson UTI Drilling LLC  NASDAQ PTEN   Crescent Consulting LLC and Skyline Directional Drilling LLC   for a January rig explosion that killed five people at a drilling rig near Quinton  Oklahoma  It was the deadliest US drilling accident since BP  NYSE BP  s Deepwater Horizon rig explosion of 2010 
According to a release from the administration  Patterson UTI and Crescent Consulting failed to maintain proper controls while drilling the well  inspect slow descent devices and implement emergency response plans  All three companies were cited for using heat lamps that weren t approved for hazardous locations 
The release added that the three firms faced penalties totaling  118 643  the maximum possible fines  A representative for Patterson UTI said the firm plans to contest the citation 
While the penalties cited may seem modest by the astronomical settlement standards of the oil industry   BP sold off  75 billion of assets to cover the Deepwater Horizon disaster   the question for investors in the three companies  of course  is what other lawsuits and damages could be coming 
Patterson UTI  the contractor at the center of Oklahoma blast in January  holds the second worst worker fatality rate among its peers  according to a Reuters review of OSHA data  At least 13 workers have died at the company s drilling sites in the past decade  the review showed 
On Tuesday  another Oklahoma based drilling company  Helmerich   Payne Inc  NYSE HP   had a lawsuit for  150 million brought against it in Harris County District Court  Texas  by representatives of Timothy Lewing  an employee hit by a falling object while working on a H P land rig near Midland  Texas on January 4 
The Lewing case came after H P settled in 2016 a  72 million negligence lawsuit brought by Joshua Keel  a worker injured while working on a rig in New Mexico in July 2014  Keel had initially sought damages in excess of  100 million  H P estimated its exposure from that payout at  22 million after taking into account the amounts to be paid by its various insurers 
Like Patterson UTI  H P has a history of rig accidents 
OSHA data shows the company faced 112 legal claims totaling  3 2 million between 2008 and 2012 for injuries  and reported three fatalities  At the time of the Keel accident  H P reported operating 177 rigs on average  That had grown to 213  while the number of fatalities had risen to five by the time Lewing was injured 
The growth in US drilling operations comes amid decreasing governmental oversight and regulation of the energy industry 
Historically  as oil production increases  so do injuries and deaths at rigs  And land based rigs were more dangerous than offshore operations  The Houston Chronicle reported back in 2013   Nearly six times as many oil patch workers were killed in Texas in 2012 than when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded  killing 11   it observed ",2018-08-10,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/new-worry-for-us-oil-investors-growing-human-toll-200337895,200337895
145982,367497,HP,Steady Near Term Outlook For Oil   Gas Drilling Industry,opinion,The Zacks  industry consists of companies that provide rigs on a contractual basis to explore and develop oil and gas  These operators offer drilling rigs  both land based onshore and offshore   equipment  services and manpower to exploration and production companies worldwide Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes  With oil prices surging almost 200  from the dark days of February 2016  work for drillers   particularly onshore   has picked up again  Thanks to the emergence of major shale plays yielding impressive results over the last few years  there has been an overwhelming requirement for complex drilling  This has led to huge demand for new premium land rigs  With crude prices expected to remain strong going into the back end of the year and surging shale output  growth prospects for land drillers look strong     On the other hand  high oil prices have not led to significant activity for offshore drillers  The three year price slump has forced the top energy companies to cut spending  particularly on the costly drilling projects  due to lower profit margins  This  in turn  has meant less work for the beleaguered drillers as offshore exploration for new oil and gas projects are nowhere near the pace of rising oil prices  With old contracts rolling off  the companies are either getting rigs stacked or bear high reactivation costs and accept much reduced dayrates  As a result  overall revenues are impacted  However  steadiness of oil prices at the current levels is driving operators to make longer term plans  as deepwater projects become cost effective if taken up for a long term  This could increase demand for offshore drilling rigs    The highly cyclical nature of the industry makes its participants   who generally build big and expensive drilling rigs   heavily dependent on the prevailing business environment  In other words  it s extremely difficult for any driller to perform well during a commodity downturn  However  the ability to come up with technologically superior products with higher efficiency can help companies gain a competitive edge in the market  Within the industry  it s interesting to note that volatility associated with offshore drilling companies is much higher than their onshore counterparts and their share prices are more correlated to the price of oil  But investors should keep in mind that these stocks are prone to quick falls too  unlike the stocks of land drillers Zacks Rank Indicates Solid Prospects The Zacks Oil and Gas   Drilling Industry is a 16 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  111  which places it in the top 43  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates steady near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags Sector   S P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas   Drilling Industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil   Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has declined 2 9  over this period compared to the S P 500 s rise of 5 3  and broader sector s fall of 0 8  One Year Price Performance  Industry s Current Valuation  On the basis of trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing oil and gas drilling stocks  the industry is currently trading at 12 13X compared to the S P 500 s 10 87X  It is also above the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 5 69X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 13 95X  as low as 3 93X and at the median of 6 96X  as the chart below shows Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  Ratio  Bottom LineWith the energy sector emerging from the crude slump and debt driven overhaul  renewed interest in the drilling space is finally raising hopes for the industry s recovery  But even if commodity prices improve  structural oversupply and pricing pressure will weigh on the sector constituents  operating margins However  sector consolidation  adoption of superior technologies  new operational systems  optimization of the fleet by strategic sell offs and acquisition  seeking profitable collaborations  among other strategic strides  will certainly help boost future prospects of the drilling companies  While one does not expect the sunny days of the drilling industry to return immediately  signs of recovery can definitely be seen None of the stocks in the Oil and Gas   Drilling space currently

145994,367509,HP,Helmerich   Payne  HP  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP  reports results for the quarter ended September 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 16  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas well drilling contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 18 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  238 5  
Revenues are expected to be  683 89 million  up 28 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7 34  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Helmerich   Payne 
For Helmerich   Payne  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  8 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Helmerich   Payne will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Helmerich   Payne would post earnings of  0 03 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 01  delivering a surprise of  133 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line

146017,367532,HP,Enrich Your Portfolio With 5 Energy Stocks Set To Beat In Q1,opinion,"After having witnessed extreme volatility in terms of pricing over the last three years  the commodity market has gradually recovered from its historic lows  to comfortably trade at more than  60 a barrel since the start of this year In fact  the first quarter of the year saw the U S  oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 despite record high domestic production  Crude was supported by various catalysts  including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies  Needless to say  such favorable developments have buoyed investors  optimism surrounding the sector s first quarter results Q1 Progress Report  What s Going in Favor Per EIA data  the commodity rose about 7 5  in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at  64 87 per barrel  It goes without saying that all oil related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products One of the main reasons why the U S  oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers agreed to expand their output cut deal beyond March  The coalition prolonged the agreement for another nine months to the end of 2018 in an attempt to clear the supply gut Another major factor fueling higher oil prices is fast growing demand for the commodity  which continues to tighten the market  Per the International Energy Agency  IEA   global oil demand is likely to grow by 1 5 million barrels a day this year to average 99 3 million barrels a day Sharp inventory drawdowns have also led to the commodity tread on growth trajectory  Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 51 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year  The gradual fall   stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports   has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 429 9 million barrels  current crude supplies are 20  below the year ago period ConcernsWhile there is renewed optimism among U S  oil companies amid the  65 plus WTI prices  the positivism could be undermined by soaring U S  production  Volume from U S  oil fields  inclusive of shale  has risen 25  since mid 2016 to more than 10 5 million barrels per day   the highest since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983  In early February  oil production broke through the 10 million barrels a day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter A rise in the oil drilling rig count points to a further increase in domestic output  An early gauge of future activity  rigs drilling for oil in America totaled 1 003 in the week to Apr 6  as per the latest weekly report by Baker Hughes  a GE Company Nevertheless  while we do not rule out chances for short term pullbacks on oversupply concerns  we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future The Picture So FarWith the Q1 earnings season finally kicking off  24 S P 500 participants released their financial numbers as of Apr 11  Per the latest   the results reflect a positive trend  with an above average proportion of companies beating top  and bottom line expectations  Overall earnings  for the companies that have already reported  are up 39 3  from the year ago period on 11 7  higher revenues  The beat ratio for the bottom line was 75  while that for the top line was 70 8  The strong momentum we saw in the preceding earnings season is expected to continue in this reporting cycle  with total earnings for the S P 500 index expected to be up 16   from the same period last year on 7 4  higher revenues  This would follow 13 4  earnings growth on 8 6  revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season  the best quarterly performance in more than six years Encouraging Numbers From Energy SpaceThe  sector put up a stellar show in the October December 2017 period  Earnings for the sector recorded a massive 136 3  jump from the year ago period   the highest among the 16 broad Zacks sectors   on 23 6  higher revenues The Q1 earnings season for the Energy sector is just around the corner  Investors are eagerly awaiting the flow of results  starting Apr 20  when Schlumberger Limited  SLB  reports first and foremost from the S P energy cohort In fact  the Energy sector is poised to witness the highest growth in Q1 yet again  The Earnings Trends report shows that earnings for the sector are expected to be up 60 1  from the year ago quarter  while the top line is likely to register 16 1  growth Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonThe encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies which are likely to trump first quarter estimates However  with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better than expected earnings While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  our proprietary methodology      makes it relatively simple  You

This FarPer the latest  report dated Apr 20  87 S P 500 members have already reported results with their total earnings up 25  from the same period last year on 10 7  higher revenues  Notably  82 8  of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings  while 67 8  topped revenue estimates So far  just five of the energy companies on the S P 500 index have reported their Q1 results  These include Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   Inc   Schlumberger Limited  Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation  NYSE HES  Both the oilfield services players  Schlumberger and Halliburton met earnings estimates  indicating that the North American drilling market remains robust  driven by increased activity  Kinder Morgan delivered an earnings beat on the back of increased contribution from the liquid terminals and Texas Interstate System  Further  Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation also delivered better than expected results Year over Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the last earnings season reflects that earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth  recording a massive 136 6  year over year gain on 23 6  higher revenues Also  for the first quarter of 2018  we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors  Per our expectations  earnings for the sector are expected to jump 59 6  from first quarter 2017  while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15 9  from the year ago levels What s Going in Favor of the Energy SectorThe first quarter of the year saw the U S  oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014  despite record high domestic production  Per EIA data  the commodity rose about 7 5  in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at  64 87 per barrel  It goes without saying that all oil related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices  as they will be able to extract more value for their products Crude was supported by various catalysts  including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies  Needless to say  such favorable developments have buoyed investors  optimism surrounding the sector s first quarter results Stocks  Earnings to Watch on Apr 26Let s find out what s in store for the below mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26 Contract drilling services provider Helmerich   Payne Inc    NYSE HP   is expected to report fiscal second quarter 2018 results before the opening bell In the preceding quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 85 71  on the back of higher drilling activities at its U S  Land Segment  Further  the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 37 06  in the last four quarters According to our quantitative model  a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    to increase its odds of an earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Our proven model shows that Helmerich   Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  The company has an Earnings ESP of  16 93  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Recovering commodity prices along with higher rig utilization in Helmerich   Payne s largest segment   U S  Land segment   are expected to buoy the results this quarter also  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich   Payne s largest segment s operating income is pegged at  27 51 million  up from the last quarter s figure of  24 75 million and the year ago quarter s operating loss of  51 85 million   Read More   Pittsburgh  PA based integrated energy company EQT Corporation   NYSE EQT   is slated to come up with January March operational results before the opening bell As far as earnings surprises are concerned  EQT   an Appalachia focused natural gas firm  with primary focus on production and midstream operations   has a decent record  having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports For this quarter as well  our model predicts an earnings beat as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and Earnings ESP of  18 59  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the average daily sales volume for the first quarter is pegged at 3 959 million cubic feet equivalent per day  MMcfe d   higher than 3 200 MMcfe d in the preceding quarter and 2 110 MMcfe d in the year ago quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the Production segment is pegged at  371 million  reflecting an increase from  267 million in the last quarter and  257 million in the year ago quarter   Read more   The largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States  Valero Energy Corporation   NYSE VLO    is another company to come up with quarterly numbers before the opening bell The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 10 26  However  our model indicates that Valero Energy s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around  as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients  While the company carries a Zacks Rank  3  its negative Earnings ESP of 4 58  makes surprise prediction difficult While improved refining margins and tax reform benefits bode well for the downstream operator  unplanned downtime and weather related issues might affect Valero s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018   Read More   Then there is Houston  TX based exploration and production major  ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP    coming up with first quarter numbers tomorrow  before the opening bell ConocoPhillips has an average positive earnings surprise of 144 45  in the trailing four quarters  Our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 62  Higher expectations for prices of natural gas  natural gas liquid and crude oil will likely favor the company s first quarter earnings Lastly there is Houston based  National Oilwell Varco Inc    NYSE NOV    another energy company set to report results after the closing bell   Last quarter  the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents  In the trailing four quarters  National Oilwell witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 6 9   without missing any estimates Our proven model does not show that National Oilwell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  20 00  Apparently  National Oilwell even warned investors that its first quarter 2018 revenues are expected to miss expectations primarily due to declined progress in new offshore rig construction as well as client associated equipment deferrals  The company expects its revenues to come in at  1 8 billion in the first quarter  reflecting 3 4  year over year decline Investor Alert  Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization  Billions of dollars in research have poured into it  Companies are already generating substantial revenue  and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight  and so are big

The U S  oil benchmark recorded its fifth increase in six weeks  attaining its highest closing since December 2014  The major catalyst was the Energy Department s inventory release  which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw  A tumbling dollar   that made the greenback priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency   provided further support 
Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April  The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 411 6 million barrels  current crude supplies are 15 7  below the year ago period and the lowest since February 2015 
Meanwhile  natural gas   one of 2017 s worst performing commodities   had an excellent week of its own following a larger than expected decrease in supplies  The 288 billion cubic feet  Bcf  withdrawal was also was significantly higher than both last year s drop of 137 Bcf and the five year  2013 2017  average net shrinkage of 164 Bcf for the reported week

Corporation recently approved a 15  hike in its quarterly dividend  The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 46 cents per share compared with 40 cents earlier  This translates to an annualized dividend of  1 84 per share  The increased dividend will be paid on Mar 12  2018 to shareholders of record as of Feb 21  2018  You can see  The oil refining and marketing giant was able to pull off the dividend hike due to the strategic actions it undertook last year for generating long term cash flow  Notably  Marathon Petroleum s  with its midstream subsidiary MPLX L P  bodes well for the company as it will lead to huge cash influx  boosting dividend and buyback programs  Moreover  the recent tax reform by the U S  government has reduced the company s cash burden  leading to the hike Marathon Petroleum is known for raising dividends since it became a standalone public company in mid 2011  Additionally  it has an active share repurchase program  These highlight the company s commitment to return more value to shareholders  Notably  the dividend hikes and buybacks  since the company s inception  have totaled  13 billion   Read more  3

the second fiscal quarter of 2018  While the average rig revenue per day is likely to be flat compared with the first fiscal quarter  daily average rig cost is expected to be roughly  13 900 during

average direct costs per operating day came in at  12 940  down from  13 770 in the year ago quarter  The segment was also boosted by a jump in both the operating days  from 6 288 to 14 776  and the number of rigs operational  from 68 to 161  on the back of resilience in Patterson UTI s operations amid an improving market Consequently  the segment recorded operating loss of  16 4 million   significantly narrower than the loss of  62 5 million incurred in the year earlier quarter Pressure Pumping  Revenues of  406 7 million almost trebled from the year ago sales of  105 6 million

compared to  5 2 million in the year ago quarter  However  the rebound in commodity prices notwithstanding  the unit incurred a wider quarterly loss of  7 8 million  as against the loss of  1 1

over its business following the recovery in land rig count and the recent bullishness in activity and pricing  In fact  the company sees 2018 as an exciting year for super spec rigs  The company has 130 of them in its fleet with 98  under contract While Patterson UTI sees an average rig count of 169 in the first quarter  it also expects average rig revenue per day to increase  300 sequentially  driven by favorable repricing of short term contracts  At the same time  average rig operating cost per day is also expected to go up in the first quarter Patterson UTI expects an average of 96 rigs to be operational under term contracts during the first quarter and 67 for the entire 2018 In pressure pumping  the company expects first quarter revenues to fall slightly from the fourth quarter due

146041,367556,HP,Getting Over The Hump,opinion,"Hey everybody  Dave Bartosiak filling in for Jim Giaquinto today  He ll be back with you folks again tomorrow 

Are you starting to feel better about the market right now  Technically speaking  it s looking better but just like I said yesterday  still not out of the woods yet  However  it does seem like the normalization is happening  We re getting the VIX to settle down as the market is surging higher  Still that next technical hurdle lies ahead of us  That s the 50 day moving average on the S P 500 now at 2 721  Perhaps that s close enough for a standoff during tomorrow s session 

Green all over as the major market averages all pushed higher  The S P 500 finished the day higher by 35 69 or 1 34  at 2 698 63  The Dow added 253 04 or 1 03  at 24 893 49  The NASDAQ rallied 130 10 or 1 85  at 7 143 61  The small caps of the Russell 2000 got in on the action too  rallying 27 14 points or 1 8  at 1 522 09 

Today s Intraday Trades 

I was busy in both Surprise Trader and Momentum Trader swapping out a few lagging performers in Eldorado in Momentum and Dana in Surprise Trader  I used the new money to get into a few new ideas including Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Paycom  

Aside from that  Tracey took a victory lap with Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP   She rang the register for a huge 33  gain in Insider Trader today  That was just the tip of the iceberg as she added 4 positions toincluding Tiffany  WR Grace  Beazer Homes and Southwest Airlines  

 What we have here is a bunch of directors buying  plus a confidence buy by a CEO and a CFO  

It may not seem like a big deal when directors buy  But they usually get compensated by awards and gift shares so they almost always have plenty of company shares  

Why would they buy more  

If they think the shares are undervalued  they ll buy more  Remember  they are greedy  And they KNOW what is happening at the company 

All of these buys are strong ones  I m expecting to see more of this throughout this week  We ll be buying again soon  

Counterstrike  Jeremy gave us some Fib targets he s looking at in the S P 500 right now  He also details short term price action in the VIX he used to gauge the move the market today 

 While the bond market was confusing  stocks and the VIX showed us a price action that was overwhelmingly positive  If this action continues into Friday we can confirm that the 200 day test was the bottom  Over 2745 in the S P and we can put our bull hats on again with Fib targets of 3095 in the S P 

Let s take a look at the chart today and the bounce back move after the CPI report  The big red bar on the left is the algos at work off the CPI headline  You can see the steady grind higher the rest of the day  Very strong price action and polar opposite of what we saw last week  

Large Cap Trader If you were looking for more insights into the CPI  the good Doctor John Blank has got you covered 

 This was the highest headline CPI print in five years 

Does this concern me  No  actually  Add me to the pundits who write to you  This was NOT a report to be feared 

Why 

This version of the headline CPI reading includes the rise in WTI oil prices  It makes its way into the gasoline at the pump prices in the broad CPI  Since North American oil production is rising smartly  the WTI benchmark price is now off from  65 a barrel  reflected in this CPI data  to around  59 a barrel 

I think shorts and speculative market makers were just looking for data to confirm their trade positions  

That s all I ve got for you folks today  Jimmy G will be back to hold it down for you tomorrow 

Have a great night 



Dave

146065,367580,HP,What s In Store For Helmerich   Payne  HP  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP   is set to release fiscal first quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 25 
In the preceding three month period  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 38 1  on the back of higher drilling activities in the North American markets  Further  the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12 93  in the last four quarters 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Helmerich   Payne  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Which Way Are Estimates Headed 
Let s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents for the quarter under review has been stable over the last seven days  It reflects a narrower loss of about 65 8  from the year ago quarter 
Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  538 million for the quarter  up 45 8  from the prior year quarter 
Factors at Play
Prices of oil at the end of October to December quarter 2017 were  60 46 per barrel  up about 19 6  sequentially amid tightening supplies  improving demand outlook and OPEC deal extension talks  The drilling contractor is poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices 
Helmerich   Payne s industry leading drilling fleet including its advanced FlexRig along with its term contracts with well capitalized oil majors poise the company to report strong revenues  Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the revenues of Helmerich   Payne s largest segment   U S  Land   is pegged at  453 million compared with  439 4 million in the prior quarter 
The International and Offshore segments are also expected to witness improvement in their revenues  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich   Payne s international and offshore segment revenues are pegged at  58 million and  33 2 million respectively  reflecting a sequential rise of 5 4  and 2 2  
The company also has a solid balance sheet with impressive leverage and liquidity ratios giving Helmerich   Payne enough financial flexibility to take advantage of the recovering energy landscape 
However  declining margins remains a concern and is likely to offset the optimism surrounding the stock  The company s average rig margins in the U S  Land segment have been compressing considerably  Thought the fleet utilization has been improving  the firm s margin in its the Land segment has plunged from over  17 000 in fiscal 2016 to around  8 000 in fiscal 2017  The trend is likely to continue in the coming period as well 
For the current quarter  the Zacks Consensus estimate for the average rig margin in the U S  Land segment is pegged at  7 610 as against the reported level of  8 039 in the prior quarter  The declining margins are likely to dent the earnings of the most significant segment of the company 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Helmerich   Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  11 62   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 13 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 14 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our 
Zacks Rank  However  Helmerich   Payne s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions 
Energy Stocks with Favorable Combination
Though earnings beat looks uncertain for Helmerich   Payne  here are some companies from the same industry which  according to our model  have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
Noble Corp    NYSE NE   has an Earnings ESP of  0 55  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release fourth quarter earnings results on Feb 21  You can see  
ENSCO PLC   NYSE ESV   has an Earnings ESP of  7 29  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release fourth quarter earnings numbers on Feb 26 
Nabors Industries Ltd    NYSE NBR   has an Earnings ESP of  1 73  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release fourth quarter earnings results on Feb 28

146087,367602,HP,Why You Should Hold Helmerich   Payne  HP  Now,opinion,"We issued an updated research report on drilling contractor Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP   on Oct 5  The company s industry leading drilling fleet  comprising advanced FlexRigs  and drill operating expertise lend it an edge over its peers  However  volatile oil and gas prices remain overhangs on the stock 
The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months 
Helmerich   Payne is a major land and offshore drilling contractor in the western hemisphere  having the youngest and most efficient drilling fleet  The company specializes in shallow to deep drilling in oil and gas producing basins of the United States and international locations 
The contract driller is relatively immune to economic turmoil as it has contracts with well capitalized oil majors and larger independent companies  Additionally  term contracts and shale drilling demand for its rigs have helped Helmerich   Payne maintain a relatively high level of utilization 
Helmerich   Payne s technologically advanced FlexRigs are the key to its success  These rigs help drive its count of active rigs and maintain relatively strong daily rate margin even during periods of market uncertainty 
Despite these factors  the company has lost 23 9  over the past year  underperforming the 19 3  downfall of the  

Also  though oil prices have recovered from its historic lows  it is way below the mid 2014 level  Thus  many energy companies have been forced to cut spending  particularly on the costly upstream projects  on the back of lower profit margin  This  in turn  means less work for contract drillers like Helmerich   Payne

146099,367614,HP,Oil Jumps To 2 Year High On Inventory Drop  Keystone Closure,opinion,The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a lower than expected weekly draw  On a further bearish note  the report revealed that refined product inventories  gasoline and distillate  both rose slightly from their week earlier levels  Meanwhile  refinery activity improved However  the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market Despite the mostly negative data sets  the benchmark was buoyed by the fact that commercial inventories actually dropped after notching up successive weekly builds The U S  oil benchmark also rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month  The agreement  already renewed once  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut Further support came from the shutdown of TransCanada Corporation s   TO TRP   590 000 barrel per day Keystone oil pipeline   one of the largest from Canada to the United States   due to a leak and subsequent cleanup operations As a result  the front month West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures gained 2 1   or  1 19  to  58 02 per barrel yesterday   the highest settlement since Jun 30  2015 Energy Stocks GainThe bullish oil market sentiment encouraged buying in energy stocks  which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR   an assortment of the largest U S  energy companies   almost 0 4  Wednesday  Some of the biggest gainers of the S P 500 yesterday were oil and oil related companies like Chesapeake Energy Corporation   NYSE CHK    Range Resources Corporation   NYSE RRC    Marathon Oil Corporation   NYSE MRO    Southwestern Energy Company   NYSE SWN   and Helmerich   Payne  Inc    NYSE HP   Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1 9 million barrels for the week ending Nov 17  following a rise of 1 9 million barrels in the previous week  The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 2 1 million barrels An uptick in refinery demand led to the stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer  But the withdrawal failed to match up with expectations as U S  output rose by 13 000 barrels per day last week to 9 7 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983 Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 25 of the last 33 weeks and are down more than 76 million barrels since April  The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 457 1 million barrels  current crude supplies are 6 5  below the year ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year Meanwhile  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   was down by 1 8 million barrels to 61 2 million barrels The crude supply cover was down from 28 3 days in the previous week to 27 8 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 30 7 days Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were up for the second straight week as production jumped  The small  44 000 barrels addition   compared to the polled number of 1 million barrels rise in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 210 5 million barrels  Despite last week s increase  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 6  below the year earlier level but is in the middle of the average range Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  edged up 269 000 barrels last week  contrary to analysts  expectations for 1 8 million barrels decrease in supply level  The marginal weekly rise could be attributed to healthy production  At 125 million barrels  current supplies are 16 2  below the year ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 0 3  from the prior week to 91 3  About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration  EIA  Petroleum Status Report  containing data of the previous week ending Friday  outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U S   both locally and abroad The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of petroleum products  It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry Want to Own an Energy Stock Now If you are looking for a near term energy play

146114,367629,HP,Flood Of Oil Earnings On Jul 27  HP  NOV  EQT  MPC  VLO  COP,opinion,We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season  with more than 50  S P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of this week Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 97 S P 500 members that combined account for 28 1  of the index s total market capitalization  According to the latest   total earnings for these companies are up 8 4  from the same period last year on 5 1  higher revenues  with 78 4  positive earnings surprises and 72 2  beating revenue estimates At this stage  we don t have too many results from the  Energy  sector  However  a number of companies have earnings lined up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report Energy  First Half RecapLast year   Energy  was the strongest S P sector performer  with a market thumping 24  return  In particular  November s historic OPEC led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important  50 per barrel threshold  The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement  and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that  this would be the year   True to the strong sentiments  U S  oil prices reached around  55 per barrel in late February  the highest level in 19 months However  the situation is drastically different now  with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks  By Jun 21  crude had cratered more than 20  from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory  In fact  prices ended down 14 3  for the first half of the year   the worst performance since 1998 Let s take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil Energy sector were spectacular  driving the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index The Jan Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year ago period  While crude slumped to some 12 year low in the first quarter of 2016  natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years As a result  the sector   whose year earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss   came out swinging  For the sector components on the S P 500 index  total Q1 earnings had robust year over year dollar growth on 33 8  higher revenues  While 69 7  of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates  63 6  of them outperformed the topline The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well  This is not surprising  considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line  While earnings for the Oil Energy sector are set to jump a massive 271 4    the highest year over year growth among all sectors   the top line is likely to show a growth of 15 1  from the second quarter 2016 levels Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 27Let s see what s in store for six energy companies expected to come up with Jun quarter numbers on Thursday  Jul 27 Contract drilling services provider Helmerich   Payne Inc    NYSE HP   is expected to report before the opening bell In the previous quarter  this Tulsa  OK headquartered provider of drilling rigs  equipment and personnel to explore for and develop oil and gas missed estimates  weighed down by lower drilling activity  especially in the international markets Regarding earnings surprises  Helmerich   Payne is on a bit of a slippery surface  having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports  And our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this time around too This is because  as per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to beat earnings  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  For the quarter to be reported  Helmerich   Payne has an Earnings ESP of  6 45   while it carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult   Read more   Simultaneously  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Helmerich   Payne  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Headquartered in Houston  TX  National Oilwell Varco Inc    NYSE NOV   is another energy company set to report second quarter 2017 results   this time after market closing  The company   which is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment   has a good track of having outperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters However  National Oilwell is likely to break the trend in the to be reported quarter  This is because the company is a Zacks Rank  4 stock that has an Earnings ESP of  14 29  National Oilwell Varco  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Then there is Pittsburgh  PA based integrated energy company EQT Corp    NYSE EQT   coming out with Apr Jun operational results before the opening bell As far as earnings surprises are concerned  EQT   an Appalachia focused natural gas firm with primary focus on production and midstream operations   has a decent record  having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports  However  with an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  our proven model shows that an earnings beat is uncertain for EQT in the upcoming quarterly release   Read more   EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    We also have Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   reporting second quarter 2017 results tomorrow   again ahead of the opening bell  Coming to the earnings surprise history  this Findlay  OH headquartered downstream operator has a good record  it s gone passed estimates in three of the last four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 189 75  But our model does not indicate that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   While a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult   Read more   Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    The largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the U S  Valero Energy Corp    NYSE VLO   is the fifth company to come out with quarterly numbers tomorrow morning Boasting of an excellent track of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters  Valero Energy is likely to encounter a speed breaker in the upcoming release  This is because the combination of Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  1 85  makes it an unlikely candidate for earnings beat  You can see  Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Lastly  there is Houston  TX based exploration and production major ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   coming up with second quarter numbers tomorrow before market open As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the company has a mixed record  having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four reports  Our model does not indicate that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too  as it has a Zacks Rank  4 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00  ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise    The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of

146123,367638,HP,Dow Keeps Moving  Reaches Another Record High,opinion,"The major indices had been marching in lockstep for the past couple of days  heading upward and making new all time highs along the way  The S P and NASDAQ needed a break on Thursday  but the Dow didn t  The index kept moving with a gain of 0 20  to a fresh record of 22 203 5  The S P slipped 0 11  to 2495 6 as 2500 proves to be elusive once again  The NASDAQ was off 0 48  to 6429 1  Retailers and technology were under pressure in the session  while a rise in consumer price inflation for August stoked fear that the Fed would raise rates sooner than expected   For all the bears out there saying this is the peak  that stocks are a bubble  and the crash is imminent  nothing in the market s behavior is indicating that   said Tracey in Insider Trader   There s no cash pouring in  mom and pops aren t obsessing over it  there s little speculation  and there s little excitement amongst the investing class  

Speaking of Insider Trader  that portfolio was the only one making moves today  Tracey swapped out three positions on Thursday  The editor sold two names for profits and added three more to capitalize on the high level of activity among insiders for beaten down stocks  Learn more below  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Insider Trader  It was a busy day for the portfolio as Tracey bought three names amid heavy insider activity  But first  she sold three positions to make room and two of them were positive  The sold stocks were Keysight  KEYS   7 5    Matson  MATX   7 1   and Summit Hotels  INN   And now  the new buys are 

  Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP   Shares of this contract drilling company have plunged 36  so far this year on concerns over the price of oil and the sustainability of its dividend  But the company s CEO thinks the selling is way overdone and bought shares just after the stock hit a 5 year low 

  Freeport McMoRan  FCX   This company is the largest copper miner in the world  and its actually up 4 3  year to date  That means its in better shape than most natural resource stocks  And the President   COO apparently thinks its going to get even better because he bought more than 36 000 shares earlier this month 

  Cinemark  CNK   This has been the worst summer box office season in 21 years  and shares of this movie theater chain are down 8 5  year to date to 3 year lows  However  the company is updating its refreshments and converting to luxury recliners  The CEO believes this will be a big boon to CNK because he bought 5000 shares late last month 

The allocations should come to about 10  each when taking the above mentioned sells into consideration  The full write up offers much more on each of these moves Options Trader   The Dow notched another new all time high today  while the S P and Nasdaq finished just under that mark  But it has so far been a great week for the markets with all of the major indexes poised for solid weekly gains 

 Between strong economic numbers  robust corporate profits  excitement over tax cuts  and an air of bipartisanship emerging in Washington  as nascent as it may be at this stage   stocks are being well supported 

 And with another earnings season just around the corner  hopes are high that stocks can keep their uptrend going      Kevin Matras

Momentum Trader    W hy the all time highs  Why has the market climbed the wall of worry and why now  suddenly  are we breaking out while the dollar is reversing  Well  I think the explanation is more simple than people realize  The market is beginning to realize that the Art of the Deal has arrived 

 When Trump reached across the aisle to make nice with the Democrats to get the debt ceiling bill passed  something changed  It changed for the better as investors who doubted the President s pro business stance  awakened to better odds of progress  If he can get a deal done for the debt ceiling  maybe he can get a deal done for taxes as well  If he gets a deal done for taxes  then this market is going to continue to scream higher 

 You don t have to take my word for it  If you want to know how the market feels about his chances  take a look at the Russell 2000 and the US Dollar  These both give you vital information  The Russell 2000 and its mostly domestically focus has a pulse on the expectations of the US economy  As that index starts to break higher  it tells you that investors are bullish about the prospects      Dave Bartosiak

Industrial Average and the S P 500 index felt pressure from the sharp drop in crude futures  gaining just 0 06  and 0 11  for the day  respectively The two energy representatives in the 30 stock Dow Jones industrial average  ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM   and Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   were down almost 0 4   Meanwhile  the biggest casualties of the S P 500 were Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc

inventories increased by 3 295 million barrels for the week ending Jun 2  2017  following a decline of 6 43 million barrels in the previous week The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 3 5 million barrels  A pullback in refinery crude runs from previous week s record highs and jump in imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer even as domestic production edged lower The first inventory increase in nine weeks adds to the supply of excess oil in the U S   though the year over year storage surplus has narrowed down considerably in recent months after a run of drawdowns  At 513 21 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 2 3  from the year ago period and are in the upper limit of the average range during this time of the year However  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on

surged 4 36 million barrels last week  compared to the analysts  expectations for an unchanged supply level  The second successive weekly increase in distillate fuel stocks could be attributed to lower demand  Despite past week s increase in distillate fuel stocks  at 151 09 million barrels  supplies remain marginally lower than the year ago level but are close to the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was down by 0 9  from the prior week to 94 1  About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration

The major indexes are on track for a modestly positive open at the start of May s trading session  with market participants looking ahead to a busy docket of economic and earnings reports

A stronger reading today will strengthen expectations of a notable turnaround in the U S  economy s growth trajectory in the current period following Q1 s anemic showing  The recent weakening in the U S  dollar has raised hopes that the worst may finally be behind us  particularly for the export centric manufacturers 
Jobs will be the other key point of focus this week  with the April non farm payroll reading coming out on Friday  The expectation is for  headline  gains of 200K vs  215K in March and the unemployment rate ticking back down to 4 9   Unlike other economic readings which weakened during Q1  the labor market continued to chug along month after month without losing steam  Positive economic readings this week  both from the factory sector as well as the labor market  will increase the odds of a June Fed hike    
This is the last busy week of the Q1 earnings season  with results from more than 130 S P 500 companies on the docket  By the end of this week  we will have seen results from 88  of S P 500 members  The trends for most of the sectors  Retail still has a sizable number of reports pending  are already well established  These include widespread growth challenges  more numerous positive surprises  and relative fewer negative revisions to current period estimates  These trends will likely carry through to the end of this reporting cycle without any major changes

As we have been stating from this reporting season all along  the growth pace is notably tracking below other recent periods  but positive surprises are tracking above other recent periods  The most plausible explanation for the bigger proportion of positive surprises is the low levels to which estimates had fallen ahead of the start of this earnings season  The recent pullback in the U S  dollar s exchange value has helped Q1 results on the margin as well

146205,367720,HP,Acuity Brands  Helmerich   Payne  Air Methods  AMN Healthcare Services And Halyard Health Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   May 10  2016   highlights Acuity Brands    as the Bull of the Day and  Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on   Air Methods Corp     AMN Healthcare Services     and Halyard Health    

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

Lighting is one of those areas in our lives that we often take for granted  We hardly think about how important having a well lit place can be until we find ourselves in the dark  nor do investors think about these companies on a frequent basis either  However  this could be a mistake if you take a closer look of Acuity Brands     a leader in innovative lighting systems 

This Georgia based company might not be a household name  but it has a variety of lighting solutions and particularly in the LED market  While this might not sound like the sexiest place for investors to go  the stock has actually been a star performer and it has gained over 41  in the past year  so clearly it is on the right track 

But with these kind of gains in a difficult market  investors need to be extra careful to make sure that the fundamentals also lineup as well  Fortunately for AYI  there is plenty of promise if we look to recent estimates and some of their stats on the momentum front too 

Recent Estimates

Over the past two months  we haven t seen any analyst earnings estimates go lower for the current quarter or full year  helping to push the consensus earnings estimate sharply higher over the past two months  Current earnings expectations have actually surged by 5 35  in the past sixty days for the current quarter  while the full year estimate has moved higher by over 8 1  in the same time frame  Clearly  there is strong potential for AYI to continue growing its business in the near term 

  

Oil and gas stocks have been surging so far in 2016 thanks to a rebound in prices and a bit more hope for the market and its longer term potential  But recent events suggest that this run might be coming to an end  as sluggish economic data and an oversupplied market are starting to wreck havoc on a number of stocks in the space 

Take Helmerich   Payne    for example as a great representation of this trend  This Oklahoma based company is focused on the drilling market has seen its shares rise by nearly 9  since the start of 2016  However  May has been a rough stretch for the company and HP stock has fallen by almost double digits just since the beginning of the calendar month 

This is obviously a bearish trend  but investors have to be asking if this can continue for HP shares  or if a rebound is dead ahead  Well  if we consider some of the bearish economic data lately such as sluggish China growth prospects and increased worries over U S  economic activity and we add that to the recent earnings estimates for this stock  it becomes clear that HP may be facing more pain in the near term 

Recent Estimates

Analysts have been racing to cut their earnings expectations for HP stock  In the past two months we haven t seen a single estimate go higher  compared to eight lower in the current quarter and eight lower for the full year 

The magnitude of these earnings estimate cuts has also been troubling  We have seen expectations slashed by more than 50  for the current quarter and current year  while the most recent estimates have been especially bleak

Will the EU Disintegrate This Summer 

There s a big question all Europe watchers must take seriously  Will the European integration dream disintegrate across the summer 
	It is not outlandish to speculate 
	In the Global Week Ahead  there are two related acts due on stage  in this EU integration disintegration drama 
	Monday kicked off with an extraordinary meeting of EU Finance ministers to discuss the macroeconomic adjustment program for Greece  Could Greece finally get some debt relief  That would be a helpful step   The Sustainability of Greece s Public Debt  was the topic slated for discussion

	U K  Prime Minister Cameron recently defended his decision to call the EU referendum  telling the BBC   You shouldn t try to hold an independent sovereign nation in an organization against its will  Then  Cameron went on to backtrack and say leaving the EU meant  the clock being turned back to an age of competing nationalism in Europe  
	Whether this Brexit vote is a vote for or against Cameron s U K  leadership remains to be seen  Running a democratic country by referendum speaks to a weakening hold on Prime Ministerial power  He will seek to consolidate party support after this vote  U K  Conservatives look to be about as unified as U S  Republicans these days  That s me being polite 
	With my economist hat on  I think EU Finance Ministers want to get the Greek fiscal debt situation to calm down  They wish to move forward productively  This is partly a tactic to help U K  voters see the EU in a favorable light  A political blowup with Greece  scant weeks before the U K  referendum  would be very bad indeed for the EU integration camp

146241,367756,HP,Energy Prices Crushed  Pull The Plug On These Stocks,opinion,"The ongoing oil and gas price plunge is sure to have an adverse effect on most industry components 
Time to Sell These E P Plays While all crude focused stocks stand to lose from falling commodity prices  companies in the E P sector are the worst placed  as they will be able to extract less value for their products  In particular  we suggest avoiding exposure to mid  and small cap E P players  In particular  we suggest avoiding exposure to mid  and small cap E P plays like EXCO Resources Inc   NYSE XCO   Halc n Resources Corp   NYSE HK   Bonanza Creek Energy Inc   NYSE BCEI   Rosetta Resources Inc   NASDAQ ROSE  and Oasis Petroleum Inc   NYSE OAS   These producers have negative returns year to date and has been witnessing downward earnings consensus estimate revisions for the current quarter and year Drillers   Pushed to the Brink by Sinking Oil Prices As crude price collapse  the top energy companies are expected to cut spending  particularly on the costly drilling projects  on the back of lower profit margins  This  in turn  means less work for the beleaguered drillers that are facing an uphill battle to turn around  With large  multinational energy firms looking to reign in their skyrocketing capital expenses  the drilling space is likely to see intense competition  as multiple firms chase a single contract  This excess capacity  in turn  could lead to lower utilization or dayrates  Companies like Helmerich   Payne Inc   HP   Nabors Industries Ltd   NBR   Parker Drilling Co  NYSE PKD  and Patterson UTI Energy Inc   NASDAQ PTEN  look to be in most trouble Record Natural Gas Production Keeps Pressure on  Gassy Companies  Looking ahead  EIA expects average total production to rise by 3 1  in 2015  while total natural gas consumption is anticipated to decline next year  We believe these supply demand dynamics   the projected negative consumption growth in the face of production increase   will weigh on natural gas prices  translating into limited upside for natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
In the absence of major production cuts or a stronger economy to boost industrial demand  which is responsible for almost a third of the gas consumption  we do not expect much upside in gas prices in the near term  In other words  there appears no reason to believe that the supply overhang will subside and natural gas will be out of the dumpster in 2015  In the past  winter weather has played a factor in boosting prices with demand for domestic natural gas exceeding available supply  But with no dearth of new supply  even this association is becoming more and more obsolete  Consequently  natural gas weighted exploration and production companies like Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK   Cabot Oil   Gas Corp   COG  and EOG Resources Inc   EOG  are in for a tough time  Gas focused partnerships like Williams Partners L P   WPZ  and ONEOK Partners L P   NYSE OKS  tend to suffer too  from falling sales for their natural gas liquids  NGL  processing  Check out our latest Oil   Gas Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy ",2015-01-04,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-prices-crushed,-pull-the-plug-on-these-stocks-237292",237292
146242,367757,HP,Helmerich   Payne Is A Fracking Buy,opinion,"Helmerich   Payne  NYSE HP  has taken full advantage of the North American oil and gas renaissance brought on by fracking 
 with a long dividend history  The company has grown earnings per share at 22  a year over the last decade  20   earnings per share growth is what you d expect from a growth phase social media company  if it even had earnings   not an  old economy  contract drilling services business like Helmerich   Payne 
I will tell you up front  I m long Helmerich   Payne  The company s investment thesis is a combination of growth from the North American oil renaissance as well as a value play due to low oil prices 
Simply put  Helmerich   Payne has navigated the North American oil boom better than any of its peers  The company is now the market leader in the U S  land contract drilling services industry  as the image below shows 

Helmerich   Payne has leap frogged its competitors to take the leading market share position by providing higher quality rigs  The company has greatly expanded its best in class AC Flex Rigs over the last 15 years  The image below shows this rig growth  Note that the company has also sold off nearly all of its old model rigs to focus on its AC Flex Rigs

Helmerich   Payne and Oil Price Declines
Helmerich   Payne s 22  earnings per share growth rate over the last decade is nothing short of phenomenal  The company s earnings are actually declining now due to the precipitous decline in oil prices since July 
Helmerich   Payne is in part a victim of its own success  The rise in oil production in North America coupled with reluctance to reduce oil production in other parts of the world has resulted in more oil supply  When supply rises while demand is held steady  prices decline 
We don t live in a stable world  however  Oil production levels can and will change  Wars  economic sanctions  dwindling reserves  and rising energy demand all have the potential to raise oil prices  Just as oil prices haven t permanently stayed high  they will not permanently stay low 
Since oil prices fell from over  100 a barrel to around  50 a barrel  Helmerich   Payne s stock price has suffered  The company s stock price fell from highs of around  110 to lows of around  55  The stock currently sits at  63 68 
Helmerich   Payne is a Fracking Bargain At Current Prices
 The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble  We want to buy them when they re on the operating table
