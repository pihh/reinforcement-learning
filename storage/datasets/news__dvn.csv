196423,417939,DVN,Will Devon Energy  DVN  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Devon Energy  DVN   This company  which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This oil and gas exploration company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 28 14  
For the most recent quarter  Devon Energy was expected to post earnings of  0 19 per share  but it reported  0 26 per share instead  representing a surprise of 36 84   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 36 per share  while it actually produced  0 43 per share  a surprise of 19 44  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Devon Energy  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Devon Energy has an Earnings ESP of  12 73  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 18  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-devon-energy-dvn-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200500089,200500089

barrels of oil equivalent Like many small  to mid cap energy companies  price pressures and overhead caused NOG to underperform the markets last year  The most recent earnings report showed an EPS of 9 cents  below the forecast   but revenues were up  coming in at  233 9 million  or 37  over the estimate  While headwinds are hurting Northern  the company s foundation is solid Management is using that strong revenue base to put the company on sound footing  with it reducing debt and attracting investors by commencing a dividend  In mid January  the company revealed moves to retire more than  50 million in outstanding debt notes  a decision that will improve the bottom line by 13   Additionally  in mid December  NOG announced its first ever dividend payment  scheduled for April 2020  of 1 5 cents per share  At current prices  this dividend will yield about 3   or 50  more than the average yield among S P listed companies Analyst Jason Wangler  of Imperial Capital  was impressed by NOG management s financial moves  and upgraded his stance on the stock from Neutral to Buy  Wangler specifically cited the dividend announcement in his comments  writing   The announcement is important as it shows the progress NOG has made on its balance sheet over the past two years as well as the fact that now NOG stock can be considered a yield vehicle  Wangler also raised his price target on NOG

s target implies a possible upside of 60    To watch Heffern s track record  click here Commenting on the stock  Heffern said   On the back of very strong preliminary 4Q19 results  ESTE s 2020 plan

of the White House  The much hyped Phase One trade deal was the first tangible sign of de escalation in the nearly two year long trade dispute between the two largest trading countries of the world  Notably  the U S  energy sector is likely to be a major beneficiary of this temporary trade deal Phase One Trade Deal and U S  Energy SectorPer the deal  China has agreed to purchase  200 billion in U S  goods over the next two years in addition to the total amount of China s imports from the United States in 2017  Notably  the Asian economic super power procured  186 billion of U S  goods and services in 2017 Out of the new U S  exports of  200 billion  products from the energy sector   including liquefied natural gas  crude oil  refined products and coal   will constitute  52 4 billion   18 5 billion in 2020 and  33 9 billion in 2021   The energy sector will be the second largest beneficiary after the diversified manufacturing sector  which will command  77 7 billion of U S  exports in two years Moreover  a solution to the year long tariff related conflict between the United States and China will provide a major boost to crude oil price as it will reduce the likelihood of a global economic slowdown Although the final trade deal or the phase two deal is unlikely to happen before the U S  presidential election in November 2020  the interim deal will at least cool down the tariff war  which affected not only these two countries but also the Eurozone and several major emerging markets Other PositivesOn Jan 14  the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  raised its

International Petroleum Technology Conference  IPTC  in Saudi Arabia  Bahrain s oil minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said that U S  shale production  which has become the major source of global oil supply  may not maintain its momentum throughout 2020 Meanwhile  the EIA revealed that although U S  crude oil production will continue to rise in the next two years  its rate of growth has actually declined  On average  the WTI crude production is expected to increase 0 9 million barrels per day  bpd  in 2020 compared with 1 3 million bpd in 2019 and 1 6 million bpd in 2018 Despite a surge in sales of electric cars  demand for oil is expected to rise in the petrochemical industry  especially in plastic industry  Also  growing demand for aviation oil will support crude oil prices

of global oil supply  may not maintain its momentum throughout 2020 Meanwhile  the EIA revealed that although U S  crude oil production will continue to rise in the next two years  its rate of growth has actually declined  On average  the WTI crude production is expected to increase 0 9 million barrels per day  bpd  in 2020 compared with 1 3 million bpd in 2019 and 1 6 million bpd in 2018 Despite a surge in sales of electric cars  demand for oil is expected to rise in the petrochemical industry  especially in plastic industry  Also  growing demand for aviation oil will support crude oil prices

196453,417969,DVN,Should Value Investors Pick Devon Energy  DVN  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Devon Energy Corporation   NYSE DVN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Devon Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 49  as you can see in the chart below   This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 12  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Devon Energy s current PE ratio noticeably below its midpoint  which is 20 12  over the past five years  However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks Oils Energy sector trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 36  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Devon Energy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 74  so it is fair to expect an increase in the stock s value in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Devon Energy has a P S ratio of 0 92  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Devon Energy currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DVN a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Devon Energy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C  This gives DVN a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days and one higher  while the current year estimate has seen five downward and four upward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 7 7  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has risen 2 2   in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Devon Energy Corporation Price and Consensus   This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineDevon Energy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 32  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks for Today Experts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning

196470,417986,DVN,Devon Energy  DVN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Devon Energy  DVN  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas exploration company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  2 26 billion  up 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 51 56  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Devon Energy 
For Devon Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 99  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Devon Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Devon Energy would post earnings of  0 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 36  delivering a surprise of  20  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Devon Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/devon-energy-dvn-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200447191,200447191

What s Next for Devon Energy 
While Devon Energy has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Devon Energy was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

196479,417995,DVN,America s Shale Boom Keeps Rolling Even as Wildcatters Save Cash,news," Bloomberg     America s surging shale oil production shows little sign of abating  despite industrywide spending cuts  as explorers learn to do more with less 
Almost all the independent producers have reduced their budgets for 2019  but many still expect to deliver double digit growth in production this year  fourth quarter earnings reports show  Growth is slowing but still strong  the U S  will add about 1 45 million barrels of oil a day on average this year  down from 1 6 million in 2018  according to the Energy Information Administration 
 The machine still has enough cash available that it can continue to grow at a rate that s material   said Raoul LeBlanc  a Houston based analyst at IHS Markit  said by phone  The rest of the world  is now not going to be flooded with oil  but still mildly glutted  
The tumble in oil prices at the end of 2018  combined with investor demands for fiscal discipline  has prompted most shale executives to only invest what they earn in cash flow  ending years of debt fueled growth  But the scale of past investments and low service costs mean that the cutbacks will only put a dent in growth projections 
On average  U S  explorers have cut their capital budgets 4 percent but are predicting a 7 percent increase in production  according to RS Energy Group  a Calgary based researcher 
The latest explorers to announce spending cuts and pledge more returns to investors were Concho Resources  NYSE CXO  Inc  and  Devon Energy  Corp  NYSE DVN   on Tuesday  Despite the budget trimming  Concho expects oil output to grow about 28 percent in 2019  Devon lifted oil production 14 percent in January  compared with the final three months of 2018  but foresees full year output trailing the 2018 figure as divestitures take a bite 
The U S  will likely pump a record 12 4 million barrels a day this year  13 percent higher than in 2018  according to the EIA  Most of the growth will come from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico 
 Operators are putting more attention on capital efficient operations and focusing more on core holdings   said Justin Lepore  a research associate at RS Energy Group   There s a focus on modest growth  ",2019-02-20,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/americas-shale-boom-keeps-rolling-even-as-wildcatters-save-cash-1784527,1784527

196493,418009,DVN,Canadian Natural  CNQ  Ups Oilsands Game With C 3 8B Buyout,opinion,In a bid to further solidify its position on its home turf  Canadian Natural Resources Limited   TSX CNQ   recently inked a mega deal of C 3 8 billion to snap up Devon Energy Corporation s   NYSE DVN   Canadian business  The pact represents Canadian Natural s biggest buyout since 2017  when it acquired Shell s  oilsands assets for C 8 16 billion Markedly  Canadian Natural   the largest energy producer in terms of volume in Canada and eighth largest explorer  excluding national oil companies  in the world   will boost output capacity to 1 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day  Mboe d  with this latest deal with Devon  This deal is a win win for both the firms  with shares of Canadian Natural and Devon up 3 73  and 0 94   respectively  post the announcement of the agreement Per the deal  Canadian Natural will acquire Devon s Jackfish oilsands project  heavy oil wells and undeveloped lands  Notably  the acquired assets netted 113 000 barrels of oil equivalent to Devon in the first quarter of 2019  The proved reserves associated with the holdings amounted to 409 million barrels of oil in 2018 Canadian Natural will borrow C 3 25 billion term loan to fund the deal and the rest will be financed via free cash flows of the firm  Subject to satisfactory closing conditions and regulatory approvals  the deal is set for closure on Jun 27 Devon s Strategic Sell Off to Streamline PortfolioAs we know  Devon already stated its intentions to exit Canadian operations  struggling with low oil prices and high costs  earlier this year in February  Pipeline construction in Canada has failed to keep pace with rising domestic oil  forcing producers to sell their products at a discounted rate  Pipeline pinch sent Canadian crude prices spiraling downward in 2018  which prompted the Alberta government to mandate production cuts  Reportedly  infrastructural bottlenecks are likely to lead to lost revenues of C 15 8 billion in 2018 Consequently  Devon s move to vend Canadian assets seems to be a prudent one  Devon will utilize the proceeds from the transaction to trim debt and deepen focus on high return U S  shale plays  It is hiving off non core Barnett Shale gas properties in Texas by the end of the year Canadian Natural s Opportunistic Purchase is an Excellent Fit Canadian Natural got hold of Devon s assets at a much lesser price than what most of the energy pundits predicted  considering there weren t many buyers of the holdings  While international energy explorers are anyway focusing on U S  shale plays  most of the Canadian companies are not very keen on acquiring new stakes in oilsands projects amid ongoing crisis in the Canadian energy industry  While Suncor Energy had already signaled its disinterest in making further investments in the country until the pipeline crisis gets resolved  Cenovus Energy  CVE  is yet to recover from its  17 7 billion acquisition deal of ConocoPhillips s oilsands properties Meanwhile  Canadian Natural has an impressive history of acquiring assets that are an excellent fit to the company  Apart from taking over Shell s oilsands holdings in Canada  the firm also snapped up Canadian holdings of Marathon Oil  NYSE MRO   Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC  Corporation and BP plc  LON BP  The Devon assets buyout will increase crude production capacity of Canadian Natural by 128 000 barrels a day  that too at a discounted price  enabling the firm to compete more strongly with Suncor   NYSE SU    which currently holds the leading position in the Canadian oilsands market Devon s Jackfish oilsands project is adjacent to Canadian Natural s Kirby North South projects  The complementary asset base has been the primary driver of the deal  With Devon s assets being within Canadian Natural s core production areas  it provides the latter with increased economies of scale and synergy benefits of C 135 million on an annualized basis  As Devon s assets fit well with Canadian Natural s land base  it will help the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company to squeeze down costs while boosting output  You can see  Amid the Canadian crisis  various energy biggies like Shell  LON RDSa   Statoil  OL EQNR   TOTAL SA and Conoco Phillips  among others  have jettisoned stakes in their Canadian properties  The latest deal leads to continuation of the trend of offloading stakes by foreign companies in Canadian oilsands  which are grappling with the notorious reputation of being eco unfriendly and suffering from pipeline shortage and huge costs With most of the international energy players exiting the Canadian energy market  majority of Canada s oilsands assets are concentrated in the hands of very few Canadian energy majors  In fact  Imperial Oil  Suncor  Cenovus and Canadian Natural will account for three fourths of the total oilsands output by next year The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires

196503,418019,DVN,DVN Or APC  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States stocks have likely encountered both Devon Energy  DVN  and Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   1  Strong Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
DVN currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 73  while APC has a forward P E of 26 54  We also note that DVN has a PEG ratio of 0 83  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  APC currently has a PEG ratio of 4 08 
Another notable valuation metric for DVN is its P B ratio of 1 59  Investors use the P B ratio to look at a stock s market value versus its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  APC has a P B of 3 45 
Based on these metrics and many more  DVN holds a Value grade of A  while APC has a Value grade of C 
Both DVN and APC are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that DVN is the superior value option right now ",2019-05-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dvn-or-apc-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200423490,200423490
196509,418025,DVN,U S  energy firms chasing oil price rally stumble on old baggage,news,"By David French NEW YORK  Reuters    With oil price recovery taking hold  several U S  oil and gas companies entered 2018 with a compelling plan   sell undeveloped or less essential fields and invest the money to boost returns from their sweetest  most productive spots  There is a catch  though  The strategy assumes that with crude now up more than 150 percent from its February 2016 bottom enough firms are keen to crank up production  even if it means buying fields with higher extraction costs and lower margins  So far  sale attempts suggest those buyers may be hard to come by  After a bruising downturn  shareholders are looking to get a cut of improved profits and asset sale proceeds rather than underwrite acquisitions  those involved in these deals say   Oil and gas companies are no longer rewarded for simply  grabbing land  and public investors have become more discerning regarding acquisitions   notes Jon Marinelli  head of U S  energy investment and corporate banking at BMO Capital Markets  Shares of  Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN    QEP Resources  Inc  N QEP  and Southwestern Energy Co  N SWN  and others have rallied after they floated plans to sell non core acreage  reflecting hopes that some of the proceeds will return to investors  But since shareholders across the industry in general favor shedding assets over acquisitions  the sentiment makes striking new deals tricky  An informal poll of five investment bankers by Reuters put the share of sales that failed to close in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of this year at between 50 percent and 80 percent  with Marinelli putting the figure at around two thirds  Dealmaking for oil and gas fields going into 2018 was already stagnating  While last year s total sales were only marginally down from 2016 at  67 3 billion  the first quarter accounted for around 38 percent of that figure  according to data provider PLS   Graphic    If proposed sales fail to materialize this year  it could mean a time of reckoning for these oil and gas firms   If these companies cannot execute the divestiture s  that gave investors  confidence on their future leverage profile  you would likely see less risk tolerant investors trim or sell their positions   said Tim Dumois  portfolio manager at  BP   LON BP  Capital Fund Advisors  which invests in energy stocks  Among those seeking spin offs  Anglo Australian miner BHP Billiton Ltd  AX BHP   L BLT  has the most ambitious plans  Facing the same pressure from shareholders as U S  energy producers  it wants to sell onshore shale assets in the Permian  Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins  valuing them at  14 billion on its balance sheet   While BHP s Permian and Eagle Ford land is generally considered attractive because of low production costs  one of the Eagle Ford asset packages and its Haynesville fields mainly produce shale gas  making them less appealing to buyers given stubbornly low gas prices   BHP would consider a bid that valued the entire business below the company s original valuation  if it ensured no unsold assets remained  according to people familiar with the sale process  The company received bids from interested parties on May 23  although a final decision on what it will do is not expected for a few months  PRIVATE EQUITY WARY For those weighing acquisitions  Bakken operator  Oasis Petroleum   N OAS  offers a cautionary tale  Shares in the company fell as much as 25 percent in the two days after it said on Dec  11 it paid  946 million for acreage in the Delaware Basin  Since then  major land purchases by U S  oil and gas firms have fizzled  with executives preaching focus on controlling costs and avoiding unnecessary expansion   We can do a whole lot of great work by hitting some singles   Brad Holly  chief executive officer of  Whiting Petroleum Corp   N WLL   told an industry event in April  drawing on a baseball metaphor to describe how the company was looking for some  really small things  to add to its existing acreage  In the absence of companies as buyers  private equity firms have picked up some slack  the value of land bought by buyout firms rose to 47 percent of the total in the fourth quarter from 11 percent in the first three months of 2017  according to PLS  However  the run up in oil prices  rather than whet their appetite further has an opposite effect  making private equity firms wary that prices may not be as strong when they are ready to cash out  Higher crude prices also boost sellers  expectations  making it harder for buyout firms to drive a hard bargain to ensure better future profits  Such calculations gain added significance after years of returns on energy stocks trailing other sectors   If energy equity markets are underperforming the wider S P  this reduces the chance of private equity buying larger assets because you don t think you ll get a good runway for an exit   said Glenn Jacobson  partner at Trilantic Capital Partners  Some sellers have now started moderating their expectations  Hunt Oil Company for example  owned by one of Texas  wealthiest families  split a package of Eagle Ford land it was marketing for up to  700 million in the fourth quarter into three individual pieces  according to a person familiar with the transaction  Two bits went to private equity buyers  with a third sold to  Penn Virginia Corp   O PVAC  for  86 million  the person added  
 The decision becomes do you hold your nose and sell  or do you retain the asset   said BMO s Marinelli ",2018-06-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-energy-firms-chasing-oil-price-rally-stumble-on-old-baggage-1492398,1492398

Looking at the history of these trends  perhaps none is more beloved than value investing  This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market  Value investors use a variety of methods  including tried and true valuation metrics  to find these stocks 
On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today

Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  This is a prefered metric because revenue can t really be manipulated  so sales are often a truer performance indicator  DVN has a P S ratio of 1 3  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 33 
Finally  investors should note that DVN has a P CF ratio of 2 96  This figure highlights a company s operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook  DVN s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 5 89  Within the past 12 months  DVN s P CF has been as high as 12 06 and as low as 2 18  with a median of 3 70

196525,418041,DVN,Devon Energy  DVN  Q1 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"Devon Energy  DVN  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 36 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 30 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 20 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 20   A quarter ago  it was expected that this oil and gas exploration company would post earnings of  0 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 10  delivering a surprise of  67 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
Devon Energy  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry  posted revenues of  1 50 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 40 48   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 81 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Devon Energy shares have added about 45 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 4  
What s Next for Devon Energy 
While Devon Energy has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Devon Energy was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 50 on  2 72 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 02 on  10 82 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States is currently in the top 25  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/devon-energy-dvn-q1-earnings-top-estimates-200413384,200413384

196536,418052,DVN,Devon Energy  DVN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Devon Energy  DVN  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas exploration company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 26 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  30  
Revenues are expected to be  2 26 billion  down 40 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 39 78  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Devon Energy 
For Devon Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  21 28  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Devon Energy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Devon Energy would post earnings of  0 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 10  delivering a surprise of  67 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Devon Energy appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/devon-energy-dvn-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200409517,200409517

below  7 million bpd in April  much lower than Saudi s previous estimate of 10 million bpd On Jan 28  the U S  government announced sanctions on Venezuela  According to the International Energy Agency  IEA   Venezuela s crude output is likely to decline from 1 3 million bpd in 2018 to 750 000 bpd in 2019 owing to U S  sanctions  Moreover  oil export dropped by 159 000 bpd to just under 2 8 million

196554,418070,DVN,Trump EPA pick  no plans to review finding that CO2 is dangerous,news,"By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    President elect Donald Trump s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency expressed doubt about the science behind global climate change during a contentious Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday  but added he would be obliged for now to uphold the EPA s finding carbon dioxide poses a public danger  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt  48  sued the agency he intends to run more than a dozen times on behalf of his state  leading both his opponents and supporters to believe he will aggressively carry out Trump s campaign vows to slash EPA regulation to boost domestic oil and gas drilling and coal mining   Science tells us that the climate is changing  and that human activity  in some manner  impacts that change   Pruitt said during the hearing in front of the Environment and Public Works Committee   The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact  and what to do about it  are subject to continuing debate and dialogue   Responding to a question from Democratic Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts  Pruitt said he would be obliged as administrator to initially abide by the EPA finding that carbon dioxide and other gases scientists believe contribute to climate change pose a risk to the public  That is a premise for many of the regulations limiting carbon emissions imposed during President Barack Obama s tenure   There s nothing that I know of that would cause a review at this point   he said  Trump has promised to refocus the EPA on its core values of protecting air and water quality  while scrapping many of Obama s initiatives to combat climate change by targeting carbon dioxide emissions  That stance has triggered an international diplomatic backlash  worried environmentalists  and cast a cloud of doubt over the future of a global pact to combat climate change and its effects  signed in Paris last year  U S  government agencies said on Wednesday that world temperatures in 2016 hit a record high for the third year in a row   Why are folks so concerned     We re concerned that we won t be fine with the environment   said Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware   That s why you have the kind of concern you re witnessing here today   In prepared remarks that were interrupted by protesters shouting  There is no planet B   Pruitt said he would seek to ensure environmental rules imposed by the EPA were effective  but without hurting development    Environmental regulations should not occur in an economic vacuum  We can simultaneously pursue the mutual goals of environmental protection and economic growth   he said  He added that he would seek to give states more authority to regulate their own environmental issues  Pruitt said he would recuse himself from ongoing cases against the EPA that he is involved in if the EPA s ethics commission required him to do so  INDUSTRY TIES For weeks  environmental groups have campaigned to urge lawmakers to block Pruitt s nomination  saying he is doing the bidding of energy companies and industry groups that have contributed to his election campaigns  During the hearing  Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon showed a blown up image of a letter Pruitt sent to the current EPA administrator several years ago opposing regulations limiting methane emissions from the energy sector  Merkley said it had been written by Oklahoma company  Devon Energy   NYSE DVN   Pruitt responded by saying the letter was not sent on behalf of any one company but on behalf of an entire industry that is important to the state s economy New Jersey Democratic Senator Corey Booker later asked Pruitt if he had sent similar letters of behalf of Oklahoma citizens affected by pollution  citing statistics showing the state has among the highest asthma rates in the country   Did you even file one lawsuit on behalf of those kids   Republicans on the committee meanwhile focused their questions on how Pruitt will work to avoid pollution crises like the lead contamination crisis affecting Flint  Michigan  and criticized the Obama administration s climate regulations  Asked what would be his guiding philosophy as EPA administrator  he said   I believe that the role of the regulator is to make things regular   and restoring confidence and certainty to those that are regulated   He said he would also support the U S  renewable fuels standard  which requires biofuels like ethanol to be blended in gasoline  but said the program needed some tweaks  Several conservative groups and political action committees supported Pruitt in advance of the hearing  including the PAC Freedom Works  America Rising Squared  a registered nonprofit backing conservative issues  and the National Association of Manufacturers

196555,418071,DVN,Red tape chokes off drilling on Native American reservations,news,"By Valerie Volcovici FORT BERTHOLD  North Dakota  Reuters    When the U S  oil boom hit North Dakota a decade ago  wells sprang up quickly on the edges of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation  an expanse of prairie and rolling hills three times larger than Los Angeles  Tribe members here  facing a 40 percent unemployment rate and sending their children to 1950s era school buildings  were eager to tap some of state s most promising reserves  But layers of federal regulation   applying only to tribal lands   slowed them down for years  frightened away investors and cost them millions of dollars   The reservation looked like the hole of a donut   said Marcus Levings  who was chairman of Mandan  Hidatsa and Arikara  MHA  Nation s reservation at the time   Everything around us was moving  and there was nothing in the middle   Fort Berthold has since caught up to become one of the state s most productive regions  But the initial delays undermined the MHA Nation s sense of sovereignty and cost it badly needed revenue   an experience echoed in widespread complaints from other tribes and from energy firms  including some owned by Native Americans   Now  with U S  President Donald Trump in office and oil prices rising  their frustration is fueling a renewed push to streamline approvals for drilling and mining on Indian reservations  Clearing regulatory hurdles for a single project on tribal lands can take as many as 50 steps  compared to a half dozen for oil wells on private property  The process can take three times as long to complete  according to tribal leaders  lawyers specializing in Native American issues  oil company executives and federal regulators  Officials at the agency overseeing that process   the U S  Bureau of Indian Affairs  BIA   a division of the Department of Interior   did not respond to repeated requests for comment  A spokesperson for Trump  who campaigned on a promise to slash energy regulation  declined a request for comment  The stakes are high  Native American reservations cover just 2 percent of the nation s surface  but by some estimates contain as much as a fifth of all U S  oil and gas reserves  along with vast coal stockpiles   Some tribes  for environmental or cultural reasons  have shunned the idea of developing these reserves  but many others want to tap the vast wealth beneath their homelands  A coalition of Native Americans appointed by Trump s team to guide his Indian policy is researching proposals to make energy development easier on tribal lands   including the controversial idea of transferring them to private ownership   That coalition met privately in Washington last month with tribal representatives and Trump s team  and the group listed deregulation of energy development on reservations as a high priority  according to a person who attended the meeting  Representatives of the coalition did not respond to requests for comment   Congress  now firmly in Republican control after November s election  also appears poised to act  The Indian affairs committees in the House and Senate are planning to re introduce legislation this year that would streamline Bureau of Indian Affairs approval processes for tribal energy resource agreements  said Senator John Hoeven  a Republican from North Dakota and the new chair of the Senate Indian affairs committee  U S  Representative Raul Grijalva  a Democrat from Arizona  has opposed previous efforts to relax energy regulations on tribal lands  including a 2015 proposal he argues would have undermined public input before project approvals  That could weaken the legal arguments of residents impacted by environmental damage  he said in an interview   The regulations are there for the public  including tribal members  to know what the intended and unintended consequences of that project are going to be   he said  WAIT  WAIT  WAIT The United States holds title to about 56 million acres of tribal lands  a vestige of the treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers  The tribes have rights to the land   and the resources under the surface   but they do not own it   On Fort Berthold and other reservations  energy development requires a uniquely large number of easements and environmental permits  all of which must be approved by multiple federal agencies in a process overseen by the Bureau of Indian Affairs  Former North Dakota Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan   who was in office when the shale boom hit his state   said he understood that regulations can preserve Native American culture by keeping tribal lands environmentally sound and off the real estate market  But he also said he recognized them as a bottleneck   It shouldn t be a reason for holding up development   Dorgan told Reuters in an interview   If ever there was a place in North Dakota that needed this development most  it is on reservations   A 2015 report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that the problems went beyond the processes in law and regulations  Poor management by the Bureau of Indians Affairs has hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes  the office concluded   One tribe  according to the report  saw permit reviews stretching to as long as eight years and missed out on than  95 million in revenues it could have earned from royalties  oil and gas severance taxes and tribal permitting fees  The report also found that BIA offices were understaffed and had failed to keep adequate records  Dave Williams  CEO of MHA Nation chartered energy company Missouri River Resources  said his firm has learned how to work around the regulatory process  but called it frustrating  He said he knows most of the employees at the BIA s regional office on the reservation in New Town  and tries to prod them to get things done  with a friendly touch    It is discouraging because everything gets bureaucratized   just wait  wait  wait   especially if you re an oil guy  and most of your life you are on time and get things done   he said   Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including  Devon Energy  Corp  NYSE DVN   Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY    BP   LON BP  and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments  Those companies did not respond to requests for comment         TRIBAL OPPOSITION  SOLIDARITY A substantial segment of the Native American community continues to oppose energy development on tribal land or would like to see it limited  The Northern Cheyenne in Montana  for example  live atop rich coal reserves but have shunned mining it because they fear it will bring pollution and undermine their way of life   The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota has galvanized the U S  environmental movement with its ongoing protests against a pipeline constructed near its reservation  But many tribes that supported the Standing Rock protests were motivated by protecting a tribe s right to govern itself rather than by opposition to fossil fuel development  Among the tribes backing the protests were the Southern Ute Tribe in Colorado  the Ute Tribe of Utah  the Montana Crow and the Navajo Nation across the Southwest  all of which are pursuing energy development on their own lands  Tribes are also seeking to curtail what they call unjust taxation of energy projects on tribal lands by states in which their reservations are located  For many tribal leaders  the desire for more control over drilling projects is as much about self determination as money   We ve always wanted jurisdiction over our people and our land to the fullest extent possible   said Jackson Brossy  executive director of the Navajo Nation s Washington office   Back in Fort Berthold  MHA Nation Councilman Fred Fox said he felt it was time for Washington to hand more responsibility for tribal lands back to the tribes  They should not be managed as U S  owned  public lands   he said  but rather as sovereign Native American nations   
 We have ancestors that owned these lands   he said  looking out over a snow covered settlement in the White Shield section of the reservation   Let us collect our own taxes  Let us create economic viability for our people  Let us create the regulatory system  ",2017-01-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/red-tape-chokes-off-drilling-on-native-american-reservations-456073,456073

On top of the Zacks Rank  investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits  For example  value investors will want to focus on the  Value  category  Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and  A  grades for Value will be some of the highest quality value stocks on the market today 
Devon Energy  DVN  is a stock many investors are watching right now  DVN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   as well as a Value grade of A 
Value investors also use the P S ratio  The P S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  DVN has a P S ratio of 1 1  This compares to its industry s average P S of 1 49 
Finally  we should also recognize that DVN has a P CF ratio of 3 05  This metric focuses on a firm s operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook  DVN s current P CF looks attractive when compared to its industry s average P CF of 5 06  Within the past 12 months  DVN s P CF has been as high as 12 28 and as low as 2 18  with a median of 5 53

196571,418087,DVN,A Texas unicorn preps for a rare oil IPO,news,"By Mike Stone  Reuters    Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC is a unicorn roaming the barren landscape of West Texas  Founded by a retired NFL player and his high school buddy   with land deals signed on the hood of a pickup   the Fort Worth oil and gas company is now worth nearly  3 billion  according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value  That s triple the  1 billion threshold for a so called unicorn  the moniker most often used in Silicon Valley for high value private companies  An IPO would be a crowning achievement for John Sellers and Cody Campbell  who co founded predecessor companies starting in early 2009  The valuation is based on prices paid for mineral rights in the Permian Basin  where the duo has leased more than 65 000 net acres of oil rich land in the past two years  Demand has soared here because of new drilling techniques that can extract crude at a profit despite low oil prices  The success of any Double Eagle IPO would depend on whether the oil price recovery holds  but that uncertainty doesn t bother the Texans   so far  they have made a fortune off the price crash   Had it not been for the turndown   Sellers said   we would never have seen as many opportunities to put together so much acreage   Until now  most energy companies have been bought out before going public  but the successful IPO this month of Extraction Oil   Gas  O XOG    the first stock market debut of a U S  oil and gas explorer in more than two years   could pave the way for more  The Double Eagle business model is not new  Dale Operating  a private company in Dallas  has leased and sold 17 portfolios of assets since 1982  It is a high risk endeavor because leases can run out before drilling succeeds   It s possible to be directionally right  but lose if it does not happen in time   said Larry Dale  the president of Dale Operating  Now  Double Eagle is ramping up the risk by becoming a drilling company  competing against established Permian Basin players such as RSP Permian Inc  N RSPP  and Callon Petroleum Co  N CPE   BUGS CRAWLING THE WALLS Sellers and Campbell got into the oil business after the 2008 U S  housing crash ended their separate careers as real estate developers  Sellers had gone into real estate after college  and Campbell had done so in 2006 after a pectoral muscle tear cut short his 17 month career as an offensive lineman with the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League  Nearly broke  Sellers and Campbell relied on bank loans and help from friends and family to get started  Unlike larger competitors  who outsource the search for lease rights to local agents  the two men searched land registers themselves for mineral deeds  then followed up personally with the landowners  usually small farmers in Texas and Louisiana  They often sealed deals for lease options on 200 or 500 acres at a time with handshakes outside the local grain elevator  The goal was to sell groups of leases to drillers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp  N CHK  or  Devon Energy  Corp  N DVN   In the early days  they worked out of an old Texaco field office in rural Texas  Bugs crawled the walls  The two men  still in their twenties  shot cans out back for fun   Every deal was critical   Sellers said in an interview at Double Eagle s more upmarket current headquarters in Fort Worth   If they didn t sell  we were done   CASHING IN During a particularly cash strapped moment  they bought one landowner a round trip  first class ticket to London   spending  9 800 on a credit card with a  10 000 limit   as a form of payment to extend their lease option on his land  The lease on that land was eventually sold  to Endeavor Energy Resources LP  one day in January 2009   an hour before the option expired   in a hotel lobby in Tyler  Texas  The landowner wept when he got a check for  5 5 million for his mineral rights  Sellers and Campbell made enough to pay off their debts and went on to secure more than ten thousand leases covering more than a million acres  selling them off in bundles  By 2012  with the price of oil at about  100 per barrel  Double Eagle s success caught the ear of Wall Street  Greg Beard  Head of Natural Resources at private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC  recalled thinking after he first met them in Ft  Worth   We have to work with these guys   Apollo invested  and less than two years later  in November 2014  Sellers and Campbell sold one of their many business entities  Double Eagle Energy Oklahoma LLC  for  251 million to Aubrey McClendon s American Energy Partners L P  Apollo reaped a four fold return from its early investment on acreage in the Oklahoma formation known as the SCOOP  which is now crowded with drillers  The sale couldn t have come at a better time  The price of oil had already peaked and was heading toward a 12 year low of about  28 per barrel  Apollo s investment in Double Eagle represents a new tack by private equity firms   backing modern wildcatters to gradually build portfolios of mineral rights  The move comes after some spectacular failures in traditional leveraged buyouts of energy companies  KKR   Co LP s  N KKR   7 2 billion acquisition of Samson Resources Corp  for instance  ended in bankruptcy last year when shale drilling became more expensive than the debt laden company could handle  Apollo s EP Energy Corp  N EPE   also purchased in a leveraged buyout  has lost four fifths of its stock value in the oil market rout since the exploration and production company went public in January 2014 at a valuation of more than  5 billion  BASIN ECONOMICS Sellers and Campbell sensed opportunity as the price headed south  They focused on the Midland Basin  a rocky area of the Permian basin where technological advances had made it profitable to drill even with prices at  35 a barrel  They deployed the same model   searching land registers and dealing with landowners directly   but this time with a staff of more than 50  Deals still get done on the hoods of trucks  Apollo has again teamed up with them and  together with Campbell and Sellers  have invested more than  500 million  Starting next month  Double Eagle will drill on their leased land instead of flipping the mineral rights  It has hired a well completion expert to prepare for drilling  and in August brought on a chief financial officer with public company experience to prep for an IPO  In October  the company merged with Veritas Energy   increasing its leased acreage by about a third   and created Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC  The timing again looks fortuitous  with oil prices up more than 10 percent this month on prospects that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and other major producers will agree a sizeable output cut or freeze  Sellers and Campbell are counting on their West Texas location to help them hedge against the additional risks of drilling  
 Even if the rest of the industry crumbles  that basin is going to stand on its own   Campbell said   It has the best economics of any North American basin  ",2016-10-18,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/double-eagle-energy,-a-texas-unicorn,-preps-for-a-rare-oil-ipo-433006",433006

196574,418090,DVN,Trump advisors aim to privatize oil rich Indian reservations,news,"By Valerie Volcovici WASHINGTON  Reuters    Native American reservations cover just 2 percent of the United States  but they may contain about a fifth of the nation s oil and gas  along with vast coal reserves  Now  a group of advisors to President elect Donald Trump on Native American issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to 56 million acres of tribal lands  two chairmen of the coalition told Reuters in exclusive interviews   The group proposes to put those lands into private ownership   a politically explosive idea that could upend more than century of policy designed to preserve Indian tribes on U S  owned reservations  which are governed by tribal leaders as sovereign nations   The tribes have rights to use the land  but they do not own it  They can drill it and reap the profits  but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property   We should take tribal land away from public treatment   said Markwayne Mullin  a Republican U S  Representative from Oklahoma and a Cherokee tribe member who is co chairing Trump s Native American Affairs Coalition   As long as we can do it without unintended consequences  I think we will have broad support around Indian country   Trump s transition team did not respond to multiple requests for comment  The plan dovetails with Trump s larger aim of slashing regulation to boost energy production  It could deeply divide Native American leaders  who hold a range of opinions on the proper balance between development and conservation  The proposed path to deregulated drilling   privatizing reservations   could prove even more divisive  Many Native Americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self determination and culture   Our spiritual leaders are opposed to the privatization of our lands  which means the commoditization of the nature  water  air we hold sacred   said Tom Goldtooth  a member of both the Navajo and the Dakota tribes who runs the Indigenous Environmental Network   Privatization has been the goal since colonization   to strip Native Nations of their sovereignty   Reservations governed by the U S  Bureau of Indian Affairs are intended in part to keep Native American lands off the private real estate market  preventing sales to non Indians  An official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to a request for comment  The legal underpinnings for reservations date to treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers  Tribal governments decide how land and resources are allotted among tribe members  Leaders of Trump s coalition did not provide details of how they propose to allocate ownership of the land or mineral rights   or to ensure they remained under Indian control  One idea is to limit sales to non Indian buyers  said Ross Swimmer  a co chair on Trump s advisory coalition and an ex chief of the Cherokee nation who worked on Indian affairs in the Reagan administration   It has to be done with an eye toward protecting sovereignty   he said   1 5 TRILLION IN RESERVES  The Trump appointed coalition s proposal comes against a backdrop of broader environmental tensions on Indian reservations  including protests against a petroleum pipeline by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their supporters in North Dakota  On Sunday  amid rising opposition  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday said it had denied a permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline project  citing a need to explore alternate routes   The Trump transition team has expressed support for the pipeline  however  and his administration could revisit the decision once it takes office in January   Tribes and their members could potentially reap vast wealth from more easily tapping resources beneath reservations  The Council of Energy Resource Tribes  a tribal energy consortium  estimated in 2009 that Indian energy resources are worth about  1 5 trillion  In 2008  the Bureau of Indian Affairs testified before Congress that reservations contained about 20 percent of untapped oil and gas reserves in the U S  Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including  Devon Energy  Corp  NYSE DVN   Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY    BP   LON BP  and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments  Those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment  Trump s transition team commissioned the 27 member Native American Affairs Coalition to draw up a list of proposals to guide his Indian policy on issues ranging from energy to health care and education   The backgrounds of the coalition s leadership are one sign of its pro drilling bent  At least three of four chair level members have links to the oil industry  Mullin received about eight percent of his campaign funding over the years from energy companies  while co chair Sharon Clahchischilliage   a Republican New Mexico State Representative and Navajo tribe member   received about 15 percent from energy firms  according to campaign finance disclosures reviewed by Reuters   Swimmer is a partner at a Native American focused investment fund that has invested heavily in oil and gas companies  including Energy Transfer Partners   the owner of the pipeline being protested in North Dakota  ETP did not immediately respond to a request for comment   The fourth co chair  Eddie Tullis  a former chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama  is involved in casino gaming  a major industry on reservations  Clahchischilliage and Tullis did not respond to requests for comment  BUREAUCRATIC THICKET Several tribes  including the Crow Nation in Montana and the Southern Ute in Colorado  have entered into mining and drilling deals that generate much needed revenue for tribe members and finance health  education and infrastructure projects on their reservations  But a raft of federal permits are required to lease  mortgage  mine  or drill   a bureaucratic thicket that critics say contributes to higher poverty on reservations   As U S  oil and gas drilling boomed over the past decade  tribes struggled to capitalize  A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office found that poor management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes    The time it takes to go from lease to production is three times longer on trust lands than on private land   said Mark Fox  chairman of the Three Affiliated Tribes in Forth Berthold  North Dakota  which produces about 160 000 barrels of oil per day    If privatizing has some kind of a meaning that rights are given to private entities over tribal land  then that is worrying   Fox acknowledged   But if it has to do with undoing federal burdens that can occur  there might be some justification   HISTORY OF  TERMINATION  The contingent of Native Americans who fear tribal land privatization cite precedents of lost sovereignty and culture  The Dawes Act of 1887 offered Indians private lots in exchange for becoming U S  citizens   resulting in more than 90 million acres passing out of Indian hands between the 1880s and 1930s  said Kevin Washburn  who served as Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior from 2012 until he resigned in December 2015   Privatization of Indian lands during the 1880s is widely viewed as one of the greatest mistakes in federal Indian policy   said Washburn  a citizen of Oklahoma s Chickasaw Nation  Congress later adopted the so called  termination  policy in 1953  designed to assimilate Native Americans into U S  society  Over the next decade  some 2 5 million acres of land were removed from tribal control  and 12 000 Native Americans lost their tribal affiliation   Mullin and Swimmer said the coalition does not want to repeat past mistakes and will work to preserve tribal control of reservations  They said they also will aim to retain federal support to tribes  which amounts to nearly  20 billion a year  according to a Department of Interior report in 2013  Mullin said the finalized proposal could result in Congressional legislation as early as next year  Washburn said he doubted such a bill could pass  but Gabe Galanda  a Seattle based lawyer specializing in Indian law  said it could be possible with Republican control of the White House and the U S  House and Senate   Legal challenges to such a law could also face less favorable treatment from a U S  Supreme Court with a conservative majority  he said  Trump will soon have the chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia  a conservative member who died earlier this year  
 With this alignment in the White House  Congress and the Supreme Court   he said   we should be concerned about erosion of self determination  if not a return to termination  ",2016-12-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-advisors-aim-to-privatize-oil-rich-indian-reservations-445612,445612

196577,418093,DVN,Analysts Estimate Devon Energy  DVN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Devon Energy  DVN  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 19  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil and gas exploration company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 34 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 10 billion  down 47 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11 86  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Devon Energy 
For Devon Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  6 35  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Devon Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Devon Energy would post earnings of  0 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 63  delivering a surprise of  46 51  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Devon Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-devon-energy-dvn-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200386947,200386947

196595,418111,DVN,Special report  As oil boom goes bust  Oklahoma protects drillers and squeezes schools,news,"By Luc Cohen and Joshua Schneyer NEWCASTLE  Okla   Reuters    After intense lobbying  Oklahoma s oilmen scored a victory two years ago  State lawmakers voted to keep in place some of the lowest taxes on oil and gas production in the United States   a break worth  470 million in fiscal year 2015 alone  The state s schools haven t been so fortunate  In Newcastle  23 miles from the capital of Oklahoma City  John Cerny recently learned that the school attended by his five year old granddaughter  Adelynn  will open just four days a week next year  The Bridge Creek school district will slash spending because of a projected  1 3 billion state budget shortfall next year  Beth Lawton teaches first grade at Broadmoore Elementary in Moore  a city of 59 000 bordering the capital  In April  she and several colleagues were told their contracts won t be renewed because of funding cuts  Broadmoore s class sizes are expected to rise next year as a result   I think our lawmakers have failed us  and I don t understand how little they value education   Lawton said   Oklahoma s school funding crisis is part of the pain inflicted by falling oil prices on energy rich states across America that rely on natural resources taxes to pay their governments  bills  But the crisis in Oklahoma is especially dire  exacerbated by a legacy of large tax breaks bestowed upon oil companies  Before the recent 60 percent decline in oil prices  a drilling bonanza minted millionaires and billionaires in Oklahoma  The boom turned sleepy Oklahoma City into a thriving hub for drillers like  Devon Energy   N DVN   Chesapeake Energy  N CHK  and Continental Resources  N CLR    the troika that lobbied hardest for the tax break extension  The rebuilt downtown hosts top notch dining  hotels  arts venues  and a top NBA basketball team  But as private oil wealth created these emblems of prosperity  public services have come under severe strain  In contrast to other energy states  Oklahoma didn t fill state coffers during flush years  Oklahoma taxed new oil and gas production from its prolific horizontal wells   the big money makers of the fracking industry   at rates as low as 1 percent throughout the shale boom  In North Dakota s giant Bakken oilfield  the going rate was 11 5 percent  MISSED OPPORTUNITY  The state actually began cutting back on funding for Oklahoma school children before the bust  and education funding is likely to contract much further  said Ryan Owens  a co director at the Cooperative Council for Oklahoma School Administration  a professional association of educators   Oil was  100 a barrel  and we still had less money per student   Owens said   We had an opportunity and we missed it   Shale regions are hurting across the country  Since 2014  the U S  energy industry has shed more than 100 000 jobs  But during the drilling spree of 2008 to 2014  oil rich states like North Dakota and Texas saw a sharp rise in oil and gas tax revenue and salted away a chunk of it for education  Over the same period  Oklahoma s oil and gas production tax revenue slid 32 percent  in spite of soaring oil prices and a doubling of oil output   The state legislature can t help when oil and natural gas falls   said David Morrow  the Bridge Creek schools superintendent   What has got the state of Oklahoma  in my opinion  is everything we gave away   Oklahoma lawmakers voted on Thursday to eliminate a separate subsidy for the worst performing wells in order to help plug the budget gap  While barely utilized during the boom years  the cost of that tax credit grew to more than  130 million in 2015  as sinking prices made more wells unprofitable   Overall  Oklahoma s  3 billion education budget has been cut by  58 million since January  Though next year s funding remains uncertain  the state s projected 18 percent budget deficit has schools preparing for the worst  Across the state  at least 100 Oklahoma school districts are considering shorter weeks or school years  and 1 000 school jobs are at risk  according to the Cooperative Council  A SMILING BOY Among the hardship measures being implemented  according to recent school surveys  bigger class sizes  teacher pay cuts and hiring freezes  cutbacks in arts  athletics and foreign language instruction  fewer offerings for special needs and gifted students  and a moratorium on field trips   The Oklahoma oil industry is publicizing the role energy taxes play in helping fund schools  In March  a poster in the lobby of driller Continental Resources  headquarters featured a smiling boy and read   Oklahoma oil   gas produces my education    Kristin Thomas  a spokeswoman for Continental  said the industry and its employees are the state s largest bloc of taxpayers  while drillers pay billions more in royalties to landowners  She said tax breaks for other industries  such as wind energy  have hurt education funding    We don t have a revenue problem in Oklahoma   Thomas said   We have a spending problem    The wind industry received tax credits and exemptions worth  306 million from 2004 to 2015  the Oklahoma Tax Commission said  State revenue data reviewed by Reuters show the horizontal drilling tax breaks topped  1 billion between fiscal years 2012 and 2015 alone   Oklahoma s education spending per pupil fell by 24 percent between 2008 and 2016  the biggest drop in the country  according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities  a Washington D C  group that tracks budget and tax issues on behalf of low income people   In North Dakota  where recent budget cuts have been less severe  spending per pupil grew 26 percent over the same period  the biggest gain in the country  Tax revenue on oil production helped North Dakota stash away more than  3 2 billion in an investment fund  in addition to  614 million set aside exclusively for schools  In Oklahoma  Governor Mary Fallin recently used the state s  300 million rainy day fund for a  50 million  one time fix  for public schools  Fallin declined an interview request  A spokesman said the tax breaks were created by her predecessors  A large portion of the tax on oil and gas production is funneled into Oklahoma s General Revenue Fund  which provides schools with around half their funding  Many school districts also receive oil production tax money directly  based on output in their counties   HAPPY TO KEEP THIS AT ZERO  In 1994  Oklahoma began taxing new output from horizontal wells at just 1 percent  compared to 7 percent for conventional vertical wells  When the so called incentive rates were first enacted  they were meant to be temporary support for what was then a nascent drilling technology   Horizontal wells have bores that extend lengthwise into reservoirs of oil and gas trapped in porous shale rock  The fossil fuels are typically unleashed by the process known as hydraulic fracturing  or fracking   blasting the rock with a mixture of water and chemicals  Horizontal fracking wells have become central to the recent shale oil and gas boom in Oklahoma and around the United States  Over the years  Oklahoma s lawmakers repeatedly extended the tax breaks on horizontal wells  even as the technology became common and far more productive  oil prices rose and output surged   State tax regimes are often complex  In Oklahoma  horizontal wells were taxed at a discounted rate in their first years but subject to the nominal 7 percent rate after several years of production  The incentive rates were set to expire in 2015  a scenario that would have made all wells subject to 7 percent taxes through their lifespan  But the biggest drillers were keen to protect the reprieve from the higher rates  Horizontal wells often pump out their bounty quickly  generating their highest production by far during their first few years  So in 2014  the three big drillers made a lobbying push for lawmakers to make permanent the favorable tax treatment on early production  They had to fend off warnings about falling state energy tax revenues from critics of the breaks  such as Tulsa billionaire George Kaiser   Kaiser  whose interests include drilling  banking and philanthropy  urged lawmakers to let the tax breaks expire as planned  The benefits mainly went to out of state shareholders in oil companies  he told them  while ordinary Oklahomans paid the price through underfunded public services   Some lawmakers agreed  Mark McCullough was one of the few House Republicans to oppose extending the incentive  Horizontal drilling technology  is now very mature and widely used   he said during the 2014 debate   Is it really an incentive anymore  Or are we now getting into something else    BIG BREAK Today  McCullough says  it s clear that the enduring tax breaks were disastrous for state revenues  but a majority of lawmakers were quick to side with drillers during the boom    Oil and gas has a ton of weight  and by darn they wanted their credit   McCullough told Reuters   By golly they got their credit    To help win over lawmakers  Devon hosted dozens of them in its Oklahoma City skyscraper before the 2014 floor vote  The company had several talking points  according to state legislator Pat Ownbey  who attended the meeting  Among them  Higher taxes would only hurt state revenue  by prompting frackers to abandon Oklahoma for other states    While some may think that raising taxes on the oil and gas industry could provide additional funding for education  drilling less wells in the state will end up decreasing total revenue traditionally designated for education in the long run   Devon wrote in a later public statement   On April 29  2014  three weeks before lawmakers voted to extend tax breaks  Fallin and Oklahoma s finance secretary  Preston Doerflinger  held a private meeting at the governor s mansion with Devon s chairman and the chief executives of Chesapeake and Continental  The topic was oil production taxes  Doerflinger s spokesman said  Those same companies were hoping for a 2 percent tax rate on horizontal wells for their first four years in operation  according to local media reports   The following month  a 2 to 1 majority of Oklahoma lawmakers voted to tax all horizontal and vertical wells at 2 percent for the first three years of production  That s when horizontal wells yield the most oil   and the most potential tax  After three years  output from a typical horizontal oil well in the state has declined by 86 to 89 percent from peak levels  according to industry consultant Drillinginfo  Drillers cheered the outcome  which was similar to their own proposal  For the first time  the vote would make the tax breaks permanent  Though it lifted the tax burden from 1 percent to 2 percent during a well s early years  oil companies were now guaranteed some of the most driller friendly rates in the country   Chesapeake declined to comment for this story  Devon referred Reuters to an industry trade group  the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association   I PAY MY TAXES  Its president  Mike Terry  said the low production taxes kept Oklahoma competitive and have helped make it  the most resilient in the nation at weathering the downturn in oil prices   The number of rigs exploring for oil and gas in Oklahoma has fallen by 59 percent since late 2014  compared with a decline of 66 percent nationwide  he said  The legislative record shows that oil companies found a sympathetic audience at the capitol   I find it odd that we re thinking about castigating our number one industry instead of getting down and thanking them   state representative Leslie Osborn said during a legislative debate before the vote   I would have been happy to keep this at zero percent    Osborn s district includes Oklahoma City  which in March announced plans to lay off 208 teachers and in April said it would fire 92 school administrators  The steps will save about  13 million a year   Osborn didn t respond to requests for comment about the school cuts   Over Oklahoma s boom period  energy production tax revenues fell instead of rising  The opposite happened in North Dakota and Texas  which saw big increases in revenue  In 2014  Oklahoma s take was  860 million  down from a  1 3 billion peak in 2008  That s partly because over time  more and more of Oklahoma s production came from horizontal wells  taxed at the far lower rate  To be sure  lower natural gas prices also explain part of Oklahoma s revenue crunch  Between 2008 and 2014  gas prices fell by around 50 percent  even as oil prices frequently topped the  100 a barrel mark   Still  the tax breaks alone cost Oklahoma around  800 million over the same period  according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute  a Tulsa think tank that draws some of its funding from Kaiser   Driller tax breaks have taken a toll in some other states  Louisiana exempts horizontal wells from tax for up to two years if drilling costs aren t recouped first  The state s Legislative Auditor said the breaks cost  1 1 billion from 2010 to 2014  But Louisiana hasn t cut school funding as sharply as Oklahoma has  Per pupil spending is down 1 4 percent since 2008   In Inola  Oklahoma  30 miles east of Tulsa  37 year old machinist Jack Foster has four young sons enrolled in public school  where four day weeks are already in effect  The family is unhappy about the cost cuts  and has to make alternative plans for the boys once a week

196600,418116,DVN,Week Ahead  Equity Rout To Continue Or Holiday Rally Ahead  ,opinion,"Major indices fall  S P 500 enters official correction territory
Treasuries rise  boosting dollar  further pressuring oil and commodities
Bitcoin falls below  4 000
Oil s slide toward  50 weighed on equities last week  Friday s stock market losses for the Dow and NASDAQ Composite capped a tough week for both major indices  However  the most significant losses were for the S P 500  which after its 0 66  decline on the final day of trade during the holiday shortened week  slipped into an official correction as it hit cumulative losses of 10 percent 
The benchmark was pulled down by energy companies tracking oil s fall to its lowest level in a year  Crude s oversupply also pressured commodity prices  The dollar climbed in tandem with Treasuries  adding to the pressure 
Weekly Selloff Leaves Every Sector In the Red
The S P 500 Index declined 0 66 percent Friday  dragged down by Energy sector shares   3 14 percent   with companies like Devon Energy  NYSE DVN  and Marathon Oil  NYSE MRO  losing at least 4 percent each  Communication Services   1 31 percent  was the second worst performer  though it lagged Energy by almost two percent 
On a weekly basis  the benchmark extended the selloff by 3 79 percent  or 5 34 percent for the second straight week  completing the 10 percent dip required for the index to be considered in a correction  The price reached the lowest level since May 3  over half a year ago 
The weekly decline over the 3 and a half day trading week  was its third worst Thanksgiving week performance since 1939  Technology underperformed    6 05 percent   The tech selloff was more significant than falling oil prices Energy dropped   4 87 percent  
Every sector was in the red with losses of at least 1 percent  Utilities were the best relative performers with losses of just 1 4 percent 
The Dow Jones Industrial Index underperformed on Friday  falling 0 73 percent  However  with a 9 54 percent decline from its October 3 record close  it is the only benchmark not yet in correction  While this may be seen as a sign of strength  it s important note that it was already at a lower level before the most recent selloff since trade war fears had already depressed the mega cap index 
Multinational companies listed in the benchmark rely heavily on exports for growth  Also  despite the Dow being the only major index not in an official correction  it underperformed both for the week   4 44 percent  and for the last two weeks   6 62 percent  

The NASDAQ Composite dropped Friday 0 48 percent  4 26 percent for the week and 6 32 percent for both weeks  While  it has been the worst performer during this rout  falling 14 68 percent since its highest close on August 29  passing the 15  threshold on Wednesday s low  it bounced off its long term uptrend line since the previous correction in 2016  Technically  the 50 DMA is about to cross below the 200 DMA 
The Russell 2000 outperformed on Friday  falling only 0 27 percent  It capped a 2 54 percent slide for the week and a 3 85 percent decline for the second straight week  Technically  the moving average interplay executed a death cross last week  when the 50 DMA fell below the 200 DMA  The small cap index is the second worst performer after the NASDAQ during this rout  falling 14 83 percent since its highest close in August 
Six Key Risks for Equity Markets
Equity markets are currently facing six key risks 
Trade war  it may have already ended the first synchronized growth since the Great Recession 
China s economic slowdown  a result of the trade tussle  the world s second largest economy is reducing demand which will have an adverse chain reaction on other economies 
Germany s economic slowdown  same reasons  similar repercussions 
Fed tightening  fears persist that rising rates will end the most extended bull market on record 
Waning oil demand  sinking prices are hitting equity and commodity markets 
Tech selloff  the sector s heavy weighting on major indices could add additional strain if shares continue to be jettisoned 
On the other hand  since the US economy is still robust as it continues to show signs of health  investors may decide to buy stocks at a holiday discount  Retail sales  the backbone of the American economy  are in great shape heading into the holiday shopping season 
With unemployment at multi decade lows and rising wages  moderate inflation and falling oil prices  there s a sense  there s plenty more where that came from   Even after the recent retail upheaval wherein brick and mortar sales have been transforming into e commerce purchases  retail sales are forecast to climb 5 percent since last year  which is only slightly lower than the 5 6  gains for this metric seen in the previous year 
Ironically  the current risk off mood is at odds with the buoyancy among consumers  whose online shopping over Thanksgiving is forecast to reach a record this year  What s bothering investors is a prevailing fear that things are as good as they can be  From corporate earnings to the economy  a slowdown looks likely after one of the longest expansions on record 
Investors have sought safety in companies that offer stable income and high dividends  like utilities and consumer staples  since the S P 500 started a retreat last month that morphed into its second 10 percent correction of the year  So much love has been placed with safety shares that JPMorgan strategists  led by Dubravko Lakos Bujas  said their valuations relative to risky stocks suggest the market is  perhaps wrongly   starting to price in a recession like scenario  
 We view the current style dislocation as overdone and inconsistent with the fundamental backdrop   the JPM strategists wrote in a note earlier this week   The business cycle slowdown concerns are largely premature  
A note on fundamental and technical analysis  though during the middle of a market move  fundamentals and technicals often agree  they are generally at odds during market turns since smart money stays ahead of the curve  before the fundamentals are known 

The yield on 10 year Treasurys fell below the October low  after failing to scale above the October peak this past month  completing a double top reversal  So far  it found support by the 100 DMA  Should it fall below the 3 00  it will likely continue to sink lower  A drop below the 200 DMA would suggest a deeper decline toward 2 900 percent 

The higher demand for Treasuries by foreign investors boosted the dollar  which has already buoyed by its current haven status  Technically  demand for the global reserve currency kicks in at the bottom of its rising channel 

On Friday  oil reached a cumulative stumble of 6 66 percent  a devilish slide by some measures  The reality of the plunge is perhaps of equal concern  US President Donald Trump continues to pressure Saudi Arabia to keep prices down  and the equity rout plays on fears that the end is nigh for economic growth and with it the demand for energy 
Ironically  there s a not so virtuous loop being formed  feeding on itself  with Friday s stock selloff triggered by falling oil prices  whereupon equities fall yet more  pressing on commodities yet again  Technically  the price retested a bearish flag  found resistance and is potentially repeating the 19  drop it for the commodity seen from October 29 November 13  The 50 DMA crossed below the 200 DMA  executing a death cross  a technical phenomenon that receives substantial attention  even by non technical traders 

Bitcoin fell 4 4 percent on Sunday  to  3 752 at time of writing  for the second day of losses  That s an aggregate loss of 15  over the two day period and more than 35  since we suggested in mid November that the cryptocurrency was set to slump toward  3 000 
The current 13 month low has polarized digital currency analysts  with some saying the asset class is history because it s just too confusing  while others have been ramping up their calls of a bottom being reached

196602,418118,DVN,Why Devon Energy  DVN  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Devon Energy  DVN   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States industry 
This oil and gas exploration company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 19 20  
For the most recent quarter  Devon Energy was expected to post earnings of  0 43 per share  but it reported  0 63 per share instead  representing a surprise of 46 51   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 37 per share  while it actually produced  0 34 per share  a surprise of 8 11  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Devon Energy lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Devon Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of  22 67   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 19  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-devon-energy-dvn-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200378494,200378494

196616,418132,DVN,Here s Why You Should Buy Devon Energy Stock Right Away,opinion,"On Jun 16  Devon Energy Corporation   NYSE DVN   was upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Why the Upgrade 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings per share has been revised upward from  1 39 to  1 64 over the last 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings rose to  3 05 from  2 47  Moreover  we expect the company to record earnings growth of 160 3  and 86 3  in 2018 and 2019  respectively     
Devon has a strong footprint in oil rich U S  resources comprising Eagle Ford  Delaware Basin  the sub basin of Permian   Rockies and the STACK play  Moreover  the company has exposure to Eastern Alberta s heavy oil projects  Apart from oil  Devon s strong exposure to prolific natural gas fields like Barnett Shale will secure the company s long term production growth 
In fact  from the U S  resources  the company is expecting oil production to grow from 114 thousand barrels per day  MBbls D  in 2017 to more than 175 MBbls D through 2020  A major portion of the output growth is likely to be backed by Delaware and STACK plays  Devon is also planning to lower cash cost per barrel of oil equivalent by 15  from 2017 to 2020    
The overall production growth and strong cost saving initiatives are likely to help Devon to witness compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of more than 25  in cash flow through 2020  This will lead to  2 5 billion in cumulative free cashflow generation over the same time frame  assuming that West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil will continue to trade over  60 per barrel   
All these positive developments indicate the company s impressive pricing chart  Over the past year  the stock has rallied 31 9   outperforming the 14 5  cumulative rise of the stocks belonging to the    

Other Stocks to Consider
Other prospective players in the energy space are Anadarko Petroleum Corp    NYSE APC    Eclipse Resources Corp    NYSE ECR   and Wildhorse Resource Development Corp    NYSE WRD    While Anadarko carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Eclipse and Wildhorse sport a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   
We expect Anadarko Petroleum to witness year over year earnings growth of 229 6  in 2018 
Eclipse is expected to record revenue growth of 13 5  through 2018 
Wildhorse will likely see year over year earnings growth of 309 3  in 2018

196630,418146,DVN,Oklahoma set to overturn local drilling controls as backlash brews,news,By Heide Brandes and Yeganeh Torbati OKLAHOMA CITY WASHINGTON  Reuters    Facing a backlash over the side effects of its oil and gas boom  Oklahoma is poised to overturn an 80 year old statute that allows cities and towns to ban drilling operations within their borders   The legislation  now being finalised  would help insulate energy companies from local movements that have grown in response to the rapid expansion of oil and gas drilling and a dramatic spike in earthquakes across the central state  Oklahoma now sees 600 times more tremors than it did before 2008  a surge seismologists say is linked to vast amounts of wastewater injected into the ground as a result of drilling for oil and from hydraulic fracturing   a process to extract natural gas that is also known as fracking  The bill was championed by energy companies  which contend that local interference in drilling practices would endanger the production bonanza that has boosted their profits and brought the United States within sight of energy independence  Opponents say the bill severely restricts the right of local communities to protect themselves from the earthquakes and drilling operations that encroach on residential areas  The move by Oklahoma s Republican majority legislature follows a similar law signed on Monday by Texas Governor Greg Abbott in response to a fracking ban passed by one municipality  In April  the state run Oklahoma Geological Survey said the rise in tremors is  very likely  linked to injection of wastewater into disposal wells  Those concerns have spawned local protest movements  with some towns weighing new restrictions on oil and gas production  although none in Oklahoma have called for a total ban   The legislature has basically sent a message which is  we re going to continue enabling the industry   said Ed Shadid  a city councilman in Oklahoma City  where protests in December led to an oil company withdrawing plans for new wells  The bill   which passed with strong majorities in both houses and now awaits changes in the Senate   would repeal a 1935 statute that gives municipalities broad rights to restrict oil and gas operations within their borders   Under the new bill  municipalities can establish  reasonable  restrictions on oil and gas operations such as traffic  odor  or noise regulations  but cannot effectively ban drilling or other operations    We don t feel it s appropriate that the oil and gas industry should be singled out   said Kim Hatfield of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association  which supported the bill   OIL S BIG ROLE Oil booms are synonymous with prosperity in Oklahoma  where production taxes on oil and natural gas contributed more than 7 percent of gross state revenues in 2014  The state is now facing a  600 million budget deficit  in part due to the economic stress wrought by months of low oil prices   There are a lot of jobs and a lot of tax revenues realized through oil and gas production   said Cory Williams  a Democratic House member who opposed the bill   There is a lot of hesitancy to do something that might appear to regulate or burden oil and gas   But officials in Oklahoma  Texas  New Mexico  and other states at the forefront of the U S  energy boom now face the challenge of balancing the revenue that comes from pumping more oil and gas with the problems it can cause for residents  Central to that is what to do with the massive volumes of water generated by extraction   While briny water is a common byproduct of oil and gas production  some of Oklahoma s fields are especially water logged  producing up to 20 barrels of water for every barrel of oil recovered  The state wide average is about 10 to 1  Injection wells are crucial to the economics of production in Oklahoma  those in the industry say  Firms including  Devon Energy   NYSE DVN   Sandridge Energy  Tulsa based New Dominion  and others operate disposal wells in Oklahoma   This really is the only way to dispose of the water   said Dewey Bartlett  Jr   the mayor of Tulsa  Oklahoma s second largest city  who is also president of a local oil firm  Before the Survey s announcement in April  state officials had been publicly skeptical the industry was triggering the quakes  As late as February  Republican Governor Mary Fallin was quoted saying the state didn t know enough to understand the cause  Hatfield  of the OIPA  said that no one within the industry  is disputing that it is a possibility  that injection wells and earthquakes are linked  In March  the Commission ordered some well operators to prove they were not dumping water below the state s deepest rock formation  Regulators also doubled the number of disposal wells under scrutiny  This month  the Commission announced that more than 50 wells have reduced their depths  150 wells have cut their water volumes in half  and other wells are keeping their volumes below 1 000 barrels per day  There are about 3 200 active oil and gas disposal wells across the state  Still  Oklahoma is on track to hit 941 earthquakes of magnitude 3 0 or greater in 2015  according to the survey  compared to 584 last year   It is a really easy measurement in this case whether a regulation is adequate  Have the number of quakes gone down   said Todd Halihan  a geologist at Oklahoma State University   That says whether you re doing an adequate job

196631,418147,DVN,U S  Republicans navigate the new politics of energy abundance,news,By James Oliphant OKLAHOMA CITY  Okla   Reuters    U S  Republicans have had to watch from the sidelines as the Obama White House has taken political credit for America s unexpected energy boom and tumbling gas prices  Now it has left their presidential candidates scrambling for a way to reclaim leadership on an issue the party once seemed to own  Their apparent answer  calling time on a 40 year old federal ban on crude oil exports and using the newfound energy bounty to strategic advantage   We ve got an abundance of supply   Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said this week in Oklahoma at a gathering of putative Republican candidates for next year s presidential election  Lifting the ban  he said  would allow exports to  our allies in Europe  where  instead of being dependent on  President  Vladimir Putin and the Russians  they could be dependent on Americans    President Barack Obama s administration has allowed small exceptions but has said it will not open the door to crude exports as long as the United States is still importing some oil  Even the Republican led Congress has been reluctant to push too quickly for an end to the export ban  fearing political repercussions should gas prices spike in the aftermath  But several in the ranks of Republican presidential candidates or likely candidates are warming to the idea  Walker s call was echoed by others in Oklahoma  where powerful oil and gas interests want the ban lifted  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie  who has yet to formally declare  said exports would lead to  a more peaceful  more stable world when other countries are not relying on Iran and Russia for their oil   And former Texas Governor Rick Perry called for faster approval of liquefied natural gas exports  vowing to  flood Europe  with it if elected president   That kind of talk upends the past politics of energy scarcity  perhaps most famously expressed by the  drill  baby  drill  mantra of the Republicans  2008 vice presidential candidate  Sarah Palin   Drilling in Alaska and off shore waters was seen as a way to boost America s fossil fuel reserves and curb dependency on foreign oil  But that was before the advent of widespread hydraulic fracturing   the drilling process known as fracking   unlocked new domestic oil and gas reserves   The boom in U S  supply disrupted global oil markets  spawning a sharp decline in prices and lowering gasoline costs at home  The emergence of energy abundance   presided over by a Democratic president who embraced fracking   left Republicans seeking a new cudgel to carve out distinction on energy policy  The notion of ending the export ban found a receptive audience in Oklahoma    That scarcity mentality is a product of the ancient past   Larry Nichols  chairman of  Devon Energy  Corp  NYSE DVN  told the crowd  saying it was time to  get rid of that silly export ban   Harold Hamm  CEO of Continental Resources Inc  called lifting the ban a  no brainer   Proponents argue that crude exports would be an oil and gas job creator  Low prices have forced the industry to scale back drilling projects and lay off workers but an overseas market would allow it to ramp up production  a point made by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal  who is also a prospective presidential candidate   Still  the move carries some risks  Oil refiners oppose lifting the ban because it keeps the domestic crude oil they buy at low prices  And there is a lingering nervousness in Congress that lifting the ban could trigger a backlash from the public if gas prices spike  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  a declared candidate  proposed lifting the ban earlier this year but pulled his measure before it could be voted upon    You open up exports  gas prices go up  and then Congress gets the blame   said Rachel Pierson  an analyst with Beacon Policy advisers in Washington ,2015-05-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/u.s.-republicans-navigate-the-new-politics-of-energy-abundance-343287,343287

196640,418156,DVN,Special Report  Depleted oil field is window into China s corruption crackdown,news,By Charlie Zhu  David Lague and Fergus Jensen  LIMAU  Indonesia  Reuters    In a muddy clearing in southern Sumatra  a portable diesel power plant hammers away alongside a wellhead  struggling to extract crude from a depleted reservoir that lies below farmland and rubber plantations   It was much easier to extract cash from a state owned Chinese oil giant   A subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation  CNPC   PetroChina Daqing Oilfield  paid  85 million to pump from three blocks in the ageing Limau field under a 2013 contract with Indonesia s state owned oil company  Pertamina  according to senior Chinese oil industry officials with knowledge of the transaction   Today  the three Limau blocks squeeze out less than three percent of the oil pumped when output peaked in the 1960s  When PetroChina Daqing announced the deal  it didn t disclose the seller  the price or any other financial details    We all know it is a ridiculous investment  but I have no idea where the money has actually ended up   says a senior Chinese oil industry official who has seen budget figures for the Limau wells   The management at CNPC is now investigating the deal as part of a sweeping crackdown on official graft by Chinese President Xi Jinping that has destroyed a powerful political rival who once ran the oil giant   Zhou Yongkang  The anti corruption campaign is cutting a swathe through the senior management ranks at CNPC  with at least a dozen former top managers under arrest   There is vast scope for corruption inside the CNPC empire  which includes its huge listed subsidiary PetroChina Company Ltd and hundreds of other units  say company officials familiar with the investigation  The group is one of the world s biggest corporations  last year reporting revenues of  432 billion  Current and former senior company officials say it is difficult to keep track of all the businesses and deals underway    THIS IS CRAZY   Indonesia s anti graft watchdog told Reuters last month that it plans to probe the country s oil sector  Satoto Agustono  director of development at Pertamina EP  a unit of Pertamina  said he had no knowledge of the price of the Limau deal but said oil companies sometimes paid top dollar for risky investments    The oil and gas business is really crazy   he said   We do not know why they want to buy at high prices when production is low  But  some people  they buy it  This is crazy    Chinese oil industry officials say they have identified two other suspect deals in Indonesia in which the CNPC group paid a combined  350 million to buy assets from little known private companies   Basically  they are worthless   says the same oil industry official who has seen the budgeting figures for the Limau deal   It has caused heavy losses for the state    CNPC chairman Zhou Jiping told an internal meeting in August that the company would  actively explore  new ways of conducting investigations in its overseas operations as part of its crackdown on corruption  the company said in a statement on its website  A CNPC group spokesman in Beijing declined to answer questions from Reuters about the suspect deals   The story of the Limau transaction provides a window into the mechanics of what Chinese oil industry officials say is one suspect deal   Interviews with CNPC officials  searches of company filings and documents related to the agreement reviewed by Reuters show PetroChina Daqing paid for control of a shell company registered in a tax haven  the British Virgin Islands  BVI   This transaction allowed PetroChina Daqing to take over the operation of the three Limau blocks   Only a trickle of oil has been pumped since the deal was announced in March 2013  according to Chinese and Indonesian oil industry officials with knowledge of the field   TARGETTING ZHOU  The probes into the Indonesian deals are part of a much wider corruption investigation in China that has sparked the biggest political upheaval since the 1989 Tiananmen protests   Zhou Yongkang  born in 1942  was a member of China s elite Politburo Standing Committee until his retirement in 2012  A former head of China s feared internal security apparatus  he is now almost certain to become the most senior leader to be prosecuted since the 1981 trial of the Gang of Four  driving figures behind the Cultural Revolution   On December 6  the official Xinhua News Agency said Zhou had been expelled from the ruling Communist Party  The statement accused him of corruption and leaking state secrets  Zhou s case has been handed to judicial authorities  it said   terminology that usually means criminal charges will follow  It is not known if he has a lawyer   Zhou built an extensive power base at CNPC as he rose to the top of the oil giant in the 1990s  At least 11 other former top CNPC group officials are under arrest  Two   former CNPC vice president Wang Yongchun and the former head of the group s Indonesian operations  Wei Zhigang   were involved in assessing the Limau investment  according to Chinese oil industry officials  Wang Yongchun was also president of PetroChina Daqing Oilfield    The investigations into Wang and Wei are linked to but not limited to the Limau acquisition   said one of the Chinese oil industry officials   Two months before he was arrested in August last year  Wang said the company was keen to expand in Indonesia  according to the company s website  Wang was quoted hailing the Limau deal as an example of deepening cooperation   In a November 28 report  the Communist Party mouthpiece  the People s Daily newspaper  confirmed that graft busters were probing Zhou s network in the petroleum industry  It was the first official acknowledgement the CNPC arrests were tied to him   CNPC has disowned Zhou   We will never provide shelter for corrupt elements   the company pledged in a statement coinciding with the news of his arrest   Under former CNPC head Jiang Jiemin  who was arrested last year  the group launched a headlong spending splurge  heeding a political command to secure more offshore oil reserves  In the five years to 2013  the company spent  25 billion on overseas assets and  241 billion on capital expenditure   Investigators are now scrutinizing the group s domestic and offshore spending on oilfields  oil service contracts and equipment supply deals   Jiang and Wang Yongchun have been expelled from the party and are under investigation for  taking huge bribes   according to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection  CCDI   Calls to the Beijing numbers for the CCDI spokesman on the agency s website were not answered   As is routine in Chinese corruption cases  Jiang  Wang and Wei couldn t be reached for comment nor could their lawyers be identified   SHELL COMPANIES  Indonesia has been a key target for the CNPC group s expansion plans  Once self sufficient in oil  output in the Southeast Asian nation has declined since its 1995 peak  Jakarta has been anxious to attract foreign investment to arrest falling production   Some of CNPC s early investments in Indonesia  made when oil prices were lower  have paid off  Its listed unit  PetroChina  bought the Indonesian assets of U S  oil producer Devon Energy Corp in 2002  CNPC was the country s seventh ranked producer in 2011 with 3 500 employees and an annual output of about 40 million barrels   The Limau deal was a departure from PetroChina Daqing Oilfield s normal business model  The oil services company hailed the 2013 agreement as its first  technology for resources  deal  having traditionally relied on fees for its income  In this deal  it would trade its expertise in extracting oil from mature fields in return for a share of any increased output  it said in a statement   In a subsequent statement in June last year  the company said it had completed an  equity acquisition related to the Limau project   without disclosing the seller or the price   Interviews with Chinese oil industry officials and documents related to the transaction show PetroChina Daqing actually bought Vision Horizon Holdings Ltd   a company registered in the British Virgin Islands  A company search shows that Vision Horizon was registered in May 2009  BVI companies are not required to disclose directors and shareholders   Through other shell companies registered in the tax haven  Vision Horizon is linked to BVI registered Indospec Energy Limau  the company that holds a joint operating contract for the three Limau blocks  In an interview with Reuters in his Jakarta office  the chief executive of Indospec Energy Limau  Indra Wijaya  confirmed that the company had won the contract from Pertamina through a tender   A draft of the 91 page contract reviewed by Reuters shows that Indospec Energy Limau is scheduled to invest another  50 million in the first three years of a 20 year operating agreement   Wijaya  who said he had earlier worked for Pertamina for more than 20 years  confirmed that Vision Horizon was involved in the Limau deal but declined to provide details  Wijaya also declined to discuss PetroChina s  85 million payment   This is about our business   he said   I am not going to give any answer    UNLIKELY TO MEET TARGET  Like many of Indonesia s mature oilfields  Limau has been in decline since it peaked in the 1960s  The field covers more than 200 square kilometers of forest and farmland  including patches of rubber and palm oil plantation  in South Sumatra Province   In a 2013 technical paper  Wijaya and two Pertamina experts advocated using advanced recovery methods to boost output  They reported that production from the three blocks had peaked at 46 000 barrels a day in 1960  A report by Wood Mackenzie  an energy consultancy  showed that by the 1990s  water injection and other recovery methods were needed to keep the field pumping   A company that earlier operated Limau  Hong Kong listed South Sea Petroleum Holdings Ltd  said in a stock exchange filing that output for the entire field in 2007 was about 7 000 barrels a day  The combined output from the three blocks is now about 1 200 barrels a day  according to Pertamina s Agustono   In its 2013 statement announcing the deal  PetroChina Daqing said it aimed to boost production of the three Limau blocks to about 7 300 barrels a day  Upstream industry experts familiar with the Limau field say it is highly unlikely that PetroChina will ever meet this target      Additional reporting

196642,418158,DVN,Beware Natural Gas Shortage,opinion,"Heed The Warning 
From glut to shortages  During downturns in major commodity markets there is a tendency to get all doomy and gloomy about the future and get locked into a lower than longer mentality  That kind of short term thinking has engineered a major bottom in petroleum and now that type of thinking may make an on impact natural gas 
In the U S   we fear a market collapse on Henry Hub natural gas in the spring  as record production should refill storage and cause a U S  glut  In the big picture  we are sowing the seed of a future shortage  Shell  NYSE RDSa  is warning that despite the global glut of natural gas we are on the path to a major Liquified Natural Gas LNG shortage 
Royal Dutch Shell says the world could face a shortage of liquefied natural gas within a decade because of underinvestment in new projects and because of what should be a major demand surge during that time as users will increase their usage of natural gas because of the current cheap prices and the environmental benefits of natural gas  Shell warns in its annual LNG outlook  that because of low prices the demand for liquefied natural gas grew by 29M metric tons last year  30  more than previously expected  to 293M tons 
Shell says that they expect LNG demand to grow by a explossive 500M metric tons year by 2030  Supplies on the other hand will fall by 300M tons year due to a lack of new projects and natural declines in existing production  LNG buyers should heed the warning as long term hedges at this point are relatively cheap but thinly traded  While this is a problem for down the line  it is not too early to be getting prepared  Speculators though can sell this market in the short term in the U S  because we will see more production in the coming months and a bit of a pullback in demand  
Oil prices gain ground after early weakness as the U S  stock market shot to the sky  This helped oil overcome worries about a potential large increase in weekly supply and more refineries going into maintenance  Saudi Arabia was making news overnight  Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia s King Salman reshuffled some of the kingdom s top military officers and several deputy ministers on Monday  in a broad shakeup seen as elevating younger officials in key economic and security areas  This comes as the war in Yemen is dragging on and has not gone well for the Saudis 
Yet  what may move oil today is the testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell  His job is to not rock the boat and if he comes off well  and not too hawkish  then stocks and oil will build on yesterday s gains  If not  we ll just be prepared for some volatility 
There was also a lot of talk about the future of fracking techniques that could make shale production much better in the future  The Financial Post reported shale drilling is about to take a gigantic leap forward with a new  3 dimensional  technique called cube development 
The Post writes that modern day shale drilling  which combines fracking with horizontal drilling  has largely been a 2 dimensional activity drilling horizontally through a single shale layer to extract gas from tiny pockets within the shale  But there s more than one shale layer commercially viable  Here in the northeast we have three layers actively drilled  the Marcellus  the Utica  and the Upper Devonian 
Until now  drillers have targeted a single layer  Sometimes they use the same vertical well bore to target a different layer but that s the exception rather than the rule  The rule is changing  In Texas and a few other locations  drillers are experimenting with drilling all the commercially viable shale layers at once 3D style  Encana has a  cube development   3D  Texas well pad that sits on 16 acres  The pad hosts 19 shale wells and pumps 20 000 barrels of crude oil a day  Devon Energy  NYSE DVN  has a 24 well pad project in Oklahoma  And others are giving it a try too   Of course while you can produce more you will also deplete formations faster but that too is a problem for another day 
RBOB futures are looking cheap as we get the lull before the summer time blend run up  With U S  gasoline demand on track to break records this summer we should get a very strong rally on RBOB soon  The summer switchover season is starting and as we start to see spring return  the RBOB futures should spike  Make sure you are hedged and look for opportunities to buy 
Truckers have also received a break in diesel prices after a sustained run up but that too may be short lived  Since the beginning of February  fuel prices have dropped approximately 7 cents after rising about 11 cents over the first five weeks of the year  According to the Department of Energy s weekly report  the U S  average price for a gallon of on highway diesel is now  3 007 as reported by CC news  Yet  with late winter demand from Europe and anticipated seasonal crop planting demand around the corner we should see those price rebound in a few weeks  
Grain prices are still being supported by the lack of rain in Argentina and that could support ethanol prices  DTN reports that President Donald Trump has invited federal lawmakers at the center of the Renewable Fuel Standard debate to a meeting at the White House today to discuss potential reform DTN has not been able to confirm such a meeting is scheduled  and representatives of biofuel groups contacted by DTN said they have not received an invitation to participate  Earlier this week  Sen  Ted Cruz  R Texas  held a rally with employees at the now bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery  He called for reform to the RFS  after PES alleged in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing that  832 million in costs to comply with the RFS was the reason for its demise  During that rally  Cruz said biofuels groups had  refused  to meet with him and other members of Congress to talk about potential changes to the RFS   Stay tuned ",2018-02-27,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beware-natural-gas-shortage-200294607,200294607

196656,418172,DVN,Devon  DVN  Gains From Cost Savings And Oil Production,opinion,"On Nov 14  2017  we issued an updated research report on Devon Energy   NYSE DVN    The company is currently focused on making the most of its high margin production zones and resorting to cost saving initiatives  in order to boost performance  Additionally  divestment of non core assets is a key factor Owning to stellar production from domestic oil plays  the company is well poised to deliver a significant increase in the domestic output in 2018 from 2017 levels  However  the highly competitive nature of the oil and gas industry continues to be a headwind Devon Energy s third quarter earnings surpassed estimates by 17 9   on the back of increased productionand cost cutting initiatives  The company registered positive earnings surprise in last four quarters  reflecting an average surprise of 13 77  In the third quarter  the company s lease operating expenses  LOE  reflected a  10 million sequential decline  Additionally  it resulted in savings of over  1 4 billion in annualized operating and G A expenses  The company expects cost savings to be sustainable in 2017  owing to higher production rates from the company s U S  resource plays and relatively flat LOE costs Devon Energy s  2020 Vision  is expected to introduce advance technology to produce higher volumes from wells and generate peer leading returns on invested capital for shareholders Devon Energy s divestments of non core assets worth  3 2 billion in 2016 and subsequent repayment of debt helped to lower annual interest burden by  120 million  The company has sold  420 million of assets year to date and is on schedule to achieve divestiture target of  1 billion non core assets in the next 12 18 months However  operations of oil and gas companies are often disrupted natural calamities and technical hindrances  Devon Energy s operations in the south Texas Eagle Ford region were dampened due to storm related curtailment in the recent months  The company s domestic production declined 15 000 barrels per day  of which 65  was oil 
The competitive oil and gas industry can act as a hindrance to Devon Energy s prospects  Strong financial background and global presence provide other players in the market to cope with the falling price environment  Consequently  this might limit Devon s capacity to apply for new drilling rights or acquire properties

crude inventories jumped by 4 6 million barrels for the week ending Sep 15  following an increase of 5 9 million barrels in the previous week  The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go up some 2 4 million barrels Volume ramp up from the import and production facilities shuttered in the wake of hurricane Harvey led to the big stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer Despite the substantial climb in oil storage for a third straight week  current supplies   at 472 8 million barrels   are still marginally below the year ago period  However  stocks are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year Meanwhile  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   was up by 703 000 barrels to 59 8 million barrels The crude supply cover was up from 29 4 days in the previous week to 30 8 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 30 2 days Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were down for the third week running as Gulf Coast refineries sidelined by Harvey continue to ramp up throughput  The 2 1 million barrels draw   above the polled number of 800 000 barrels fall in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles down to 216 2 million barrels  Following last week s slide  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now 4  below the year earlier level but is in the upper limit of the average range Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  went down by 5 7 million barrels last week  compared with analysts  expectations for one million barrels decrease in supply level  The largest weekly fall since 2011 could be again be attributed to recovering refinery post storm induced outages  At 138 9 million barrels  current supplies are 15 8  below the year ago level but are in the bottom half of the average range for this time of the year Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 5 5  from the prior week to 83 2   While refinery runs rebounded from the previous week s nine year lows  it s still a far cry from

196660,418176,DVN,EIA Crude Data Backs Up Bullish API Report,opinion,"Less Is More
Famed architect Mies van der Rohe was famous for his belief that sometimes you can do away with all the ornamentation on building because sometimes less is more  They are now finding that out in the energy space these days  that is also true and if you do less you will be rewarded  OPEC and Non OPEC found that out when they cut production to shore up prices and reduce over supply  Now some shale producers are getting the message as well  Dow Jones reported that shares of Devon Energy  NYSE DVN   one of the largest U S  shale companies  are up 4 2  after the company disclosed plans to spend less next year than some analyst estimates  Devon will invest between  2B and  2 5B on exploration and production  less than the  2 6B or more that had been anticipated  according to Tudor Pickering Holt  The stock surge according to Dow Jones stems in part from interest that has intensified among some investors for shale companies to live within their means  reduce spending and temper their ambitions in the name of improving profitability 
This of course is a good thing for these companies and something we have been harping for a while  You can t lose money on every barrel and expect to make up for it in volume  I applaud Devon for this wise move yet in some ways it was a decision that was forced upon them  Other shale companies will be forced to cut back as well especially the smaller outfits and while that is good for their balance sheets it does not bode well for future us oil production estimates 
What you are going to see is lower production growth of oil in the U S  for an extended period  To reverse that slowdown  you may have to see an oil market sustained well above  60 or maybe even  65 a barrel 
Many shale oil companies are already over extended from a return on spending and banks will be more reluctant to lend them money  In the meantime the U S  shale output  per well  will continue to decline  There are some estimates that the U S  shale industry would need to double their current CapX spending to increase production by another million barrels a day  There is no way that is possible in this low oil price environment 
Yet will this low price environment remain  No  In fact we are in the process of an extended oil bull market  With global growth smoking and production constraints and logistical issues rising we are more than likely in a generational bull market  The problem is that by the time the bankers believe it the shale guys will be playing catch up  Forget about the argument of the record amounts of drilled but uncompleted wells  To get them on line you will need men and equipment both of which are in short supply  That means to get enough men and equipment you will need even higher prices 
Yesterday s Energy Information Admintation  EIA  report is backing up the bullish back drop even though the report was not as bullish as the wildly and scary bullish American Petroleum Institute  API  version  The EIA reported that total commercial petroleum stocks feel stocks fell 5 8 Million Barrels at a time of year when they normally increase  Last year  for example  petroleum stocks increased by 9 million barrels  So  from last year total supply is down a whopping 75 million barrels from a year ago  an incredible year over year drop 
Crude oil supply fell by 2 435 million barrels as U S  crude exports surged to another record at 2 13 million barrels of oil per day  U S  crude production up week over week by 46 000 barrels to 9 553 million barrels a day  still short of the 10 million plus that we were supposed to be producing  Oil imports to the U S  hit 5 4 million barrels a day just 20 000 barrels above a 5 year low  Gasoline stocks fell 3 5 million barrels  not as large as the 7 million plus drop by API but still incredible for this time of year  Gas Demand increased by 8 00 barrels a day keeping it near seasonal all time records 
Distillates stocks fell only 320 00 barrels easing concerns of a desperate tightening of supply  but the drop reminds us that refiners are still behind the eight ball trying to keep up with surging global demand 
This comes as Reuters reports that OPEC is going to extend production cuts and wants a floor of  60 in 2018 according to Reuters   Then you have the ongoing collapse of Venezuela  While they did make their bond payment to avoid a default their oil production is not being helped  Talk that tankers of Venezulean crude is being turned back due to quality issues means their oil industry could be ready for a total collasps  Data shows that Venezuela s September crude production fell again to just 1 8 million barrels of oil a day  Sad ",2017-11-02,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-110217-200257802,200257802

STACK  a major area of energy development interest in Oklahoma  stands for Sooner Trend Anadarko basin Canadian and Kingfisher counties  The area s importance was highlighted by the U S  Energy Information Administration action in August to expand its weekly Drilling Productivity Report to include the Anadarko Basin  the area that contains the STACK and SCOOP zones 
The EIA said the  of the Anadarko Basin is consistent with the report s aim to 

Cover the most prolific and active on shore regions where oil and natural gas are produced from shales and other tight resources  In the recent years the Anadarko region  which includes 24 Oklahoma and 5 Texas counties  has become the target of many producers using improved drilling and completion technology to this already well established oil and gas producing basin  As of July 2017  there are 129 operating rigs in the Anadarko region  second to only Permian region with 373 operating rigs 

As companies race to the area to take advantage of its lower cost production  operators in the region include 
Devon Energy Corp   NYSE DVN NYSE   whose Q2 17 oil production exceeded guidance in large part because of the company s activity in the STACK zone  In July  Devon  that its Privott 17 H well set records with a 

Facility constrained peak 24 hour rate of 6 000 oil equivalent barrels  Boe  per day  50 percent oil   When compared against publicly available data in the STACK  the Privott well achieved the highest initial production rate of any well by a wide margin and is expected to recover in excess of 2 million Boe over the life of the well 

Tony Vaughn  Devon s chief operating officer  commented 

Looking ahead  we expect to continue to build operational momentum in the STACK as we transition our activity to multi zone development drilling that will drive additional efficiency gains and maximize the value of our resource 

Jericho Oil Corp  V JCO   an oil junior that just  a nearly one third interest in 9 400 net surface acres in the STACK  The joint venture was able to acquire the rights at a much lower cost than many of its neighbors  its implied acreage acquisition cost of  2 300 net Mississippian acre adjusted for PDP compares to as much as  15 000  20 000 per acre that major players have paid in this area of the STACK 
Jericho CEO Brian Williamson told Streetwise Reports that its acreage is 

Sandwiched between several best in case  sizable independents  including the likes of Alta Mesa Holdings  AMR NASDAQ   Marathon Oil Corp   NYSE MRO NYSE   Sandridge Energy Inc  NYSE SD   Newfield Exploration Company  NYSE NFX   Continental Resources Inc  NYSE CLR   Gastar Exploration  NYSE GST  and Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE CHK NYSE   which trade at much higher multiples for their STACK acreage values 

Most analysts believe that the price of oil will remain well under  100 barrel for the foreseeable future  Williamson commented 

The things we are seeing suggest that the STACK and our acreage in particular can be developed profitably with oil in the  30 35 bbl price range 

Marathon Oil Corporation  NYSE MRO   which substantially increased its profile in the STACK when it purchased PayRock Energy Holdings for  888 million in 2016  With the acquisition came PayRock s 61 000 net acres in the STACK  The PayRock acquisition  the company reported  had an implied acreage value of  11 800 adjusting for proved developed producing  PDP  reserves 
Marathon Oil president and CEO Lee Tillman stated 

Acquiring PayRock s STACK position will meaningfully expand the quality and scale of Marathon Oil s existing portfolio in one of the best unconventional oil plays in the U S 

Continental Resources Inc  NYSE CLR   which has rapidly expanded into the STACK region  Continental Resources president and COO told The American Oil   Gas Reporter earlier this year that 

Continental completed its first STACK well in August 2015  In the past year and half  we have pioneered the play into the overpressured window of Blaine County  Ok  STACK clearly has become a key catalyst for Continental s growth  We have never had a play this prolific evolve so quickly  The results have exceeded our early expectations  and the impact on Continental s production growth both near term and long term will be significant 

The company reported that in August it completed a record well in the STACK area 

The Tres C FIU 1 35 2XH flowed an impressive 1 021 Bo and 29 6 MMcf of gas  5 953 Boe  in its initial 24 hour test  with flowing casing pressure of 6 500 pounds per square inch from a 9 748 foot lateral  Adding an additional 1 978 barrels of anticipated natural gas liquids post processing  Continental estimates the initial 24 hour IP rate for the Tres C would be a record 7 442 Boe  40  liquids  on a three stream basis 

Honorable mentions
Newfield Exploration Co  NYSE NFX  holds more than 300 000 net STACK acres  In March  the company announced that its Burgess well in Kingfisher  LON KGF  County 

Achieved a 24 hour flow rate of 2 931 BOEPD  69  oil  and a 20 day average rate of 2 492 BOEPD  70  oil  

Sandridge Energy Inc  NYSE SD  announced in August that it has entered into a  200 million development agreement with a private investment fund to develop wells in the NW STACK  where it holds rights to 70 000 net acres

196683,418199,DVN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Baker Hughes  Concho Resources  Devon Energy  Marathon Oil And Chesapeake Energy,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   December 06  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Baker Hughes Inc   NYSE     Concho Resources Inc   NYSE     Devon Energy Corp  NYSE DVN    NYSE     Marathon Oil Corp  NYSE MRO    NYSE     and Chesapeake Energy Corp  NYSE CHK    NYSE      

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

U S  Rigs Continue Output Post OPEC Deal  What to Expect

	After the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  or OPEC  agreed on production cut last Wednesday  oil prices have started improving again  Energy investors are undoubtedly pleased with the cartel s announcement as the commodity market is already flooded with plentiful supply of crude 

	However  we note that U S energy players have increased oil rig counts last week  even after OPEC s decision  In fact  the rig count has been increasing for the last five weeks consecutively  It clearly indicates that shale players have started to gather to the oil patches when the major crude producers  including OPEC members and Russia  are expected to curtail their output 

OPEC to Cut Production

	Interestingly  this is the first time since 2008 that OPEC has signed a deal to cut oil production  No doubt this is the most crucial move in the energy sector this year to restore crude prices  In fact  oil has started to recover with West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude currently trading above  50 per barrel mark 

	Per the accord  OPEC will lower its production by 1 2 million barrels per day  MMB D  to 32 5 MMB D   effective Jan 1  2017   from 33 6 MMB D  Notably  the production cut   almost 1  of worldwide output   is much more than what was projected by most analysts 

	Saudi Arabia has shouldered most of the output cut  It will lower production by about 486 000 barrels per day  Iraq  on the other hand  agreed to cut output by 210 000 barrels per day  which marks the second highest reduction  Also  non OPEC players  such as Russia  have shown willingness to cut production by 600 000 barrels per day  Of the total amount  Russia   the major non OPEC oil producing player   alone will cut output by 300 000 barrels 

Why More Oil Rigs on OPEC s Decision 

	The present state of affairs is being considered by many as an opportune moment for U S shale players to outpace OPEC in the race for production share  With the cartel s output sacrifice  the U S energy companies are expected to take advantage of higher oil prices in the coming days by producing more oil 

	In fact  U S energy players added more rigs last week  after OPEC announced its decision to curb output  In its weekly release  Houston  TX based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc   NYSE      reported higher U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country  than the previous week 

	Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 597 in the week ended Dec 2  2016  This was up by four from the week before  In details  the report shows that oil rigs in the U S increased by three  while the natural gas rig count rose by one 

Shale Players on the Rise

	It is a well documented fact that the Permian Basin has witnessed higher rise in rigs over the last week than any other major basin  The other three basins that showed increased rig counts are Haynesville  Eagle Ford and Barnett  As expected  the companies involved in exploration operations in those oil patches showed stock price appreciation 

	Concho Resources Inc   NYSE      and Devon Energy Corp   NYSE      having resources in the Permian Basin improved 6 3  and 16   respectively  over the last five days  On the other hand  Marathon Oil Corp   NYSE      and Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE      with acres in the Eagle Ford basin increased 20  and 19   respectively  during the same period 

	Also  each of these Zacks Rank  3  Hold  companies outperformed the broader industry  year to date  You can see   

	To be precise  Concho  Devon and Chesapeake gained 53   50  and 61  respectively  while the Zacks categorized Oil   Gas U S Exploration   Production industry increased 47   Moreover  Marathon Oil has showed an improvement of 45  compared with only 5  increment for the Oil   Gas U S Integrated industry 

Bottom Line

	U S players are once again on track to ramp up production  This is not a good sign for the overall energy industry  Once energy firms in the U S  start returning to fields with huge production potential  oil will again hit bottoms

196695,418211,DVN,Transocean  RIG  To Post Q3 Earnings  What To Expect ,opinion,"Offshore drilling powerhouse Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   is set to release its third quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on Wednesday  Nov 2 
What Investors Need to Know
The company s stock performance has been pretty choppy lately  and it will be up to this coming release to set the trend heading into 2017 
However  the Switzerland based rig supplier has an excellent industry rank   in the top 16  overall  Transocean also has a  B  for its   so fundamentals are pretty strong for this stock 
Adding to the positives  the company has a very good track record when it comes to earnings and has beaten estimates in each of the last twelve quarters  as you can see in the chart below TRANSOCEAN LTD Price and EPS Surprise
 

   But for a stock exhibiting such great vibes  earnings estimates have been rather stagnant  as the consensus estimate has been unmoved over the past few months  This is something that investors definitely don t want to see heading into a report 
Therefore  the signals are mixed and it seems as if it could be a rockier report than one might think 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
As is the case with other offshore drillers  Transocean s revenues earnings have borne the brunt of the freefall in realized commodity prices over the past 2 years  As oil remains in a bearish territory  the top energy companies have cut spending  particularly on the costly drilling projects  on the back of lower profit margins  This  in turn  has meant less work for the beleaguered drillers as offshore exploration for new oil and gas projects has almost come to a standstill 
However  Transocean has come up with certain strategy initiatives to overcome the industry wide slump 
Firstly  with an aggressive cost reduction program  Transocean is looking to shore up its operational performance even in this weak oil and gas pricing environment  As part of this strategy  the company has embarked on a policy to optimize overhead and maintenance expenses 
Secondly  Transocean has zeroed its focus on reducing out of service times by carefully planning the frequency of its in service maintenance and shipyard repairs 
Finally  Transocean has set itself an ambitious target to achieve a very impressive 95  revenue efficiency for 2016  As it is  the company is coming off three consecutive years with revenue efficiency at or above 95  The continuation of this trend will aid operating margin in the to be reported quarter  
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Transocean will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  7 69   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 12 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher  at 13 cents 
Zacks Rank  Transocean has a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Transocean  here are some firms from the energy space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
W T Offshore Inc    NYSE WTI   has an Earnings ESP of  11 63  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is expected to release earnings results on Nov 2  You can see  
Devon Energy Corp    NYSE DVN   has an Earnings ESP of  20 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  The partnership is anticipated to release earnings on Nov 1 
Comstock Resources Inc    NYSE CRK   has an Earnings ESP of  3 74  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is likely to release earnings on Nov 8

196696,418212,DVN,Can Emerge Energy Services  EMES  Surprise Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Fracking sand player Emerge Energy Services L P    NYSE EMES   is set to release its third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Wednesday  Nov 2 
In the preceding three month period  the Southlake  TX based partnership posted a negative earnings surprise of 25 81  
As far as the earnings surprise history is concerned  Emerge Energy Services has a dismal record  its missed estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average miss of 112 26  EMERGE ENRG SVC Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Factors to Consider This Quarter
Emerge Energy Services  successful initiatives in controlling costs  both fixed and variable  across all aspects of its business will improve its competitive positioning and augment its bottom line 
However  following the sale of its fuels unit   the partnership s stable earnings segment   to Sunoco L P    NYSE SUN   for  178 5 million  things look bleak for the to be reported quarter 
Moreover  the ongoing slump in crude prices will continue to take its toll on Emerge Energy Services  third quarter results due to cutbacks in the production of the lucrative  and high margin  fracking sand that is used as a proppant by exploration and production companies   Pricing pressure will add to the woes 
Additionally  the partnership s high leverage and miniscule cash in hand makes Emerge Energy Services vulnerable to even a small decline in revenue and earnings

196698,418214,DVN,EIA Reports Season s First Natural Gas Withdrawal,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a surprise decrease in natural gas supplies   the season s first withdrawal 
About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  Surprise Decline
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 2 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended Nov 18  2016  contrary to the guidance  of 2 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider 
The past week s decline represents the first withdrawal of the 2016 2017 winter heating season after stocks hit an all time high in the previous week  However  the decrease was lower than the 5 year  2011 2015  average drop of 27 Bcf for the reported week 
Moreover  the current storage level   at 4 045 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is still up 39 Bcf  1   from last year and is sitting 241 Bcf  6   above the five year average 
Long Term Thesis Positive
Successive below average builds and now the season s first withdrawal   with strong power sector consumption   has been cutting into the year over year storage surplus  In fact  natural gas prices have rebounded strongly  by more than 90   since hitting 17 year lows of around  1 6 per MMBtu in the first quarter  The dramatic recovery has helped the commodity breach the key psychological level of  3 per MMBtu 
The price strength has translated into major gains for natural gas weighted companies including the likes of Cimarex Energy Co    NYSE XEC    EQT Corp    NYSE EQT    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG    Range Resources Corp    NYSE RRC   and Devon Energy Corp    NYSE DVN   
However  each of these firms has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which does not make them screaming buys  In case you are looking for natural gas names for your portfolio  one could opt for Ultra Petroleum Corp    OTC UPLMQ    It has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Ultra Petroleum shares have outperformed Zacks categorized U S  Oil and Gas Exploration and Production industry over the last three months  You can see  
With the early winter turning out cooler than expected  natural gas demand has picked up on the back of elevated power sector consumption due to air conditioning use  Coupled with the easing production from the major shale plays  natural gas prices are set to rise further 
What s more  rig count is now languishing below 120   compared to almost 200 a year ago and the high of 1 606 reached in 2008  Therefore  production growth is unlikely to resume anytime soon 
In general  sentiment toward natural gas is likely to become more positive in the near future as speculators bet on a frigid winter to follow the hot summer

196708,418224,DVN,Can Williams Companies  WMB  Surprise Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies   NYSE WMB   is set to release its third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Monday  Oct 31 
In the preceding three month period  the Tulsa  OK based company met earnings estimates owing to significant cost reductions and continued improvement in financial performance 
But coming to earnings surprise history  the company has a mixed record  its missed estimates in 2 of the last four quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 26 83  WILLIAMS COS Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Williams is a premier energy infrastructure provider in North America  The company boasts a widespread pipeline system and is one of the largest domestic natural gas transporters by volume  Hence  the company s size and diversity are likely to drive earnings in the to be reported quarter 
The company s midstream assets  which are less sensitive to commodity price fluctuations  help it maintain a steady stream of revenues and cash flows in spite of low natural gas prices 
Despite these positives  we remain concerned about the company s high debt levels that make it vulnerable to an extended drop in commodity prices  The company s exposure to commodity price volatility has also taken a toll on its volume and distribution growth potential    
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Williams Companies will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  12 50   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 14 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher  at 16 cents 
Zacks Rank  Williams Companies has a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

What Investors Need to Know
The company s stock performance has been pretty choppy lately  and it will be up to this coming release to set the trend heading into 2017 
However  The Hague based supermajor has a good industry rank   in the top 41  overall  Shell also has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   so fundamentals are pretty strong for this stock 
But the company has a dismal great track record when it comes to earnings and has missed estimates in each of the last four quarters  as you can see in the chart below ROYAL DTCH SH A Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Earnings estimates have also been sluggish for the stock  as the consensus estimate has been going down over the past few months  This is something that investors definitely don t want to see heading into a report  To make matters worse  it has an  F  for its  
Therefore  notwithstanding Shell s  Buy  rating  the signals are mixed and it seems as if it could be a rockier report than one might think 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Unlike the last quarter  where oil advanced more than 26  sequentially to notch up the best quarterly percentage gain in 7 years  the Jun Sep 2016 period turned out to be a rather flat one with crude barely advancing  In fact  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures during the third quarter hovered around the  45 per barrel mark  flat from the second quarter and down from  46 50 in the same period last year  This does not bode well for Shell and its upstream unit in particular 
Worryingly  there are signs of weakness in the refining business  suggesting that the unit   which saved Shell when crude prices plunged   could now be a drag  The second quarter saw the integrated behemoth s downstream segment income erode on fuel oversupply and weak demand  With refined product inventories remaining at their maximum seasonal levels in at least 20 years and margins set to narrow  Shell could be in for more trouble in the to be reported quarter 
However  production gains present a bright spot for the group  In the previous quarter  Shell s upstream volumes averaged 2 628 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day  MBOE d   24  higher than the year ago period  While crude oil production increased 24   natural gas output was up 23     thanks to the contribution from BG Group that was acquired earlier in the year 
Chevron s successful cost reduction initiatives are expected to cushion the results  At  12 billion  the company s capital and exploration expenditure for the first half of this year has run 31  lower than in the equivalent period of 2015    
Finally  Shell is set to benefit from lower unit costs in the upstream business and is on track achieve its previous guidance of a 20  reduction between 2014 and the end of 2016 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Shell will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises

In the preceding three month period  the Dallas  TX based upstream player delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28 57  in spite of challenges associated with a steep drop in oil price  This was primarily owing to effective cost control measures 
In terms of earnings surprise history  the company has an excellent record  It surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 33 20  EXCO RESOURCES Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
The third quarter saw natural gas advancing around 25  sequentially  Natural gas futures during the Jul Sep 2016 period hovered mostly between  2 5 per million Btu  MMBtu and  3 per MMBtu  Given that the commodity makes up for around 90  of EXCO Resources  total production  the improvement in pricing bodes well for the company 
Moreover  the company s successful cost reduction initiatives are expected to cushion the results to a large extent  The company s efforts to improve liquidity and restructure the balance sheet to enhance capital structure are also expected to have a positive impact on the quarterly results 
However  EXCO Resources  core operational region   the Haynesville shale   has seen a drastic fall in the number of gas rigs employed  Production is likely to suffer as a result

196796,418312,DVN,What s In The Cards For Marathon Oil  MRO  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Leading upstream energy firm Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   is set to release its second quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on Wednesday  Aug 3 
In the preceding three month period  the Houston  TX based company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8 51  despite the challenges that a steep drop in oil price tagged along  The better than expected results came thanks to solid production  at the upper end of guidance  and cost control initiatives 
As far as the earnings surprise history is concerned  the company has an excellent record  its beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 19 93  MARATHON OIL CP Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Unlike the previous few quarters  second quarter 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with crude advancing more than 26  sequentially    the best quarterly percentage gain in seven years   while natural gas prices jumped 49   the most since 2005  Marathon Oil s business will undoubtedly gain from this uptick 
Last quarter  the company s exploration expenses came at  24 million  significantly lower than  90 million in the year earlier quarter  Moreover  Marathon Oil s total quarterly cost and expenses fell 30  to 1 328 million  We expect the company to perform well on the cost front in the to be reported quarter as well 
However  Marathon Oil s decision to cut its capital expenditure by half will lead to production decline  While exploration expenses will be limited  the company will only spend on completing existing projects internationally  
Finally  despite recovering from multi year lows  both oil and natural gas prices are below year ago levels  thereby affecting profitability 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  That is not the case here as you will see below      
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at a loss of 24 cents 
Zacks Rank  Marathon Oil has a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Marathon Oil  here are some domestic upstream you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO   has an Earnings ESP of  33 33  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is anticipated to release earnings on August 2

196797,418313,DVN,Transocean  RIG   Stock Poised To Beat Earnings In Q2 ,opinion,"We expect offshore drilling powerhouse Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   to beat expectations when it reports second quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on Wednesday  Aug 3 
In the preceding three month period  the Vernier  Switzerland based firm delivered a massive positive earnings surprise of 165 38  despite the challenging environment posed by the steep drop in commodity prices throughout the quarter  The outperformance came on the back of a significant decline in operating and maintenance expenses 
Importantly  Transocean has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters with an average beat of 111 84  TRANSOCEAN LTD Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Transocean is likely to beat earnings in the to be reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP   for this company stands at  150 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a penny  whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at a loss of 2 cents  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Transocean carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us confident of an earnings beat 
Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  On the other hand  the Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
What s Driving the Better Than Expected Earnings 
As is the case with other offshore drillers  Transocean s revenues earnings have borne the brunt of the freefall in realized commodity prices over the past 2 years  As oil remains in a bearish territory  the top energy companies have cut spending  particularly on the costly drilling projects  on the back of lower profit margins  This  in turn  has meant less work for the beleaguered drillers as offshore exploration for new oil and gas projects has almost come to a standstill 
However  Transocean has come up with certain strategy initiatives to overcome the industry wide slump and outperform earnings estimates yet again in the second quarter 
Firstly  with an aggressive cost reduction program  Transocean is looking to shore up its operational performance even in this weak oil and gas pricing environment  As part of this strategy  the company has embarked on a policy to optimize overhead and maintenance expenses 
Secondly  Transocean has zeroed its focus on reducing out of service times by carefully planning the frequency of its in service maintenance and shipyard repairs 
Finally  Transocean has set itself an ambitious target to achieve a very impressive 95  revenue efficiency for 2016  As it is  the company is coming off three consecutive years with revenue efficiency at or above 95  The continuation of this trend will aid operating margin in the to be reported quarter 
Other Stocks to Consider
Transocean is not the only company looking up this earnings season  Here are some companies from the energy space which  according to our model  also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Concho Resources Inc    NYSE CXO   has an Earnings ESP of  33 33  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is anticipated to release earnings on August 2

Natural Gas Prices Rise  Bucks the Brexit Trend
When most commodities   save gold   suffered from the uncertainty triggered by Britain s exit from the EU  natural gas prices ended Friday at  2 662 per MMBtu   1 5  higher from last week  This could be attributed to successive below average builds on the back of  keep on cutting into the year over year storage surplus  Things were further helped by predictions of strong cooling demand with forecasts of warmer temperature across the country over the next few days

However  significantly lower year over year injection figures this time has meant that the commodity has been trading above the key psychological level of  2 50 per MMBtu for quite some time now  This might just support a price breakout in the coming weeks

196827,418343,DVN,Natural Gas Hits 9 Month High On Below Average Build,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed a larger than expected increase in natural gas supplies  However  the build was well below historical averages for the sixth week in a row  which further narrowed the supply overhang  This  together with predictions of above normal temperatures across the country in the near term   leading to the commodity s heightened requirement for air conditioning   pushed natural gas futures to a 9 month high 
About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report
The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report   brought out by the Energy Information Administration  EIA  every Thursday since 2002   includes updates on natural gas market prices  the latest storage level estimates  recent weather data and other market activities or events 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of natural gas  It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas weighted companies and related support plays 
Analysis of the Data  Larger than Expected Injection
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 69 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended June 10  2016  above the guidance  of 64 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider 
Following past week s numbers  the current storage level   at 3 041 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is now up 633 Bcf  26   from last year and is sitting 704 Bcf  30   above the five year average 
However  on a positive note  the latest increase was lower than both last year s build of 96 Bcf and the 5 year  2011 2015  average addition of 87 Bcf for the reported week 
Natural Gas Prices Rally
Natural gas prices ended Friday at  2 623 per MMBtu  2 6  higher from last week as successive below average builds on the back of strong power sector consumption keep on cutting into the year over year storage surplus  Things were further helped by predictions of strong cooling demand with forecasts of warmer temperature across the country over the next few days 
The commodity has rebounded strongly  by more than 60   since hitting 17 year lows of around  1 6 per MMBtu in the first quarter  This has boosted shares of natural gas companies like Devon Energy Corp    NYSE DVN   and Range Resources Corp    NYSE RRC    which have popped up more than 30  over the past 3 months 
Are Prices Set to Explode 
The phenomenal run up notwithstanding  natural gas prices are way off the heights reached some years back  From a peak of about  13 50 per MMBtu in 2008 to around  2 60 now  the plummeting value of natural gas represents a decline of 80  over 8 years 
However  significantly lower year over year injection figures this time has meant that the commodity has now crossed the key psychological level of  2 50 per MMBtu  This might just support a price breakout in the coming weeks 
With production from the major shale plays starting to ease and the commodity s demand set to increase with the onset of a  hot  summer  natural gas prices will continue to recover  What s more  rig count has been falling consistently and is now languishing at 86   compared to more than 200 a year ago and the high of 1 606 reached in 2008  Therefore  production growth is unlikely to resume anytime soon 
The price strength translates into upside for natural gas weighted companies including the likes of Cimarex Energy Co    NYSE XEC    EQT Corp    NYSE EQT    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG   and Williams Companies Inc    NYSE WMB   ",2016-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/natural-gas-hits-9-month-high-on-below-average-build-200137061,200137061
196828,418344,DVN,Marathon Oil Buys PayRock Energy  MRO Stock Jumps 10 ,opinion,"Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   has seen its shares fall by 43  over the last year  but their most recent buyout could signal change 
On Monday  Marathon announced that it is buying out PayRock Energy Holdings for  888 million    PayRock owns 61 000 net surface areas in the area of Oklahoma known as the Stack  which is considered by some to be one of the best shale oil reservoirs in the U S   
Following this report  Marathon stock closed at  14 48 share  up 10 03  for the day after opening at  13 85 per share  Marathon raised the funds for the acquisition by decreasing spending  cutting production and selling off more than  1 billion in stock  The company plans on focusing on lower risk domestic production 
Recent Transactions and Plans 
This is Marathon s largest transaction since earlier in the month  when Marathon agreed to spend  334 6 million to settle a dispute over refinery pollution across five U S  states 
It has been a difficult time for MRO as it faces the same difficulties as many other energy companies which are at the mercy of volatile crude prices  This latest move could be the start of a new trend though  as Marathon expects returns on newly drilled wells in the region of 60  to 80  on  50 bbl  oil  news that investors are happy to hear 
Marathon is not the first to purchase property in the Stack  as Devon Energy   NYSE DVN   and Newfield Exploration   NYSE NFX   are also involved in the region  The purchase brings Marathon s total ownership in the Stack up to 200 000 acres and falls well within their announced  1 4 billion capital expenditures budget

196841,418357,DVN,Quarterly Report Cards Provide Comfort ,opinion,"Quarterly Earnings
We re approaching the time of year when report cards proclaiming   what a joy your child is to have in my class  are dispatched with varying degrees of sincerity  Quarterly MLP earnings are the report cards of the industry  and a time when investors can similarly consider whether they are happy to have included PCD  Promised Cashflows Delivered  LP   in their portfolios 
A couple of years ago Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  used to be a reliably boring sector  The influx of new money from ETF and mutual fund investors quickly turned and fled when oil started declining  see   which caused MLPs to be exciting in a decidedly distasteful way 
However  operating results for midstream infrastructure businesses weren t remotely as volatile as their stock prices  which increasingly supports our theory of last year s collapse  it was a funds flow issue caused by recent investors following  and thereby accentuating  near term momentum  Most firms have released their quarterly operating results  and they were generally decent with some mild positive surprises  MLPs rarely release figures that are substantially off expectations 
TransCanada  NYSE TRP  reaffirmed 8 10  growth in its current C 2 26 dividend  yielding 4 4    Targa Resources  NYSE TRGP  experienced some modest softening of margins in their natural gas Gathering and Processing  G P  segment although volumes were overall as expected  Western Gas  NYSE WES  reported EBITDA 15  ahead of expectations due to sharply higher production by Anadarko  NYSE APC   their sponsor  This allowed the GP of WES  Western Gas Equity Partners  NYSE WGP   to grow its distribution 24  YoY  twice the rate of WES  It s why the people who run MLPs don t invest in MLPs  but instead put their money in the GPs that run them  Hedge fund managers make their money from payments they receive from the hedge funds they manage  So it is with MLP managers  As the chart shows  if you add up where MLP insiders invest their own money they prefer GPs by a factor of 22X 

EnLink Midstream Partners  NYSE ENLK  was slightly ahead of expectations and provides 1 09X distribution coverage  Its sponsor and biggest customer Devon Energy  NYSE DVN  raised its production guidance by 3  having previously announced moves to shore up its balance sheet  asset sales  secondary equity offering and sharply reduced 2016 capex   Credit enhancement moves by DVN are good for its MLP  ENLK s GP  EnLink Midstream  NYSE ENLC  yields 7 3  
Spectra Energy Partners  NYSE SEP  reported EBITDA that was 7  below expectations as mild winter weather reduced natural gas volumes  They are pressing on with Access Northeast which will enhance natural gas distribution and storage in New England if it is implemented  Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI  recently cancelled their North East Direct project due to insufficient demand  so it ll be interesting to see how Access plays out  SEP increased its distribution 8  YoY  Their GP Spectra Energy Corp  NYSE SE  yields 5 3  
Energy Transfer Williams
Energy Transfer Equity  NYSE ETE  CEO Kelcy Warren has tried everything to extract himself from his ill advised pursuit of Williams Companies  NYSE WMB   His former CFO lobbied WMB shareholders to reject the deal  with dubious legality and no fiduciary compunction ETE issued preferential securities to management  diluting the deal s value to WMB  they also slashed the anticipated synergies from the original  2BN figure 
Risk arb traders are not a group that normally draws much sympathy  They buy stock in companies that are being acquired and hedge the position by shorting the acquirer  They bet on deals closing as anticipated  which they usually do  Frequent modest profits are occasionally punctuated by expensive surprises  The chart below shows the price of WMB compared with the actual price implied by the terms of the ETE deal  The smaller the spread  or discount to deal terms   the more likely it is to close  The bigger the spread  the less fun risk arb traders are having  You might also think of it as representing the fluctuating stress imposed on involved traders as the odds of the deal closing oscillated  Even Bobby Axelrod  from Billions  would have been challenged to make money  It s a curious set of circumstances when the suitor experiences such rapid regret  see Williams Stands Alone at the Altar  and that made it harder for some to assess likely outcomes 

Kelcy Warren recently said of the deal   We can t close  We don t have a transaction that can close  So I want to be very clear  we can t close this transaction   Since the absence of an affirmative tax opinion is the basis for this conclusion  we can assume that such insight was arrived at only belatedly  after the other forms of avoidance described above had been used   They may still close on altered terms  although since the WMB board was previously divided on the topic it s hard to imagine them coming together on less favorable terms given recent history  ETE s tax counsel has certainly earned their fee

Analysis of the Data  A Smaller than Expected Injection
Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose by 73 billion cubic feet  Bcf  for the week ended May 13  2016  below the guidance  of 79 Bcf gain  as per the analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts  a leading independent commodities and energy data provider  Moreover  the increase was lower than both last year s build of 98 Bcf and the 5 year  2011 2015  average addition of 91 Bcf for the reported week 
But in spite of past week s bullish numbers  the current storage level   at 2 754 trillion cubic feet  Tcf    is still up 791 Bcf  40   from last year and is sitting 795 Bcf  41   above the five year average 
Natural Gas Prices Edged Down Last Week
Natural gas prices ended Friday at  2 062 per MMBtu  1 6  lower from last week as an encouraging inventory report was more than offset by predictions of mild weather amid lingering oversupply concerns  The commodity  though  has rebounded around 30  since hitting 17 year lows of around  1 6 per MMBtu in the first quarter  This has boosted shares of natural gas companies like Devon Energy Corp    NYSE DVN   and Range Resources Corp    NYSE RRC    which have popped up more than 60  over the past 3 months 
Prices Remain Depressed on Bearish Fundamentals
Natural gas prices are way off the heights reached some years back  From a peak of about  13 50 per MMBtu in 2008 to just over  2 now  the plummeting value of natural gas represents a decline of 85  over 8 years 
With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge  natural gas prices have been held back  What s more  industrial requirement has been lackluster over the past few years with demand barely rising 
In the past  winter weather has played a factor in boosting prices with demand for domestic natural gas exceeding available supply  But with no dearth of new supply  even this association is becoming more and more obsolete  Also  the past winter   being unseasonably warmer than normal   hampered the heating fuel s demand and keeping inventories at high level 
The price weakness translates into limited upside for natural gas weighted companies including the likes of Cimarex Energy Co    NYSE XEC    EQT Corp    NYSE EQT    Southwestern Energy Co    NYSE SWN    Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG   and Williams Companies Inc    NYSE WMB   ",2016-05-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/natural-gas-ticks-lower-despite-small-inventory-addition-200131661,200131661

196857,418373,DVN,Oil Up On Iran Cooperation,opinion,"Oil prices soared after Iran said they support efforts to stabilize the oil market  While Iran s oil Iran s oil minister Bijan Zanganeh seemed to say they would not join other members in freezing output  they did say that OPEC understood their special situation  The market took this as a sign that there were some negotiations going back and forth to allow Iran to regain some market share that was lost under international sanctions  In other words  the road to a production freeze and eventually a cut  is still on track 
Critics of course are saying why would the Saudis allow Iran to get back market share  After all  the Saudis have no diplomatic and commercial ties with Iran after the flap over the execution by Saudi Arabia of a popular Shite cleric  That was met by the storming of the Saudi Arabian embassy in Iran  But the Saudis are feeling the economic pain and even the largest producer in the OPEC cartel is bleeding cash  Even though they can get oil out of the ground cheaply  they still have an economy and a couple of wars they have to pay for  It is getting so bad that Saudi Arabia s debt rating was cut by two notches to A  from A  stable  This was the second time in four months that Saudi Arabia s debt rating has been cut by S P  Other oil producers such as Bahrain lost its investment grade status and oil producer Oman was lowered to the last rating above junk status  Qatar s AA rating was affirmed 
The reason why all the major OPEC and non OPEC players are talking is they just can t take it anymore  They are all going broke and fear that if they do not stabilize prices  the global economy will crack and they will all lose as oil demand falls  They are past their point of pain  The market knows the significance of these talks because if completed  it will be the first agreement between OPEC and non Opec nations in 15 years  Back then there were many skeptics about that deal as well  but it led to a bottom in oil prices at levels we have not seen since 
The market s reaction is so positive because traders realize the historic nature of these talks and the progress that we have seen so far  This is a total turnaround from expectations from just a month ago  At that time it seemed like producers we digging in their heels on output  Many said they would not ever consider cuts or a freeze  Of course that was last month 
This comes against a backdrop of plunging cap x spending across the energy space  The latest big cuts come from Devon Energy  N DVN  that said it will lay off 20 per cent of its staff in the first quarter of the year 
Oil also is getting support by a surprisingly bullish American Petroleum Institute  API  report  The API reported that U S  crude inventories fell by 3 26 million barrels last week  We also saw a 2 02 million barrels drop in distillate supply  On top of that we also saw a very minor increase in gasoline supply of 750 00 barrels  Today we will see if the Energy Information Administration report that will be released because of the President s Day holiday  The Weekly Petroleum Status Report will be released on Thursday  February 18  2016 at 11 00 A M  and 1 00 P M   Eastern Time  due to the holiday 
Trying to find the exact bottom is hard we see the contango building signaling higher prices in the future  Just like 15 years ago  an OPEC non Opec agreement signaled a bottom and it could very well be doing that again ",2016-02-18,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-phil-flynn-energy-report-02-18-2016-200118770,200118770

196869,418385,DVN,Bullish Bets On Oil Go Sour,opinion,"Prominent hedge fund manager Andy Hall got burned in July after oil prices crashed  Heading up Astenbeck Capital Management  Hall has made very large bets that oil prices would rebound  citing the unsustainably low oil prices and the rise of demand across the world  particularly in Asia 
But July was a brutal month for him  His hedge fund lost 17 percent of its value  or about  500 million 
Bloomberg profiled him and another notable trader  Pierre Andurand  who has taken the opposite position  arguing that oil prices will remain low for the next two years  And while Hall s hedge fund saw millions go up in smoke  Andurand s hedge fund  Andurand Capital Management  rose by 3 5 percent in July 
However  Hall maintains that a rebound is near  He s right that global demand continues to rise  The International Energy Agency  IEA   in its July oil market report that oil demand will hit 94 97 million barrels per day  mb d  by the end of the year  a nearly 2 mb d jump from the second quarter  Demand will increase in 2016 as well   the IEA says by another 1 2 mb d 

Moreover  the supply picture should begin correcting  although data is wildly all over the map  Weaker shale drillers are starting to look pretty fragile under the weight of their mounting debt  Drillers raised  44 billion in fresh debt and equity between January and June of this year  a level of largesse that cannot continue  Debt is getting more expensive and restrictive  Hedging positions and insurance that have protected drillers through much of this year is expiring  And an increasing volume of debt is dropping into  distressed  territory and bond prices for weak drillers are crashing 
That could lead to more defaults and bankruptcies in the coming months   Some of them are essentially running on fumes   says Jimmy Vallee  a partner at the Houston law firm Paul Hastings 
A shakeout in the sector could trickle over into actual levels of oil production  So far  output has been steady and resilient  even though it has leveled off after years of growth 

Moreover  there is reason to believe that production data doesn t add up  The EIA s weekly data has production increasing all the way through June  And the latest weekly data shows production at 9 46 mb d in the last week of July  having fallen just slightly from highs of around 9 6 mb d earlier in the month 
However  EIA s    which is more reliable   shows that production peaked in April at 9 69 mb d  and fell 180 000 barrels per day in May to 9 5 mb d  That would be consistent with the EIA s monthly drilling productivity report  which expects another 91 000 barrel per day decline in August 
So what are we to make of this  Taken together  it appears that although production is still elevated  supply could have already been contracting a few months ago  Still  the markets have grown pessimistic in recent weeks after seeing EIA weekly data  which could be overstating the supply picture 

On the flip side  some drillers are still somehow squeezing out more oil even though prices are low  Whiting Petroleum Corporation  NYSE WLL   the largest driller in North Dakota  saw its production hit 170 000 barrels per day in the second quarter of this year  an all time high for the company  Continental Resources Inc  NYSE CLR   which also focused on the Bakken  extracted 10 percent more oil and gas in the quarter 
Devon Energy  NYSE DVN   a company based in Oklahoma City  increased production by 30 percent in the second quarter  Pioneer Resources  a Texas based exploration company  boosted production by 10 percent  and even promised to send rigs back to the field to drill more 
The confusing figures on the supply side are frustrating to the oil markets  which are seeking clarity about where exactly the sector is heading 
And to be sure  even though many companies are achieving production gains  many are not making money  as profits have all but been zeroed out by the collapse in oil prices 
But that is cold comfort for hedge fund managers like Andy Hall  who are extraordinary bullish on the price of oil  Companies that continue to drill and somehow manage to increase production will merely ensure that oil prices will remain low for quite some time ",2015-08-10,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bullish-bets-on-oil-go-sour-261041,261041
196882,418398,DVN, Energy Earnings  Here s The Silver Lining,opinion,"If you re unimpressed by the recent earnings reports in the energy sector  you re not alone Natural gas companies in particular have reported less than stellar earnings over the past couple of weeks 
With gas prices declining   along with stagnant overall demand and increasing supplies   companies like Chesapeake  NYSE CHK   Devon  NYSE DVN   and Encana  NYSE ECA  just weren t able to generate killer profits  As a result  all three companies are well off their 52 week highs achieved earlier this year 
Don t give up hope just yet  though  There s still an opportunity to scoop up some short term gains with these stocks 
Taking Evasive Action
The price of natural gas dropped in the second quarter and averaged in the low  4s per thousand cubic feet  mcf   which just isn t high enough for these companies to turn a decent profit  Prices need to be at least at the  5 per mcf level for the big bucks to kick in  yet with gas prices now sitting in the  3s  the third quarter promises to look even worse 
But that doesn t mean these companies are doomed  Far from it 
These firms are taking action to strengthen their futures after a major debt binge in the last decade  And they have huge assets on their books  which they re selling to free up cash 
For example  Devon received over  2 8 billion from the sale of non core assets in the second quarter  Chesapeake has been selling billions of dollars  worth of property to deleverage its balance sheet   leaving the company with the most prolific producing properties in areas like the Marcellus Shale and the Permian Basin 
These companies are also shifting production from natural gas to liquids   It s an easy shift back when natural gas prices head higher   Devon is now projecting that liquids will account for close to 60  of its production by the end of the year 
Natural gas liquids deliver much higher margin  so we should actually start to see profits move higher in the third and fourth quarters  as far as year over year comparisons are concerned  
Chesapeake has a long way to go in this regard  While revenue increased significantly year over year  the company s business is still tilted towards natural gas instead of liquids  This means it saw lower margins than Devon this quarter 
At the same time  however  that s also where the future opportunity lies for CHK  As it continues to shift production to liquids  we should start seeing higher margins going forward 
Will this be enough to compensate for slowing growth in the industry overall  though 
Has the Energy Story Stalled 
The growth in the energy market that was beginning to take hold in Europe has stalled  And events in the Middle East and Russia are putting a damper on growth prospects in those regions  That leaves the United States  China  and India to pick up the slack in terms of energy demand 
Yet while China and India look to be increasing demand  the United States is actually seeing flat demand for oil   even while the economy is humming  Still  given the actions the companies above are taking  I m convinced that even dismal third and fourth quarters may offer a chance to buy into some good names that have stupendous long term potential 
And  the chase  continues ",2014-08-18,Karim Rahemtulla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-earnings:-here’s-the-silver-lining-222928,222928
196883,418399,DVN,What The Strong Dollar Does To Gold  Oil   And Why We re Seeing Green,opinion,"The United States is doing better than it has in years  Jobs growth is up  unemployment is down   carries the rest of the world on its shoulders like a wounded soldier and the World Economic Forum named the U S  the third most competitive nation  our highest ranking since before the recession  As heretical as it sounds  there s a downside to America s success  and that s a stronger dollar  Although our currency has softened recently  it has put pressure on two commodities that we consider our lifeblood at U S  Global Investors  gold and oil  It s worth noting that we ve been here before  In October 2011  a similar correction occurred in energy  commodities and resources stocks based on European and Chinese growth fears  But international economic stimulus measures helped raise market confidence  and many of the companies we now own within these sectors benefited  Between October 2011 and January 2012  Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC  rose 58 percent  Canadian Natural Resources Limited  NYSE CNQ   20 percent  Devon Energy  NYSE DVN   15 percent  Cimarex Energy Co  NYSE XEC   15 percent  Peyto Exploration Development Corp  TO PEY   15 percent  and Suncor Energy  NYSE SU   10 percent  Granted  we face new challenges this year that have caused market jitters Ebola and ISIS  just to name a couple  But we re confident that once the dollar begins to revert back to the mean  a rally in energy and resources stocks might soon follow  Brian Hicks  portfolio manager of our Global Resources Fund  PSPFX   notes that he s been nibbling on cheap stocks ahead of a potential rally  one that  he hopes  mimics what we saw in late 2011 and early 2012  A repeat of last year s abnormally frigid winter  though unpleasant  might help heat up some of the sectors and companies that have underperformed lately  September Was the Cruelest Month On the left side of the chart below  you can see 45 years  worth of data that show fairly subdued fluctuations in gold prices in relation to the dollar  On the right side  by contrast  you can see that the strong dollar pushed bullion prices down 6 percent in September  historically gold s strongest month  This move is unusual also because gold has had a monthly standard deviation of  5 5 percent based on the last 10 years  worth of data  Here s another way of looking at it  On October 3  bullion fell below  1 200 to prices we haven t seen since 2010  but they quickly rebounded to the  1 240 range as the dollar index receded from its peak the same day  There s no need to worry just yet  This isn t 2013  when the metal gave back 28 percent  And despite the correction  would it surprise you to learn that gold has actually outperformed several of the major stock indices this year  As for gold stocks  there s no denying the facts  With few exceptions  they ve been taken to the woodshed  September was demonstrably cruel  Based on the last five years  worth of data  the NYSE ARCA Gold BUGS Index has had a monthly standard deviation of  9 4  but last month it plunged 20 percent  We haven t seen such a one month dip since April 2013  This volatility exemplifies why we always advocate for no more than a 10 percent combined allocation to gold and gold stocks in investor portfolios  Oil s slump is a little more complicated to explain  Since the end of World War II  black gold has been priced in U S  greenbacks  This means that when our currency fluctuates as dramatically as it has recently  it affects every other nation s consumption of crude  Crude Oil  then  has become much more expensive lately for the slowing European and Asian markets  Weaker purchasing power equals less overseas oil demand equals even lower prices  What some people are calling the American energy renaissance has also led to lower oil prices  Spurred by more efficient extraction techniques such as fracking  the U S  has been producing over 8 5 million barrels a day  the highest domestic production level since 1986  We re awash in the stuff  with supply outpacing demand  Whereas the rest of the world has flat lined in terms of oil production  the U S  has zoomed to 30 year highs  In a way  American shale oil has become a victim of its own success  At the end of next month  members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  are scheduled to meet in Vienna  As Brian speculated during our most recent webcast  it would be surprising if we didn t see another production cut  With Brent oil for November delivery at  83 a barrel a four year low many oil rich countries  including Iran  Iraq and Venezuela and Saudi Arabia  will have a hard time balancing their books  Venezuela  in fact  has been clamoring for an emergency meeting ahead of November to make a plea for production cuts       Although not an OPEC member  Russia  once the world s largest producer of crude  is being squeezed by plunging oil prices on the left  international sanctions on the right  This might prompt President Vladimir Putin to scale back the country s presence in Ukraine and delay a multibillion dollar revamp of its armed forces  When the upgrade was approved in 2011  GDP growth was expected to hold at 6 percent  But now as a result of the sanctions and dropping oil prices  Russia faces a dismally flat 0 5 percent  Volatility Has Returned The current all in sustaining cost to produce one ounce of gold is hovering between  1 000 and  1 200  With the price of bullion where it is  many miners can barely break even  Production has been down 10 percent because it s become costlier to excavate  As I told Kitco News  Daniela Cambone last week  we will probably start seeing supply shrinkage in North and South America and Africa  The same could happen to oil production  Extraction of shale oil here in the U S  costs companies between  50 and  100 a barrel  with producers able to break even at around  80 to  85  If prices slide even further  drillers might be forced to trim their capital budgets or even shelve new projects  Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations told NPR s Audie Cornish that a decrease in drilling could    I f prices fall far enough for long enough  you ll see a pullback in drilling  And shale drilling uses a lot of manufactured goods 20 percent of what people spend on a well is steel  10 percent is cement  so less drilling means less manufacturing in those sectors   At the same time  Levi places oil prices in a long term context  reminding listeners that we ve become accustomed to unusually high prices for the last three years   People were starting to believe that this was permanent  and they were wrong   he said   So the big news is that volatility is back   On this note  be sure to visit our interactive and perennially popular  which you can modify to view gold and oil s performance going back ten years  A Penny Saved Is a Billion Dollars To Spend and Invest With fresh volatility in oil production comes the fear that the most price sensitive states will be hurt the most  Exceptionally vulnerable states include Oklahoma  Wyoming and North Dakota  Texas  the nation s leading oil producer one of the world s top producers  in fact is diversified well enough to not feel the pain as much  What s bad for oil producers  though  turns out to be good for American consumers  who are already benefiting from lower gasoline prices  As of this writing  the national average for a gallon of gas is  3 10  down from  3 35 a year ago  according to AAA s  As a result  American consumers are looking at huge savings  40 billion this year alone  According to Deutsche Bank s  every penny that s saved at the pump equates to a billion dollars in household energy consumption that can be put back into the economy in other ways          I like to think of this as an unexpected and very welcome tax break  Automobile sales are already up from 2009  Lower gas prices might encourage some families to spring for that Suburban instead of a Prius

amount of revenue generated by each one of these companies in the second quarter of 2014  Klondex s first quarter of full commercial production  What the chart conveys is that  in relation to its peers  Klondex has a significantly higher profit margin than companies with a market cap two to three times its size   This is going to be very positive for Klondex shareholders as we go into the year end   portfolio manager Ralph Aldis said during our webcast   The third quarter should be another great quarter  and that s when people will say   Hey  that second quarter report wasn t a fluke   They re going to start buying the stock and get it moving   Indeed  Klondex has managed to stay above the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  ARCA GDXJ  ETF for the 12 month period  delivering a positive

196884,418400,DVN,Chesapeake Stuns The Market,opinion,"I ve seen the signs of Chesapeake Energy Corporation  NYSE CHK  success since  were in the low  20s 
Since that time  the company has shown its ability to consistently navigate around the many obstacles in the natural gas and LNG markets 
As a result  the stock jumped to more than  31 this past June 
Now  shares have returned to the low  20s on the back of a decline in natural gas prices 
But don t fret  The company has risen from the ashes yet again 
New Sheriff Commands Order
Chesapeake has always been a natural gas producer first  and a liquids producer second 
That reasoning was justified a few years ago when then CEO Aubrey McClendon went on a multi billion dollar land buying spree that left the company more than  15 billion in debt 
Since 2008  the company had dumped tens of billions on capital spending over and above cash flow  resulting in declining earnings and a piss poor performance 
But that era came to an end with McClendon s ouster in early 2013 
His replacement  Doug Lawler  had one mandate  Reduce debt fast 
Since Lawler s takeover  he has commanded the clearance of billions in assets  most of which weren t central to the company s core operations 
But a sale in mid October will likely be his crowning achievement when it comes to debt disposal  And you should be adding to or initiating a position in Chesapeake today 
Dropping All Debt
In the face of the biggest decline in oil prices since 2010  Chesapeake sold a huge chunk of its natural gas and oil acreage to Southwestern Energy Company  NYSE SWN  for more than  5 3 billion 
As part of this deal  Chesapeake will shed 413 000 acres with 1 500 wells in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania 
The deal also includes wells in the Marcellus and Utica shales that produced about 336 million cubic feet of gas per day last month 
The crazy thing is  this sale won t affect the growth rate of the company s remaining assets  which is expected to remain between 7  to 10  going forward  
It will  however  impact the company s future earnings for the better 
Worth So Much More
To put the magnitude of Chesapeake s current sale in perspective  at the time it was announced that Chesapeake s market capitalization was about  12 billion 
The sale of this one asset represented almost half of its market cap  So the remaining company is now flush with capital 
Indeed  Chesapeake will have a measurable performance that isn t clouded by interest expense and debt service for the first time in a decade 
To top it off  even after the sale  the company still owns massive assets in the major oil and gas producing regions of the United States 
Those assets are majorly undervalued  too 
Consider that energy companies Encana Corporation  NYSE ECA  and Devon Energy Corporation  NYSE DVN  spent over  12 billion in the last two years on just two acquisitions  The fact that companies are buying up properties means they re anticipating stronger energy markets ahead  despite the current decline 
Plus  while the price of oil and gas are critical for future profits  after this sale they re less critical than they were just a few months ago 
Bottom line  Chesapeake has managed to almost completely deleverage its decade of debt in just the past two years  If this company could survive  2 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas and the biggest recession of our generation  the prospects of operating in a better environment could be nothing short of spectacular 
And  the chase  continues

Stocks gained on Friday following the announcement of a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia  The S P 500 Index and Russell 2000 Index exceeded their December peaks to close at new all time highs  Momentum indicators for the major equity benchmarks in the US continue to be bullish  suggesting that the early February low may have been an important one  The S P 500 Index  Dow Jones Industrial Average  and Russell 2000 Index all tested support at their respective 200 day moving average lines as the month began  leading to the healthy bounce that has led to the present highs  Now that resistance at the previous peak has been broken  next level of significance on the upside for the S P 500 Index can be found at 2150  representing trendline resistance that has restrained trading activity for over a year 



Looking at the near term seasonal tendencies  the last half of February has historically been fairly negative for stocks  Over the last 20 years  the S P 500 Index has fallen by an average of 1 15  between February 16th and March 2nd  The large cap index has ended lower in 65  of those seasonally weak periods  This period typically follows the monthly options expiration date  an event that has the tendency to act as a pivot point to the prevailing market trend  The next seasonal up leg for stocks  the trend that lifts all boats  runs from the start of March through to the start of May as investors react to first quarter earning reports

Stocks have had a lacklustre start to 2015  consolidating following fairly healthy gains accumulated last year  The S P 500 index has traded within an 80 point range that topped out around 2 064 as investors remained cautious given the overhanging macroeconomic issues  Defensive assets  such as bonds and high yielding equities  were the beneficiaries of the market uncertainty through the month of January  but the risk off trend is showing signs of changing  Following another strong employment report for the month of January  treasury yields in the U S  traded firmly higher  forcing investors out of some of those higher yielding equities in the utilities and REIT sectors  Consumer staples and health care  two defensive sectors  have also started to show performance that is lagging that of the broad market as investors rotate towards materials  financials  and consumer discretionary  This cyclical rotation is typically a positive for the broad equity market as investors venture out on the risk spectrum 
Seasonally  cyclical sectors  including industrials  materials  energy  financials and consumer discretionary tend to perform well into the spring  benefiting from the uptick in economic activity following the winter months  This risk on sentiment amongst equity investors tends to result in gains for the S P 500 index  particularly during the months of March and April  Between March 1 and May 5  the large cap benchmark has recorded gains 75 per cent of the time over the past 20 years  resulting in an average gain of 4 23 per cent  Assuming markets can get past some of the overhanging macroeconomic concerns  there is a strong probability for further gains in stock prices during the months ahead 


Sentiment on Friday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended close to neutral at 0 97

196886,418402,DVN,Why Hedge Funds Love These 2 Energy Companies ,opinion,The state of things in the oil and gas industry makes it quite difficult to recommend energy stocks to investors  If nothing else  the decline in profits that energy companies have been posting since the price of oil started declining about a year ago is enough reason not to look in the direction of energy companies  In the midst of this turbulence  however  hedge funds have been putting their money in some energy companies  I ve always believed that  while it is important to have set investing principles   and stay committed to them   to become successful at investing  looking at what institutional investors are investing in is worth it  The size of the assets these investors manage means that they always conduct their due diligence before making decisions  While you may not want to base your decisions off institutional investors  watching them could help put your sentiment in check  Having said that  here are two energy companies smart money loves in this uninspiring oil and gas environment    Devon Energy Corp   NYSE DVN  On Friday  May 1  Third Point s Daniel Loeb lauded Devon Energy Corp as one of the best value plays in the oil and gas sector in a letter to   The hedge fund manager said it recently initiated a position in Devon  Here is why Third Point loves Devon  From the letter  it is obvious that Devon s effort to improve the quality of its portfolio and its operational efficiency is what Loeb likes about Devon   We believe the company has significant scope for improvement on operational execution as management begins to focus its capital in fewer  higher return areas   Loeb said in his letter  By 2016  Devon is expected to direct almost all of its capital towards the Eagleford shale  the Permian Basin and the CanaWoodford  all of which are high return areas  While this move increases the risk of investing in Devon due to reduced diversification  this move will help the company cut costs significantly  thereby  improving margins  Moreover  with the uncertainties surrounding the oil and gas space  being able to streamline one s business to focus on what s core will differentiate between companies that will survive and those that won t Due to the efficiency hack that Devon is employing  Loeb s hedge fund believes that Devon has an upside potential of up to 50  from May 1 s closing price of  68 61 per share    Cheniere Energy  Inc   ARCA LNG  Cheniere Energy is primarily involved in liquefied natural gas  LNG  related business  The company has two segments  LNG Terminal Business  and LNG and Natural Gas Marketing Business  The company s major LNG assets include the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana and Corpus Christi LNG terminal in Texas  The table below shows a list of institutional investors that recently increased their positions in Cheniere Source  Nasdaq com From the table we can see that hedge funds are bullish on the company  Some of them include Baupost Group  Viking Global and Lone Pine Capital  So what s there to love about a company that have had a negative net income for at least five years  with the trend getting worse  First  one should note that both of the company s LNG exports facilities are still under construction at various stages  Despite this  though  Cheniere has been going about signing up customers on long term  take or pay contracts on the gas that its Sabine Pass facility will process  As of now  over 88  of the facility s capacity has already been  in the said contracts  In addition  as for its Corpus Christi export facility  about 57  of the facility s capacity has also been tied down in long term contracts   even though the company is still seeking certain governmental permits for the facility  Perhaps the huge value of these deals is the reason why hedge funds are bullish on this company  The company projects that these facilities   in addition to its marketing business   could generate between  5 2 billion and  6 9 billion in EBIDTA in five years  time  Going by this projection  the company potentially has an enterprise value to EBIDTA ratio between 3 75 and 4 98   using the company s current enterprise value of  25 88 billion  This is a huge improvement on the company s current  79 05 EV to EBIDTA ratio  In addition  this is significantly lower than S P 500 s total enterprise value to EBIDTA of 12    Final Word Overall  while the bullishness of hedge funds on these companies are mostly based on what is to be rather than what is already on the ground  I believe that these hedge funds are making smart decisions  These two companies present juicy growth potentials and they could be awesome growth portfolio additions for investors who can stomach a sizeable amount of risk ,2015-05-04,Prakash Sundaram,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-hedge-funds-love-these-two-energy-companies-250591,250591

196904,418420,DVN,Porter Stansberry  The Greatest Threat To The U S  Economy,opinion,America is staring down a fiscal catastrophe  says Porter Stansberry  the outspoken investment analyst who has coined the phrase  the end of America   Americans are living beyond their means  he says  and the global economy is tired of holding our debt  Nothing short of economic disaster will befall us  But amid such grim predictions  in this interview with The Gold Report  Stansberry takes a moment to praise the enduring value of timeless investments  such as farmland and     Krispy Kreme  Stansberry shares his thoughts on everything from the Federal Reserve to Hong Kong  The Gold Report  When we spoke in   you said that the tax base will expand and people shouldn t fear going over the cliff they should fear not going over the cliff  Clearly  we went over the cliff  Were you surprised at the lack of public reaction to the sequestration and the enthusiasm the market has had since then  Porter Stansberry  No  I thought the press about the so called fiscal cliff was nonsense and that the amount of reductions in government spending wouldn t make any difference  I wasn t worried the fiscal cliff would have any material impact on the financial markets  I was worried that the fiscal deficit problems would get worse if we didn t expand the tax base  But at the end of the day  it s a wash because spending will continue to go up and there is no way we can finance it with taxes  TGR  You ve written about what you call  the end of America   This describes a shift of direct exchange treatments  caused by the debasement of the U S  dollar through quantitative easing  QE   that will result in the dollar no longer being the world s reserve currency  Many other countries  notably Japan  have recently been doing aggressive QE  Has that impacted the effects of QE in the U S   PS  I would rather answer the question this way  Everyone else s sovereign debt is priced off of the 10 year U S  Treasury yield  Demand for U S  government paper will  sooner or later  collapse when creditors around the world realize that the U S  government is bankrupt  When that moment of realization comes  our bond market will collapse  I wrote a piece for the S A Digest on May 10 when the junk bond market average yield went below 5   I said that this is as far as the Federal Reserve can press down interest rates  There is no way you can make money in junk bonds when your average yield is below 5   I said get the heck out of bonds  That happened to be the same moment when the market for Japanese Government Bonds  JGBs  also began to collapse  I don t think that s a coincidence  JGBs fell because the Japanese government said it was going to print unlimited amounts of new yen and manipulate its markets overtly  That is the same thing that has been happening in America for the last four years  We supposedly live in a free country but try giving up your passport and leaving  We supposedly have free market capitalism but what happens to the entire world s markets when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks  What he says drives all of the world s stock markets  bond markets and currency markets  I do not think we have free market capitalism when one man s opinion determines the outcome of every market in the world  I believe the most important impact of quantitative easing will be the loss of prestige and power for the world s central banks  I believe  sooner or later  the negative consequences of manipulating prices and debasing our currencies will overwhelm the near term bubbles they have created  In Japan  investors are abandoning the sovereign debt market in a wholesale way  I believe that is what triggered the run we have seen out of U S  Treasuries  too  Investors suddenly realized that these markets can still crash     and if the currency falls far enough  the central bank cannot act  I believe both market moves were inevitable and were caused by the previous bubbles in those markets that were engineered by the central banks  TGR  Bernanke signaled that there could be a potential scaling back on QE and that the market is going down based on that  Does that mean the Fed s decisions have been buoying the market  PS  The recent activity in the markets is the natural reaction to a manipulated market  All of the previous central bank buying means that market participants do not know what the actual value of the bonds really is  We do not want to find out the hard way  Also  who is going to buy when the Fed starts selling  It has  3 trillion   3T  worth of assets  As people around the world begin to flee from sovereign debt  there is going to be a bear market in U S Treasury bonds  We have not seen a crisis where people flee out of Treasury bonds in a very long time  but we are at that point because the Fed s printing of dollars to manipulate the Treasury rate destroys the credibility of the entire paper sovereign system  TGR  Where will that money go  PS  It can go into 30 day Treasury bills  T bills   which is a great place to hide  It can go into real estate  timber  euros  It can go into Chinese yuan or Hong Kong dollars  The latter is an interesting trade because Hong Kong dollars are pegged to the U S  dollar  You could have short term Hong Kong dollars that would give you an upside as people flee into the dollar  and you have the option of turning it into Chinese yuan someday  If the dollar collapses  there is no doubt the Hong Kong monetary authority would stop following the dollar and start following the yuan  TGR  How bad does it have to get before the Hong Kong dollar converts to the yuan  PS  Hong Kong works on the basis of a currency board  For every Hong Kong dollar in circulation  there has to be a matching dollar in the Treasury  It s not mismanaged  It doesn t have to break the tie to the dollar it can keep it as long as it wants  In the short term  the U S  dollar is going to be very strong because people are going to move out of bonds and into T bills  Investors are thinking  I do not want to hold Japanese government bonds anymore  and I do not want to hold Japanese government debt  I don t want to hold U S  government bonds  and I don t want to hold euro bonds  What do I hold instead  The most liquid thing in the world  a U S  Treasury bill  But it could be a crisis if the Treasury crash turns into a real panic and you see the 10 year yield quickly go to 4 5   5   6  or 7   If that happens  the Fed is going to open the floodgates  Screw the long term consequences  It s going to manipulate the rate back down  At that point  the dollar would crater  Buying Hong Kong bills instead of Treasury bills is an interesting way to hedge against the risk of the Fed being more active rather than less active  If the Fed sacrifices the U S  dollar completely  we are going to have a 30  devaluation overnight  and the Hong Kong authorities will finally break the tie to the dollar  The Hong Kong dollar will have a new basket of currencies to base our currency on  or it will go to the yuan  TGR  It has come out that Bernanke is leaving  How do you think the announcement of the new chair will affect Fed policies  PS  It doesn t make any difference who is in the Fed chair because Fed policy is driven by the realities of the U S  debt crisis  With the U S  economy  60T in debt  the Fed cannot impose a significant real rate of interest on the U S  obligations or insist on a hard dollar  We just can t afford it  TGR  What advice do you have for the new Fed chair  Don t take the job  PS  Nobody would want to follow my advice  The Fed is emblematic of a dramatic change in American society  We are so addicted to living beyond our means that when we hear someone say we shouldn t be borrowing so much money  it sounds like gibberish  If you look at the promises the federal government has made with Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid the current value of those promises is  124T  It is unreasonable to make these promises  It s insane  If you took the collective value of every privately owned asset in the country  it comes to  99T  The government has not only promised more money than it s ever going to have  it has promised more money than we all collectively have  Or consider this nonsense  Americans hold  1T in student loans  Are you kidding me  Does it make sense to anybody to spend  75 000 to become a dental hygienist  It has become the Fed s job to make this huge lie the idea that we can borrow and spend our way to prosperity the truth  If I were Fed chairman  I would go in my first day and say we re going to have a real rate of interest that s equal to at least 3   And we re going to do that because we want to reward people for saving  We want to have a hard currency  and everything else in the economy is going to revolve around that  That is how you reward productivity  saving and capital investment the things that actually create wealth  TGR  Which concerns you more the fact that the U S  is quickly losing its status as the world s reserve currency or this unfunded liability  PS  Losing our status as the world s reserve currency is the greatest threat to our economy  It is one thing to decide for ourselves that we are not going to live a lie anymore and we are not going to live beyond our means  We could curtail our spending slowly and make sensible changes to the tax system  broadening the base  flattening the rates and getting rid of complexity  Most importantly  we could reform our entitlement programs and  in 20 or 30 years  we could end up with a healthy currency and a solvent government again  On the other hand  if we continue down the path we are on now  the sheriff is going to show up at our house  He will say  sorry  but your creditors do not trust you anymore and they are foreclosing  At that point  they will just start taking collateral back exchanging the trillions of dollars outstanding into hard assets in a rush  Just look at what is happening in Japan and then realize that almost 95  of their government obligations are held domestically  If creditors lose faith in the U S  in the same way  the result will be much worse because foreign investors hold so much of our debt  TGR  What does that mean for the average citizen  PS  If the dollar loses its standing as the world s reserve currency  the value of the average citizen s savings and wages will disappear  Power bills and gas bills will go up  Doctor bills will go up  as will airline tickets  college  education  private school for kids  Yes  that has already happened quite a bit since the early 1970s  and it is going to get a lot worse  When you look around and wonder why things are not working the way they should  it is because the price system is so heavily manipulated  TGR  Last November you were buying a lot of real estate  Are you still buying  PS  I still am buying real estate  I m closing on another big farm in about 10 days  I don t want to buy stocks  They re too expensive  I definitely don t want to buy bonds  They re an absolute wealth trap  I don t want to invest any more in my own business because I m worried about the effects of this economic uncertainty  So what do I do  I hide the money in real estate  I buy an agricultural property  If agricultural prices go up  and I believe they must  eventually  as the dollar falls  the farm becomes more profitable  Wealthy people have sheltered their assets against inflation in farmland and timberland for all of recorded history  TGR  But don t the underlying assets lose value if the dollars back out of the Treasury  PS  No  they don t  I ve been recommending that people buy farmland for four or five years  As the 10 year yield has gone down  the yield on farm properties has also gone down  The price of farm properties has skyrocketed  In many places  you will see these prices correct a lot because there will be yield contraction on farmland  But  on the other hand  where you have bought property at a good price  you will not get hurt because eventually inflation will generate additional revenue for you from the farm  What you do not want in this environment is a fixed coupon  You don t want to buy something like a Treasury bond  which is denominated in dollars  and the coupon is paid in dollars  You are going to lose to inflation and you are going to lose as yields go higher and the value of your bond goes down  Income from a farm  on the other hand  is tied to the price of a commodity  so at least you are protected from inflation  For me it is still the least bad option  TGR  And all the commodity prices will go up in this situation  PS  If I am right about a run on the dollar  absolutely  The timing of the next commodity rally is  of course  uncertain  But it is also inevitable  In any case  I would much rather have a farm than a Treasury bond  I know a farm can feed me and my family  TGR  Last December you were excited about the idea of exporting natural gas  Ernest Moniz  the new federal energy secretary  recently promised that liquefied natural gas  LNG  court decisions will be made this year  Do you think that he will come through  and if so  what will be the impact of those decisions  PS  I don t know the guy  so I can t speculate on whether or not he will live up to his promise  But they have granted one more license to a privately held company that is exporting LNG out of the Sabine Pass  near where Cheniere Energy Inc   LNG NYSE  is doing the same  I m certain that LNG exports from America are going to soar  We are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas  We have more natural gas production  more natural gas storage  more natural gas pipelines than anybody else in the world  We are going to turn that into a dynamic and fantastic competitive advantage for our country  All we have to do is get the scumbag politicians out of the way  And  fortunately  they can be bought  TGR  Until that happens  is LNG a viable investment strategy  PS  I am more bullish on natural gas today than I have ever been in my life  I think you re going to see a huge bull move in these stocks as their earnings ratchet higher and the market suddenly realizes that natural gas is at  3 50 per thousand cubic feet   3 50 Mcf  rather than  2 Mcf  I am talking about producers in the natural gas space Devon Energy Corp   DVN NYSE   Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK NYSE  and others like them  TGR  I m going to read the first sentence from an article you published in the S A Digest   What if there was a secret way of looking at the stock market and individual companies that allowed you to see the real value of everything regardless of the price   What you go on to describe sounds like value investing  Is it  PS  The question of whether you call yourself a value investor or a growth investor is less important than whether or not you look at a business  likely earnings capacity and buy it based on a conservative estimation of that number  My experience with individual investors is that they know absolutely nothing about accounting or finance  They have no capacity to be buying individual stocks  and yet they still do  I m challenging my readers to learn these simple tools so they can better understand our newsletters and be better investors  On our radio site  Stansberry Radio  we have a  up in which I just go through the numbers  I don t tell you what the companies are  but looking at the numbers I can tell you what kind of businesses they are in terms of quality  growth and valuation  It really becomes clear when I tell you what the companies are  the Hershey Company  HSY NYSE   a super high quality business  and U S  Steel  X NYSE   a super low quality business  TGR  Does it make a difference what state the market is in when you are looking at a business  core values  If you find a company that has real underlying value  do you buy it and hold it  PS  Here s an example  I really want to buy Krispy Kreme Doughnuts  KKD NYSE  for my own account  It s a legendary brand that has all the attributes of a capital efficient business  People love their doughnuts  They re a fantastic little treat  If anyone is ever feeling down or sick  bring them a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts  it s way better than giving flowers  I can understand this business  and I know it will always be profitable  Last year  it had gross profits of  78 million   78M   It distributed  20M of that to its shareholders  That s a pretty good rate of capital efficiency  It bought back  20 billion in stock on  78M and net sales  It is expanding all over the world  and I have no doubt it is going to continue to grow  About a decade ago  Krispy Kreme almost went bankrupt because of accounting fraud the management stuffed the sales channel and badly botched a massive expansion  But it is a great brand  so it survived  In the last year the stock has gone from  7 or  8 share to  16 or  17 share  and quite frankly  I missed the turnaround  I wanted to buy the stock  but I didn t want to get involved until the management was replaced  But I lost track of the story  I m hoping that the turmoil in the bond markets will drive securities prices down and that this stock  which is now trading at 50 times earnings  will come down to a level where I m comfortable buying it  Turmoil and fear always provide opportunities to buy great assets  Will my grandkids eat Krispy Kreme doughnuts  I think so  Will a 100 acre farm be here in 100 years  I m pretty sure it will be  So  you have got to remember to use this crisis to pick up great assets on the cheap  TGR  It sounds as if you should do your homework now and buy selectively on dips and pullbacks  You don t want to be caught flat footed  PS  I try to  but it is hard to get organized enough to really take advantage  I have been waiting for five or six years to buy Krispy Kreme and I botched it  just because I was not watching the turnaround closely enough  Warren Buffett has this idea to have a 20 hole dance card for investing  In your lifetime  you would only be allowed to buy 20 stocks  Pick 20 great companies and follow those 20 stocks your whole life  Buy them when they are really cheap  I bet if you actually did that  you would be very successful  Look at Buffett and Geico  for example  He had been buying that single stock for decades before he finally took it private  TGR  You ve encouraged people to hold a large allocation of gold  some of it as a hedge against the dollar collapsing  Have people missed that window of hedging  PS  No  We have consistently recommended that people buy physical gold  Gold is the only universally accepted financial asset that is no one else s corresponding liability  That is gold s only purpose  It doesn t have value as an industrial metal  You don t buy gold because of supply and demand  You buy it as a hedge against the failure of financial institutions  whether it s the dollar failing or JPMorgan or your credit union down the street failing  TGR  What should be the allocation of gold in a good sized portfolio  PS  Assuming that price is irrelevant  I would like to see a cash and gold component of around 30   I would have 30 day Treasury bills and gold bullion  TGR  Where does real estate fit into that  PS  In a balanced portfolio  something like 10   I don t normally associate real estate with my investment portfolio  When I think of an investment portfolio  I think of things that are liquid that you trade  and I don t usually put real estate in that category  TGR  What else are you looking forward to in investment ideas  PS  Let me just say that today it seems as if everything is going great  the economy is getting better and everything is wonderful  But I think we re at the most dangerous point in the last 50 or 100 years in our country  We have tons of unsustainable policies  and we are racing toward a cliff  Not a stupid  phony  press driven fiscal cliff but a real cliff  This cliff involves people around the world no longer being interested in holding our debt  People don t realize that there is no material difference between what has gone on in Greece and Spain and what s happening now in Japan and what is happening with us  We re just the largest kid on the block  but we re not in any better shape  TGR  In fact  we have more to lose in one sense because we are the reserve currency  If that goes away  we miss a leveraged advantage  PS  China is angling to become our competitor as the world s reserve currency  It is buying up as much gold as it possibly can to have a firm foundation for its currency  Over the next several years that will come to fruition  In fact  here s a stunner for you  Within the next 12 to 24 months  I think the yuan will open on the capital account  which means free trading around the world  I don t think anybody expects that  TGR  Will that be the first domino in the U S  dollar s retreat from reserve currency  Does this need to happen for the U S  dollar to be removed as the reserve currency  PS  Before the euro  the U S  dollar made up about 80  of all bank reserves around the world  That fell to 62  with the advent of the euro  I think the yuan will take us to below 50   In that case  we will no longer have claim to the world reserve currency  This is happening in lots of ways already  China has set up bilateral trade agreements with a dozen of the largest Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  countries  It has the banks in those countries set up to do capital account yuan trading  and the banks have bought lots of yuan so they can hold the inventory and make the trades  That s gone on with Australia  France  Britain  Russia  Japan and all the Latin American countries  They are positioned to go ahead and push the button and make that policy change at any time  That would be an enormous change and would allow banks from all over the world to sell their dollars and buy yuan  That would be very bad for our country because it would push up interest rates on all of our bonds and weaken the value of our currency tremendously  TGR  I assume that means the price of goods goes up for the average consumer  PS  Yes  especially imported goods  But one positive would be that our current account and trade deficits would regain some balance because we wouldn t be able to afford to buy so much from overseas  It would make a dramatic difference in our standard of living  In the most important way  it would greatly increase the cost to borrow  That s a big problem for our economy because as you know  just about everything in our life is based on debt  TGR  Your insights  once

196905,418421,DVN,A Q A With Porter Stansberry,opinion,America is staring down a fiscal catastrophe  says Porter Stansberry  the outspoken investment analyst who coined the phrase   the end of America   Americans are living beyond their means  he says  and the global economy is tired of holding our debt  Nothing short of economic disaster will befall us But amid such grim predictions  in this interview with The Gold Report  Stansberry takes a moment to praise the enduring value of timeless investments  such as farmland and     Krispy Kreme  Stansberry shares his thoughts on everything from the Federal Reserve to Hong Kong  The Gold Report  When we spoke in December  you said that the tax base will expand and people shouldn t fear going over the cliff they should fear not going over the cliff  Clearly  we went over the cliff  Were you surprised at the lack of public reaction to the sequestration and the enthusiasm the market has had since then  Porter Stansberry  No  I thought the press about the so called fiscal cliff was nonsense and that the amount of reductions in government spending wouldn t make any difference  I wasn t worried the fiscal cliff would have any material impact on the financial markets  I was worried that the fiscal deficit problems would get worse if we didn t expand the tax base  But at the end of the day  it s a wash because spending will continue to go up and there is no way we can finance it with taxes  TGR  You ve written about what you call  the end of America   This describes a shift of direct exchange treatments  caused by the debasement of the U S  dollar through quantitative easing  QE   that will result in the dollar no longer being the world s reserve currency  Many other countries  notably Japan  have recently been doing aggressive QE  Has that impacted the effects of QE in the U S   PS  I would rather answer the question this way  Everyone else s sovereign debt is priced off of the 10 year U S  Treasury yield  Demand for U S  government paper will  sooner or later  collapse when creditors around the world realize that the U S  government is bankrupt  When that moment of realization comes  our bond market will collapse  I wrote a piece for the S A Digest on May 10 when the junk bond market average yield went below 5   I said that this is as far as the Federal Reserve can press down interest rates  There is no way you can make money in junk bonds when your average yield is below 5   I said get the heck out of bonds  That happened to be the same moment when the market for Japanese Government Bonds  JGBs  also began to collapse  I don t think that s a coincidence  JGBs fell because the Japanese government said it was going to print unlimited amounts of new yen and manipulate its markets overtly  That is the same thing that has been happening in America for the last four years  We supposedly live in a free country but try giving up your passport and leaving  We supposedly have free market capitalism but what happens to the entire world s markets when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks  What he says drives all of the world s stock markets  bond markets and currency markets  I do not think we have free market capitalism when one man s opinion determines the outcome of every market in the world  I believe the most important impact of quantitative easing will be the loss of prestige and power for the world s central banks  I believe  sooner or later  the negative consequences of manipulating prices and debasing our currencies will overwhelm the near term bubbles they have created  In Japan  investors are abandoning the sovereign debt market in a wholesale way  I believe that is what triggered the run we have seen out of U S  Treasuries  too  Investors suddenly realized that these markets can still crash     and if the currency falls far enough  the central bank cannot act  I believe both market moves were inevitable and were caused by the previous bubbles in those markets that were engineered by the central banks  Printing of dollars to manipulate the Treasury rate destroys the credibility of the entire paper sovereign system TGR  Bernanke signaled that there could be a potential scaling back on QE and that the market is going down based on that  Does that mean the Fed s decisions have been buoying the market  PS  The recent activity in the markets is the natural reaction to a manipulated market  All of the previous central bank buying means that market participants do not know what the actual value of the bonds really is  We do not want to find out the hard way  Also  who is going to buy when the Fed starts selling  It has  3 trillion   3T  worth of assets  As people around the world begin to flee from sovereign debt  there is going to be a bear market in U S Treasury bonds  We have not seen a crisis where people flee out of Treasury bonds in a very long time  but we are at that point because the Fed s printing of dollars to manipulate the Treasury rate destroys the credibility of the entire paper sovereign system  TGR  Where will that money go  PS  It can go into 30 day Treasury bills  T bills   which is a great place to hide  It can go into real estate  timber  euros  It can go into Chinese yuan or Hong Kong dollars  The latter is an interesting trade because Hong Kong dollars are pegged to the U S  dollar  You could have short term Hong Kong dollars that would give you an upside as people flee into the dollar  and you have the option of turning it into Chinese yuan someday  If the dollar collapses  there is no doubt the Hong Kong monetary authority would stop following the dollar and start following the yuan  TGR  How bad does it have to get before the Hong Kong dollar converts to the yuan  PS  Hong Kong works on the basis of a currency board  For every Hong Kong dollar in circulation  there has to be a matching dollar in the Treasury  It s not mismanaged  It doesn t have to break the tie to the dollar it can keep it as long as it wants   In the short term  the U S  dollar is going to be very strong because people are going to move out of bonds and into T bills  Investors are thinking  I do not want to hold Japanese government bonds anymore  and I do not want to hold Japanese government debt  I don t want to hold U S  government bonds  and I don t want to hold euro bonds  What do I hold instead  The most liquid thing in the world  a U S  Treasury bill  But it could be a crisis if the Treasury crash turns into a real panic and you see the 10 year yield quickly go to 4 5   5   6  or 7   If that happens  the Fed is going to open the floodgates  Screw the long term consequences  It s going to manipulate the rate back down  At that point  the dollar would crater  Buying Hong Kong bills instead of Treasury bills is an interesting way to hedge against the risk of the Fed being more active rather than less active  If the Fed sacrifices the U S  dollar completely  we are going to have a 30  devaluation overnight  and the Hong Kong authorities will finally break the tie to the dollar  The Hong Kong dollar will have a new basket of currencies to base our currency on  or it will go to the yuan  TGR  It has come out that Bernanke is leaving  How do you think the announcement of the new chair will affect Fed policies  PS  It doesn t make any difference who is in the Fed chair because Fed policy is driven by the realities of the U S  debt crisis  With the US economy  60T in debt  the Fed cannot impose a significant real rate of interest on the U S  obligations or insist on a hard dollar  We just can t afford it  TGR  What advice do you have for the new Fed chair  Don t take the job  PS  Nobody would want to follow my advice  The Fed is emblematic of a dramatic change in American society  We are so addicted to living beyond our means that when we hear someone say we shouldn t be borrowing so much money  it sounds like gibberish  If you look at the promises the federal government has made with Social Security  Medicare  Medicaid the current value of those promises is  124T  It is unreasonable to make these promises  It s insane  If you took the collective value of every privately owned asset in the country  it comes to  99T  The government has not only promised more money than it s ever going to have  it has promised more money than we all collectively have  Or consider this nonsense  Americans hold  1T in student loans  Are you kidding me  Does it make sense to anybody to spend  75 000 to become a dental hygienist  It has become the Fed s job to make this huge lie the idea that we can borrow and spend our way to prosperity the truth  If I were Fed chairman  I would go in my first day and say we re going to have a real rate of interest that s equal to at least 3   And we re going to do that because we want to reward people for saving  We want to have a hard currency  and everything else in the economy is going to revolve around that  That is how you reward productivity  saving and capital investment the things that actually create wealth  TGR  Which concerns you more the fact that the U S  is quickly losing its status as the world s reserve currency or this unfunded liability  PS  Losing our status as the world s reserve currency is the greatest threat to our economy  It is one thing to decide for ourselves that we are not going to live a lie anymore and we are not going to live beyond our means  We could curtail our spending slowly and make sensible changes to the tax system  broadening the base  flattening the rates and getting rid of complexity  Most importantly  we could reform our entitlement programs and  in 20 or 30 years  we could end up with a healthy currency and a solvent government again  On the other hand  if we continue down the path we are on now  the sheriff is going to show up at our house  He will say  sorry  but your creditors do not trust you anymore and they are foreclosing  At that point  they will just start taking collateral back exchanging the trillions of dollars outstanding into hard assets in a rush  Just look at what is happening in Japan and then realize that almost 95  of their government obligations are held domestically  If creditors lose faith in the U S  in the same way  the result will be much worse because foreign investors hold so much of our debt  TGR  What does that mean for the average citizen  PS  If the dollar loses its standing as the world s reserve currency  the value of the average citizen s savings and wages will disappear  Power bills and gas bills will go up  Doctor bills will go up  as will airline tickets  college  education  private school for kids  Yes  that has already happened quite a bit since the early 1970s  and it is going to get a lot worse  When you look around and wonder why things are not working the way they should  it is because the price system is so heavily manipulated  TGR  Last November you were buying a lot of real estate  Are you still buying  PS  I still am buying real estate  I m closing on another big farm in about 10 days  I don t want to buy stocks  They re too expensive  I definitely don t want to buy bonds  They re an absolute wealth trap  I don t want to invest any more in my own business because I m worried about the effects of this economic uncertainty  So what do I do  I hide the money in real estate  I buy an agricultural property  If agricultural prices go up  and I believe they must  eventually  as the dollar falls  the farm becomes more profitable  Wealthy people have sheltered their assets against inflation in farmland and timberland for all of recorded history  TGR  But don t the underlying assets lose value if the dollars back out of the Treasury  PS  No  they don t  I ve been recommending that people buy farmland for four or five years  As the 10 year yield has gone down  the yield on farm properties has also gone down  The price of farm properties has skyrocketed  In many places  you will see these prices correct a lot because there will be yield contraction on farmland  But  on the other hand  where you have bought property at a good price  you will not get hurt because eventually inflation will generate additional revenue for you from the farm  What you do not want in this environment is a fixed coupon  You don t want to buy something like a Treasury bond  which is denominated in dollars  and the coupon is paid in dollars  You are going to lose to inflation and you are going to lose as yields go higher and the value of your bond goes down  Income from a farm  on the other hand  is tied to the price of a commodity  so at least you are protected from inflation  For me it is still the least bad option  TGR  And all the commodity prices will go up in this situation  PS  If I am right about a run on the dollar  absolutely  The timing of the next commodity rally is  of course  uncertain  But it is also inevitable  In any case  I would much rather have a farm than a Treasury bond  I know a farm can feed me and my family  TGR  Last December you were excited about the idea of exporting natural gas  Ernest Moniz  the new federal energy secretary  recently promised that liquefied natural gas  LNG  court decisions will be made this year  Do you think that he will come through  and if so  what will be the impact of those decisions  PS  I don t know the guy  so I can t speculate on whether or not he will live up to his promise  But they have granted one more license to a privately held company that is exporting LNG out of the Sabine Pass  near where Cheniere Energy Inc   LNG  is doing the same  I m certain that LNG exports from America are going to soar  We are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas  We have more natural gas production  more natural gas storage  more natural gas pipelines than anybody else in the world  We are going to turn that into a dynamic and fantastic competitive advantage for our country  All we have to do is get the scumbag politicians out of the way  And  fortunately  they can be bought  TGR  Until that happens  is LNG a viable investment strategy  PS  I am more bullish on natural gas today than I have ever been in my life  I think you re going to see a huge bull move in these stocks as their earnings ratchet higher and the market suddenly realizes that natural gas is at  3 50 per thousand cubic feet   3 50 Mcf  rather than  2 Mcf  I am talking about producers in the natural gas space Devon Energy Corp   DVN   Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK  and others like them  TGR  I m going to read the first sentence from an article you published in the S A Digest   What if there was a secret way of looking at the stock market and individual companies that allowed you to see the real value of everything regardless of the price   What you go on to describe sounds like value investing  Is it  PS  The question of whether you call yourself a value investor or a growth investor is less important than whether or not you look at a business  likely earnings capacity and buy it based on a conservative estimation of that number  My experience with individual investors is that they know absolutely nothing about accounting or finance  They have no capacity to be buying individual stocks  and yet they still do  I m challenging my readers to learn these simple tools so they can better understand our newsletters and be better investors  On our radio site  Stansberry Radio  we have a videoup in which I just go through the numbers  I don t tell you what the companies are  but looking at the numbers I can tell you what kind of businesses they are in terms of quality  growth and valuation  It really becomes clear when I tell you what the companies are  the Hershey Company  HSY   a super high quality business  and U S  Steel  X   a super low quality business  TGR  Does it make a difference what state the market is in when you are looking at a business  core values  If you find a company that has real underlying value  do you buy it and hold it  PS  Here s an example  I really want to buy Krispy Kreme Doughnuts  KKD  for my own account  It s a legendary brand that has all the attributes of a capital efficient business  People love their doughnuts  They re a fantastic little treat  If anyone is ever feeling down or sick  bring them a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts  it s way better than giving flowers  I can understand this business  and I know it will always be profitable  Last year  it had gross profits of  78 million   78M   It distributed  20M of that to its shareholders  That s a pretty good rate of capital efficiency  It bought back  20 billion in stock on  78M and net sales  It is expanding all over the world  and I have no doubt it is going to continue to grow  About a decade ago  Krispy Kreme almost went bankrupt because of accounting fraud the management stuffed the sales channel and badly botched a massive expansion  But it is a great brand  so it survived  In the last year the stock has gone from  7 or  8 share to  16 or  17 share  and quite frankly  I missed the turnaround  I wanted to buy the stock  but I didn t want to get involved until the management was replaced  But I lost track of the story  I m hoping that the turmoil in the bond markets will drive securities prices down and that this stock  which is now trading at 50 times earnings  will come down to a level where I m comfortable buying it  Turmoil and fear always provide opportunities to buy great assets  Will my grandkids eat Krispy Kreme doughnuts  I think so  Will a 100 acre farm be here in 100 years  I m pretty sure it will be  So  you have got to remember to use this crisis to pick up great assets on the cheap  TGR  It sounds as if you should do your homework now and buy selectively on dips and pullbacks  You don t want to be caught flat footed  PS  I try to  but it is hard to get organized enough to really take advantage  I have been waiting for five or six years to buy Krispy Kreme and I botched it  just because I was not watching the turnaround closely enough  Warren Buffett has this idea to have a 20 hole dance card for investing  In your lifetime  you would only be allowed to buy 20 stocks  Pick 20 great companies and follow those 20 stocks your whole life  Buy them when they are really cheap  I bet if you actually did that  you would be very successful  Look at Buffett and Geico  for example  He had been buying that single stock for decades before he finally took it private  TGR  You ve encouraged people to hold a large allocation of gold  some of it as a hedge against the dollar collapsing  Have people missed that window of hedging  PS  No  We have consistently recommended that people buy physical gold  Gold is the only universally accepted financial asset that is no one else s corresponding liability  That is gold s only purpose  It doesn t have value as an industrial metal  You don t buy gold because of supply and demand  You buy it as a hedge against the failure of financial institutions  whether it s the dollar failing or JPMorgan or your credit union down the street failing  TGR  What should be the allocation of gold in a good sized portfolio  PS  Assuming that price is irrelevant  I would like to see a cash and gold component of around 30   I would have 30 day Treasury bills and gold bullion  TGR  Where does real estate fit into that  PS  In a balanced portfolio  something like 10   I don t normally associate real estate with my investment portfolio  When I think of an investment portfolio  I think of things that are liquid that you trade  and I don t usually put real estate in that category  TGR  What else are you looking forward to in investment ideas  PS  Let me just say that today it seems as if everything is going great  the economy is getting better and everything is wonderful  But I think we re at the most dangerous point in the last 50 or 100 years in our country  We have tons of unsustainable policies  and we are racing toward a cliff  Not a stupid  phony  press driven fiscal cliff but a real cliff  This cliff involves people around the world no longer being interested in holding our debt  People don t realize that there is no material difference between what has gone on in Greece and Spain and what s happening now in Japan and what is happening with us  We re just the largest kid on the block  but we re not in any better shape  TGR  In fact  we have more to lose in one sense because we are the reserve currency  If that goes away  we miss a leveraged advantage  PS  China is angling to become our competitor as the world s reserve currency  It is buying up as much gold as it possibly can to have a firm foundation for its currency  Over the next several years that will come to fruition  In fact  here s a stunner for you  Within the next 12 to 24 months  I think the yuan will open on the capital account  which means free trading around the world  I don t think anybody expects that  TGR  Will that be the first domino in the U S  dollar s retreat from reserve currency  Does this need to happen for the U S  dollar to be removed as the reserve currency  PS  Before the euro  the U S  dollar made up about 80  of all bank reserves around the world  That fell to 62  with the advent of the euro  I think the yuan will take us to below 50   In that case  we will no longer have claim to the world reserve currency  This is happening in lots of ways already  China has set up bilateral trade agreements with a dozen of the largest Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD  countries  It has the banks in those countries set up to do capital account yuan trading  and the banks have bought lots of yuan so they can hold the inventory and make the trades  That s gone on with Australia  France  Britain  Russia  Japan and all the Latin American countries  They are positioned to go ahead and push the button and make that policy change at any time  That would be an enormous change and would allow banks from all over the world to sell their dollars and buy yuan  That would be very bad for our country because it would push up interest rates on all of our bonds and weaken the value of our currency tremendously  TGR  I assume that means the price of goods goes up for the average consumer  PS  Yes  especially imported goods  But one positive would be that our current account and trade deficits would regain some balance because we wouldn t be able to afford to buy so much from overseas  It would make a dramatic difference in our standard of living  In the most important way  it would greatly increase the cost to borrow  That s a big problem for our economy because as you know  just about everything in our life is based on debt  TGR  Your insights  once again  are always intriguing and insightful  I really appreciate it ,2013-07-05,Commodity Trade

196906,418422,DVN,Nat Gas Is On Fire,opinion,One industry group that is soaring today is the natural gas stocks  It seems that the tensions and problems in Iraq are escalating  which is causing a bid in many of the leading natural gas stocks  Some of the leading stocks in the sector that are trading higher include Devon Energy  NYSE DVN   Southwestern Energy  NYSE SWN   Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK  and Patterson UTI Energy  NASDAQ PTEN   Traders should note that this important industry group is starting to get overbought on the daily and weekly charts  This tells us that if the current geopolitical events around the world calm down the natural gas stocks could pullback in the near term  Until that time  this industry group will likely remains strong  Devon Energy is the leading natural gas stock at this time  Traders should note that DVN has weekly chart resistance around the  82 75 level  If the stock continues to surge into this major resistance area it could stall out and likely pullback from the level ,2014-06-12,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nat-gas-is-on-fire-215887,215887
196907,418423,DVN,Prepare For A Natural Gas Price Explosion,opinion,"In my last article  I discussed how ISIS  actions in Iraq aren t likely to send oil prices blasting higher in the short term  Supplies are simply too plentiful for prices to experience a major spike  For Natural Gas  however  a price explosion is imminent 
Indeed  even though natural gas is such an abundant resource  there are other factors in play right now that point to a significant increase in prices over the next six to eight months  In fact  seeing natural gas reach the  6 level by December isn t out of the question 
A Roadmap to  6 Natural Gas
Remember  the trajectory for natural gas prices is decided mainly by five factors  usage predictions  demand forecasts  current inventory levels  a healthy dose of speculation and   of course   the weather 
Let s take a closer look at the first four 
Price Driver  1  Usage  We re certainly going to see greater commercial usage of natural gas   both for transportation  the fastest growing segment  and for electricity generation  Because of tougher carbon emission regulations  many power plants are transitioning out of coal and into natural gas 
Price Driver  2  Demand  With a booming new housing market and greater occupancy in existing homes  that were once under foreclosure   we re going to see more demand from consumers who are looking at natural gas to heat their homes   and power all types of household appliances 
Price Driver  3  Inventory  Inventory levels are at an 11 year low   thanks to increased consumption and a very cold winter season that drew down much more gas than expected 
Price Driver  4  Speculation  Investors are speculating about liquid natural gas production ramping up faster than expected  based on Russia s moves this past spring and recent news that it has cut off supplies to Ukraine  In reality  LNG production and exports from the United States are still years away from making a real dent  But where speculation is concerned  the details rarely matter 
Now  the four factors above are all  known  at this point  And while they each point to higher prices ahead  there s still one big  unknown  factor to consider  weather 
It will be the major determinant of natural gas prices for the remainder of this year 
A hot summer will push inventory levels lower  as more power plants begin relying on natural gas  At that point  if we have another harsh winter  supplies of natural gas won t be replenished fast enough 
That alone should be enough to propel prices well into the  5 per thousand cubic feet  mcf  level   and maybe as high as  6 come December 
3 Ways to Play the Coming Price Surge
Now  you can play this upcoming spike in prices through traditional natural gas futures contracts 
Or you can buy premier companies in the sector that boast a strong correlation to the price of natural gas 
Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK   for instance  just set a 52 week high and has been a favorite of ours for quite some time  CHK has exposure to both oil and gas   and it s the second largest producer of natural gas in the United States  You can also get exposure through Devon Energy  NYSE DVN    a major producer that s also trading at new 52 week highs 
And finally  you can enter a more speculative position with a company like Westport Innovations  NASDAQ WPRT   which is trading close to its 52 week lows 
Westport is engaged in the design and production of environmentally sustainable engines  which   for the most part   means they run on natural gas  These engines compete directly with diesel engines 
They cost more to build  but based on current natural gas to diesel prices  the cost of operation is about 30  less than diesel powered engines 
The country is on the cusp of having natural gas filling stations across major trucking routes  and Westport will deliver the higher powered engines needed for long haul routes 
Thanks to a delayed delivery of these engines  however  the stock has come under pressure 
That  combined with the coming price explosion for natural gas  could be creating the perfect buying opportunity 
And  the chase  continues ",2014-06-23,Karim Rahemtulla,https://www.investing.com/analysis/prepare-for-a-natural-gas-price-explosion-216999,216999

196934,418450,DVN,Investors Not Giving Eagle Rock Energy Partners LP Enough Credit,opinion,Unlike most energy related MLPs  Eagle Rock Energy Partners LP  NSDQ  EROC  operates in both the upstream and midstream segments of the energy business  Roughly 60 percent of the partnership s total operating income comes from oil  gas and NGL production  while its gathering pipelines and processing facilities account for the remaining 40 percent Eagle Rock Energy Partners is a far stronger company than it was two years ago  The MLP went public in late 2006  and the bull market for energy commodities enabled the firm to boost its quarterly payout steadily throughout 2007  But two obstacles tripped up the MLP in 2008  significant exposure to oil and gas prices  and a heavy reliance on short term lines of credit with banks    By their very nature  upstream operations have some exposure to commodity prices  Some partnerships such as Linn Energy LLC  NSDQ  LINE  limit their exposure to fluctuations in oil  gas and NGL prices by hedging future production  Eagle Rock Energy Partners doesn t fully hedge its expect output  a strategic decision that decimated the firm s cash flow when oil and gas prices collapsed in later 2008 and early 2009 Eagle Rock Energy Partners  midstream business also has some built in exposure to commodity prices  as a slowdown in drilling activity reduces the number of wells hooked up to the MLP s gathering system and weighs on throughput  In 2008 09  the firm s processing margins also suffered because of the collapse in energy prices    The MLP s debt structure compounded these problems  At the beginning of 2010  Eagle Rock Energy Partners  outstanding credit facility accounted for 60 percent of the firm s  1 2 billion enterprise value  This outsized debt amounted to more than 4 5 times the MLP s earnings before interest  taxation  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA     Credit facilities are subject to periodic evaluations and potential redetermination  At the height of the financial crisis  Eagle Rock Energy Partners faced an unwelcome liquidity crisis  as the MLP s lenders slashed its credit facility      To conserve cash  the firm in early 2009 cut its quarterly to  0 021136 per unit from almost  0 35 per unit  This news sent the stock plummeting to a low of  2 24 per unit from a high of about  23 per unit    In 2010 Eagle Rock Energy Partners completed a series of transactions that drastically altered the MLP s risk profile  The firm sold off its volatile minerals business for  174 5 million  raised another  53 9 million by issuing common units and warrants  and eliminated its incentive distribution rights fees an MLP pays to its general partner for managing daily operations    Today  Eagle Rock Energy Partners  credit facility is only 24 percent of the firm s enterprise value  The partnership s leverage ratio has declined to less than 3 5 times EBITDA    As market conditions improved  Eagle Rock Energy Partners has returned to growth mode  expanding its midstream and upstream businesses via acquisitions and organic projects  The MLP now disburses a quarterly payout of  0 22 per unit  and management aims to growth the distribution to  0 25 per unit by early 2012    Although Eagle Rock Energy Partners has reduced its business and financial risks  the stock s valuation continues to suffer from the stigma of the MLP s troubles in 2008 09  Upstream Eagle Rock Energy Partners  upstream segment comprises 591 operated oil and natural gas wells and the equivalent of 371 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves  Gas accounts for about 63 percent of the MLP s total reserves  while oil accounts for 19 percent of this resource base and NGLs represent 18 percent  Daily production in 2011 averaged 85 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent    As explained in Jim Fink s article    US natural gas prices will likely remain depressed for at least the next few years  thanks to reduced demand during the unseasonably warm 2011 12 winter and rising production from the nation s   Based on my outlook for natural gas prices  Eagle Rock Energy Partners  significant exposure to this out of favor commodity is a red flag  Fortunately  the MLP has hedged 81 percent of its estimated natural gas and ethane output at an average price of  5 82 per million British thermal units more than double the current price of natural gas  The firm has hedged about 70 percent of the firm s estimated gas and ethane production in 2013  43 percent in 2014 and 24 percent in 2015  Eagle Rock Energy Partners has also hedged about 87 percent of its expected oil and NGL production in 2012    More important  Eagle Rock Energy Partners has a significant inventory of drilling prospects in the Cana Shale and the Golden Trend in Oklahoma  two liquids rich plays that offer superior wellhead economics    Continental Resources  NYSE  CLR   Devon Energy Corp  NYSE  DVN  and other independent exploration and production firms are spearheading development in the Cana Shale  a subsection of the larger Woodford Shale  Forty seven rigs are currently drilling horizontal wells in the region    Eagle Rock Energy Partners has amassed a leasehold of 14 600 acres of in the region  with four operated wells and 59 non operated wells that are in production  The majority of the MLP s acreage in the Cana Shale is located in the wet gas window  the portion that produces significant volumes of NGLs and condensate  Because of this favorable production mix  Eagle Rock Energy Partners in 2011 earned about  4 per thousand cubic feet of output in the Cana Shale    Eagle Rock Energy Partners and other upstream operators continue to drill test wells in the southeast of the play  a peripheral region where the productive formation is about 2 000 feet deeper than in the Cana Shale s fairway  The  owns 1 636 net acres in the region and is participating in two wells  the Continental Resources operated Olson 1 22H and the 100 percent owned Beckham 1 27H  which is scheduled to be spudded in the second quarter of 2012    Other wells in the vicinity have yielded initial production rates of 7 million cubic feet of natural gas per day  300 barrels of oil per day and volumes of NGLs  Additional drilling results in the region could be an upside catalyst for the stock    The Golden Trend already accounts for about one quarter of Eagle Rock Energy Partners  production and contains multiple productive formations    In the first quarter  the MLP s overall production declined slightly from the final three months of 2011  Management also cut its planned capital spending by  20 million and reduced its 2012 production guidance by 2 million cubic feet equivalent of natural gas per day  to 90 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day  This revised target still represents production growth of roughly 12 percent    Management s cuts to upstream spending and production guidance are part of a plan to focus drilling activity in   Eagle Rock Energy Partners  current forecast calls for oil output to grow by 8 percent in 2012  while NGL production is expected to surge by more than 50 percent  By year end  liquid hydrocarbons will account for 46 percent of the MLP s output    Eagle Rock Energy Partners will operate a total of three to four rigs this in the Cana Shale  the Golden Trend and the Permian Basin    Management told analysts at the NAPTP conference that the pipeline of potential upstream acquisitions remains robust  as exploration and production companies divest mature assets to fund drilling activity in   The firm is also eyeing opportunities to pick up gas focused acreage at bargain prices that guarantee solid returns even in the current pricing environment  Closing an upstream acquisition that s immediately accretive to cash flow would be welcome news for the hard hit stock    Midstream Eagle Rock Energy Partners  midstream business comprises 5 500 miles of gathering pipelines in the Texas Panhandle  east Texas and Louisiana  south Texas  the Gulf of Mexico and west Texas  These small diameter pipelines connect individual wells to processing facilities and  ultimately  the US interstate pipeline network  The firm also owns 19 gas processing plants that separate NGLs such as propane and ethane from raw natural gas    In the first quarter of 2012  Eagle Rock Energy Partners transported an average of 453 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day through its gathering systems    The partnership s gathering pipelines in the Texas Panhandle should benefit from rising liquids rich production in the Granite Wash and Brown Dolomite play  a mature formation that yields more than 8 gallons of liquids for every 1 000 cubic feet of natural gas produced  Drilling activity in the Granite Wash has driven most of the system s throughput growth in recent quarters    The Granite Wash yields 4 gallons to 6 gallons of liquid hydrocarbons for every 1 000 feet of natural gas  About 55 rigs currently operate in the play s Texas portion  with four rigs dedicated to acreage served by Eagle Rock Energy Partners  midstream assets  Management expects the number of rigs targeting acreage in the MLP s service area to at least hold steady  implying flat to increasing demand gathering and processing  The MLP s processing plant in its East Panhandle system ran at more than 90 percent of headline capacity in the first quarter    With producers drilling test wells in nearby plays such as the Tonkawa  Hogshooter and Cleveland  as well as the Atoka and Morrow zones located beneath the Granite Wash  demand for midstream capacity could increase  Operators have reported solid liquids production from all these pay zones  suggesting that drilling activity in these basins will only increase    To accommodate demand  Eagle Rock Energy Partners plans a number of expansion projects in the Texas Panhandle  including the construction of the Woodall processing plant  a facility capable of handling 60 million cubic feet of natural gas per day  This  72 million facility should come onstream in early June  The Wheeler processing plant  which will also serve the eastern portion of the Texas Panhandle  will boast a nameplate capacity of 60 million cubic feet per day once it s completed in April 2013    Although throughput on Eagle Rock Energy Partners  gathering and processing assets in east Texas has suffered from declining activity in the dry gas Haynesville Shale  drilling activity in the Austin Chalk play could offset some of this weakness  The MLP s management team is contemplating the construction of another processing facility in Louisiana that will handle volumes from this basin    Recent drilling results in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale sometimes called the Louisiana  should spur additional development  Goodrich Petroleum Corp  NYSE  GDP  in late May announced a three day initial production rate of 1 082 barrels of oil equivalent per day from a test well in this emerging play    In the first quarter of 2012  gathered volumes on Eagle Rock Energy Partners  east Texas assets increased by 2 percent from year ago levels  but NGL and condensate throughput tumbled by 12 percent  This decline  which stemmed primarily from downtime at a third party processing plant on the Gulf Coast  should prove temporary  The MLP s processing facilities in east Texas operated at a utilization rate of 70 percent to 75 percent in the first three months of the year    Cash flow from Eagle Rock Energy Partners  processing assets can fluctuate with commodity prices  About one quarter of the MLP s contracts guarantee the MLP a fixed fee for processing services  However  percent of proceeds  POP  agreements account for more than half the firm s contract base and percent of index  POI  deals account for another 15 percent    Under a POP arrangement  Eagle Rock Energy Partners receives a predetermined percentage of the total sales proceeds as compensation  Although the MLP hedges its exposure to NGL and gas volumes  declining commodity prices would weigh on the profitability of POP and POI processing contracts    First Quarter Results   Eagle Rock Energy Partners boosted its distribution by 5 percent sequentially and 47 percent from a year ago in the first quarter  The MLP s DCF covered this higher payout by almost 1 4 times a healthy margin that should enable the firm s payout to withstand any further downside to energy prices    Analysts continue to question whether Eagle Rock Energy Partners will be able to reach management s targeted fourth quarter distribution of  0 25 per unit  payable in February 2013   The emerging consensus suggests that the MLP will hit this goal albeit a quarter or two later because of weakening energy prices    An explosion at Eagle Rock Energy Partners  Phoenix processing plant in the Texas Panhandle will keep the facility offline for up to 60 days  The MLP has rerouted about 80 percent to 85 percent of these volumes to the newly opened Woodall Plant  and insurance eventually will offset some of the direct financial impact from the explosion    With a yield of 11 5 percent  units of Eagle Rock Energy Partners offer ample compensation for the risks to the firm s distribution growth  Investors simply aren t giving the MLP enough credit for its lower risk financial structure  rising liquids production and its midstream segment s organic growth potential  For more MLP picks  check out my free  report

196935,418451,DVN,Ron Paul Style Resource Investing  Malcolm Gissen And Marshall Berol,opinion,Malcolm Gissen and Marshall Berol  co managers of the Encompass Fund  are bemused at the characterization of their fund as a  Ron Paul  portfolio  but they do not deny it  Their faith in hard assets gold  silver  uranium  antimony  other strategic metals and resource equities oil and natural gas remains firm  But investors  they say  need patience and a long term perspective to prosper  Read more in this exclusive Energy Report interview    The Energy Report  At the end of February  the Encompass Fund was up 20   but by late April those gains had been reduced to 11   Where does your performance stand now    Marshall Berol  As of mid June  the fund was down 6  year to date  We invest in a lot of resource companies and a number of the smaller firms have not done well recently  That is reflected in the fund s short term performance  However  our objective is long term capital appreciation    The Encompass Fund was up 34  annualized over the three years ending March 31  2012  We were in the top 1  of mutual funds in Morningstar s International Funds category and the subcategory of World Stock Funds    TER  What could happen between now and the end of 2012 to boost your performance    Malcolm Gissen  We are liquidating positions we do not feel will outperform over the next 6 18 months  We did the same thing at the end of 2008  and in 2009 the Encompass Fund produced a 137  return  largely because we stuck with the exceptional companies  We are doing the same thing now and are optimistic about the second half of the year    MB  We are selling companies that are not as strong as they should be in terms of management  projects balance sheets and the ability to raise capital    In the energy or resource sectors  access to capital is critical  Companies generally need to keep drilling and expanding production  Companies without sufficient current cash are struggling and should to be reduced or eliminated from a portfolio  leading to better performance when the markets turn  as we believe they will for energy and resource stocks    TER  Investors withdrew capital from many funds over the last year  Are you experiencing that    MG  We have had some withdrawals  but our investor group has confidence in us and shares our long term perspective  Because our fund is cautious and keeps a reasonable amount of cash  we have not had to sell any securities we did not want to sell in order to produce cash to meet liquidations  even in 2009  when we produced the 137  return    TER  Some pundits have called the Encompass Fund a  Ron Paul  portfolio  Are you comfortable with that description    MB  I m not sure what that means  If that is a reference to the fact that we have a decent portion of the portfolio in gold and silver  then yes  though Encompass has a far lower allocation to precious metals than Dr  Paul  We believe in gold and silver long term  We also believe in resource companies because of a supply demand imbalance that is likely to get worse  But the fund s portfolio has a far wider variety of resource companies and exposure to other sectors  which we understand the Paul Portfolio does not    MG  And like Ron Paul  we are opposed to a lot of regulation  Marshall and I want to see our nation address overregulation of the resource sector  to make it easier and less time consuming for companies to get into production    I believe you can have laws that protect the environment and make it easier for resource companies to get into production and provide jobs and economic development  Intelligent regulation makes sense  but regulations affecting the resource sector in the U S  have hampered the industry and cost millions of jobs and billions of dollars    TER  One of your core holdings is U S  Antimony Corp   UAMY OTCBB   which has seen remarkable gains  Does its performance embolden your belief that hard assets and resource stocks remain the right place to be    MG  Yes  We bought U S  Antimony in March 2011 at  0 40  Fifteen months later  its shares are trading over  4  It has production and mills to process the rock in Mexico  It has smelters in Mexico and Montana  We think the company is in the right place at the right time and has a very bright future ahead    MB  We believed hard assets and resources were the place to be years before we invested in United States Antimony  We still feel that  for fundamental reasons beyond stock performance  Whether it is antimony  oil or natural gas  gold  silver or copper  the longer term price trends for commodities are up because of supply and demand    On the supply side  it is increasingly difficult to get anything out of the ground  You have the challenges of finding the resource  permitting issues  high costs  environmental regulations and the interests of the local populations  among others    Demand continues because the world population is growing  in particular the rising middle class in countries like China and India  If you are going to generate electricity  you need oil  natural gas  coal and uranium    When it comes to commodities like antimony  vanadium and cobalt  China s dominance as a supplier is a key factor  End users  such as industrial companies and governments  want a source of supply outside of China  Last year  the British Geological Survey issued a report on critical metals  Of the 58 listed  26 are sourced primarily out of China  with antimony being the most difficult to obtain and very critical    Looking at those underlying factors  which are unlikely to change  hard assets and resources are definitely the place to be    TER  Malcolm  you told CNBC in April that you expect  much higher  uranium prices by year end  based largely on the impending end of the U S  Russia non proliferation agreement to convert high enriched uranium taken from dismantled Russian nuclear weapons into low enriched uranium for nuclear fuels  It is scheduled to end in 2013  but Russian President Vladimir Putin said it could be extended if he gets a higher price  Is that likely    MG  All indications from Putin s statements are that he would want a much higher price than I believe American utilities are willing to pay  We believe renewal of the treaty is unlikely    Today  the 104 nuclear power plants operating in the U S  get 45  of their uranium from Russia through this program  There are more than 50 nuclear power plants being built worldwide  an estimated 26 of them in China  We think there will be uranium shortages and the need for more production  driving uranium prices up between now and the end of 2013  when the supply of Russian weapon systems  uranium dries up    MB  While there has been a deficit in new production of uranium  180 million pounds  180 Mlb  per year used in nuclear power plants  vs  110 Mlb annual new production   there will be an even greater spread between supply and demand when these new plants come online over the next one to three years  not to mention the dozens more reactors now on the drawing boards    TER  The Japanese government recently ordered the restart of two nuclear reactors in Kansai Province  Did you buy on that news    MB  We recently added to our uranium company holdings  but this is not a market to be aggressively buying anything  The Encompass Fund has roughly 8  of its portfolio in uranium company stocks  We will probably increase that percentage    MG  We see uranium companies as deeply undervalued  A patient investor willing to hold these companies for two or three years is likely to have very nice profits    TER  What are some of your larger uranium holdings    MB  One of the larger positions we have in uranium companies is in Uranium Energy Corp   UEC NYSE   It went into production in south Texas at the end of 2010  is increasing production and expects to bring a second mining project into production over the next several months  Analysts estimate it will be profitable to the bottom line in the next fiscal year  which ends July 2013  Right now  it is cash flow positive in its mining and processing operations    We like that this is an American company producing uranium in the U S   although it also has a very large land holding in Paraguay that it anticipates developing    TER  UEC has a lot of exposure to upward momentum in the uranium price  Do you expect gains similar to those you have already seen if the uranium price increases in the next year    MB  When Fukushima happened  short term uranium prices were  65 a pound  lb  and long term  85 lb  After Fukushima  short term contract prices went to  40 lb and long term prices down to  55 lb  Subsequently  short term prices have been in the  50 55 range for quite some time and the long term price is about  65    We think the short term prices  where people tend to focus  will rise to between  60 70  and the stocks will go up significantly    MG  We also like the fact that UEC is a company loaded with experience  Many of its executives  upper and middle managers have been in the industry for more than 30 years  It is led by a brilliant young CEO who is aggressively moving ahead  taking advantage of low prices to make very smart acquisitions and increasing production  That combination bodes well for a company that is deeply undervalued in our opinion    MB  If investors want a larger company  Cameco Corp   CCO TO  CCJ NYSE  is one to look at  It produces about 20  of the world s uranium through its operations in many countries    TER  Cameco just raised some money  Will it use that for acquisitions    MB  That is very possible  There was aggressive bidding between Rio Tinto and Cameco for Hathor  which was a junior Canadian exploration company in the Athabasca region  Rio Tinto won that battle  so it is not a stretch to anticipate that Cameco is on the lookout for acquisitions    Cameco can also put the money to use on developing or expanding several projects of its own  This is a company with a price to earnings ratio of about 12  with close to a 2  yield  We find that attractive    TER  What other positions do you have    MB  We have a couple of attractive junior mining companies  Their stocks have been beaten down but we think the companies  their managements and their plans are solid  The first is European Uranium Resources Ltd   EUU V  TGP FSE   which is involved in uranium exploration and potentially production in the next year or two in Slovakia  Half of Slovakia s electricity is currently generated by nuclear power plants  and new power plants are being built  European Uranium recently completed a merger and acquisition  M A  transaction that gave the company additional uranium projects in Scandinavia  All of that is very attractive on a longer term basis    TER  Will it be hard to get a permit to mine uranium in Slovakia    MB  To some extent  getting mining permits tends to be a problem everywhere  Having said that  European Uranium s management is familiar with the countries it operates in    Slovakia currently has nuclear power plants and having a local source for uranium is attractive to any government  Although there is very little uranium production in Europe  the European Union has indicated its interest in having local uranium production for supply security reasons    TER  Another company is Strateco Resources Inc   RSC TO   It has the promising Matoush uranium project in Qu bec  Do you know anything about the recent public hearing on that project    MB  We understand that  generally speaking  the local communities are in favor of the projects for the jobs and other economic benefits they bring  Today  companies must be proactive and cooperative with the local communities by bringing sustainable economic activity  improving the schools  communications  power lines and health care facilities  We do not anticipate any significant holdup in moving the project forward    MG  I would also point out  in answer to your earlier question about M A  that we believe European Uranium and Strateco are both potential acquisition targets    MB  As for M A  Cameco will be an acquirer  if anything  UEC can sustain itself on its own  or may be attractive to Cameco or another company that wants to get into uranium production in the U S  Cameco currently has uranium production in the U S    TER  Any other names in the uranium space    MG  We like Ur Energy Inc   URE TO  URG NYSE A   It stumbled  not entirely through its own fault  over permitting for its project in Wyoming  It was thought that the Bureau of Land Management  BLM  was going to grant permits last year  It did not happen  Now the company is optimistic that it will be permitted by BLM this summer  Once permits are issued  the company will move aggressively toward production within 6 12 months    TER  Ur Energy put out a preliminary economic assessment on its Lost Creek project in Wyoming showing lower cash costs and higher resources  Tell us about that study    MG  We feel the company has nice resources and the potential to grow the resource significantly  It is a long term  attractive story  Wyoming is a good jurisdiction  one of the most favorable in the U S    MB  Uranium production is not new in Wyoming  but there is an extensive state and federal permitting process  Other companies  including Crosshair Energy Corp   CXX TO   which we also own  are going through that process  It takes time  but we think they will succeed  It is not as simple as flipping a switch to get into production    TER  Do you expect the BLM to approve Ur Energy s plan of operation for the Lost Creek project  What is the timeline to production if it is approved    MG  We understand that URG has hired an expert to work with the BLM in order for the permits to be granted this summer  Once that happens  it will be full speed ahead  The company has indicated that it will be in production at Lost Creek within a year after those permits are granted    TER  Uranium is not the only energy play you believe in  Several oil and gas equities make the list of the Encompass Fund s top 10 holdings  Can you explain your rationale for your exposure to oil  which has had a significant price correction in the last couple of months  and gas  which has been subject to depressed prices for at least two years    MB  Oil is down 20 25   from  105 a barrel  bbl  to roughly  80 bbl over the past several months  Natural gas futures prices  on the other hand  were  1 95 several months ago and are now about  2 80  an over 40  increase  As we have seen  these two commodities don t always move in lock step    We think that oil will continue to be important to the economies of the world  It has multiple uses and is a global commodity  Many factors  company wise  industry wise and geopolitical enter into its pricing  Natural gas is a far more local commodity  It is far more difficult to transport from one continent to another  The natural gas price and the stock of companies producing mostly natural gas have been in their own depression for the last several years    We have some very small holdings in the natural gas area  and are looking to add to our natural gas exposure at the appropriate time  When we thought natural gas prices had bottomed out a year or so ago  we made some investments  and then sold them a short while later  It turned out prices declined further  One of the things about being contrarian  about being value players  is that you can sometimes be too early    Today  it is not too early to get into natural gas companies if you have a longer term perspective  The market may take a while to come around  Drilling activities and production have declined because of low prices and the general unwillingness of banks to lend money to natural gas explorers or producers  Companies themselves moved away from natural gas and went into oil and natural gas liquids  Over the last several months  this has contributed to higher natural gas prices  Another large factor is the fair amount of conversion from coal to natural gas for electricity generation    To us  all of this indicates a strong likelihood that we have seen a bottom in natural gas prices  This will produce good investment opportunities now and nice profits over the next 9 24 months  TER  What are some of the positions you added to recently    MB  We have not added any large cap names to the portfolio  Among the large cap natural gas producers  Devon Energy Corp   DVN NYSE  is a very fine company  It has grown very well over the last decade or two    Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK NYSE  is a more controversial name in the news  but it appears to be attractive on a fundamental basis  Questions have been raised about its corporate governance  its balance sheet and cash flow  The company is undergoing significant changes in management and on the board of directors  spurred on by two large holders  Southeastern Asset Management and Carl Icahn    We have owned GeoPetro Resources Company  GPR NYSE  for several years and  while our investment has not worked out well thus far  we remain optimistic about it  It is a small company that has five different projects  gas and or oil   any one of which could be very substantial  Its stock has not done well  but we think any one of its projects could be a real company maker  and two or three of the projects are expected to be drilled later in 2012  or early 2013  The projects are geographically diversified in the U S   California  Texas and Alaska   Canada and Indonesia    TER  Do you hold any other junior oil and natural gas plays    MG  We find Magnum Hunter Resources Corp   MHR NYSE  very attractive  The CEO previously built a company from scratch and sold it for more than  2 billion  He intends to do the same thing with Magnum Hunter  At the start of 2011  it was producing 10 000 barrels oil equivalent per day  boe d   By the end of 2011  it was up to 14 000 boe d  a 40  increase  Its 2012 goal is to produce 18 000 boe d  up from 14 000 boe d  We suspect it is close to that now    Magnum Hunter has experienced management capable of building production  revenue and net income  Its stock is deeply undervalued  And  we might add  it has a preferred stock that that yields about a 9  dividend    MB  And  Magnum Hunter is not solely gas  It is oil and gas  with representation in most of the major shale play areas in the U S   Eagle Ford  Marcellus and Bakken    TER  Finally  do you have some actionable wisdom for energy investors    MB  Look beyond the headlines to the underlying factors involved in why commodities go up or go down  and how that affects the companies  Both uranium and natural gas as commodities and equities have been out of favor  We think that should and will change    Comparing energy to the gold sector  there has been a big disconnect between the commodity price and the exploration and mining companies  We think that big disconnect  which has been unfavorable to the mining companies  will change over time  You will get better performance out of mining equities than you will out of the commodity  The situation will likely be the same for uranium and uranium equities and with natural gas and natural gas companies    MG  Investors need to have a longer term focus  People tend to be very impatient  if an idea does not work in a month or two  they are out  Take a longer term perspective two to four years and be patient  Ideas need time to work out  As contrarian  deep value investors  we are sometimes early  But  when we stick with our ideas they often work very well  If people spend the time  develop a thesis and find companies that will

196936,418452,DVN,How To Play Utica Natural Gas Opportunities Of A Lifetime  Neal Dingmann,opinion,The Utica is the hottest natural gas play in the U S   not just because it s new  but because its potential is not fully known  according to Neal Dingmann  managing director of investment bank SunTrust Robinson Humphrey  While lagging well results have kept the Utica a hidden gem  several companies are poised to reveal impressive results  Dingmann discusses undervalued companies capitalizing on the play in this exclusive interview with The Energy Report    The Energy Report  Neal  Malaysian crown corporation PETRONAS recently reached a merger and acquisition  M A  deal to buy Canada s Progress Energy Resources Corp   PRQ TSX  for CA 5 5 billion   5 5B   Progress  primarily a natural gas play  received a 77  premium to the company s closing price the day before the deal  What is the broader message investors should take away from that takeover    Neal Dingmann  The North American M A market continues to be very strong  While there has been volatility in commodity prices and energy stocks  one thing that has helped is that the M A environment has remained quite stable  In fact  it has been on the upswing  This takeover is another sign of that  The long term implications are pretty clear  Despite the volatility in gas prices  there is long term confidence in natural gas prices and other large companies that should cause deal values to remain at sizeable premiums    TER  Does it indicate that investors are willing to pay a premium for gas assets or just these gas assets    ND  These assets are considered above average  but  in general  investors are willing to pay more for many gas assets  It s much like when Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM NYSE  bought XTO Energy Inc  not terribly long ago  At that time  Exxon was also willing to pay a premium despite the volatility and weakness in gas prices    TER  Are more natural gas takeovers on the way    ND  I believe so  There may not be as many dry gas takeovers in North America initially  There have clearly been a lot of liquids related deals  I still expect there to be a number of takeovers and buyouts  The most tempting M A targets will have diversified gas and liquid assets    TER  You recently told Bloomberg that you re  cautious  on natural gas and  quite bullish  on oil  Please elaborate on your positions    ND  I m cautious about the near  to medium term forecast for natural gas  Most of these newer oil and gas plays  whether it s the newer Utica play  or a more established play like the Bakken  have a sizeable amount of associated gas  My fear is that even if the dry gas plays  such as the Haynesville or the Barnett  continue to see production fall  that will be more than offset by the increase of the associated gas from some of these newer liquid or oil plays  I don t necessarily think that s going to be the case  on a long term basis  but it still does have me quite cautious in the near term    Some analysts have recently cut their oil forecasts  But one thing that continues to make oil different from any other sector is oil s high depletion rate  And many newer oil plays have higher depletion rates than past averages  My bullish sentiment is largely based on that along with likely continued incremental demand    TER  Chesapeake Energy Corp   CHK NYSE  is facing up to a  20B shortfall in cash flow  Corporate governance issues ultimately resulted in Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon being replaced as chairman by Archie Dunham  former chairman of ConocoPhillips  COP NYSE   Chesapeake has sold some assets and is looking to sell even more  Where others see a troubled company  you see value  In fact  you have a Buy rating on Chesapeake  Tell our readers why this story could get better    ND  You ve brought up a lot of good points  I try to boil exploration and production  E P  companies down to asset value  whether it s Chesapeake or a smaller  simpler story  My analysis still shows that  after all the assets that Chesapeake is scheduled to sell  it still has four to five large liquid plays where it s either the No  1 or No  2 industry participant  And this is without attributing value for its many gas plays where it s in first or second place  The M A market remains very hot and its asset value is clearly much more than where the stock price is today  even if its  13B debt is backed off    TER  Chesapeake recently put 337 000 acres in the Utica Shale up for sale  What do you expect that to fetch and who are some likely buyers    ND  The Utica is the hottest play in the U S   not just because it s new  but because of its potential  I ve heard it could have some of the best economics of any area in the U S  Unfortunately for Chesapeake  some of the portion it put up for sale is on the fringe  It is also keeping a core holding for itself  Therefore  it won t fetch the  10 000  valuation per acre that some of the core acres could get  but could still receive over  2 500 per acre    There likely will still be a relatively large number of companies looking at it  including some of the big players that are already in the play  such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc  RDS A NYSE  RDS B NYSE   as well as majors like Exxon that are looking for big growth packages  It s very difficult  especially onshore in the U S   to find any sort of large acreage blocks like this  Besides  a lot of the players that are already in the Utica are potential targets for other large E Ps that would like a presence    TER  The Utica has been flying under the radar of most oil and gas investors  A June 25 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey report said that s going to change soon  Why is this play on the rise    ND  It was under the radar prior to early well results being released by Chesapeake late last year  Prior to that  there was just a dearth of results  A lot of that has to do with having to rest or shut in these wells once they re completed  Companies that have shut in wells have to let them rest before they start releasing results  Many wells are on the verge of production  In fact  I ve heard Chesapeake alone could have as many as 20 wells that could be released by the end of July  Once a number of well results are released by Chesapeake  Gulfport Energy Corp   GPOR NASDAQ   Rex Energy Corp   REXX NASDAQ  and Anadarko Petroleum Corp   APC NYSE  among others  the play is likely to start attracting investor interest again    TER  What are some of the more prospective counties that investors can zero in on    ND  That s one thing about the Utica nobody knows for sure where the best prospective or core counties would be  Based on channel checks and conversations that I ve had I would say eastern Ohio Carroll  Harrison and Guernsey counties even as far south as Monroe and Noble counties  But nothing has been clearly established    TER  Do you expect to see other wells like Chesapeake s Buell 8H well  which is producing 9 5 million cubic feet per day  MMcf d  of natural gas and 1 400 barrels of oil per day  bbl d  even after several months of production    ND  The Buell well was not just a great well for the Utica  but it s essentially one of the best wells I ve seen in the U S  period  Even though it was that good  there is a chance that there are others at least that good and maybe even better  There are companies  such as Gulfport  that have wells with more frack stages  There was even speculation a couple weeks ago that a private producer in Monroe County produced a well that was doing over 3 000 boe d and over 1 900 barrels a day  bbl d  of condensate  which would make it a better well than the Buell    TER  We ve seen the emergence of different shale plays over the last few years  but it seems like new shale plays continue to trump the others  Today it s the Utica  Is there more to come    ND  There will always be new discoveries  A lot of that has to do with the continuation of advanced technology  We are talking about being able to drill horizontally underneath the ground up to several miles  Technology continues to advance the chances that there will be another play  Will there be plays that surpass something as good as the Bakken  the Permian and the Utica  That s tough to say  Do I think we ll find other large shale plays  I do    TER  What are some of the companies operating in the Utica that could ride positive well results and boost investor sentiment    ND  Chesapeake is still No  1 despite all the recent noise that the company has had  If the Utica does work out as I expect  I can t imagine that the 100 pound gorilla wouldn t start to gain some traction  Others that are a bit more leveraged are Gulfport Energy  REX and PDC Energy Inc   PETD NASDAQ   All three of those have very solid acreage positions in the play  Two large ones would be Anadarko and Devon Energy Corp   DVN NYSE     TER  Where is Rex s shale acreage    ND  Nearly all of its position is in Carroll County  which is very positive  It s one of the best counties  Its position is also in one continuous block versus being scattered around  which is important    TER  Have condensates been discovered in any of the wells    ND  There s been a fair amount of condensate in that area  We re clearly going to learn more over the next three to five months  I would predict that the area will probably contain around one third oil  one third liquids and one third gas    TER  What s your outlook for Gulfport    ND  Its baseline oil production in the Gulf Coast coupled with its upside in the Utica could make for a very exciting year  But a lot of investors haven t factored its very significant oil sands position into their valuations  It owns 25  of Grizzly Energy  which has a very large position at Fort McMurray  Alberta  First production there is supposed to be around the second quarter next year  Q2 13   which could be very positive for Gulfport s stock  My target for Gulfport is  45  It s still only trading around  20    TER  What about Rex    ND  I have a higher price target on Rex than the current share price  which is driven from the massive production growth of around 90  sequentially this year coupled with approximately 50  sequentially next year  all of which is mostly in the liquids part of the Marcellus  though its new Utica play in Ohio should also help    TER  And Chesapeake    ND  I ve got a higher price target on Chesapeake than the current share price that is driven by incremental cash flows  mostly from the company s liquid assets  The company clearly has even more upside if natural gas prices begin to rally above  3 Mcf    TER  Magnum Hunter Resources Corp   MHR NYSE A  is another play that s got some acreage in the Utica  When will it be drilling and how soon could we get results    ND  Magnum has attractive acreage in Monroe County  The issue that I see with Magnum in the near term is that it doesn t quite have the infrastructure necessary to process and transport the commodities  There could be a well drilled there in the coming months with a very brief test period on it  which could get us some results  However  it will be very difficult to see an actual flow rate for Magnum Hunter this year in the Utica because of the infrastructure constraint    TER  What should oil and gas investors look for through the end of the year    ND  We clearly had a volatile first half of the year  I don t think that level of volatility will continue  but the markets could still remain quite choppy  Both oil and gas could be a bit range bound through at least early next year  Oil could be somewhere from  80 95 bbl  Natural gas has likely already experienced the lowest levels it could see in some time with it likely trading somewhere around  2 50 3 50 Mcf well into next year  However  these commodity prices should be strong enough to support higher prices in a number of E P stocks versus today s current levels    TER  Thank you  Neal     covered 30  companies in the exploration and production and oilfield services sectors as an analyst at Wunderlich Securities  He has held similar positions at

196949,418465,DVN,MLPs and the Growth of Natural Gas,opinion,We often write about companies involved in drilling for shale gas in the U S  Their drilling success has depressed natural gas prices with little near term prospect of a bounce  and consequently we ve focused on companies with low debt and cheap operating costs  Range Resources  RRC  Southwestern Energy  SWN   Devon Energy  DVN  and Comstock Resources  CRK  are all holdings of ours in this sector In the years ahead it seems clear that the growing use of natural gas will require significant investment in infrastructure to transport  refine and distribute what the E P names above and others extract from the ground  Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  offer an interesting opportunity to invest in this growth  A great deal of the midstream energy infrastructure currently employed is owned through MLPs  Since they are structured as pass through entities they are not subject to corporate income tax  The public unitholders are partners owning a proportional share of the assets  and therefore receive K 1s rather than 1099s  This additional tax reporting complexity dissuades many investors from owning MLPs  but their cheaper cost of capital  since they don t pay corporate income tax  and the tax deferred nature of most of their distributions make them compelling for most U S  taxable high net worth investors Building the additional infrastructure to process growing volumes of natural gas will over the next ten years result in a bigger MLP industry  JPMorgan recently forecast  using estimates from the  Interstate Natural Gas Association of America  INGAA  that today s  250BN market cap MLP sector will require an additional  130BN in new capital to fund new natural gas and oil transmission lines  gathering lines and storage facilities Plains All American  PAA  is one of the larger MLPs with a market valuation of  12BN and a well regarded management team  In their 2011 10K PAA outlines the growth they expect to see in U S  oil business and their position as a major owner of energy infrastructure places them in a good spot for natural gas as well  Cheap ethane  often used as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry  is expected to continue attracting investment in the U S  Some analysts expect Natural Gas Liquids  NGL  supply  including ethane  to increase by as much as 40  by 2016  PAA s ownership of assets is significant  including storage capacity for 71 million barrels of crude oil and refined products  equivalent to almost 4 days total U S  demand for crude oil   9 million barrels of NGL LPG storage capacity and 90BCF  Billion Cubic Feet  of natural gas storage working capacity and base capacity  around two days  total U S  consumption  The companies that will be able to raise the capital to build additional energy infrastructure will be the ones that have shown they re capable of managing existing assets efficiently  PAA is likely to be one of those  Sell side coverage of MLPs is increasing as banks anticipate the fees they can earn from helping raise capital  As an investor  owning shares  or LP units in the case of MLPs  in a company doing a secondary isn t as exciting as it is for the underwriter  and prices often fall somewhat when the announcement is made  However  MLPs  capex plans are subject to the discipline of the market  in that new money raised must be deployed at an IRR above the marginal cost of capital  Since MLPs can t retain much of their earnings they have to make their case to investors every time they wish to finance a new project  and as such the better run firms invest new money in ways that are ultimately accretive to unitholders MLPs have been strong performers of late  but PAA still offers a distribution yield of 5 2  and is expected to grow its Distributable Cash Flow at over 7  this year  PAA is a holding in our MLP Strategy ,2012-03-09,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mlps-and-the-growth-of-natural-gas-116439,116439
196950,418466,DVN,Devon Energy Is Undervalued ,opinion,A month ago we presented   NYSE  COP  and found an excellent agreement between the predicted and measured monthly closing prices since 2000  Here we compare the overall behavior of the COP model and a model estimated for Devon Energy Corporation  NYSE  DVN  by the same technique Our simplest model links share prices of energy companies with the difference between the headline and core CPI  In essence  we were trying to use the core CPI as an energy independent  dynamic  reference to the headline CPI which includes energy and  in turn  is related to oil price  Then the difference between these CPIs might be manifested in the energy pricing power relative to all other goods and services  Formally   model states that a share price  for example  that of Devon Energy  DVN t   can be approximated by a linear function of the difference between the core CPI  cCPI  and headline CPI DVN t    A   B cCPI t    CPI t    1 where A and B are empirical constants  as obtained by linear regression   t is the elapsed time  Figure 1 shows the observed and predicted DVM share prices since 2000  The best fit model is characterized by A  93  B  7 5  and a standard model error  sterr  11 51  for the period between January 2000 and February 2012  One can observe a good agreement between January 2000 and April 2011  when the predicted curve started to deviate from the observed one  The period after May 2011 has introduced the largest model error and is absolutely different from the behavior of the COP model which has proven its predictive power   We have been reporting on its performance since 2009   Figure 2 depicts the observed and predicted monthly closing prices for ConocoPhillips since 2002 with A  75 and B  5 5  The standard model error is only  8 31 for the period between 2002 and 2012 Comparing the COP and DVN models one can conclude that the current price of Devon Energy is undervalued by about  15  In February 2012  the price closed some portion of the gap and this process should extend into March and April  Figure 1  The observed DVN price and that predicted from the core and headline CPI  A  93  B  7 5  sterr  11 51 Figure 2  The observed COP price and that predicted from the core and headline CPI  A  75  B  5 5  sterr  8 31 ,2012-03-19,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/devon-energy-is-undervalued-117365,117365

196952,418468,DVN,2 Charts Tell You Everything You Need To Know About Alternative Energy,opinion,Just a few years ago  alternative energy sources were all the rage  A booming economy and record high oil prices meant that the market had the capital and motivation to look into wind  solar  geothermal  biofuels    even rain or ocean tide currents to create energy  A rising stock market and a high tax revenue base meant plenty of capital for start ups to build wind farms and for the government to grant generous subsidies to help get new plants off the ground This momentum came to a screeching halt with the bursting of the housing bubble and ensuing credit crisis The peak nearly coincided with Texas oil baron T  Boone Pickens s lofty goal of building a giant wind farm in his home state  He announced his ambitions in July 2008  when oil prices had peaked during the previous month at close to  150 per barrel  yet halted them a year later when they fell dramatically  bottoming out near  30 per barrel in early 2009  This  of course  speaks to the necessity of high oil prices to help encourage alternative energy projects  Since then  oil prices have been volatile again and just recently rose above  100  So the question is  after a multi year period of alternative energy being  dead money   should investors be looking at alternative energy once again    In today s economic and political environments  it s extremely difficult to sound a bullish tone on alternative energy investments  The plummet in price of the Market Vectors Alternative Energy ETF  NYSE     as shown in the table above  only serves as a case in point  It peaked at  60 back in late 2007 and currently trades at about  11  Right now  the economy continues to improve  and this could help encourage alternative energy development  Yet the federal debt now exceeds  15 trillion and leaves little room for subsidies  The government recently ended subsidies to corn based ethanol  which had been championed as an alternative to gasoline prior to the credit crisis  The recent failure of solar panel maker Solyndra  which received government funding  also speaks to the risk of letting politicians influence the development of new industries and technologies The alternative energy industry still needs help to reach the scale to compete with coal  natural gas  and other fossil fuels  One study estimated that solar energy sources cost triple that of coal and twice that of natural gas  Wind energy is about 33  more expensive than coal  and at least 14  more expensive than natural gas Massive natural gas discoveries in the United States have further shifted the power to this fossil fuel over alternative energy sources  Natural gas burns much cleaner than coal  and has plummeted in price to well below  3 per million British thermal units   The low price and abundance of natural gas could prove the smoking gun to suggest that alternative energy development in the United States has slowed down indefinitely  And until the economy improves and the government starts bringing in more tax revenue than it spends annually  there is little reason to see spending on alternative energy sources rebounding significantly      Risks to Consider  The past few years have demonstrated that energy prices can be extremely volatile  Any unexpected rise in oil prices  be it from an external shock such as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East  could easily shift the balance of power back to alternative energy sources  Increased regulations out of Washington could also force fossil fuels to give way to solar  wind  and related alternative energy sources  Action to Take     Ironically  the boom in natural gas discoveries in the U S  has meant that leading firms in the space  such as Devon Energy  NYSE    and Chesapeake Energy  NYSE    are also questionable near term investment candidates  Their long term potential is much more positive  though  By Ryan Fuhrmann,2012-04-11,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-charts-tell-you-everything-you-need-to-know-about-alternative-energy-119711,119711

196966,418482,DVN,Cheap Natural Gas is Creating its own Demand,opinion,Last week the Environmental Protection Agency   EPA  issued emission standards tightening the rules surrounding the output of mercury and other harmful pollutants  These standards will have the practical effect of making natural gas relatively more attractive than coal for electricity generation since coal burning plants require the installation of expensive  scrubbers  to clean the emissions they generate  Converting older plants to operate more cleanly often fails to make economic sense and as a result new power plants are increasingly burning natural gas  The Wall Street Journal noted this in an article on Friday Of course the shale revolution in natural gas has produced a glut of the stuff  and at  3 13 per MCF it s barely possible to drill for it profitably  That the price has fallen so low at the onset of Winter when demand typically picks up is testament to the success of the drillers  But it does emphasize the importance of being invested in companies with low costs of production since there s little near term prospect of higher prices But the longer term outlook is increasingly positive  U S  based natural gas is now cheaper than anywhere in the world outside the Middle East  and that is drawing interest from other industries that rely on cheap sources of energy  States that sit atop the Marcellus Shale  such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia  are competing with one another to attract ethylene production facilities  And a Brazilian textile company recently chose Texas over Mexico to build a new denim factory because of a 30  cost advantage in electricity  Over time cheap natural gas will lead to cheap electricity  drawing in additional industries and creating manufacturing jobs  And this increased demand will no doubt help support prices It s not a sector to own for a trade  but companies with low operating costs and minimal debt are best positioned to benefit from what s happening  We recently added Southwestern Energy  SWN  to our Deep Value Equity strategy since it meets these criteria  We continue to own Devon Energy  DVN  whose liquids business provides a usefully profitable offset to today s soft natural gas prices  The natural gas story continues to have many chapters ,2011-12-28,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cheap-natural-gas-is-creating-its-own-demand-109851,109851
196967,418483,DVN,Looking Beyond  2 71 Natural Gas,opinion,Natural Gas prices have been declining for years  The shale gas boom has been great for servicers and consumers  but drillers have been producing so much natural gas that they re almost giving it away  The Wall Street Journal has an article highlighting the steady increase in domestic production  up around 50  since 2005  and the sliding price  Spot Natural Gas dropped to  2 71 yesterday and there are forecasts that the price may drop as low as  2 The stocks have reacted predictably  with Comstock Resources  CRK  and Southwestern Energy  SWN  both falling sharply  To be sure there is no end in sight for the weak pricing environment  Natural gas is starting to replace coal as the fuel of choice for new electricity generation  and low prices will create their own demand  But this all takes time  and for traders who rely on pictures  the charts certainly look ugly for these and other names However  it s worth remembering the recent M A activity that s been taking place  Sinopec  a large Chinese oil company  invested  2 2BN in a joint venture with Devon Energy  DVN  in oil and gas fields it s developing  Access to cheap  secure U S  energy resources is attractive to China  France s Total invested  2 3BN alongside Chesapeake Energy  CHK  and Spain s Repsol put in  1BN to partner in a field alongside Sand Hill Energy  This week  Bloomberg highlighted the record prices shale acreage is receiving from international buyers   Last Summer BHP Billiton acquired Petrohawk at a 60  premium to the then current price  Floyd Wilson  Petrohawk s CEO  no doubt had sublime timing  But there s little doubt that the major E P companies recognize the long term role natural gas will play in U S  energy consumption  Exxon Mobil  XOM  publishes  The Outlook for Energy  A View to 2040  which provides some insight into their thinking  It s worth reading  They expect gas and electricity  which is increasingly produced by using natural gas  to meet a growing share of total energy demand  Natural gas is far cleaner than coal  far cheaper than oil and provides energy security in the U S  While in the near term it is supplanting coal as a source of electricity  it s likely to make some inroads to transportation  And those northeasterners who burn oil for heat will see the economics of shifting to natural gas None of this makes for a trade  But natural gas E P names with low debt and production costs provide the staying power to hold as an investment while M A activity continues and demand reacts to low prices  And there s always the potential upside from instability in the Middle East  We continue to own DVN  whose proved reserves alone are worth around  60 per share  We like CRK  which owns assets similar to those Petrohawk sold at a high price last year and is steadily adding higher margin natural gas liquids and oil to its output  Yesterday we bought back into Range Resources  RRC  which represents a concentrated bet on the Marcellus Shale but has very low production costs and in our opinion solid management  Although its proved reserves put a floor value far below the current stock price  we think the company is highly confident about its ability to de risk much of its acreage but FASB rules require that proved reserves be extracted within five years and RRC need not start the clock ticking on everything  We had exited RRC in the Fall as takeover speculation drove the price up  We think at current levels it s an attractively priced investment  They estimate up to 50 Trillion Cubic Feet  TCFE  of resource potential which  even if it only generated a realized  0 50 per MCF of cashflow would generate  25BN  The company expects to fund all capex from cashflow by next year There is a huge divergence in what large long term focused companies are willing to pay for these E Ps hydrocarbons and what market participants are willing to bid for their stocks today    In the near term  expect these stocks to be volatile ,2012-01-13,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-beyond-$2.71-natural-gas-111106,111106
196968,418484,DVN,Chesapeake Takes One For the Team,opinion,Yesterday s news that Chesapeake  CHK  is going to sell  12BN in assets in response to continued weak natural gas prices looks like good news  Depending on the buyers  it s possible that the new owners could have a sufficiently long horizon that they won t need to drill just to generate near term cashflow to finance debt payments  And it may also demonstrate that there are many buyers for natural gas assets in spite of the lousy current economics caused by excess supply  Natural gas is beginning to supplant coal as the marginal fuel of choice for electricity generation  and companies like Exxon Mobil  XOM  and BP  BP  forecast an increasing share of power generation will come from natural gas So the news is mildly positive for some of those with low costs of production  such as Devon Energy  DVN   Southwestern Energy  SWN  and Comstock Resources  CRK   However  CHK is weak  since the prospect of shedding around a third of its assets when natural gas is trading at  2 50 reveals some poor financial planning by Aubrey McClendon and his team  The expectation that CHK may have to sell more liquids focused properties is further disappointment for owners of CHK  It shows that debt is bad and low production costs vital if you re going to earn a decent return on investment in this sector  CHK s actions are helpful for just those types of company  but not for CHK itself ,2012-02-15,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chesapeake-takes-one-for-the-team-114009,114009
196969,418485,DVN,How Shale Gas Is Leading To Energy Independence,opinion,Two articles concerning shale gas have caught my attention this morning   The Death of Coal  reflects the view of some that under current EPA policies coal will continue to lose ground to natural gas as the fuel of choice for electricity generation  Cheap and relatively clean natural gas is eating into the demand for coal and EPA regulations on some of the more harmful pollutants released by burning coal are adding fuel to the fire  Abundant and cheap natural gas has certainly pressured the stock prices of some E P names recently  but low prices will create their own demand Another piece from UBS makes the case that as the U S  reaches energy independence this will increasingly provide support for the USD  The U S  has been an importer of crude oil for as long as any of us can remember  currently estimated at  300BN   but that is changing as new domestic discoveries are reducing the need for imports  The revolution in shale gas as well as new discoveries of oil  North Dakota now produces more oil than OPEC member Ecuador   This will eventually reduce the drag on our trade deficit of being an energy importer  and could well be supportive for the US   Over time it will reduce U S  reliance on the Middle East  and by reducing global trade imbalances could slow the growth of sovereign wealth funds Devon Energy  DVN  is squarely in the middle of this  and incidentally just reported strong earnings yesterday morning   We also continue to like being long USD versus the Euro  Short the Euro is a nice form of tail risk insurance  While a Greek default is still unlikely  some European finance ministers are reportedly more sanguine at that prospect should Athens fail to sign up to the latest austerity plan  Neither outcome makes the Euro attractive ,2012-02-16,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-shale-gas-is-leading-to-energy-independence-114145,114145
196970,418486,DVN,FX Futures Edge  February 22  2012 ,opinion, FORECAST STOCKS  The European debt contagion remains in place and is growing once again  China remains on a growth deceleration curve and there are concerns are of a hard landing   while the US is showing surprisingly positive data figures  Still  the risk of Europe on creating a global recession is high  although the US is better positioned than the rest of the world  which simply means that it shall outperform yet again this year STRATEGY  Technically speaking  the S P 500 remains above longterm support at the 160 week moving average at 1130  which is critical given it delineates bull bear markets  However  prices have reached into our 1350 to 1370 zone   a bit lower than expected  but the reversal lower in the NDX yesterday puts in the top in our opinion  Therefore  a correction of  5  to  8  is to be expected   for now WORLD MARKETS ARE ON BALANCE  LOWER  THIS MORNING as news of the  confirmed  Greek bailout hit the airwaves  This shouldn t surprise anyone  for the Eurozone simply wanted to show that it wasn t dysfunctional  that it could indeed come to an agreement   even it if is a bad agreement  Greece has no hope of adhering to the agreement  the Eurozone knows this  and the markets really know this  But hey kick the can down the road a bit further and when the time comes to for Greece to default it may not cause much of a stir except there will be quite a bit of money thrown down the proverbial toilet to be sure To this end  even the IMF  ECB and European Commission have their doubts  and this was expressed in a February 15th  confidential  document that has now surfaced  The report makes clear why the fight over the new Greek bailout was so intense very recently  Greece will need additional relief if it is to cut its debts to 120 percent of GDP by 2020 and if it doesn t follow through on structural reforms and other measures  its debt could hit 160 percent by 2020  The report presented a  tailored downside scenario  that suggests Greek debt could fall far more slowly than hoped  to only 160  of economic output by 2020   far below the target of 120  set by the IMF  Under this scenario  Greece would need about  245 billion in bailout aid  which is nearly twice the  136 billion under the  baseline  projections  Prolonged financial support on appropriate terms by the official sector may be necessary  Moreover  under the most favorable  baseline  scenario  the Greek economy will stop contracting next year and return to  2 3  growth in 2014 circumstances   and couldstill need an additional  50 billon by the end of the decade on top of the  136 billion in new funds until 2015 Quite clearly  the markets shall see through all of this at some point  but whether that matters or not isn t really of consequence  What matters now is what European bond yields do in absolute terms and relative to Germany   especially Portugal  for it shall be next up on the platter of Eurozone bailouts  Count on it TRADING STRATEGY  The market s resilience continues to show  cracks    and we do believe that the highs seen in both Apple  AAPL  and the NASDAQ 100  NDX  suggest that the rally is over for technology  and soon to be over for other market sectors  One could easily point to the rise in crude oil prices to  105 barrel and the concurrent rise in gasoline prices as being a headwind that is perhaps the  black swan  that no one is anticipating as they focus upon the Eurozone We are long Energy and Gold Shares  and we are short of Technology  Today  we shall get a bit less long of energy by selling Devon Energy  DVN  after its recent run and to pare back our Energy exposure just a bit  Do we think the DVN run is over  No  not really  But for now  we won t be surprised by corrective consolidation to digest the gains seen  and we think it wise to simply moderate our exposure given the risk reward is better for our other Energy positions relative to where the market stands at such extended short term levels  Also  given we are exiting DVN  we are predisposed to add to our short Technology position by adding another 10  exposure to QID To Read the Entire Report Please Click on the pdf File Below ,2012-02-21,Richard Rhodes,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/fx-futures-edge:-february-22,-2012-114614",114614
196971,418487,DVN,FX Futures Edge  February 23  2012 ,opinion, FORECAST STOCKS  The European debt contagion remains in place and is growing once again  China remains on a growth deceleration curve and there are concerns are of a hard landing   while the US is showing surprisingly positive data figures  Still  the risk of Europe on creating a global recession is high  although the US is better positioned than the rest of the world  which simply means that it shall outperform yet again this year STRATEGY  Technically speaking  the S P 500 remains above longterm support at the 160 week moving average at 1130  which is critical given it delineates bull bear markets  However  prices have reached into our 1350 to 1370 zone   a bit lower than expected  but the reversal lower in the NDX yesterday puts in the top in our opinion  Therefore  a correction of  5  to  8  is to be expected   for now WORLD MARKES ARE WEAKENING IN SURPRISING FASHION  and when say this it is due to a plethora of data out this morning that has confounded most analysts  But there is one theme that is clear in the surprises and that is it is  weakness  anywhere and everywhere one looks  Be it in Dell s earnings or Toll Brothers earnings  of European and Chinese PMI data   it s all weaker than expected  So logically for once  the stock markets of the world are weakening too  Its seems that since a Greece deal isn t the bullish news that it once was  market participants are looking around and trying to figure out the economic landscape they had forgotten about SURPRISE  EUROZONE PMI CONTRACTS  With the sovereign debt crisis still in place  although on hiatus it would seem from a sentiment perspective   we should note that economists were surprised this morning when the PMI report showed economic activity contracting instead of expanding  Those consensus makers forecast a February rise to 50 8 from 50 4 but they got 49 7 instead  This reminds us of 2007 when all the economists forecast that the US and world economy would weather the sub prime crisis that morphed into a credit crisis  this is still ongoing by the way  Could those very same economists be very wrong yet again  Yes  but the technicals don t yet suggest an imminent larger top has formed  simply a short term top ANOTHER SURPRISE   China s new export orders dropped in February according to HSBC  and they did so by the largest amount in 8 months  Again  expectations were for a risein export orders as the Lunar New Year holidays  which in our mind is a very worrying sign of the impact of the Eurozone debt crisis ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT  Today  there is only one report of consequence  and it is January Existing Home Sales  The consensus tells us to expect a rise from 4 61 million annual units to 4 65 million  estimates go as high at 4 75 million  With all the surprises this morning  we won t be surprised if the existing home sales data surprises to the downside ANOTHER DOUBLE SECRET SURPRISE  TOLL BROTHERS REPORTS A LOSS  With the recent rally  there is quite a bit of optimism built into the markets  and the homebuilders have been one of the strongest groups against seemingly all odds  This has led to many calling yet another bottom in the housing market  but this morning TOL reported a  surprise  1Q loss  with weaker than expected revenue due to fewer deliveries  They delivered 564 homes versus 570 in 1Q last year  with the cancelation rate rising to 6 2  from a year ago levels of 5 7   Moreover  TOL is up  16  since the beginning of the year  with CEO Yearly saying the market generally feels  healthier  than it did a year ago  The numbers don t bear it out however GREECE IN THE HEADLINES AGAIN   Just when one thought it was safe to stop thinking about the past 2 year Grecian drama  Fitch Ratings goes and downgrades Greece s credit rating to C to CCC  and will lower it once again once there is confirmation of the bond exchange   this time to RD   restricted default  After the exchange takes place  then Fitch will  re rate  the new securities based on the agency s assessment of its post default structure and credit profile  In other words   this drama isn t over yet   it s just been put on hiatus for a short while  We all know Greek can t meet the terms of the agreement  the only question is when news of it not being able to do so hits the markets and the sovereign bond market as well as it will imply the German austerity measure route may be too onerous for Greece and perhaps some of the other countries as well if Europe doesn t pull out of the current slowdown TRADING STRATEGY  The market s resilience continues to show  cracks    and we do believe that the highs seen in both Apple  AAPL  and the NASDAQ 100  NDX  last Wednesday suggest that the rally is over for technology  and soon to be over for other market sectors  One could easily point to the rise in crude oil prices to  106  barrel and the concurrent rise in gasoline prices as being a headwind that is perhaps the  black swan  that no one is anticipating as they focus upon the Eurozone We are long Energy and Gold Shares  and we are short of Technology Yesterday  we pared back our energy exposure by selling Devon Energy  DVN   For now  we ll stand aside  but will note that we won t be surprised by a corrective consolidation to digest the gains seen  and we may very well move again to simply moderate our energy exposure even further given the market stands at such extended short term levels  Furthermore  we are predisposed to add to our short Technology position

196973,418489,DVN,Optimizing Shareholder Value   A Lesson from Devon Energy s Management,opinion,In November of last year  Devon  symbol  DVN  completed its  3 5B share repurchase program announced in May of 2010   Under this program the company repurchased 49 2MM shares  for an average price of  71 share  reducing the share count by 10    During the same period  management sold non core acreage raising the cash to fund the repurchases  pay down debt  and acquire onshore core acreage   This strategy realizes full asset value for non core properties  improves Devon s balance sheet  reduces shares outstanding  and allows management to focus on the highest IRR projects   As shareholders we love this   A little bit of arithmetic shows why As seen in the table below  the company sells 7  of its proved reserves for  10B   The after tax proceeds of  8B are used to  reduce shares outstanding by 10  for  3 5B  reduce debt by  1 8B  acquire new core acreage positions for  1 2B  add  500M of cash to the balance sheet   Furthermore  Devon s management has excelled at more than optimizing the capital structure as they have demonstrated continued strong operating results increasing proved reserves per share by 17  notwithstanding the divestitures Using a simplistic analysis for debt adjusted value per share based on proved reserves illustrates how Devon s management created  27 share of value for stock holders over the past two years   While there are other ways to value shares  this way does serve as a useful evaluation of Devon s value enhancing capital redeployment and highlights the virtuous cycle of share repurchases for undervalued companies Data is taken from 10 Ks  earnings releases  and company presentations,2012-02-26,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimizing-shareholder-value-–-a-lesson-from-devon-energy’s-management-115048,115048
196974,418490,DVN,Natural Gas Stocks Feel The Heat ,opinion,All of the leading natural gas stocks are coming under some selling pressure this morning  Lower natural gas prices are definitely not helping these stocks  This morning  natural gas futures are trading lower by more than 2 50 percent   Leading natural gas stock Southwestern Energy Co  NYSE SWN  is trading lower by  2 14 to 33 22 a share  Short term traders can watch for intra day support around the  32 30 area  Should the stock decline below that important support level the next support area is around the  31 50 level  Other natural gas stocks that are declining lower include Chesapeake Energy Corp  NYSE CHK   and Devon Energy Corp  NYSE DVN  ,2012-02-28,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/natural-gas-stocks-feel-the-heat-115333,115333
196986,418502,DVN,The Quiet Buying of Shale Gas Assets,opinion,The FT notes in an article this morning how M A activity in the shale gas arena reached almost  50BN during the third quarter  a 135  jump on a year ago  Some deals were large and notable  such as Kinder Morgan s  KMP  purchase of El Paso  Others took place out of the spotlight  but what is clearly taking place is a growing acknowledgment by the major energy companies that domestic natural gas in the U S  will represent an increasingly important source of energy production  It s here in the U S   it s cleaner than other fossil fuels  though global warming is yesterday s story  and it s persistently cheap  They very success of so many E P companies in drilling for natural gas has depressed its price  helping consumers but hurting profitability  When Petrohawk sold their business to BHP Billiton  it confirmed CEO Floyd Wilson s oft stated belief that the assets Petrohawk owned better belonged within a larger company with a lower cost of capital  That statement really is the key to the natural gas story  In a time of abundant and cheap natural gas  the company that has the lowest overall cost structure  including the cost of financing the necessary capex  will win As an investor  you have to choose carefully though  and definitely avoid companies that use too much leverage  As a result we ve never invested in Chesapeake  CHK   Aubrey McClendon is a great cheerleader for the industry but has exhibited a wholly different risk appetite in the past than we would like  We continue to like Comstock  CRK  a name that s fallen too far  We also think Devon Energy  DVN  is a solid investment trading as it does close to the value of its proved reserves  providing a cheap option on likely but not yet proven assets  and with half its revenues now coming from crude oil production  It s also all onshore  having divested its offshore and non U S  assets in recent years But Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs   also allow an interesting angle on the development of shale gas assets  Once the gas is extracted it needs to be processed  refined  transported and stored  This is to a large degree what drove KMP s acquisition of El Paso  positioning for the huge infrastructure investments required to move natural gas from under the ground to the U S  consumer  I found it interesting that earlier this month JPMorgan initiated research coverage of MLPs  They used to cover them but the analyst left several years ago and they dropped their emphasis on the sector  But JPMorgan estimates  130BN in capital investment over the next ten years as the industry responds to a shifting mix of fuels to provide energy  The tax status of MLPs precludes them from retaining much of their earnings  so new projects are usually funded with freshly raised debt or equity capital  For an investor this imposes discipline on management  since a poorly conceived project won t easily attract cheap financing  JPMorgan no doubt sees an attractive long term fee opportunity  Meanwhile  there are ways to participate in shale gas development for the equity investor through E P companies and the income seeking investor through MLPs  The sector has also recovered strongly from the sell off in equity markets through September   the Alerian MLP Index  AMZ  is back within 5  of its high reached in April  6  distribution yields and steady growth help ,2011-10-26,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-quiet-buying-of-shale-gas-assets-103694,103694
196987,418503,DVN,Savour the Moment,opinion,Sometimes you feel as if you d like the world to stop right where it is  For most investors  arriving at work and checking their portfolios over coffee this morning should be one of the most pleasant beverages they ve consumed in many months  After the misery of the third quarter culminating in September s testing of every reasonable investment thesis  sanity is finally returning  The Europeans have avoided disaster  the Germans have crammed voluntary losses on the banks  who have only themselves to blame for owning so much Greek debt in the first place   The banks say they will recapitalize through retained earnings rather than dilutive secondary offerings  The EFSF will be stretched as needed  although details are still sketchy   Life as we knew it can resume  and risk assets are cheap  Enjoy the view  like gazing across a beautiful vista on a sunny day  Touch the moment and savour it  Of course there are problems  and the moment won t last  But for now  just look and let September s nightmare recede So having done that  what s next  Well  having engineered a voluntary loss of 50  on holders of Greek debt and thereby avoiding an actual default  the market for sovereign credit default swaps  CDS  appears superfluous  Cautious buyers of Greek debt  were there ever any   who bought credit insurance  i e  CDS  have found it a waste of money  Sovereign defaults are at the end of the day as much political as credit events  Rating agency assessments of countries are political judgments  and maybe we re witnessing the end of one corner of the CDS market  Bankers have warned that reduced hedging opportunities will reduce the appetite of banks to extend credit   that may not be a wholly bad outcome given the amount of poorly conceived credit they ve extended in the past  But reduced credit in the near term combined with Europe wide fiscal retrenchment will stifle growth For our part  the main challenge to investors remains finding a fair alternative to the paltry yields offered in fixed income  Senior loans continue to be an attractive sector  The ING Prime Rate Fund  PPR  yields close to 6  and closed at a  7  discount to its NAV  When I spoke to one of the co PMs a couple of weeks ago he felt fairly sanguine about defaults barring a European disaster which  at that time couldn t be ruled out  Meanwhile  high grade corporate bonds at around 4  with no growth require conditions close to but just short of deflation to turn out well  The gap between the 8  earnings yield on the S P500 and 2 25  ten year treasury bonds is somewhat narrower than a month ago but still historically wide  Today is probably not the day to jump into equities  but at a calmer moment they still look like a more attractive long term investment than bonds  The after tax return on  100 in ten year treasuries can be beaten by a combination of  80 in 0  cash and only  20 in 2 2  dividend yielding stocks assuming as little as 4  dividend growth  Bonds are at yields that only a QE emboldened government could love In equities we remain fully invested  Natural gas E P names continue to represent the more volatile sector of our Deep Value Equity portfolio  Devon Energy  DVN  is barely above the value of its proved reserves  We continue to believe Gannett  GCI  is very cheap at 6X earnings or less than five times free cashflow  And Microsoft  MSFT  remains attractive at less than 7X earnings net of cash  less debt  on balance sheet  MSFT has been cheap for many  many months  It s not exciting to be an investor   far from it  But it continues to be reliably profitable ,2011-10-27,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/savour-the-moment-103888,103888
196988,418504,DVN,Why We Still Prefer Equities over Bonds  Dollars over Euros and Devon Energy,opinion,Barron s has a couple of interesting articles this weekend  They lead with  Buckle Up   and make the case for equities by highlighting the very wide equity risk premium  the S P500 earnings yield of 8  minus the yield on ten year treasuries of 2   something we ve also noted in the past  This spread is historically wide and  it can be argued  makes a compelling case for stocks  What seems more clear is that the spread will narrow but that could just as easily be through bond yields rising  We do think equities represent an attractive long term investment but we are more sure that bonds do not  Public policy in the U S  is to effect a transfer of real wealth from savers to borrowers  so while stocks look attractive bonds look positively ugly Of course noting that bond yields are low and can only really move up is scarcely a contrarian view  Randall Forsyth notes in Barron s a solid agreement among forecasters that bond yields will be higher a year from now  While it makes a great deal of sense  presumably the Federal Reserve will respond to higher yields by increasing its purchases unless rising yields are accompanied by an upside surprise in GDP growth  They re likely to maintain negative real rates of return for a considerable time A hedge fund  QB Asset Management  forecasts  face ripping inflation   a term likely to catch your attention  The output gap  such as the difference between current unemployment and the natural rate  seems too high for that   there still appears to be plenty of excess capacity in the labor force  It s hard to see how inflation  at least as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  can take off when so many people are available to be employed  QB could be right  but it hasn t happened so far and without an increase in money velocity the jump in money supply isn t likely to become inflationary  But similar to the wide equity risk premium  while low current inflation may persist it s not worth betting on a continuation of the status quo Shorting Euros is another crowded trade  It s just hard to see how any of the solutions on offer will promote growth within the region  The Real GDP differential is likely to be 2 5  next year in favor of the U S  European governments are following pro cyclical policies during a time of slowing growth  The Euro has weakened in recent weeks but really ought to be far lower  However  we run this risk in our hedge fund in combination with long equities from a number of different trades  We think the Euro will depreciate  but if we re wrong it ll most likely be in a scenario that is good for stocks  Borrowing Euros to buy U S  equities represents an attractive  opportunity  Mike Platt  co founder of BlueCrest  a global macro hedge fund  offered a most dire outlook on Europe and its banks  BlueCrest is one of the most successful hedge funds around  and the TV interview is worth a look  Platt is frustratingly vague about how he s positioning for what he expects will be a continued deterioration but leaves little doubt about his overall view  If European banks valued their positions the way hedge funds have to they d all be declared insolvent  I can t really see why anyone would lend anybody in Europe any money  except perhaps in Germany and the UK Finally  I d note that JPMorgan issued revised valuation estimates for large cap E P names  Devon Energy  DVN  remains one of the  largest positions in our Deep Value Equity Strategy  trading at close to the value of its proved reserves  The continued shift from natural gas to oil production in the U S  in response to relative pricing should work to Devon s advantage given its asset mix ,2011-12-19,Simon Lack,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-we-still-prefer-equities-over-bonds,-dollars-over-euros-and-devon-energy-109093",109093
