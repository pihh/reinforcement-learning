107293,328808,CSIQ,Solar Energy  The Oversupply Of Solar Panels Is Shrinking  Will Prices Rise  ,news,"By    A glut of solar panels in recent years has forced manufacturers like SunPower Corp  NASDAQ SPWR to idle factories and cut hundreds of jobs  But now demand is catching up with supplies  and SunPower is in an unusual position  It needs more panels 
 It would be fair to say our panels are in short supply   Tom Werner  the California company s chief executive  told Bloomberg News this week  The firm s factories are running at full capacity  he said  and two new plants are slated to come online by 2017  Canadian Solar Inc  NASDAQ CSIQ said it is similarly boosting production because it anticipates a panel shortage 
While individual companies need to ramp up production  analysts say an industrywide panel scarcity isn t likely  Worldwide  there s enough capacity to meet orders  But the narrowing gap between supply and demand will likely raise panel prices  and that could hurt some developers and slow project developments 
The industry is set to install as much as 52 000 megawatts of solar this year and 61 000 MW in 2015    more than seven times what developers installed five years ago  Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported in London 
 Toward the end of the year  there will be pressure on supplies and probably some upward pressure on prices   Jenny Chase  the research firm s lead solar analyst  told International Business Times  Chase said the supply pressure should raise prices by  a couple of cents per watt  from about 75 cents per watt now 
The solar glut emerged several years ago when Chinese manufacturers    bolstered by low domestic labor costs and a bevy of government subsidies    began flooding the global market with polysilicon panels  Prices dropped precipitously  from about  2 10 per watt in 2010  and U S  and European companies couldn t keep up  Dozens of American companies folded  partly as a result  and many of the remaining firms focused their production abroad  SunPower  the second largest U S  panel maker  is building its newest factory in the Philippines in 2015  for instance  It hasn t disclosed yet where it will build a second factory for 2017  
 If you look back eight to 12 quarters ago  panel prices were declining 10 to 15 percent every quarter and dropping really rapidly   Michael Barker  a senior analyst at NPD Solarbuzz  an industry research group  said in an interview 
Now  however  panel prices  are stabilizing  declining by 1 to 2 percent each quarter   he said   That really does benefit the  panel  manufacturers  because they re able to focus on long term cost reduction and efficiency increases  instead of adjusting prices  
The price hike will affect the  downstream  solar installation market  Chase said  Rooftop solar installers  for instance  might not feel much of an impact  since panels typically cost a bit more in the residential market because of the small project size  But for developers of large scale projects  the higher prices could be problematic 
 Many of these larger projects may have bid for  contracts  on the assumption that they can get panels for 50 cents a watt   Chase said  If the economics don t pan out   utility scale projects could be pushed back or canceled altogether   The United States has about 25 000 MW of large projects under development    more than twice the amount of solar already installed or under construction  industry statistics indicate 

Still  Chase and Barker said the biggest challenge to the U S  market is not the shrinking panel glut but the dueling solar trade wars between Washington and Beijing 
U S  trade officials in June imposed duties of as much as 35 percent on Chinese solar imports to the United States after ruling that Chinese subsidies kept prices of panels and related components artificially low  The tariffs follow a 2012 ruling that levies fines as high as 36 percent on imported panels made from Chinese solar cells 
Chase said the tariffs have already increased U S  panel prices by 5 cents a watt  NPD Solarbuzz reported about 3 000 MW of large scale projects in the pipeline could be hurt by the tariffs 
In January  China imposed anti dumping duties as high as 57 percent for imports of American made polysilicon  a key raw material used in making panels  Last week  the Chinese government closed a loophole that had allowed importers to avoid the duties  The rule is meant to punish the polysilicon makers and also U S  manufacturers with panel factories in the country   That could increase the costs for some foreign manufacturers   Barker said ",2014-08-19,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/solar-energy:-the-oversupply-of-solar-panels-is-shrinking.-will-prices-rise -304334,304334

107312,328827,CSIQ,U S  solar sector argues as D C  tariff hearing begins,news,"A divided U S  solar power industry testified today before a government panel that could impose steep tariffs on imported solar panels 
The trade case brought by bankrupt panel maker Suniva seeks the tariffs from the U S  International Trade Commission  asserting that a glut of panels manufactured abroad has depressed prices and made it difficult for U S  producers to compete 
Much of the industry says tariffs on overseas panels would drive up the price of solar power just as it has become competitive with other electricity sources 
Among those testifying in opposition to the trade case  SunPower  NASDAQ SPWR  CEO Tom Werner said solar power is now  on a glide path to being a fully self sustaining industry  
If the ITC finds serious injury by a Sept  22 deadline  it would recommend remedies to Pres  Trump by Nov  13

107322,328837,CSIQ,Ichor  Lazard  Canadian Solar  JinkoSolar And Enphase Energy Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 17  2019    Ichor Holdings   NASDAQ ICHR   as the Bull of the Day  Lazard   NYSE LAZ   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Canadian Solar   NASDAQ CSIQ    JinkoSolar Holdings   NYSE JKS   and Enphase Energy   NASDAQ ENPH   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Ichor Holdings is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it is the Bull of the Day today   Normally we have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  but I am going to with this stock for the simple reason that it is running and you need to take a deeper look at why   That is really the whole point of the Bull of the Day article  so let s get right to it DescriptionIchor Holdings  Ltd  is engaged in the design  engineering and manufacturing of critical fluid delivery subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment  Ichor Holdings  Ltd  is based in Fremont  United States Earnings HistoryI tend to look mostly at the last four quarters and with ICHR the story isn t one that screams  this is a winner  or something like that I see a string of three misses ended by a recent beat   So the momentum is with the name  but those other three misses are not what you want to see As I focus on the beat  I see that it helped estimates move much higher Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Rank is all about the recent revisions in earnings estimates   In ICHR s case  we see estimates moving up across the board I see the number for this quarter moving from  0 38 to  0 47    next quarter has an 11 cent move and the full year is looking at a 12 cent move The momentum carries into next year as well as I see the Zacks Consensus Estimate moving from  2 08 to  2 34 over the last 60 days ValuationThe valuation on chip stocks is always relatively high  but I like where ICHR is at   26x forward estimates isn t as high as most other chip names and the price to book of 3 5x should be close enough for value investors to remain interested   I see some topline contraction last quarter  but the 1 3x price to sales also tells me the market still rewards the stock for every incremental dollar in sales At the end of the day  as the trade war starts to wind down  this stock could be a big winner   It is consistently hitting new highs and in this market  I am a fan of buying high and selling higher  Lazardis a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and it is the Bear of the Day   Often times  the Bear of the Day will be a stock that is falling  but that is not happening with LAZ   Let s look at why this is the case  and why the stock has the lowest Zacks Rank DescriptionLazard is one of the world s major financial advisory and asset management firms  The company is specialized in offering solutions for complex financial and strategic challenges of a diverse set of clients around the world  including corporations  governments  institutions  partnerships and individuals  Founded in 1848 in New Orleans  Lazard currently operates from 43 cities in key business and financial centers across 27 countries throughout Europe  North America  Asia  Australia  the Middle East  and Central and South America Estimates FallingLazard is not in trouble by any means  but the key idea here is that the Zacks Rank is all about earnings estimate revisions   That means if the analysts see some trouble ahead they are going to lower their estiamtes   They might also just be correcting their models as they were too bullish In any event  esimates for LAZ are falling 60 days ago  the full year number for 2019 was  3 35  now that number is  3 23   Next year has seen an even bigger decline  as estimates have fallen from  3 95 to  3 56 It really speaks to the broader market when a move like that is causing the stock to fall to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell    It says that there are a lot of stocks with positive earnings estimate revisions and only a small move lower brought this stock to the lowest Zacks Rank ValuationI see a 12x forward earnings multiple which is good  but a 6x price to book is a little stiff   1 5x sales is a good level to have  but with revenue contracting you have to look for margins to expand   Lately  margins have not been expanding  so when they turn around  this stock could be worth a deeper look Solar Stocks in Spotlight on Phase One U S  China DealStock markets across the globe breathed a sigh of relief after progress in trade negotiations between the United States and China on Dec 12  after almost two years of dispute  The U S   industry  which has been witnessing uncertainty following Trump s imposition of the import tariff on solar products  witnessed an upside post the latest development Notably  the solar industry was up 4  on Dec 12  after governments of the two most powerful economies promised to purchase in abundance from each other Impact of Tariff on SolarImposition of the import tariff on solar products dealt a major blow to the U S  solar industry  Per a recent report by Solar Energy Industries Association  SEIA   tariffs on imported solar cells and modules have caused 10 5 gigawatts  GW  of solar installations to be cancelled  enough to power 1 8 million homes and reduce 26 million metric tons of carbon emissions  Sadly  solar tariffs are costing the United States more than  10 5 million per day in unrealized economic activity Details of the Recent Trade TrucePer major media reports  President Trump announced cancellation of plans to impose new tariffs on  160 billion worth of Chinese imports as part of the modest interim agreement  The United States has also promised to reduce existing import taxes on about  112 billion in Chinese goods from 15  to 7 5    In return  per Trump s tweet  China has agreed to  massive   purchases of American farm and manufactured products as part of a so called Phase 1 deal In fact  in the next two years  Beijing has committed to buying an extra  200 billion in U S  agricultural  energy and manufactured goods Here s How the Trade Deal Will Help SolarRecovering from last year s disappointing performance  U S  solar industry has been in the headlines in 2019   Thanks to the robust increase in solar installations coupled with unexpected rapid growth in the states of Florida and Texas  U S  solar stocks have rallied 66 4  year to date Rapidly increasing corporate investments in solar energy have been boosting the U S  solar industry lately  New solar project announcements have led Wood Mackenzie to increase its forecast for 2020 and 2021 utility scale installations by 2 5 GW and by 1 GW respectively In addition to the aforementioned catalysts  the latest trade truce should boost U S  solar stocks  growth  This is because phase one of the trade deal brings possible dilution in import tariff on solar cells and modules from China  along with increase in purchase of U S  solar products by China in retaliation Solar Stocks

107390,328905,CSIQ,Buy These 6 Best Value Stocks To Make The Most Of P B Ratio,opinion,When evaluating a company  investors mostly look at a stock s price to earnings  P E  or price to sales  P S  ratio  While P E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price  P S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company Though P E and P S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection  the price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also an easy to use metric for identifying low priced stocks with high growth prospects P B is the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equityWhat is Book Value Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day

107402,328917,CSIQ,5 Low Price to Book Stocks To Increase Your Portfolio s Value,opinion,Price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  are the first ratios that come to an investor s mind for narrowing down a list of undervalued stocks  However  the price to book ratio  P B ratio   though underrated  is also an easy to use valuation tool for identifying low priced stocks with high growth prospects P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market capitalization book value of equity What is Book Value Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1 PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued

107430,328945,CSIQ,5 Price to Book Value Picks For September,opinion,In value analysis  though price to earnings  P E  and price to sales  P S  are most preferred by investors  the underrated price to book ratio  P B ratio  is also an easy to use valuation tool for identifying low priced stocks with exceptional returns  The ratio is used to compare a stock s market value price to its book value The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareP B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share  So  if the share price is  10 and book value of equity is  5  investors are ready to pay two times the book value What is Book Value Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S

1 PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued

107456,328971,CSIQ,4 Discounted PEG Stocks Suitable For GARP Investors,opinion,The investment pattern of new age investors is gradually tending toward hybrid investment from pure play theories like growth or value  According to them  over the long term  this mixed strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing GARP  growth at a reasonable price  investment  often known as a special case of value investment  is gaining popularity among new generation stakeholders  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics  price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks  P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount  PEG  while adding the growth element to it  helps to identify stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It does not consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5   Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are four stocks that qualified the screening Stamps com   NASDAQ

107491,329006,CSIQ,6 Low Price to Book Value Stocks To Buy For Solid Returns,opinion,The price to book  P B  ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low priced stocks with exceptional returns  The ratio is used to compare a stock s market value price to its book value The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareP B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share  So  if the share price is  10 and book value of equity is  5  investors are ready to pay two times the book value  Ideally  a P B value under 1 0 is considered good as it indicates that the stock is potentially undervalued  However  value investors often consider stocks with a P B value under 3 0 Now let us understand the concept of book value What is Book Value There are several ways by which book value can be defined  Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to the common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are

are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog Nasdaq Exits Bear Market  5 Top Ranked WinnersOn Feb 15  the Nasdaq posted an eight week long winning stretch  In doing so  it exited its longest bear market by one measure since 1991  This represents a significant turnaround from the collapse that the index and tech stocks in particular suffered in the final quarter of 2018 Clearly  tech stocks have found favor with investors once again this year  While tech earnings likely lost momentum in the fourth quarter  the FAANG group surprised investors with strong earnings numbers  This has led to their renewed popularity among investors and market watchers alike At this point  the Nasdaq is up 12 6  year to date  With even last year s weakest performers staging a strong rebound  it would make good sense to add select index members to your portfolio to boost profits Success of Trade Negotiations Hold the Key for NasdaqUltimately  the progress of trade negotiations is crucial for the tech heavy Nasdaq s continued ascent  Tech based companies reap a substantial part of their sales from abroad and from China in particular  Most of them have also set up manufacturing bases overseas Possibly  they have the most to lose from a bitter and extended trade war  Trade negotiations are set to continue in Washington this week  Despite the structural issues  which the Trump administration remains inflexible about  investors are increasingly optimistic about a quick resolution to the dispute According to fresh reports  China has made a generous offer to tackle the key issue of trade imbalance  The proposal seeks to nullify the country s entire trade surplus with the United States in six years  The idea could easily catch the Trump administration s fancy  resolving the crisis in the process Our ChoicesThe Nasdaq has staged an admirable recovery this year after suffering a severe downturn in the fourth quarter of 2018  The much vaunted FAANG group  which often dictates the index s performance  is back in favor  Meanwhile  investor optimism over a resolution to the trade dispute with China is growing  Adding Nasdaq stocks that have performed admirably year to date to your portfolio seems to be a smart move  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of A  You can see Canadian

spasms  volatile oil prices and others through 2018 Things deteriorated at the tail end of the year  thanks to the latest Treasury yield anxiety and increase in federal funds rates  Not to forget  a rising interest rate environment reduces borrowing and eventually spending  If spending drops too much  there may be chances of a recession soon Now  as we gear up to ring in a New Year  investors might want to zero in on stocks that hold solid potential for a healthy ROI in 2019  But before that  let s go through the noteworthy events of the year and then take a look at an elaborate outlook for 2019 2018 in a Nutshell The year 2018 has been quite a mixed bag for investors In the first half  the Trump administration announced the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that provided a boost to cash flow and infused confidence for healthy investments As the year progressed  markets were stripped of the initial gains due to volatile oil prices  trade tiff  geopolitical conflict with North Korea and Iran  multiple interest hikes by Fed  imposition of tariffs on various foreign countries to improve the U S  trade balance and a soft global economy In December  for the first time in more than a decade  yields on Treasuries with shorter maturities exceeded longer dated issues  In other words  the yield curve experienced an inversion  Traditionally  such a phenomenon heralds severe economic downturn  Last time this happened in December 2007  just before the Great Recession However  we don t see a near term recession  This is because debt payments were way higher than household budgets during the Great Recession  Now  household debt payments account for a modest share of household income 2019 Overall ForecastEconomy as a WholeFresh data from IMF shows that the economy will maintain a slow pace in 2019 and 2020  The GDP growth rate is expected to remain in the 2 3  ideal range  Meanwhile  unemployment is expected to continue at the usual rate Bloomberg forecasts United States  net contribution to global GDP to drop from 12 3  to 8 5  in 2022 Trade War Jibe to Relax Till March The trade war jibe seems to settle down soon as Washington and Beijing have agreed to not levy further tariffs till March 2019  However  many experts believe that the mutually agreed timeframe is not enough to enable a comprehensive trade pact between the economies  The increase in tariff from 10  to 25   on hold till Mar 1  2019  on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports  if imposed  will have a significant impact on companies  profits Fed Rate Hike OutlookOn Dec 19  policymakers announced the expectations of two more hikes in 2019  However  it did strike a dovish note by reducing projected rate hikes from three to two Oil Prices OutlookCrude oil prices are recovering fast after plummeting to its lowest level of 2018 in November  According to market watchers  given OPEC s recent decision of production cut with global oil demand remaining solid  there are high chances that crude prices will increase in 2019 Any recovery in oil prices can play a major role in driving the broader stock market and of course small cap stocks  Although it is not clear what 2019 will unfold

107703,329218,CSIQ,5 Stocks With Relative Price Strength Worth Investing In,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally

In line with this  the company announced in March its intention to open its first U S  factory in Florida  Such a strategic move will not only enable the company to avoid the import tariff on a whole but also provide increased flexibility to support its local partners in the days to come Coming to JinkoSolar s achievements in the United States  JinkoSolar has been able to acquire major solar module supply agreements in the country  of late  Evidently  in January 2018  the company sealed a deal to supply 1 75 GW of its high efficiency solar modules  over approximately three years  to a U S  counterparty 
In March  JinkoSolar agreed to supply 2 75 GW of modules to NextEra Energy   NYSE NEE    Such deals reflect the huge demand for JinkoSolar s modules in the United States and offer scope for more such contract wins   The company already enjoys a solid relationship with sPower and till date has successfully supplied over 800 megawatt  MW  of solar modules for the latter s PV projects  The latest agreement should further strengthen JinkoSolar s strategic relationship with sPower  which includes significant down payments  thereby helping the company expand manufacturing capacity in the United States Price MovementJinkoSolar s stock has lost 33 3  in a year compared with the  s gain of 37 4   The underperformance may have been caused by stiff competition in the solar market

107765,329280,CSIQ,Are Solar Stocks In Free Fall After China s Subsidy Rate Cut ,opinion,The Chinese government s announcement of a sudden policy makeover on Jun 1  involving a significant cut down in subsidies offered to the nation s solar projects  dealt a major blow to the solar industry worldwide  Since China is the largest solar market in the world  such an upheaval had a rippling effect on the global solar industry    The  industry has declined 10  since the announcement  Not only did the policy reform result in a decline in solar stocks but also prompted analysts to reduce their projections for 2018 solar installations in China Details of the Policy ReformChina s National Development and Reform Commission  NDRC   the Ministry of Finance and the National Energy Administration  NEA  jointly released the 2018 Solar PV Power Generation Notice that might totally change solar market dynamics in China  Per the new policy  feed in tariffs  FiTs  related to utility scale solar projects will be cut and distributed generation  DG  projects will be capped until further notice In terms of utility scale projects  the Chinese administration abolished its deployment target of 13 9 GW and announced that no new projects will be given feed in tariff contracts under the old 2018 rules  However  DG projects that received grid connection till May 31  2018 will be eligible for FiTs  feed in tariffs  In the context of DG programs  China has decided to put a cap of 10 gigawatts  GW  on new solar projects in 2018  down from 19 GW installed in 2017 Analysts  OpinionAnalysts across the globe have expressed their skepticism regarding the latest policy changes through reduction in expectations for the nation s solar projects  Asia Europe Clean Energy  Solar  Advisory  AECEA  lowered its forecast for China s solar capacity addition for 2018 from 40 45 GW to 30 35 GW in response to these policy changes AECEA also lowered its forecast for the remaining years of China s 13th Five Year Plan  2016 20  to 20 25 GW annually  Other analysts like Roth and Daiwa Capital have also reduced the 2018 forecast to 30 35 GW Impact on Chinese Solar StocksThe policy changes are expected to significantly impact Chinese solar panel manufacturers as well as those involved in solar projects in the nation  This is because the cap on solar projects will restrict construction of any new project in the country  while falling panel price will hurt revenues of Chinese panel manufacturers  at least in the near term  Shares of China based solar stocks like Yingli Green Energy   NYSE YGE   have declined 6   while that of ReneSola   NYSE SOL   declined 5  since the news of the policy reform  JinkoSolar   NYSE JKS   has plunged more than 20   in the same time frame Impact on International Solar StocksThis policy change is anticipated to be detrimental for a few international solar stocks  especially the ones that are set to expand their footprint in China   have increased commitments to ship modules or are set to construct new projects  For instance  since the United States slapped a tariff of 30  on import of solar panels earlier this year  many solar players have increased their focus on China s solar market In line with this  Canadian Solar   NASDAQ CSIQ   had earlier announced the shift of its module shipment toward China and away from the United States  It expects to witness significant volume shipment in China during the second quarter of 2018 and beyond  However  with the recent policy change  it is difficult to predict whether the company will be able to duly expand its realm in China  In fact  following the announcement of subsidy cut  this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock suffered a loss of more than 20 7   much more than the industry s decline of 10   You can see  Another renowned solar stock in the international market  First Solar   NASDAQ FSLR   witnessed a steep decline in its share price  after China cut down solar subsidies  However  the rationale behind this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is a bit different  With First Solar being a prominent U S  module manufacturer  a price fall in China may result in a decline in module price in the United States  to compete in the global market  This  in turn  will hurt the company s financials  First Solar s shares have lost 15 8  since the Chinese policy reform news compared with the industry s decline of 10  Is the Policy Reform a Blessing or a Curse The Chinese government has justified the policy makeover decision with the agenda to promote the solar energy sector s sustainable development as well as reduce the  17 billion subsidy bill  that the country is incurring  However  considering the aforementioned discussions  the impositions made in the reform may hurt the solar market  at least in the near future FiTs are the contracted rate that developers get for solar power sent to the grid  Therefore  a cut in the same is likely to directly hit each Chinese solar project s revenue  Moreover  the sudden cap on building solar projects will hit demand in the market  thereby creating oversupply of panels  which in turn will drag down the prices  As per GTM Research  oversupply pressure will likely push panel prices down 32 36   This in turn should wind down revenue generation for solar panel manufacturers  in the near term Nevertheless  the oversupply situation in China along with subsequent fall in panel price may prompt Chinese manufacturers to sell their panels in other booming solar markets like Japan and India  International solar players may also follow suit  So  all might not be lost in terms of global solar market s growth prospect  although only time will reflect the ultimate impact we of the policy reform Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as

three solar power plants in China to Shenzhen Energy Nanjing Holding Co   Ltd  The units have a capacity to generate solar power worth 44 3 Mega Watt peak  MWp  Details of the DealThe deal was closed on Dec 29  2017  Canadian Solar expects the sale to contribute to fourth quarter 2017 revenues  To date  the company has delivered seven solar power plants to Shenzhen Energy Nanjing Holding  which aims at growing its renewable energy assets and producing cleaner air in China Solar Power Prospects in ChinaUnprecedented investments in solar power in the rapidly developing economy of China promise a renewable energy revolution  In 2017  China exceeded its already ambitious plan to install 105 gigawatts  GW  of solar capacity by 2020 as part of its 13th Five Year Plan  forcing administrators to revise the target to 213 GW Of the five largest solar power plants in the world  three are based in China  The country leads the world in terms of installed solar capacity  crossing the 112 GW mark in July 2017 It is to be noted that the drive for solar power is not restricted to large  remote solar installations  Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that rooftop solar will account for as much as 40 GW by 2020 and to the extent of 125 GW by 2040 in China Given the substantial prospects in the Chinese solar market  solar module producers like Canadian Solar are vying to expand their footprint in the country  The latest plant sale to Shenzhen Energy reflects this Meanwhile  not only does Canadian Solar boast strong prospects in China  the company s business is spread across the globe Global FootprintAs renewables will probably replace fossil fuels as a source of electrical power  most utility providers across the globe are gradually shifting away from fossil fuel toward alternative energy  GTM Research s latest  Global Solar Demand Monitor  report states that 13 countries will surpass the 1 GW level of annual PV installations by the end of 2018  With solar being a major growth area in the renewable space  this is clearly a golden era for solar module producers like Canadian Solar Per another report by GTM research  the global solar market will continue grow to annual

to  60 million  to invest in these projects  Notably  the JV will offer funds for the solar projects awarded by Israeli Electricity Authority in accordance to solar power tenders as well as other

Increasing Focus on Solar EnergyAlternative energy sources have been the primary target of utility service providers due to rising concerns regarding the consumption of fossil fuel and the subsequent carbon emission  To make most of the situation  each day more utilities are shifting their focus to generation of alternative energy Though President Trump is directing his focus toward the augmentation of coal industry  it is evident from projections of U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  release that the use of renewable energy  including solar  is going to increase in the United States in next few years  This uptick can be attributed to utility operators  heavy potential investments in clean energy In fact  solar energy has emerged as the most popular one among all other alternative energy owing to its easy availability and declining price of solar panels  According to the EIA  the nation s utility scale solar power capacity will reach 31 gigawatts  GW  by the end of 2018 compared with 22 GW in 2016 The international market for solar power is also expanding rapidly  Per a report from GTM Research  the global solar market will hit 85 GW in 2017  nearly

107837,329352,CSIQ,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  JinkoSolar Holding  JA Solar Holdings And Canadian Solar,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 25  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Semiconductors  including JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd   NYSE   NYSE JKS       JA Solar Holdings  Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ JASO      and Canadian Solar Inc   NASDAQ   NASDAQ CSIQ      Industry  Alternative Energy  Part 1Link  The global growth of renewable energy is increasingly driven by voluntary procurement by utilities and corporations due to declining costs of solar and wind technologies  and anticipation of a more carbon constrained future The U S  renewable energy industry has witnessed significant growth over the last several years  The implementation of a number of important decisions in 2015 by both state and federal governments further fueled its growth and continues to drive the sector  Throughout 2016  companies in the renewable energy space successfully battled against energy generated from fossil fuels in power markets and for procuring contracts across the U S  and across the globe A U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   report projects total renewables used in the electric power sector to increase 44  in 2018  Electricity generation from hydropower is expected to be relatively unchanged at 7  between 2016 and 2018  Generation from renewables other than hydropower is forecast to rise 9  in 2017 and 10  in 2018 Notably  renewable energy significantly benefits the environment as well as the economy  In addition to lowering carbon emissions  alternative sources of energy improve public health  create jobs and provide other economic benefits  Moreover  these sources of energy reduce the requirement of water for power production  offering a major advantage over fossil fuels  Offsetting these positives are the additional costs that are incurred by traditional energy sources to fully account for their environmental externalities A comprehensive study by the Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory  NREL  shows that renewables will contribute more than 80  of total electricity generation in the U S  by 2050  compared with the present level of 30   The need of the hour is the development of an electricity grid to withstand higher volumes of renewable energy and advanced grid planning to maintain reliability To this end  governments  businesses and cities around the world are making concerted efforts to speed up the evolution of energy use  With global energy system transformation being the backbone of climate action  the world has come closer under a set of major cooperative initiatives  It is these environmental considerations that are driving demand for alternative energy sources While these favorable demand trends have been boosting the growth prospects of this space  the abundant availability of fossil fuels and dearth of adequate investment in solar companies have emerged as key competitive challenges  Although the industry s long term fundamentals remain favorable  the policies of the Trump administration  like signing an order to repeal the Clean Power Plan and its decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement  are expected to hit the clean energy space  Given these challenges  growth in 2017 is expected to slow down Here  we discuss some of the major alternative energy sources SolarA major growth area in the renewable space is solar energy  An EIA report indicates continued growth in utility scale solar power capacity by almost 44  from 22 GW at the end of 2016  The projected increase will bring the amount of solar capacity to 29 GW at 2017 end and to 32 GW at 2018 end  In spite of the rapid uptake  solar will still constitute just 1  of total U S  utility scale generation in 2018  indicating immense scope for growth Solar growth has historically been concentrated in customer sited distributed generation installations  The EIA expects utility scale solar capacity to expand in states like California  Nevada  North Carolina  Texas and Georgia The solar industry in the U S  is booming  The solar Investment Tax Credit   ITC   has gone a long way in providing the industry stability and expansion  In the last 10 years  solar has witnessed a compound annual growth rate of almost 60   with the cost of installation dropping by over 70

107888,329403,CSIQ,U S  Walks Out Of Paris Climate Accord  Stocks To Win Lose,opinion,"President Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement last Thursday  compounding the woes of the clean energy industry  It s ironic  given the announcement was made just a few days prior to today   World Environment Day  
Trump s walkout decision in his controversial speech clearly reflected his long proclaimed belief that climate change is a  Chinese hoax  
The startling announcement came as a major blow to not only the environment advocates across the other 195 nations of the Paris settlement  but also heads of states of his own nation  along with members of the President s own staff 
Many fear that whatever progress the U S  made last year toward pollution mitigation and renewable assets expansion  in accord with the Paris agreement  will now go in vain  Under the accord  the U S  had pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 26  28  below 2005 levels by 2025  In fact  the agreement was signed largely on account of a preliminary understanding between the U S  and China   the two largest carbon emitting nations 
With the U S  pulling out at present  China and other countries like India will get increased opportunities in leading the clean energy space  which means that their companies will get a boost in the growing and competitive green economy 
Coming back to the announcement  Trump s claim that the contract would be a job killer for Americans  holds no valid authentication  The statistics he cited in favor of his decision  related to job recession as a result of this agreement  has been opposed by the majority   On the contrary  with green economy on the rise  jobs of the future are in renewables  Had the U S  stayed in the Paris accord  it would have undoubtedly gained from these developments 
It is clear that employees in renewable energy space like solar  wind and natural gas would be adversely affected by the decision  According to the U S  Department of Energy  3 million Americans work in clean energy at present  a number that would be threatened by the Paris pullout 
In January  the Energy Department released a report on energy and employment that showed that over 370 000 people were employed in the solar industry compared with 86 000 workers in the coal industry  It is conclusive that despite Trump s enthusiastic efforts to push and revive the coal industry  the future of the nation lies is in the hands of the renewable industry 
Nevertheless  for the time being  renewable companies   in particular solar stocks   will be the ones affected by the decision  Meanwhile  coal stocks are expected to gain the most

107899,329414,CSIQ,Renesola  SOL  Connects 180MW Solar Rooftop Grids In China,opinion,"Renesola Ltd    NYSE SOL   recently announced that it has successfully completed grid connection of solar rooftop projects worth more than 180 megawatts  MW   in China  According to this solar project developer  projects with the capacity of more than 170 MW will provide power to the utility grid under the Feed in Tariff of  0 14 kWh  RMB 0 98  kilowatt hours  
Notably  the company has set a target of installing more than 300 MW of solar rooftop projects in China by end of this year  Renesola has already achieved more than half of its target 
We believe that these successful grid connections will enable Renesola to benefit from the enormous potential prevalent in the markets of China 
China s Focus on Solar Power
According to Bloomberg  China s output from photovoltaic plants went up as much as 80  within the first quarter of 2017 
While President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate pact in May 2017  countries like China and India stated that they will continue with their efforts to reduce pollution by focusing on renewable power  Within the first three months of 2017  China s solar power generation touched a high of 21 4 billion kilowatt hours  The country plans to continue adding more solar power to its portfolio in the future  thereby attracting solar module providers like ReneSola to expand their business in there 
The Current Scenario in Solar Industry
According to experts  renewable energy is the solution for increasing demand for power supply in the world  Although  thermal energy remains a top choice when it comes to power generation  it causes considerable damage to the environment  Therefore  more utility service providers are shifting their focus towards renewable energy 
Apart from nullifying the usefulness of renewable sources  Trump directed his focus toward the augmentation of the coal industry  This in turn affected the U S  solar companies  Relaxation of environmental regulations worsened the scenario  In fact  shares of some major solar players  including SunPower   NASDAQ SPWR    Canadian Solar   NASDAQ CSIQ   and First Solar   NASDAQ FSLR   nosedived when Trump decided to leave the Paris climate agreement 
Though the strict environmental restrictions like the Clean Power Plan are being lifted from the utility service providers  most companies are still investing in increasing their renewable portfolio  This is because renewable is the future of energy production  Any investment in coal fueled plants might not go well with the future government policies 
With the U S  out of the scenario  large economies of the Asia Pacific region like China  Japan and India are currently offering a large market for expansion of solar power  The recently accomplished grid connections are an example of the same  Since ReneSola is based in China  we can expect it to make more solar installations in the country  going forward 
Price Movement
In the last one month  ReneSola s shares lost 1 1  compared with the Zacks categorized  Industry s gain of 11 6  

The company faces tough competition from the U S  Solar power manufacturers who are still getting the benefit of tax credit  Additionally  the external module shipments by the company for the first quarter of 2017 declined 23 9  year over year  These factors might have been the reason behind the company s underperformance

Axiom Capital analyst Gordon Johnson    upgraded First Solar from a  Hold  to a  Buy  and upped its price target to  51 per share on Wednesday   Given that we believe First Solar is selling modules at   50 to   60  and we are hearing rumblings that they are sold out through the third quarter of 2018   Johnson told  
 We believe the company is going to show potentially significant upside to consensus estimates  which have not changed dramatically  
On the back of this upgrade  First Solar jumped 3 5  in morning trading  The solar energy company hasn t quite reached its 52 week high  but it is now rests at its highest point so far this year  First Solar is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy 
The company  which builds large scale photovoltaic  PV  power stations  is set to report earnings on August 2 
Bright Future 
Elsewhere in the solar industry  China invested heavily in solar energy last year and is set to continue this trend going forward  The country installed   and China reportedly added 18 GW of additional solar energy in the second quarter of this year alone 
On that note  Jinko Solar   NYSE JKS   is one of the biggest solar energy movers so far today  up 9 13  
Negative estimate revisions have sent the stock down to a Zack Rank  5  Strong Sell   but fresh activity in China could spur new momentum  with shares of Jinko Solar skyrocketing this month 
All of this solar investment has helped China become the biggest renewable energy investor on the planet  According to a recent   which focused on a massive former Chinese coal mine that is now a lake with 166 000 floating solar panels  the Chinese government has set its sights on spending  360 billion on clean energy by 2020  The push will reportedly help create 13 million new jobs 
Other Asian powerhouses are getting in on the action too  For example   it is set to debut its first ever solar powered train  which will reportedly save roughly 21 000 liters of diesel fuel every year 
However  what might prove to be better news for investors in the States is that the U S  has also invested heavily in this sector 
In the U S   14 6 gigawatts worth of new solar energy projects were installed last year  which proved to be a record setting year   and a massive jump from the 7 5 GW installed in 2015 
Today  in Miami  Florida it was announced that in South Miami new homes will soon be required to be built with solar panels   the first such mandate in the state  The ordinance will also affect select home renovations as well 
 Solar reduces the cost of home ownership  it makes houses sell faster  it returns more to a builder  it makes local jobs  and most importantly  it reduces carbon emissions today to help our children and grandchildren have a better future tomorrow   South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard

107940,329455,CSIQ,Clean Energy Stock Canadian Solar Breakout Candidate In 2017,opinion,"Canadian Solar Inc  NASDAQ CSIQ  is a small cap clean energy stock trading on the Nasdaq  It has a market cap of  800M 
The stock closed today 0 07  higher  In April 2017  though it went up 15  
The company offers photovoltaic energy solutions across the globe 
Interestingly  the  rallied sharply in 2013 on the prospects of a booming industry  However  since early 2014  the sector stabilized and started a significant retracement  Some clean energy stocks lost even 70   and CSIQ is no exception to that 
Right now  InvestingHaven s research team is hinting at Canadian Solar as a potential breakout candidate for 2017  for two reasons 
First  the stock is consolidating for several months now  It has set a higher low  It starts looking solid  That is a pattern not really seen before  The proverbial cherish on the cake is the coming breakout attempt outside of the falling channel 
Second  the financials of the company seem to stabilize as well  After the revenue of the company fell last year  the last 2 quarters are stable  The small loss in the recent quarter is a small concern  There is sufficient cash in the company 
The relatively high short float ratio  15   is not good  but if a breakout occurs we expect that ratio to come down sharply triggering a strong rally 
All in all  we believe the prospects of this industry and the company are solid ",2017-04-27,Taki Tsaklanos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/clean-energy-stock-canadian-solar-breakout-candidate-in-2017-200185454,200185454

108009,329524,CSIQ,Can Solar Manufacturers Fight Panel Oversupply ,opinion,"Manufacturers of solar panels who have raised their production levels are now being confronted by a massive buildup of excess supply  Several major manufacturers have recently increased production to a point that it would boost global capacity substantially  They are now being forced to respond appropriately to the situation or face serious repercussions 
Oversupply Looms over Industry
Among the major suppliers of panels that have raised production levels are the likes of Canadian Solar Inc    NASDAQ CSIQ   Trina Solar Ltd    NYSE TSL   and JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd    NYSE JKS    These companies as well as other panel producers are competing to set up even larger state of the art facilities that can provide panels at a faster pace as well as at a cheaper price 
However  demand is expected to drop almost as soon as they begin to emerge from production lines  This is particularly true for China where subsidies for such products were removed in July  As a result  prices are plummeting and consequently  margins are expected to fall  This is not new for an industry which witnessed the fall of several major players around five years ago following a state of global oversupply 
Fallout of China s Subsidy Cut
In China  the government has cut subsidies for solar farms which commenced operations after Jun 30  The smaller quantum of subsidy could lead falling shipments and reductions in production levels  For instance  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co  Ltd    NYSE YGE   has said that it expects shipments to decline by 54  in the third quarter as a result of these developments 
Of course  the situation is not as dire as it seems  Solar demand is increasing  but growth has been falling  According to New Energy Finance  global solar production facilities will have a capacity of 67 gigawatts by this year  a year over year increase of 27   Capacity is expected to increase by 25  in 2017 and by 23  in 2018 
However  it is difficult to say whether supply has exceeded demand already  This is because data to support or dispute such an inference will not be reported by companies until the fourth quarter  However  plummeting panel prices indicate that this has indeed occurred 
How Will Producers Fight Oversupply 
Canadian Solar has already said it is changing its expansion plans  The panel maker will expand capacity by only 5 8 gigawatts  instead of the earlier target of 6 4 gigawatts  On its conference call in August  the company s CEO mentioned plans to  play safe  this year and look toward improving margins instead 
At this point  it is difficult to predict how long such a situation of oversupply may last  According to some estimates  this could last over a period for as long as two years  It seems it all depends on how companies react to this phenomenon  If they engage in a race to raise capacity  consequences will follow  A watchful approach seems to be best suited to such a situation

108012,329527,CSIQ,Will Solar ETFs Suffer From Panel Oversupply ,opinion,"Oversupply of solar panels was largely responsible for dragging down solar ETFs in recent times  Latest data showed that healthy growth in solar panel production and weakening demand created excess supply in the industry  which negatively impacted panel manufacturers  The producers are now considering different ways to combat the glut 
Dwindling Demand for Solar Panels
Despite  like higher panel installations  a shift to fossil fuel free energy sources by most countries to protect the environment and the U S  tax credit extension  solar companies suffered in the first half of this year  Moreover  sluggish demand in the second largest economy in the world had a negative impact on their performance  While China witnessed 22 gigawatts of installations during the first half of this year  panel installations are speculated to be between 6 and 8 gigawatts in the second half  read    
The situation is likely to worsen further after the Chinese government opted to reduce subsidies on solar panel installations  The government has cut subsidies for solar farms  which commenced operations after Jun 30  Panel manufacturers speculate that this may have a negative impact on panel demand  While the biggest solar panel manufacturer  Trina Solar Ltd    NYSE TSL   recently forecast that shipments may fall 6 5  in the ongoing quarter  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co  Ltd    NYSE YGE   expects shipments to decline 54  during the quarter 
Though recent data showed that demand is increasing  the pace of growth is decelerating  According to   global solar production facilities will have a capacity of 67 gigawatts by this year  a year over year increase of 27   Capacity is expected to increase 25  in 2017 and 23  in 2018  read    
Supply Continue to Increase
As per New Energy Finance  rising output is expected to boost global capacity by 18  in 2016  Major producers including Canadian Solar Inc    NASDAQ CSIQ    Trina Solar and JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd    NYSE JKS   have raised production levels  While Trina Solar recently raised its production capacity by 7 1   Canadian Solar   the second largest panel producer   is in a process to launch a 350 megawatt factory in Brazil 
These oversupply concerns led solar panel manufacturers to come up with some measures to combat the same  For instance  Canadian Solar has already said it is changing its expansion plans  The panel maker will expand capacity by only 5 8 gigawatts  instead of the earlier target of 6 4 gigawatts  On its conference call in August  the company s CEO mentioned plans to  play safe  this year and look toward improving margins instead

Commentary


 Given the deteriorating technicals going into this oversold period   chronicled over and over again in previous days and weeks   I think trading conditions are actually even more dangerous than they were during the August Angst 
Astute traders will notice a particularly dangerous pattern that has developed in the S P 500  a potential double top  The double top is messy but it is reinforced by the index s stubborn insistence on trading just below the last all time closing high set in May for three months until all heck broke loose in the August Angst  The rally off the subsequent W bottom and oversold trading conditions decisively ended just short of the all time high twice  both times in November  So  the stock market is oversold but dangerous  sure it should bounce from round current levels  but the upside prospects are limited 
A retest of that W bottom seems a near lock in the coming weeks or months  Again  because December is typically a mild month when it comes to maximum drawdowns  I am assuming a massive plunge is not in the cards for this month  


This is what I wrote on December 11th as the last oversold period began  I titled the T2108 Update  Oversold But Dangerous  because the technical health of the market looked so poor going into the oversold period  I feel nearly the same going into this latest oversold period  T2108 closed at 17 1   T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200 day moving averages  DMAs  is starting this oversold period at 19 5   even lower than the start of the last oversold period and a 3 month low  Most importantly  the S P 500  N SPY  is also at a 3 month low 


More than ever  a top seems to be set for a while in the S P 500  SPY   Too much technical damage has occurred n the way to the latest breakdown 

The volatility index  the VIX  closed at 25 0  The VIX has not closed this high since September 28th  The increasing fear is appropriate as  adds a fresh element of trading uncertainty and instability in market sentiment 


The Shanghai Composite continues a very bearish breakdown 


For the third time in two months  the 15 35 pivot has served as a launching pad for a surge in volatility 

I went into this oversold period already holding a first tranche of one of my favorite trades on an oversold period  call options on ProShares Ultra S P500  N SSO   Once T2108 dropped below 20   I doubled down on those call options  Earlier in the day  I sold my call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  N UVXY  as UVXY started fading from the open  It was up about 9  at that point  UVXY closed the day with a 22  gain  dang   After selling my UVXY call options  I bought shares in my other favorite play on oversold conditions  ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  SVXY  


I was fooled by UVXY s early inability to hold the opening gap up 


ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  N SVXY  closed at a fresh 2 1 2 year low  However  note how little time SVXY spends trading below the lower Bollinger Band once oversold conditions begin 

The stock market is full of broken down stocks now  I could spend the rest of the weekend posting the charts and barely scratch the surface  Even the leaders are getting hammered pretty good  For example  Amazon com  O AMZN  is breaking down sharply below its 50DMA  Even during the August Angst and subsequent sell offs  AMZN spent a maximum of TWO days selling off below the 50DMA  It is starting to look like the last all time high was a big fake out  When it occurred  I thought it invalidated the topping pattern I pointed out in mid December  AMZN has not closed lower since the company reported October earnings 


Even the mighty are crumbling  Amazon com  AMZN  breaks down sharply below 50DMA  uptrending  support 

When the big leaders like AMZN look toppy  I think it is fair to call the stock market  dangerous   As a reminder  this means I am shortening the duration of my trades on oversold conditions  I am also more willing to consider NEW short positions when T2108 is approaching  but NOT below  the 20  oversold threshold and the setup makes technical sense  Moreover  with China s trading chaos  I held onto more bearish positions than my T2108 trading rules recommend 

Solar was the darling this week for a hot minute  Goldman Sachs upgraded First Solar  O FSLR  and sent the stock soaring  I patiently waited for the next entry point  It came in the form of a quick reversal of that gap up  I bought a single call option because too many technicals are now breaking down for solar stocks 


First Solar  FSLR  reverses the good vibes from Goldman Sachs  N GS  but the 20DMA uptrend is holding for now 


The 200DMA breakout for Canadian Solar Inc  O CSIQ  has come to a quick end  The high volume 50DMA breakdown looks a bit ominous 


SolarCity Corporation  O SCTY  has been under new pressure ever since Chanos confirmed he has stayed short the stock even through the recent run up  The close below 200DMA support has reversed the incremental gains from December 16th s oil export alt energy deal 


Guggenheim Solar  N TAN  reminds me that the  average  solar stock is NOT doing well  Today s 9  drop takes the solar ETF right back toward 2 1 2 year lows 

I am finally throwing up the white flag on iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  O IBB   IBB ALMOST fulfilled my prediction of a complete reversal of the  Clinton Bash   Three times since last November  IBB closed above the low of that fateful day  The latest fall from that level features a very nasty  and I daresay  bearish 50DMA breakdown  I will be watching IBB closely to see whether it can emerge from oversold trading conditions in a healthier technical position 


After failing to fully reverse the loss from the Clinton Bash  iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  now looks ready to challenge recent lows 

And then there is Caterpillar  N CAT   My favorite hedge on bullishness plunged back to a post earnings low  Recall that my fistful of put options on CAT was my first bearish position to close on the selling that began the new year  dang  


Caterpillar  CAT  looks set to resume the sell off that was in place going into October earnings 

I will end on a good note  My play this week on Wal Mart  N WMT  is going amazingly well  I bought a long term call option  However  with the stock up almost 10  from my entry point in just days  I find myself sitting on an 84  gain  If no new news comes out Friday to explain this strengthening  I will just lock in the profits and look for the next entry point 


Is Amazon com money flowing to Wal Mart    The bounce off 50DMA support is getting almost parabolic relative to the upper Bollinger Band  BB

108102,329617,CSIQ,SolarCity s Light Is Fading Fast,opinion,"SolarCity Corporation  NASDAQ SCTY  wants to change the way Americans obtain electricity  So far  this goal has been extremely unprofitable  and the future profit outlook remains clouded  Nonetheless  SCTY is up over 300  since it IPO d in 2012 and receives a 4 star rating from Morningstar  Widening losses in an uncertain industry and an expensive valuation lands SolarCity in the Danger Zone this week 
Another Profitless  Growing  Company
The perception of SolarCity benefits from the increased awareness and emphasis the United States is placing on alternative energy  including solar  However  this increased awareness has not led to increased profits  Since 2012  SolarCity s after tax profit  NOPAT  has fallen from   66 million to   300 million in 2014  When including quarterly results through 2015  NOPAT has fallen even further to   404 million on a trailing twelve month  TTM  basis 
Figure 1  Negative Profits Only Getting Worse

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
SolarCity s profitability issues manifest in the company s declining NOPAT margins  which have fallen to an alarming  135  on a TTM basis  While revenues have grown 41  compounded annually since 2012  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs have grown 85  and 79  compounded annually  respectively  Essentially  the cost of attracting new customers and hiring more workers has far outpaced revenues 
Furthermore  SolarCity has a bottom quintile return on invested capital  ROIC  of  10   which has fallen every year since the company went public in 2012 
SolarCity Faces Competition From Numerous Angles
Incumbent energy providers  other alternative energy sources  and other solar panel providers and installers all pose significant competition to SolarCity  Per Figure 2  despite being one of the largest players in the solar industry  SolarCity earns a ROIC well below other solar companies and even below NRG Energy  NYSE NRG   a traditional utility that SolarCity identifies as a direct competitor 
Ultimately  the ability to compete in the energy industry will be predicated on cost control  With profit margins already well below the competition  becoming profitable looks to be a big struggle for SolarCity 
Figure 2  SolarCity is No Shining Light
 Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Capital Intensive Business Model Adds Risk 
SolarCity operates in a market that is extremely capital intensive  and one in which positive returns on invested capital may not materialize for years to come  if at all  Making matters worse  the company fronts the initial cost of the solar panels  and then either leases them back to the customer over 20 years or provides the customer with a 30 year loan 
This business model leaves SolarCity with the task of servicing and maintaining these panels for the next three decades  Defaults on loans and changes in technology could greatly lower the value of SCTY because the company risks holding large uncollectable loan balances or potentially outdated or useless solar panels 
Changing Government Regulations and Investigations Add Risk 
The Solar Investment Tax Credit  ITC  is a 30  tax credit for solar systems  which is set to fall to only 10  at the end of 2016  Industry analysis has shown that after the ITC steps down  only 3 out of 20 studied states will have solar power costs below that of traditional electricity rates  With a republican controlled congress  the likelihood of an extension of the ITC appears low  SolarCity has used this tax credit not only to generate revenue by selling it to investors  but also to lower the price it charges customers 
Apart from the possibility that SolarCity s product may not be economically feasible if the ITC isn t extended  the company faces many other legal issues  In 2012  the Inspector General of the U S  Treasury and Department of Justice opened an investigation into whether SolarCity  among other solar companies   to receive a higher tax credit and Treasury grant  No decision has been made but if the Inspector General determined that misrepresentations were made  SolarCity could face damages that would materially affect the liquidity and operations of the business  One study  around 28  higher than other companies from 2007 2011 
Bull Case Hopes Are Already Priced In
The bull case for SolarCity rests on many large assumptions  First  bulls tout the huge value of future revenues   7 billion  SolarCity will receive from customer payments currently under contract  Management discounts the payments to arrive a their present value  called  retained value   which is presented as a  better metric  to value the company  Not surprisingly  this  retained value  shows SolarCity to be in much better standing than the true cash flows of the business  which remain negative 
The first problem with this retained value is that it is based on a discount rate of 6  while we measure the firm s weighted average cost of capital  WACC  at over 9   With rising interests rates and the need for additional capital moving forward  a 6  discount rate seems generous  Second  25  of the  retained value  is built upon the assumption that 90  of customers will renew their leases  which last 20 years  for an additional 10 years upon the initial expiration 
Another key to the bull case is SolarCity s goal to achieve a cost per watt of  2 50 by 2017  This metric represents the installation  general and administrative  and sales cost to deploy one watt of power  Cost per watt conveniently excludes SG A stock based compensation expenses  Achieving this cost per watt would allow SolarCity to provide competitive energy rates even without the ITC  However  this goal is no sure bet  despite what the valuation of SCTY implies  Since 3Q14  cost per watt has increased to 2 91 from  2 89  This increase can be attributed to installation cost declines being offset by SolarCity s SG A costs  As the company ramps up efforts to increase revenues  it s unlikely these SG A costs  and overall cost per watt  will reach the stated goal 
Lastly  bulls point to new forms of energy storage  such as Tesla s home battery  as another reason to like the prospects of SolarCity  With a  3000 price tag in addition to the solar panels  there remains little evidence that energy storage will make solar panels any more attractive  However  as we ll show below  achieving the best case scenario for just about every element of the bull case is already baked into the stock price 
Stupid Money  Buyout  Risk
Because of their large market share  34  in 2014  of the solar industry  SolarCity could attract attention as a buyout candidate from traditional energy providers or even technology firms  SunEdison  NYSE SUNE  recently acquired Vivint Solar  NYSE VSLR    which was the second largest solar installer in 2014   for  2 2 billion  However  with no profits and over  2 1 billion in debt we find it hard to fathom a suitor for SolarCity would surface at its current price 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
We made several adjustments to SolarCity s 2014 reported financials 
Income Statement  We make  395 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  245 million of unusual income  96  of revenue   We remove  75 million related to non operating expenses and  320 million in non operating income  The largest adjustment is the removal of  319 million of income related to losses attributable to non controlling interests 
Balance Sheet  We make  1 1 billion worth of balance sheet adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  716 million  The largest adjustment is the removal of  883 million due to midyear acquisitions  This adjustment represents 22  of reported net assets 
Valuation  We make four adjustments for a net decrease of  2 7 billion  There are no value increasing adjustments  The largest adjustment to shareholder value is the removal of  597 million related to the fair value of minority interests  These liabilities represent 12  of SolarCity s current market cap 
Valuation Is Out of Reach  Even in Best Light
As it stands  SolarCity has a NOPAT margin of  135  on a TTM basis and gross margins around 42  in 2Q15  Assuming the ITC is extended and SolarCity is able to maintain gross margins  to earn a positive NOPAT margin the company must drastically lower its sales and marketing expenses  which undermines customer growth potential going forward 
Nevertheless  if we assume a best case scenario and SolarCity achieves a NOPAT margin of 20   higher than the 15  average of electric utility companies   the company would have to continue growing revenue by 40  compounded annually for the next 10 years  This scenario implies SolarCity s revenue growth would continue unabated by the cuts in SG A and reach  7 billion within a decade 
However  in a more likely  and still optimistic scenario  one in which the ITC is not extended and SolarCity sees its gross margins take a hit  the valuation is even more alarming  If SolarCity can achieve a 15  NOPAT margin  equal to utility companies but still higher than competitors CSIQ  FLSR  SPWR  and grow revenues by 30  compounded annually for the next 10 years  the stock is only worth  9 share today   an 82  downside 
Any NOPAT margin below 15  returns a negative equity value in our DCF model  It s hard to argue how SolarCity s business operations justify its current share price 
Loss of Tax Credit and Cost Per Watt Miss Will Push Shares Downward
We see two particular events that could propel SCTY down in the near future  First  if the ITC is not extended  investors may question the feasibility and competitiveness of the SolarCity business model  In turn  expect SCTY to decline when the expected ITC step down becomes reality  Second  if SolarCity s cost per watt rises again  or even if it decreases but at a slower rate  we believe shares will move lower as the market realizes the assumptions baked into the current stock price are overly optimistic and not likely to be met 
Short Interest is Very High
Short interest stands at 23 million shares  or 24  of shares outstanding  The market has certainly recognized the potential for downside risk in SCTY 
Heavy Insider Selling  Not Much Buying
In the past 12 months  the stock is down 28  as insiders have sold 13 million shares and bought only 1 8 million shares  for a net of 11 2 million shares sold or 12  of all shares outstanding 
Executive Compensation Not Based On Profits
SolarCity executives  aside from their annual salaries  are paid largely in the form of stock options  These stock options are granted based upon a performance objective specific to each executive  These performance objectives relate to total megawatts deployed  cost per watt  customer growth  and even  financial operations efficiency   These objectives are also used in the determination of annual cash bonuses  Rather than paying executives over  38 million  aggregate fair value of equity awards  last year  we suggest SolarCity pay executives based on more shareholder friendly criteria  like profits

108104,329619,CSIQ,Sellers Maintain Control Of Stock Market ,opinion,"T2108 Status  6 1 T2107 Status  15 5 VIX Status  36 0 General  Short term  Trading Call  BullishActive T2108 periods  Day  3 below 20   oversold   Day  4 under 30   Day  27 under 40   Day  67 under 50   Day  84 under 60   Day  283 under 70 

The sellers kept up the pressure yesterday  Futures were notably weak before the open  Yet  buyers showed up in time to gap the market up in a move that COULD have confirmed an oversold bottom  Instead  the sellers immediately moved to retake control  and the ball rolled all downhill from there  T2108 closed at a fresh low of 6 1  

How low will T2108 go 

The S P 500 closed for a loss for the 6th straight day  and below the lower Bollinger Band  for an amazing 4th straight day 
The sellers remained strong  as they were able to press the S P 500 for a fourth straight day below its lower Bollinger Band  BB   The index lost 11 2  over six straight days of selling  Whenever the buyers return to bring some balance  the resultant rally is likely to be very impressive 

Here is a chart of the NASDAQ  NASDAQ QQQ  for additional context  The tech heavy index closed with a fractional loss only because Monday s low  and open  were so incredibly  and unbelievably  deep  The NASDAQ has lost 11 5  in six days of selling 

Little consolation as the NASDAQ s selling did not create a new low 
According to the rules I laid out previously  there were no trades to make no matter your risk preference  The VIX managed to trade perfectly between the previous high and low  As a reminder  a break to a new high gets aggressive traders buying  Less aggressive buyers wait until the VIX CLOSES below a previous low 

The volatility index swung through a wide range but stayed  in bounds  
This action translated into large moves in the volatility products  ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE SVXY  plunged into the close  while ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY  put on a rare display of resilience 

ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  SVXY  was crushed again as an initial rally quickly faded 


ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  UVXY  reached again for its 200DMA downtrend 
Although the trading rules did not trigger  I did execute three key trades 

With T2108 oversold  I set at least one limit order for call options on ProShares Ultra S P500  NYSE SSO  at a low ball price to catch a plunge while I am not monitoring the stock market  Surprisingly  my low ball offer of the day triggered near the close  I guess it makes sense given the rush of selling  Again  I strongly preferred at this stage of the oversold period to buy additional positions when the VIX was surging to new heights 

The second trade was on shares of ProShares Short VIX Short Term Futures  SVXY   The plunge into the close looked so much like panic that I could not resist buying back into SVXY for the next short term swing  This is even more speculative than usual given the VIX did not print a new high 

Finally  the third trade was a two for one on solar stocks Canadian Solar  NASDAQ CSIQ  and First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   I included CSIQ in my shopping list of stocks on the first oversold day because I concluded the stock was  ridiculously  oversold  I took a risk and bought as CSIQ faded to close the opening gap up  I wish I had CSIQ on the list for Monday s plunge    I set a tight limit order to sell at  18 since I am already holding call options  Fortunately  the stock proceeded to rally straight up and took out my price target in short order  After CSIQ  I took a look at FSLR and decided to jump back into my favorite solar stock with call options 

Unfortunately  both CSIQ and FSLR hit walls later in the day along with the market  and ended up closing at their lows  FSLR was turned back from resistance at its 50DMA  CSIQ has a chart commonly seen in the market right now  a gap down and a rally on Monday  a gap up and a fade on Tuesday   almost a  sloppy  abandoned baby bottom except the upside showed too little conviction  The battle between bears and bulls  sellers and buyers is just getting warm 

Canadian Solar  CSIQ  struggled  like so many stocks  to pick itself up and out of deeply oversold conditions in what ALMOST looked like an abandoned baby bottom 
Here is what a proper abandoned baby bottom looks like  from   


Nison   A very rare Japanese candlestick top or bottom reversal signal  It is comprised of a doji star that gaps away  including shadows  from the prior and following sessions  candlesticks  This is the same as a Western island top or bottom in which the island session is also a doji  


Me  An abandoned baby bottom  traps  bears and sellers on the second day  These sellers assumed the big gap down confirmed the bearishness of the selling on the first day 

Finally  finally a nod to China s increasing woes with this  from a Canadian network followed by chart showing the on going collapse of the Shanghai Composite Index  SSEC  

The Chinese government lost control of the Shanghai Composite Index as it continued to collapse from its 200DMA breakdown  This reversed a gain that was as high as 59  for 2015

108105,329620,CSIQ,4 Solar Stocks Set To Rise,opinion,"November 16  2015 was a strange trading day as U S  stock markets rallied in the wake of the horrific terrorist attacks in Paris  There were really big moves in even some big cap stocks  The S P 500  N SPY  reversed all of its losses on Friday and then some 


The S P 500  SPY  bounces back in impressive fashion 
This is the strong and supportive context in which I am noting some particularly interesting setups for solar stocks  First Solar  O FSLR   SunPower Corporation  O SPWR   Canadian Solar Inc  O CSIQ   and Hanwha Q Cells Co Ltd  O HQCL  

FSLR looks like it has successfully retested support at its 200 day moving average  DMA   Conveniently  this test also happens to coincide with a near complete reversal of a post earnings gap up  FSLR is my favorite setup given its 200DMA is starting to trend upward 


First Solar  FSLR  bounces off support
SunPower  SPWR  gained 2 6  on the day but closed just below its 50DMA  Given this trendline has started to turn upward  I will get bullish on SPWR if it manages to close above the 50DMA  A break below Monday s intraday low will be very bearish and suggest that resistance at the 50DMA is confirmed  Moreover  such a break will confirm the invalidation of the bullish post earnings gap up from last month  Finally  the confirmed resistance at the 200DMA is a note of caution on a rally 

SunPower  SPWR  sold off sharply after failing to break down resistance at its 200DMA
Like its solar cousins  Canadian Solar  CSIQ  completely reversed gains from its last earnings report  Unlike its cousins  CSIQ held its gains for only a brief period after the post earnings open  The subsequent selling has been more shallow  perhaps because buyers had not over committed from post earnings giddiness  I liked Monday s bounce off the lows because it seems to validate the 50DMA as support  I like CSIQ for a potential extended rally after it first closes higher 

Canadian Solar  CSIQ  tries to stop the post earnings bleeding with a bounce above 50DMA support
I earlier wrote about Solar City has a play off a pivot point  The road to earnings eventually killed that nice pattern  The post earnings sell off confirmed the end of that pivot trade  Two straight days of high volume SEEM to have finally delivered a tradeable bottom  The obvious caveat on SCTY is that famous short seller Jim Chanos has publicly recommended shorting the stock  I am also VERY wary of stocks that can fail so dramatically after an insider makes a major purchase of shares  A new low is a clear point for creating a stop loss 

Solar City attempts a revival 
Hanwha Q CELLS Co   HQCL  is a bonus stock  The stock is thinly traded  but I like the chart as an example of the potential power of chart setups  HQCL has converging 50 and 200DMAs  On Friday  the stock bounced perfectly off 50DMA support on particularly low trading volume  Technicians know this pattern as a doji that represents a stalemate between buyers and sellers  Monday s 15 2  surge resolved the stalemate in favor of buyers  The now rising 50DMA now looks like solid support  HQCL reports earnings on November 19th  so I strongly suspect this surge is related to some pre earnings speculation  I could not find any other explanatory news  With only 47 527 shares traded on the day  it is clearly easy for a few big traders to generate a massive move 

Thinly traded Hanwha Q CELLS Co   Ltd   HQCL  makes a fat statement with a picture perfect surge off 50DMA support 
There is one huge caveat looming over all these setups  The solar ETF  Guggenheim Solar  N TAN   still looks awful  While TAN has not violated the double bottom from August and Ooctber  it is still well below resistance at its 50DMA  Its 20DMA has started to turn downward again  In other words  my select list of solar stocks are mostly part of a special breed  The good news is a retest of TAN s 50DMA resistance will surely provide some fuel for rallies for the strongest solar stocks of the bunch 

Guggenheim Solar ETF  TAN  has a long way to go to confirm a solid double bottom

108108,329623,CSIQ,Follow Up To Bullish Solar Setups,opinion,"Almost two weeks ago  I described some bullish setups on solar stocks  Here is a quick update on those setups and related trades 
First Solar  Picture Perfect Setup
First Solar  O FSLR  is a picture perfect setup from 200 day moving average  DMA  support  I sold my call options into the rally that stalled a little on the shortened trading day on Friday  FSLR is still my favorite solar stock  so I will be scoping it for the next short term entry point 

First Solar  FSLR  rallies successfully off 200DMA support 
SunPower Corporation  Churn Continues Below Resistance
 SunPower  O SPWR  is still struggling to trigger a bullish setup  It continues to churn just below resistance at its 50DMA  SPWR is now a short if it manages to close below  22  the recent low  I am still looking for a bullish breakout above the 50DMA 

SunPower  SPWR  continues to struggle below its 50DMA resistance 
Canadian Solar  Short term Upside Potential
Canadian Solar  O CSIQ  is a picture perfect setup at 50DMA support  I never made a trade on this one  CSIQ still has sort term upside potential to at least 24  A new post earnings high would be very bullish  but resistance looms overhead from the 200DMA 

Canadian Solar  CSIQ  maintains a bullish bounce off 50DMA support 

Solar City  Finally Bottomed  For Now 
Solar City  O SCTY  may have finally bottomed for now  The rally off the recent bottom has put about 20  back on the stock  I sold my call options into the rally  The next threshold for SCTY is a move into the post earnings gap down  Overhead resistance looms large as the 50DMA quickly trends downward 


Solar City  SCTY  makes a strong bounce off its recent bottom 
Hanwha Q CELLS Co   Progress Limited
Hanwha Q Cells  O HQCL  has been unable to make more progress since a strong bounce off 50DMA support  There is no new bullish trade here until the stock can print a breakout and close above  20 

Hanwha Q CELLS Co   HQCL  is still coiling for a potential breakout 
Overall  these select solar stocks remain of great interest even as Guggenheim Solar ETF  N TAN  still sits near its low for 2015

eBay  NASDAQ EBAY  shares are trading near their 2 year highs  We are close to important resistance levels and traders should watch this stock closely as the upward potential is huge if we see a breakout  eBay has been consolidating for 2 years inside a trading range of  60 to  46  As can be seen in the weekly chart below  we are currently testing the resistance around  60  If we get a confirmed breakout above this trading range it will be a very important event  Breakouts like this are huge  The chart has formed a bullish flag with the pole starting from  26  86 to  57  So the upside potential if we get a confirmed breakout will be a move towards  90

Canadian Solar
One of my favorite patterns as you have already seen is the bullish flag  The weekly chart in Canadian Solar  NASDAQ CSIQ  provides such an example with the upside potential being huge if buyers manage to breakout the stock price above  35 with potential target the  70  80 zone 

There is a huge bullish flag being formed and we are currently under the upper flag boundaries and close to important resistance area  Price is also below the Ichimoku cloud  another indicator that will confirm the breakout if we break above  35 ",2015-03-02,Alexandros Yfantis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/i’m-watching-these-stocks-243569,243569

First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR   has been acting really well  reaching 61 21  before pulling back to 61 11  up 1 37  or 2 3   on nearly 4 million shares on Monday  After the breakaway gap  it s been up in a rising flag and popped through the resistance zone on Monday  Solar stocks did very well on Monday  It wouldn t be surprising to see this stock reach up to 65  and beyond that 68  and then 70

Commentary
Given that T2108 and T2107 closed essentially unchanged on Friday  the increase in breakdowns turned out to be more a function of where I happened to look on Friday  June 26  2015 

An ominous breakdown below the 200DMA for Canadian Solar Inc   NASDAQ CSIQ  confirms the earlier 50DMA breakdown
However  one breakdown should now be on everyone s radar  On Friday  the Shanghai Composite Index  SSEC X  lost 7 4   The selling confirmed a 50DMA breakdown and produced a fresh 6 week low  The index is now down 19  from a major multi year high set just two weeks ago  The index is STILL up 34  year to date 

The Shanghai Composite Index violently pivots around its 50DMA into a confirmed  and ominous  breakdown

Anyone who has lived through the NASDAQ bubble and crash of 1999 to 2000 should see very familiar patterns
The Shanghai Composite Index is China s casino stock market  We have heard stories for months now about the gold rush mentality among retail traders eager to open trading accounts to get in on the action  The tremendous rush of what has reportedly been thousands of new accounts a day has come despite a slowing growth rate in China and plunging prices of steel rebar to 2009 levels  The slump in steel is at least symbolic of a larger malaise as so much of the larger China story runs on infrastructure and construction   both heavy users of steel 
The current breakdown of the Shanghai Index represents a near inevitable end of the momentum  The similarities to the NASDAQ bubble and crash are also not surprising given these frenetic trading conditions and rapid  parabolic gains   to a record low on Saturday represents a desperate acknowledgement that conditions are potentially teetering on a bigger calamity  It is now the FOURTH rate cut since November  Along with everyone else  I will be looking to see whether this cut works to calm China s stock traders 
Meanwhile  back on the home front  the S P 500  via the SPDR S P 500 ETF  ARCA SPY   remains contently oblivious 

The S P 500 in a familiar position   hanging out around its 50DMA
The VIX tried to generate some excitement but was promptly faded before it could reach the 15 35 pivot  now firm resistance  

The Federal Reserve has dutifully helped to suppress volatility
The only thing preventing me from getting outright bearish on the U S  market is that T2108 is stuck firmly in neutral territory  So  the trading call remains neutral  and I am still focused on stock specific stories  To stick with a bearish theme  I present charts from the ugly side of the fence 
This chart on iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  ARCA EEM  is  catch up   I should have noted it earlier  After EEM tested resistance at the 200DMA  I loaded up on put options  I closed them out on Friday  The difference between this trade and the past two is that I did not hedge with call options 

iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF  EEM  is firmly turned back from resistance
Ambarella  Inc   Ambarella Inc  NASDAQ AMBA   has been a momentum favorite for a while now  On Monday  June 22nd  notorious short seller Citron brought an end to that momentum in dramatic style  Interestingly  Citron released its report on the morning of Friday  June 19th  but I guess it took the weekend for enough people to truly believe whatever the report said 
The lack of commitment to this stock showed in the subsequent rush to the exits   a classic characteristic of momentum stocks  After the dust settled  AMBA had lost 21   The next day  it gapped up as the last bargain hunters and short covering went to work  The momentum came to a fresh end with Friday s bearish engulfing pattern  As ugly as the chart looks now  the stock is not technically confirmed as bearish until major support  such as the 50DMA  breaks 

Citron crushes the momentum in AMBA
AMBA gained a lot of its fame from being a GoPro  Inc   NASDAQ GPRO  supplier  AMBA has performed much better than GPRO  AMBA has made numerous all time highs and until last week experienced near non stop  breakneck upward momentum 
GPRO had its day and is now struggling to regain former glory  That excitement returned with earnings in April  After a complete reversal of the post earnings gap that I SHOULD have bought  the stock resumed its recovery from the March low  The momentum has wavered in June as the 200DMA has held firm as resistance  AMBA put GPRO back on my radar and I promptly faded the weak recovery from Monday s AMBA sympathetic drop 

GoPro  Inc   GPRO  starts to waver at 200DMA resistance
Again  I am not yet bearish on the stock market overall  The constant chop  the consistent hugging of the 50DMA by the S P 500  and the inability of volatility to make a move are all non supportive for any fundamental bearishness  It does not even make sense to try to get  pro actively  bearish 
This is even more true if China s rate cut succeeds in calming nerves and keeping traders in their stratospheric positions  But given the convergence and confluence of events  which now includes what could actually be the end game for Greece  I am officially on alert  Interested readers should check out my study from 2011 that demonstrated that trading in the summer can lead to gains for bulls  but when things go bad  they get VERY bad

108142,329657,CSIQ,Governments Don t Really Want Clean Energy  Madness In US  Spain,opinion,"A curious thing is happening in the battle on carbon  Solar panels are finally becoming cheap enough and efficient enough to warrant usage  without government subsidies  at least in sunny places 
Everyone should be happy  Right 
Instead we have tariffs  fees  and taxes on those who use solar panels 
In effect  when solar energy made no economic sense  companies received subsidies  now that solar makes sense  many governments want nothing to do with it 
Solar Energy Storage is Worse Than Nuclear Spillage
In sunny Spain  
Storing solar energy in a battery in Spain is more criminal than spilling radioactive waste  That s the implied message written between the lines of a recently drafted law poised for fast track approval by the government of Spain  Proposed fines for residential and SME use of solar energy self consumption will be as high as  60 million   67 7 million   Spain s  Ideological Campaign Against Solar 
Speaking recently to PV Tech  Union Espanola Fotovoltaico  UNEF   the PV Association of Spain  stated that  this would be the only self consumption law in the world created only to prohibit the development of self consumption  
UNEF added that Spain s new law is  retroactive  because if projects do not fit within the new parameters they will become illegal  even if already legally approved  Specifically  the new law requires that the owner and consumer must be the same person  and installations may no longer exceed 100 kW  Infringements will be treated very seriously  resulting in the maximum fines of up to  60 million   67 7 million   This amount is twice as high as the penalty for causing a leak of radioactive waste in Spain  currently set at  30 million   33 85 million  
The new levy on solar energy self consumption from a grid connected owner s storage unit will have a seriously negative impact on the solar installation payback period  SMEs using self consumption are expected to have a lengthening of payback time from four to seven years  PV Tech also notes that taxation on  residential self consumption of solar energy in Spain could increase payback time from around 16 years to 31 years  

Solar Madness Arizona Style
Sunny Spain does not want solar  what about Arizona 
In sunny Arizona 
In the wake of Salt River Project s recent solar rate hike  SolarCity Corporation  NASDAQ SCTY   the largest rooftop solar installer in the state  is relocating at least 85 of its 900 Arizona workers out of state  with more to come 
SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive said Wednesday the SRP fees approved in February are too restrictive and eliminate the potential to save money with solar for nearly all customers 
 That is bad for the economy   Rive said   Arizona is the state with all the sun  All the other states  where we operate  are doubling their solar capacity  and Arizona is shrinking  which makes no sense  
SRP officials in February approved a new rate plan for any new customers installing solar under which they will pay a monthly  demand charge  based on their highest 30 minute average demand of power from the grid during peak hours 

US Tariffs
Arizona depicts state level madness  Inquiring minds may be interested in what s happening with recent events in solar energy the US national level 
For the answer  please consider  
The U S  revised some taxes on solar products from certain companies in China to help thwart dumping amid a renewable energy spat between the two nations 
Some units of Yingli Green Energy Holding  NYSE YGE   the second largest solar manufacturer  received the lowest so called anti dumping rate  0 79 percent  The rate for another group of companies including Canadian Solar Inc  NASDAQ CSIQ   JinkoSolar Holding Company Limited  NYSE JKS   and some other Yingli units was set at 9 67 percent  Other companies will pay 239 percent 
 Economically counterproductive tariffs have artificially made solar panel prices in the U S  the most expensive in the world   Shah said  CASE was formed to represent most of the U S  solar industry against the petition 

Economic Madness
Does the Obama administration want clean energy or not 
All tariffs are economic madness  But 239 percent tariffs and even the average rate of 20 94  is especially inane  Do we want to reduce independence on carbon based energy or not 
If China gave us free solar panels we would be crazy not to take them  At a cost of zero  they would truly be affordable  Numerous businesses would spring up installing them 
Hiring would increase  GDP would rise 
Instead  we have tariffs and additional fees on solar based energy just as the technology is beneficial enough to use  on its own accord  without subsidies  This is economic madness ",2015-08-11,Mike (Mish) Shedlock,https://www.investing.com/analysis/governments-don't-really-want-clean-energy;-economic-madness-in-us-261202,261202
108177,329692,CSIQ,A Summer Solar Rally ,opinion,"After a blistering start to the year we warned readers in March that several solar charts were showing warning signs that all was not well for this sector  As it turned out many solar names would fall 40 50  over the ensuing ten weeks 
Canadian Solar Inc  NASDAQ CSIQ 
GT Advanced Technologies Inc  NASDAQ GTAT 
SolarCity Corporation  NASDAQ SCTY 

Now it appears that the worm has turned once again for the solar sector and the correction has likely reached its conclusion 
TAN Daily
Many solar stocks such as CSIQ and SCTY have aggressively broken out of basing patterns this week and the 5 year weekly chart of Guggenheim Solar  ARCA TAN  highlights the considerable upside potential that this sector still offers longer term 
TAN 5 year Weekly
The fact that many solars have considerable short interest  GTAT 34  of float is shorted  SCTY 28  of float is shorted  SUNE 25  of the float is shorted  only adds fuel to the fire of the summer solar rally which is currently underway  While we like outright long positions in the above mentioned stocks  more conservative investors might consider a pairs trade of long TAN vs  short SPDR Energy Select Sector Fund  ARCA XLE   which also happened to be the most overbought sector heading into this week  ",2014-06-18,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-summer-solar-rally-216500,216500
108178,329693,CSIQ,Renewable Energy And The Irony Of Government Policy,opinion,"Wall Street has been aggressively cheer leading the solar industry over the past couple of years  An example  Canadian Solar Inc  NASDAQ CSIQ   has climbed 10x in value since 2012 
Backing up the hype  solar panels are half the cost they were in 2008  and capital costs for solar power plants have fallen by 22  in 2010 2013  according to an Economist article discussing the costs of renewable energy 
 In a few sunny places  solar power is providing electricity to the grid as cheaply as conventional coal  or gas fired power plants   the article says 
However Charles Frank of the Brookings Institution  a think tank  created a cost benefit analysis to rank various forms of energy 
 The costs include those of building and running power plants  and those associated with particular technologies  such as balancing the electricity system when wind or solar plants go offline or disposing of spent nuclear fuel rods  The benefits of renewable energy include the value of the fuel that would have been used if coal  or gas fired plants had produced the same amount of electricity and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that they avoid  The table summarises these costs and benefits  It makes wind and solar power look far more expensive than they appear on the basis of levelised costs  
 Solar power is by far the most expensive way of reducing carbon emissions  Wind is the next most expensive  Hydropower provides a modest net benefit  But the most cost effective zero emission technology is nuclear power  
The irony of some government policy is not lost on the Economist magazine 
 At the moment  most rich countries and China subsidise solar and wind power to help stem climate change  Yet this is the most expensive way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions  Meanwhile Germany and Japan  among others  are mothballing nuclear plants  which  in terms of carbon abatement  are cheaper  ",2014-07-27,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/renewable-energy-and-the-irony-of-government-policy-220692,220692

Commentary
The Santa Claus rally is rolling along with more marginal new all time highs on the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   

The S P 500 is once again  reluctantly  marking off new all time highs
The post Fed excitement is well behind the market  and it looks like it is meandering its way to the next catalyst  T2108 closed at 52 9  and is perfectly positioned in  neutral   The volatility index bounced a little yesterday but failed to hold its high at 16  It looks the VIX will bounce around the 15 35 pivot instead of continuing to collapse toward lows into the new year as I had hoped 
Speaking of expectations going into the new year  my title is a reference to two related items  First of all  I am completely avoiding the typical new year prognostication  Instead  I have chosen to steal an old friend s mantra for making predictions   prices will fluctuate   It just seems to make little sense to project out an entire year when the vast majority of us will be flat wrong by the end of the year  I also do not like how some analysts and prognosticators spend a lot more time predicting than analyzing past claims 
More importantly  I am happy to announce that I have FINALLY updated the historical data for my T2108 Trading Model  TTM   Along the way  I found it necessary to give  a series of uplifts and edits  I hope I have made the presentation at least a little easier to understand  As always  I welcome feedback 
The bottom line for anyone without the inclination to dive into the dirty details is that the T2108 Trading Model has proven quite robust over these near two years since I first developed it  Nothing in the data over the last two years suggests I need to make dramatic changes in strategy or analysis  For folks new to the T2108 Trading Model  please refer to   Going forward I hope to more aggressively attack my list of potential future work 
Consider inclusion of other technical indicators like T2104  T2104 is a Cumulative Volume Index which is an indicator of market breadth
Further refine the quasi oversold trading model and develop related derivatives
Study drawdowns and risk in more detail
Search for additional unique trading opportunities and windows  For example  the distance from a new 52 week or all time highs  impact of other major indices  the prevailing trend  existence of recently tested price supports and resistance  etc 
Continue searching for strict definitions of oversold and overbought conditions using T2108
Test additional machine learning models
Assess other moving averages for thresholds  is the 40DMA the best divider  
Let me know whether there is anything missing from this list  While I am making now 2015 predictions  I do have a few things I am KEENLY watching  Here is a SAMPLE 
Oil
Yes  EVERYONE is watching oil  My informal observation is that a LOT of folks are trying to pick a bottom  I can understand why  the eventual upside in buying oil related stocks at a discount is potentially very high  But along the way this could still deliver a lot of pain  After seeing   I pulled up the chart of Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  ARCA XLE   I see an ETF ready to fail another test of resistance at its 50DMA 

The downtrend in Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF  XLE  is well intact
Instead of shorting XLE directly  I decided to try a leveraged ETF instead  Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X ETF  NYSE ERY   Its chart is perfectly perched on 50DMA SUPPORT  The additional reason why I like re shorting oil here is that IF the S P 500 has another rough January  it will almost certainly take down oil related stocks as well  Thus  ERY becomes a fresh hedge on my overall bullishness  Mind you  out of the other side of my neck I HAVE been nibbling on some oil related names in the past two weeks  I made a first tranche of buys in Encana  NYSE ECA    an old favorite  Memorial Production Partners LP  NASDAQ MEMP    a high yielder that I discovered already hedged itself 5 years out  thank you Nightly Business Report    and Fluor Corporation  FLR    an infrastructure play I have LONG wanted to add to the portfolio  I have absolutely no interest in rushing into a second tranche until some signs of stabilization and or further decline in sentiment occurs in the sector 
The buy of ERY may have been timely given  from Civeo Corporation  NYSE CVEO  in after hours  emphasis mine  

 Civeo Corporation  NYSE CVEO  today announced the company s initial 2015 guidance  which reflects decisions by major oil companies in North America to significantly reduce 2015 capital spending  particularly in Canada  continuing weakness in global commodity markets and the resulting impact on the company s business in Canada  Australia and the United States 
The acceleration in November of the decline in global crude oil prices and forecasts for a potentially protracted period of lower prices have resulted in major oil companies reducing their 2015 capital budgets from 2014 levels  This has had the effect of reducing the near term allocation of capital to development or expansion projects in the oil sands  which is a major driver of demand for the company s services in Canada  It has also increased the difficulty of reliably estimating 2015 occupancy levels for the company s facilities  Likewise in Australia  persistently low metallurgical coal prices continue to negatively impact demand for accommodations in Civeo s primary markets  In addition to these operational factors  the company expects to be negatively impacted by the continuing weakness in the Canadian and Australian dollars  which are down 2  and 6   respectively  over the past two months against the US dollar and down 8  and 9   respectively  year to date in 2014  

This alone says that oil companies are NOT expecting some kind of quick rebound in 2015  To make matters look even more dire  CVEO is now in search of NEW revenue sources 

 In reaction to softer markets  the company is pursuing additional revenue opportunities  adjusting its cost structure  limiting capital expenditures and suspending its quarterly dividend  

Consider ourselves warned 
Google
Google Inc  NASDAQ GOOGL  experienced a surprisingly sharp plunge below the  500 level during the last brief market sell off  Unsurprisingly  the bounceback was equally sharp  and yet somehow I missed the entire move    Now  GOOG is struggling to break 50DMA resistance  I am expecting it to fail as it seems GOOG is experiencing a very slow but sure downward shift in sentiment  I am ready to trigger a related trade on a break of  525 which would take the stock below recent  low volume  churn  Note that a breakout should at least have enough power to re challenge the post earnings high from October which will coincidentally converge with 200DMA resistance 
Google s sharp recovery is now stalled at 50DMA resistance
IPOs
My friend TraderMike has  re opened my eyes to the wonderful word of IPOs  There are all sorts of stocks making amazingly nice trading opportunities from a technical level  I am pledging myself to watch his site  more carefully  YOU should too  Here is an example of a very nice setup in Hortonworks  NASDAQ  HDP  that I completely missed 

A lot to like in Hortonwork s  HDP  technicals so far
GoPro  Inc 
GoPro Inc  NASDAQ GPRO  is a recent IPO that deserves its own section  Little has spelled hype better than GPRO s IPO and subsequent run up  But the stock has fallen hard from all time highs and momentum has come to an abrupt halt  NOW  the 50DMA is starting to define a downtrend in the making  Note how GPRO definitively failed 50DMA resistance yesterday  I took the opportunity to run into some put options 

GPRO had a nice run up on holiday expectations  but is the honeymoon over 
Currencies
This deserves its own post  Suffice to say that I continue to monitor the major themes going  strong dollar  weak euro  shaky Australian dollar  the stalled economic recovery for the United Kingdom  British pound   the shredding of the Japanese yen from immense amounts of central bank printing  contrarian long the Canadian dollar 
The Commodity Crash Playbook I first developed this concept in 2011  I am looong overdue to update it and rewrite the playbook as commodities across the board have finally collapsed in 2014 
Solar Stocks
  I dared to prognosticate a January bounce in solar stocks  I had a good round of first positions in December  I am rebuilding a hedged play for January  I will write a separate post on it soon  In the meantime  here is how I am generally playing it  long First Solar  NASDAQ FSLR  call options  short Guggenheim Solar ETF  ARCA TAN   short Canadian Solar Inc   NASDAQ CSIQ    and long CSIQ call options  I may make additional tweaks in the coming days 
Hmmm  looking at my list  it sure looks pretty bearish  Something to chew on  I guess

108180,329695,CSIQ,Alt Energy Stock Outlook  Long Term View Favorable,opinion,"The demand for alternative energy is growing rapidly as nations around the world have taken on the challenge to combat global warming issues  This is exemplified by the U S  and China deciding to jointly act on climate change plans after prolonged talks  Notably  renewable energy growth in Asia s third largest economy    India    is expected to accelerate in the coming years following big ticket announcements involving American loans for renewable energy projects in the country 
The recent drop in oil prices has been a drag on stocks in this space  which will likely be an issue for quite some time  Bu the long term outlook for alt Energy stocks remains favorable 
Solar
A major growth area in the renewable space is solar energy  A U S  Energy Information Administration   EIA   report indicates continued growth in utility scale solar power generation  which is projected to average almost 80 gigawatt hours per day in 2016  Although solar uptake is rising steadily  it will still be just 0 7  of total U S  utility scale generation in 2016 
Solar growth has historically been concentrated in customer sited distributed generation installations  Yet  EIA expects utility scale solar capacity to expand over 60  between the end of 2014 and the end of 2016  with about half of this new capacity being built in California  In addition  the current U S  administration s efforts to restrict carbon emissions are a net positive for renewable energy stocks  The proposed climate change plan is a very bold attempt to address the global warming issue  A proposed new Clean Power Plan of Environmental Protection Agency would reduce carbon emission from power plants by 30  by 2030  compared to the levels in 2005  The administration s earlier environmental plan  unveiled in Jun 2013  had put additional limits on existing coal fired plants  The administration issued directives asking environmental regulators to set up carbon pollution standards for active plants  Coal generates about 40  of U S  electricity and coal plants are the largest source of carbon emissions in the country  Per the latest report released by the Solar Energy Industries Association   SEIA    the U S  trade association of approximately 1 000 companies in the solar energy industry  the U S  solar energy industry grew 41  year over year to reach 1 354 megawatt  MW  in the third quarter of 2014  This marked the second largest quarter of solar installations in the history of the market  buoyed by the utility solar photovoltaic   PV   market  which installed 825 MW in the quarter  up 52 8  year over year  As of Sep 2014  more than 36  of all new electricity generation came from solar energy Solar in China  China  the world s prime manufacturer of solar panels  is emerging as the leading market for solar PV to meet the growing need for clean energy  The Chinese government announced new policies to encourage local governments to promote more solar installations on home and business rooftops  and ground mounted plants of up to 20 megawatt   MW    China installed a record 12 GW of solar panels in 2013  which made it the world s largest solar market  for that year  overtaking longtime leader Germany  China s National Energy Administration has called on local governments of all regions to focus on distributed generation  A fourth quarter surge is indeed likely on the back of these efforts  China has also pledged to attain peak carbon emissions by 2030  or earlier if possible  The country has set a daunting goal of boosting the share of non fossil fuels to 20  of the country s energy mix by 2030  The following leading Chinese solar stocks are sure to make the most of the favorable government stimulus  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co  Ltd   NYSE YGE   JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd   NYSE JKS  and JA Solar Holdings  Inc   NASDAQ JASO  Ontario  Canada based solar product manufacturer Canadian Solar Inc   NASDAQ CSIQ  is also well positioned with its diversified manufacturing base and project portfolio in Canada  China  Japan and the U S 
Wind
The American Wind Energy Association   AWEA   reported that the wind industry grew radically during the first three quarters of 2014  The U S  industry installed 1 254 MW over this time frame  up significantly from what the industry installed during the first three quarters of 2013  This brought the total installed capacity to 62 300 MW  The majority of wind construction activity continues to be focused in Texas  As per EIA  wind capacity grew by 10  between 2012 and 2014 and it is expected to increase by 23  between 2014 and 2016  The EIA expects wind capacity to expand twofold as compared to solar as the former is starting from a much larger base than the latter  15 gigawatts   GW   of wind versus 6 GW of utility scale solar 
Hydro
Hydropower is considered the leading renewable energy source in the U S  With the emergence of new technologies  like marine and hydrokinetics  this industry is likely to continue to generate vast amounts of sustainable energy throughout the country  Hydropower is also the cheapest source of electricity as it has the lowest cost per kilowatt hour compared to all other sources  More importantly  hydropower is independent of the volatile movement in fuel costs  EIA projects that conventional hydropower generation will increase by 2 1   while non hydropower renewables used for electricity and heat generation will grow by approximately 3 9  in 2015  For 2016  growth in renewables consumption for electric power and heat generation is projected to continue at a rate of 4 8   as a 1 1  increase in hydropower is combined with a 6 6  increase in non hydropower renewables

Breitburn Energy Partners  NASDAQ BBEP  had a monster move on Tuesday  It has already gone from 4 50 to 9 40  before backing off at 8 90 on Tuesday  up 1 71  or almost 16   on 12 million shares  There could be some resistance in the 9 40 zone  It did close above the 50 day moving average though  If it moves forward  the targets are 10 35 and 12 00  I m looking for a better set up  perhaps a consolidation and flag 
First Solar   NASDAQ FSLR  as you know is one of the leading solar companies of the world  It recently dropped from the 73 range all the way down to under 40  and in the last couple days it snapped back  On Tuesday  it broke out above resistance and its moving averages  up 2 68 to 48 15  or almost 6   on 4 2 million shares  It may very well take a run at the 51 3 4 zone before it pulls back  We re keeping a close eye on the solar s as they may be reversing 
Laredo Petroleum   NYSE LPI  was up 3 08 to 12 89  or 31 4   on 10 2 million shares  It has come down dramatically from the July high when it was 31  all the way down to its spike low recently at 7 00  and then it had a reversal  It formed a little coiling base  and in the last two days it s blown through all of the moving averages  as well as the high around the 11 range reached at the end of December  At this point  if it has reached up to a new channel top  then it may go back and consolidate  But it may very well test the gap in 14 14 1 4  and the major declining tops line  before it does that 
Trina Solar Limited  NYSE TSL  is another one of the solar stocks that are perhaps in play now  up 97 cents to 10 52  or 10   on 6 3 million shares on Tuesday  In the last 3 4 sessions  it has broken through the declining tops line and lateral price resistance  and now a run up toward the 11 11 1 4 range may be in order
