players are expected to report quarterly results by the end of this week  Picture Thus Far and ExpectationsPer the  report dated Oct 23  37 5  of the S P auto components have already reported quarterly results  with their total earnings up 4 9  from the same period last year on 7 9  higher revenues  Notably  100  of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings  while 66 7  topped revenue estimates  A look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that the auto sector s earnings recorded a decline of 0 7  year over year  while revenues inched up 0 1   In the third quarter  revenues and sales are expected to scale down 2  and 20 8  year over year  respectively Let s take a look at the factors that are likely to have affected auto stocks in the to be reported quarter Challenges Galore in Auto Sector in Third QuarterAutomakers around the globe have been struggling with declining car sales amid economic slowdown concerns  This trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter  Auto sales in China  the world s largest car market  continued to plunge during the quarter amid recession worries and trade war tensions that have been denting confidence of consumers and holding back manufacturers  Increasing popularity of ride sharing platforms are also likely to have weighed on car sales  Stricter emission woes  and shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles are likely to have changed the sector s dynamics  Widespread usage of technology and rapid digitalization resulted in fundamental restructuring of the automotive market  This is likely to have increased manufacturing vehicles  costs  which were passed on to consumers and dented demand  Meanwhile  technological complications call for high priced aftersales services  which may have created new opportunities for auto equipment manufacturers to capitalize on Key Releases on Oct 25Given the bleak year over year backdrop  let s take a glance at how three auto players are placed ahead of their third quarter results  slated to release on Oct 25 Lear Corporation   NYSE LEA    Lear   one of the leading Tier 1 suppliers to the global automotive industry   is slated to report quarterly results before the opening bell Our proprietary model clearly indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    to increase the odds of an earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  The firm came up with weaker than expected earnings in the last reported quarter amid lower than anticipated revenues from the Seating segment  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the firm displays a mixed record  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 1 02  Lear Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Lear carries a Zacks Rank  3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   which makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of  3 20 per share on revenues of  4 75 billion  Lear s acquisition of Xevo early this year  which integrated the latter s e commerce vehicle platform technology with Lear s electronic expertise  is likely to have positively reflected in the quarter to be reported  However  lower production volumes in key markets  especially China and Europe  are likely to have impacted Lear s top line  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the firm s Seating segment revenues is pegged at  3 633  indicating a 1 3  year over year decline  Further  the consensus estimate for sales from the E systems segment stands at  1 171 million  suggesting a decrease from  1 208 6 million reported in the year ago period Autoliv  Inc    NYSE ALV    Autoliv  a Swedish auto industry supplier  is also set to unveil quarterly numbers before the market opens  While the firm came up with better than expected results in the last reported quarter  it missed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters Autoliv  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Things are not looking up for Autoliv this time around as the firm currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of  1 38 per share on revenues of  2 10 billion  The company s product segments   Airbags and Seatbelts   are sending mixed signals for the to be reported quarter  Weaker vehicle sales in Europe and China are likely to have impacted revenues from Seatbelt products  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter 2019 Seatbelt revenues is pegged at  660 million  implying 2 4  year over year fall  However  estimates for Airbag revenues stand at  1 397 million  suggesting an uptick from  1 357 million recorded in the year ago quarter  The firm s product launches and strong performance of frontal and side airbags  especially in North America  are likely to have buoyed its earnings in the to be reported quarter The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company   NASDAQ GT    Goodyear Tire  one of the largest tire manufacturing companies in the world  is slated to post quarterly results before the opening bell  The firm came up with weaker than expected results in the last reported quarter due to lower sales volumes across all its major markets including North America  Europe and Asia Pacific regions  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the firm displays a dismal record of missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company Price and Consensus   Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Goodyear Tire this time around  as it currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 and Earnings ESP of  11 56  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of 50 cents per share on revenues of  3 78 billion  The firm s strategic asset  TireHub  which is the national tire distributor of the United States  is likely to have boosted performance of Goodyear Tire in the quarter to be reported  The company s restructuring efforts  launch of products  and innovative mobility connectivity via Roll retail pilot and Mobile Tire Shop Network are expected to have positively reflected in third quarter results  Goodyear Tire s strategy of slashing costs by reducing its manufacturing footprint in Alabama is also likely to have aided margins  However  challenging macroeconomic environment in major markets served by the company is likely to have dented the top line  Concerns regarding U S  China trade tussle and economic slowdown  as well as sagging auto sales in the United States are likely to have weighed on the company s third quarter 2019 earnings Standard Motor Products  Inc    NYSE SMP    Standard Motor came up with better than expected results in the last reported quarter on the back of strong performance from Engine Management and Temperature Control segments  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the firm displays a mixed record  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters Standard Motor Products  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Standard Motor this time around  as it currently carries a Zacks Rank  2 and Earnings ESP of 0 00  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of 92 cents per share on revenues of  304 7 million  Increasing orders from both Temperature Control and Engine Management segments are likely to have boosted Standard Motor s overall sales in the quarter to be reported  For the Temperature Control unit  pre season orders are likely to have been solid  This is expected to have driven its top line  Further  Engine Management   except the wire and cable business   is likely to have gained from strong orders on the back of the buyout of Pollak business early this year  Nonetheless  high labor costs and industry headwinds are likely to have weighed on the firm s bottom line Today s Best Stocks from

47834,269349,ALV,Should Value Investors Consider Autoliv  ALV  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Autoliv  Inc    NYSE ALV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks  PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole  On this front  Autoliv has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 03  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 79  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Autoliv s current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 16 19 over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Auto Tires Trucks Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 44  Hence  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Autoliv has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 08  which is lower than the current PE level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Autoliv stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Autoliv has a P S ratio of about 0 81  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 59x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years We should also point out that Autoliv has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 08  which is lower than the current PE level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Autoliv stock in the near term too  P S Ratio Another key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Autoliv has a P S ratio of about 0 81  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 59x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Autoliv currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Autoliv a solid choice for value investors  What About the Stock Overall  Though Autoliv might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives ALV a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and two down in the same time period  This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched down 0 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has remained stable over the same time frame  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Autoliv  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term  Bottom Line Autoliv is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Besides a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 35  of 255 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about the stock  Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below   Hence value investors might want to wait for the Zacks Rank  industry ranks  performance and analyst sentiments to turn around in the name first and once that happens  this is likely to be a compelling pick

quarterly results A look back at the Q3 earnings season reflects that the auto sector s earnings dipped 0 3  year over year on 0 4  revenue decline  In the fourth quarter  overall earnings and revenues for the auto sector are projected to decline 59 1  and 5 2  year over year  per the latest   In fact  the auto sector s earnings are likely to decline the most among all the 16 Zacks sectors Let s take a look at the factors that are likely to have affected auto stocks in the to be reported quarter Factors Setting the Tone for Auto Sector Results in Q4Automakers around the globe have been struggling with declining car sales amid economic slowdown concerns  China  the world s largest auto market  witnessed a massive decline in vehicle sales during the quarter amid recession worries and trade war tensions  U S  light vehicle sales in the fourth quarter also fell 1 7  year over year to 42  90 911 units  Vehicle sales from each of the Detroit 3 carmakers  Ford  General Motors  NYSE GM  and Fiat Chrysler  dropped year over year in the December quarter Increasing popularity of ride sharing platforms is likely to have weighed on car sales  Stricter emission woes  and shift toward electric and autonomous vehicles have changed the sector s dynamics  Widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization resulted in fundamental restructuring of the automotive market  This is likely to have increased manufacturing vehicles  costs  which are passed on to consumers and in turn dented demand  Meanwhile  technological complications call for high priced aftersales services  which may have created new opportunities for auto equipment manufacturers to capitalize on Key Releases on Jan 28Let s take a glance at how five auto players are placed ahead of fourth quarter results  slated to release on Jan 28  before the opening bell Harley Davidson  Inc    NYSE HOG    In the last reported quarter  Harley Davidson came up with better than expected results on the back of higher than anticipated sales in the firm s motorcycle and related products segment Our proprietary model clearly indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    to increase the odds of an earnings beat  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the American motorcycle manufacturer surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters Harley Davidson  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   However  this time around  things are not looking up for Harley Davidson as the firm carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and has an Earnings ESP of  117 39   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of 5 cents per share on revenues of  924 9 million Harley Davidson s efforts to launch lighter motorcycles and bolster dealer networks are likely to have positively impacted fourth quarter performance  The firm s initiatives to lower expenses are expected to have boosted margins in the quarter to be reported  However  softness in the U S  and European market are likely to have dented sales volume and the top line in the fourth quarter  As such  the consensus mark for revenues from the sale of motorcycles for the fourth quarter is pegged at  709 million  suggesting a 3 9  year over year decline   Read more   PACCAR Inc    NASDAQ PCAR    The Washington based truck manufacturer posted better than anticipated results in the last reported quarter backed by record truck delivery and solid after market part sales  As far as earnings surprises are concerned  PACCAR surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters PACCAR Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Encouragingly  it has the favorable combination of an Earnings ESP of  0 78  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is a profit of  1 51 a share on revenues of  5 55 billion PACCAR s impressive line up of innovative truck models and technologies is likely to have aided the firm s fourth quarter performance  Healthy U S  economy and freight growth are likely to have spurred demand for PACCAR s Class 8 truck during the quarter  Fourth quarter gross margins for Truck  Parts and Other are expected in the 14 14 5  range  The metric in the year ago quarter was 14 23   However  rising selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to have clipped profit margins to some extent   Read more   Lear Corporation   NYSE LEA    Lear   one of the leading Tier 1 suppliers to the global automotive industry   posted better than expected results in the last reported quarter on the back of higher than anticipated revenues from the Seating segment As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the firm displays a mixed record  It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 3 3  Lear Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Lear has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  7 10   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of  3 20 per share on revenues of  4 75 billion  Lear s acquisition of Xevo early this year  which integrated the latter s e commerce vehicle platform technology with Lear s electronic expertise  is likely to have positively reflected on the quarter to be reported Growing mix of high content crossovers and SUVs are expected to have driven demand for the firm s Seating segment Rising need for electrification and connectivity is also likely to have propelled demand for the E Systems segment in fourth quarter 2019 However  General Motors UAW six week strike is likely to have hurt the firm s top line to some extent Autoliv  Inc    NYSE ALV    Autoliv  a Swedish auto industry supplier  posted weaker than expected results in the last reported quarter amid raw material expenses and decline in global light vehicle production As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the firm displays a dismal record of missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters Autoliv  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   However  our model predicts an earnings beat for Autoliv in the to be reported quarter  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  0 28   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of  1 78 per share on revenues of  2 14 billion  The firm s product launches and strong performance of frontal and side airbags  especially in North America  are likely to have buoyed earnings in the fourth quarter  The company s product segments   Airbags and Seatbelts   are anticipated to have performed well in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2019 Seatbelt revenues is pegged at  721 million  implying a 6 3  sequential rise  Further  the consensus estimate for Airbag revenues is  1 428 million  suggesting an uptick from  1 349 million recorded in the prior quarter Polaris Industries Inc    NYSE PII    The Minnesota based motorcycles and off road vehicles  ORV  firm delivered an earnings beat in the last reported quarter primarily on the back of higher than expected contribution from the ORV Snowmobiles segment As far as earnings surprises are concerned  the firm surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters Polaris Industries Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   However  our model indicates that the company may not be able to maintain earnings beat streak in the quarter to be reported  as it has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  1 59   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is earnings of  1 78 per share on revenues of  1 77 billion  It is expected to have benefited from increasing year over year revenues across most of the product segments including ORV snowmobiles  aftermarket  global adjacent markets and motorcycles  Evidently  the consensus mark for revenues from ORV snowmobiles  motorcycles  aftermarket and global adjacent markets is pegged at  1 163 million   118 million   230 millionand  132 million  indicating year over year increase of 9 7  35 6   8 4  and 8 1   respectively  However  the positives are likely to have been offset by higher costs and tariff woes  Lower sales and profits from the Boat segment are expected to have dented overall results  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and gross profit from the Boat segment is pegged at  131 million and  24 6 million  depicting

Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Anders  Looking now into Q4 2019 key events on the next slide  Firstly  I would like to say that I m very pleased that our adjusted operating margin has improved compared to last year  despite the challenging vehicle market  The reason for this improvement is mainly a result of the actions initiated in prior quarters  to mitigate the effects of tough market condition and high launch activities 
We continue to outperform against global light vehicle production  growing sales organically six percentage points more than global LVP  The strong performance is driven across all regions  This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter of significantly higher organic growth compared to the market  further strengthening our market share position 
I am pleased to also report that 2019 became the fifth straight year that Autoliv achieved an order intake share of around 50   Our cash flows remain strong  enabling delivering toward our target  to maintain a leverage ratio in the range of 0 5 to 1 5  Our strong performance in the fourth quarter enabled us to meet or exceed all of the metrics in our guidance  despite softening of market conditions 
Uncertainty remains high and we do not see any turnaround in light vehicle production in the near term  Additionally  we continue to see high raw material costs  however  this year over year effect has slowed  and we should start to benefit from lower raw material costs in 2020 We continue to actively manage the business cycle downturn  Compared to a year ago  headcount is about 1 600 less  despite unchanged sales 
Looking now on adjusted operating margin progression on the next slide  As illustrated by this chart  we have been able to gradually improve the margin versus last year  from more than 200 basis points below in the first two quarters  to 20 basis points above in the fourth quarter  This is despite continued headwinds from declining light vehicle production and raw material costs 
The main reasons for the sequential improvements is our efficiency program  including business cycle management activities  improved launch cost efficiency  as well as our strong focus on continuous improvements throughout the organization  As implied by our full year 2020 indication  we expect the adjusted operating margin to improve  In addition to the positive contribution from our continuous improvement activities  we expect to see further effects from the structural efficiency program  as well as lower raw material prices  Although uncertainties continue to affect the industry volumes  we expect to outperform light vehicle production in 2020 in all major regions 
However  we expect 2020 seasonability to be even more pronounced than what was in the 2019  in terms of quarterly profitability progression  The start of the year will be challenging  but we expect a significantly stronger second half of year  This reflects the expectation variation in light vehicle production  where IHS expects Q1 to decline by around 6   while the second half year is expected to grow more than 2  
Looking now at the recap of fourth quarter financial performance on the next slide  Our consolidated net sales were actually flat compared to Q4 2018  impacted by weaker currencies  Organic sales increased by 0 5   despite the global light vehicle production falling by more than 5   Adjusted operating income  excluding costs for capacity alignments and antitrust related matters and separation costs was also essentially unchanged year over year  despite the impact of general market conditions and raw material pricing  Adjusted EPS increased by  0 42 compared to Q4  18  mainly due to lower income tax and higher adjusted operating income 
Looking now on the market development  the negative light vehicle production trend that started around mid 2018 has continued  Global light vehicle production is estimated to have fallen by 6  in 2019  the worst performance since the financial crisis in 2008 2009  and by more than 5  in the fourth quarter according to IHS  China s light vehicle production increased for the first time since early 2018  However  it was still 14  below the level achieved in Q4  17  In the near term  vehicle demand is expected to remain stagnant  due to the weak consumer confidence  as well as the reduction in new energy vehicle subsidies 
U S  light vehicle sales finished the quarter down 2  compared to last year  while sales in Mexico fell by more than 9   and Canada by almost 3   Light vehicle production in North America decreased by 9   The main reason for the lower light vehicle production was a strike at GM s U S  facilities  Inventories declined by 180 000 units to a December six year low of around 3 5 million 
Europe s light vehicle registrations were 11  higher than during the same period in 2018  The surge in car sales came  as some countries announced changes to the bonus malus component of CO2 based taxation for 2020  However  despite the increase in European light vehicle registrations  light vehicle production in Europe decreased by 5   The West European production of vehicles with high safety content dropped by 6  in Q4  19  on top of the 9  decline in Q4  18 
Looking to our sales growth on the next slide  Our sales grew organically by 0 5   as a result of new launches over the previous quarters  we were able to outgrow light vehicle production in all regions  Sales in China increased organically by 13   outperforming light vehicle production  both with global and domestic OEMs  Combined  we outperformed light vehicle production by around 12 percentage points 
In North America  our sales declined by 3   which is close to six percentage points better than the decline in light vehicle production  mainly due to product launches from previous quarters  particularly with FCA and Tesla 
Our sales in South America increased by 40  organically  despite declining light vehicle production  The third quarter underperformance versus light vehicle production in Europe  turned to outperformance in the fourth quarter  impacted by recent launches of high volume models  at PSA  Renault and BMW Sales in Japan decreased organically by 9  compared to the light vehicle production decline of 11   The market weakness was a reaction to the sales tax increase in October  Rest of Asia organic sales declined by 2   which was almost 8 percentage points better than light vehicle production 
Looking at sales performance for full year 2019 on the next slide  In full year 2019  our sales outperformed global light vehicle production by over seven percentage points  At the beginning of the year  the outperformance was expected to be 5  to 6   The better than expected outperformance was partly due to the positive development in the market mix  as low content per vehicle segments declined more than the high content per vehicle segment 
2019 marks the second year with 6  to 7  outperformance versus light vehicle production  This trend is expected to continue into 2020 
We outperformed light vehicle production in China  Americas and Rest of Asia by between 8 and 13 percentage points  The underperformance in Europe and Japan reversed in the fourth quarter  and we believe that this trend will be maintained in 2020  We estimate that our market share of passive safety in 2019 increased by almost two percentage points to more than 41   The largest increase came from passenger airbags and steering wheels 
Looking into our key model launches in Q4  19 on the next slide  These models are well distributed across the globe  and have an Autoliv content per vehicle of around  100 to  300 per car  Particular y interesting are two new Japanese models  with front center airbags  the Honda Fit and the Isuzu D Max  The new front center airbag helps avoid driver to interior and driver to passenger impact  We expect to see strong growth coming from front center airbag  as Euro NCAP has introduced a far side load case in the 2020 rating program 
Going into 2020  we again have a high level of launch activities to support new vehicles to be introduced over the coming quarters  and we believe that will prolong outperformance of light vehicle production 
I will now hand over to our Interim CFO  Christian Hanke to speak to the financials 
Christian Hanke    Interim Chief Financial Officer
Thank you  Mikael  Looking now to our financials on the next slide  This slide highlights our key figures for the fourth quarter  Our net sales were unchanged at  2 2 billion  Our gross profit and margin increased slightly year on year  supported by lower launch related costs and our structural efficiency program  In addition  the net operating leverage on the organic sales growth from the ramp up of new vehicle programs  was more than offset by lower capacity utilization  due to the sharp drop in light vehicle production 
Reported earnings per share improved by  2 84 to  1 78  The main drivers behind the increase were  0 242 from lower cost for capacity alignments and antitrust matters  0 43 from lower tax and  0 02 from higher adjusted operating income  Our adjusted return on capital employed  was 26  and return on equity was 31  we have maintained our quarterly dividend at  0 62 
Looking now on the next slide  our adjusted operating margin of 11 1  was 20 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2018  As illustrated by this chart  the adjusted operating margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs of 10 bps  which was more than offset by 20 basis points from SG A and RD E  and 10 basis points from FX effects 
We managed to offset the negative operating leverage effects of the 5  LVP declined by a number of activities  such as business cycle management and operating leverage on sales growth from new product launches  Additional support came from normalized launch related costs and the structural efficiency program 
Looking on the next slide  operating cash flow was strong in the fourth quarter of  19 and amounted to  312 million  which was about  25 million higher than for continuing operations in 2018  mainly explained by improved operating working capital  Capital expenditures amounted to  118 million in the fourth quarter  which is about 5 4  in relation to sales  an improvement from the 6 1  a year earlier For the full year  19 operating cash flow  excluding the EC antitrust fine  amounted to  844 million  This was  36 million higher than for continuing operations in 2018  Capex in relation to sales amounted to 5 6  
Moving on to the next slide  we have  as you know  a long history of a prudent financial policy  Our balance sheet focused and a shareholder friendly capital allocation policy remains unchanged  despite the current market conditions  As of December 31st  2019  the company had a leverage ratio of 1 7  which is slightly lower compared to what we reported as of the September 30 
Our strong free cash flow generation should allow deleveraging and should allow continued returns to shareholders  while providing flexibility  We expect to be within our target leverage ratio range by the end of 2020  This excludes any other discrete items and other non foreseeable changes to our business 
I will now hand back to Mikael 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Christian  Looking at the recap of the full year  19 on the next slide  The year 2019 was one of the most challenging years for the automotive industry  with close to 6  decline in global light vehicle production  a sharp contrast to the 1  growth that was expected when the year started  Combined with higher raw material costs  a large number of product launches and improvement initiatives  2019 was a challenging year indeed  However  2019 was also a year  where we built on the foundation for the sustainable profitability improvement for the coming years 
Our performance progressed throughout the year  and in the fourth quarter  we show the first year on year improvement in adjusted operating margin since the spin off of Veoneer  I m also pleased that we  for the fifth straight year  maintained around 50  order intake share  supporting our growth for the longer term 
Looking at the details of our structural efficiency program on the next slide  We have already started to see the positive effects of the program  although limited in the quarter  For full year 2019  the savings amounted to almost  10 million  and the program should reach its full effect by mid 2020  Most operations will be impacted  and we expect a headcount reduction of around 800  The cost for the program is now estimated to be around  52 million and a cash out to be spread from Q2  19 to Q2 2020  The sequential savings in 2020 is estimated to be around  30 million to  40 million  on top of the savings already achieved in 2019 We continue to evaluate our global operations and to optimize our footprint  This may result in additional restructurings in the future quarters as needed 
On the next slide  you can see that our order intake share for the full year continued on the same high level as in 2018  Supporting our growth opportunities also beyond 2020  This is strong evidence that our company is the leading company in the passenger safety automotive industry  and shows that we have successfully managed operations of ramping up of previous year s high level of order intake 
One of our key performance indicators  customer satisfaction  has improved substantially and is at a high level  the best we have had for several years  However  this does not mean that we can relax  We always strive for improving products  services  processes and costs  We estimate that we booked about 50  of available order value in 2019  making 2019 the fifth consecutive year of booking around of or more than 50  of available order value  The order intake is broad based  We have improved our market position in three dimensions  regional  customer  and product category 
On the next slide  we have the outlook for major light vehicle markets  which has become increasingly more uncertain  due to weaker consumer confidence and regulatory changes  Reflecting the increasing uncertainty in the market  our base scenario for global light vehicle production in 2020 is a contraction of 2  to 3   which is lower than IHS outlook of a decline of 0 7   This would be the third year in a row with declining light vehicle production 
Looking further ahead  as we have outlined at the Capital Markets Day in November last year  we do not expect the market to return to historic growth rates in medium term  Our base assumption is that it will take five years from now  until we reach the 2017 global light vehicle production level  The reason for our more negative view on global light vehicle production compared to IHS  is the impact from the strict CO2 emissions limits in Europe  We know that many OEMs  2020 launch schedules for electric and plug in vehicles are back end loaded  potentially bringing production volatility  Additionally  we do not see a rebound in China in the current weak consumer confidence environment  and we are closely monitoring the tragic development of the Corona virus in China  and gauging its potential impact on the automotive industry 
In the U S   we expect a modest contraction  still with a stable consumer environment  As a result of the past year s strong order intake  we expect to outgrow light vehicle production by around six percentage points 
Looking at how we will outperform the light vehicle production in 2020 on the next slide  Here you see some of the key models supporting our outperformance in 2020  These more or less are expected to account for a large share of our organic sales growth during 2020  Seven of these models were launched recently  five are yet to be launched  Annually  these 12 models represents close to 9  of sales  and our content per vehicle is in the range of  130 to almost  500 
Looking io our margin development for 2020 on the next slide  As we communicated at our Capital Markets Day in November  we see some tailwinds and some headwinds for 2020  We believe the net effects of tailwinds and headwinds should result in a year over year improvement in adjusted operating margin  To be able to indicate an improvement by at least 40 basis points in a historical weak market environment  gives us confidence that we are on track to the 12  medium term target  You can see the main tailwinds include growth from executing on a strong order book and the structural efficiency program  The main headwinds include lower inflator replacements sales and continued decline in light vehicle production 
Now looking on the full year 2020 outlook on the next slide  We have summarized our full year 2020 indications  and we do not see any signs of turnaround in the light vehicle demand  Our financial outlook assumes a 2  to 3  decline of global light vehicle production  These indications exclude cost for capacity alignments and antitrust related matters  We expect our organic growth to be around six percentage points higher than the global light vehicle production  Consequently  our full year 2020 indication is for a 3  to 4  organic sales growth  with no expected currency translation effects or net sales growth is assumed to be in line with organic growth 
Reflecting the low light vehicle production assumptions  our indications for the adjusted operating margin is at least 9 5  for the full year 2020  We anticipate the currency effects on the operating margin for full year 2020 to be relatively neutral  Operating cash flow excluding any unforeseen events  excluding unusual items is expected to be above the 2019 level 
Turning the page  to drive toward our financial targets  our 2020 focus is directed to efficiency and productivity  The number of product launches have now stabilized at the new higher level  enabling an increased focus on productivity improvements in 2020  With more than 100 improvement projects being evaluated  we have set the high pace toward factory future  These projects are key drivers to our medium term targets and for shareholder value creation We will also continue our effort to flawless execution of our new launches  improving customer satisfaction further and thereby supporting our new and stronger market position 
Unfortunately  there will be millions of traffic accidents in 2020 some fatal  some where people will get injured  Therefore we will relentlessly continue to innovate and to deliver best quality products  that will save more lives 
I will now hand back to Anders

Questions and Answers 
Operator
Thank you  sir   Operator Instructions   Your first question today comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank  Your line is open  Do you have yourself on mute  Emmanuel Rosner  your line is open for your questions  We ll take the next question  and that comes from Hampus Engellau from Handelsbanken 
Hampus Engellau    Handelsbanken    Analyst
Thank you very much  Three questions from me  Starting off on the underlying core production  you were talking about 2  to 3   Is this based on your call offs or is it    how do you come to that compared to IHS  given that there is a sharp first half in IHS and then a recovery in the second half  You are seeing a sharper first half or how should we think about that  Second question is    OK  let s take one at a time  Sorry 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay  no problem  go ahead and we can take them all for you 
Hampus Engellau    Handelsbanken    Analyst
Okay  If I    on the order intake you continue to trend at 50   I think also you highlighted that this is more broad based  Does this mean that you are also breaking into other products  I mean  firstly  it was more frontal airbags and steering wheels  that was a result of the collapse for the quarter and I was wondering if this    is it becoming more tough to get market shares i e  do you feel that you need to do more on pricing  and how should we think of the stickiness  If your assumption for this year is correct  where would you end in terms of market shares  if we had 41  in Q4  Last question is more on the efficiency program  if we should expect them to be more front end loaded in terms of savings  Thanks 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay  Thank you  Hampus  Starting with light vehicle production outlook here  I think we do  as we always do  I think we re looking at external underlying guidance that companies like IHS is giving  of course  Then we build in what we see in terms of our collapse  You re correct there  when it comes to the Q1 horizon and the beginning of the year  we have higher level of visibility 
So that is being baked into our total outlook  But also of course in dialogues with our customers etc  gives a more complete picture  that builds our own view here for the full year 
And with what we see there in the beginning of the year  we see  as you said a sharp decline in Q1 here and the challenging first half of the year and then gradually improvement  And I think of course you further out you get  the visibility is lower and is more of assumptions  when you get there    the data points  But that s where we are right now and I think  I would like to stress that  with everything that is happening globally now  in both terms of geopolitical and I would say also  the overall business cycle adds to the uncertainty here  and the potential impact on light vehicle production 
So we are 2  to 3  down  but with the high level of uncertainty  and of course our job here is to follow the development and making sure that we take countermeasures when necessary here 
On the second question here on the order intake  I think we see the same thing as we have seen and see  I mean we are in a very competitive and challenging industry here  as the the Tier 1 supplier into the automotive  and there is no changes to that  I think in terms of the wins we have here  it is broad based across the different products  but also across the different customers    main customers we have and regions  So the connection to where    the capital related situation  that is beyond us now  It s beyond us since some time back  I would say  and this is really wins on our own merits across the industry here 
How weak it is  We will see  But I also would like to stress again here  that 50  in terms of the order intake share is not the target that we have per se  Our focus here is to protect the market share that we are growing into and the market share we expect to grow into  is the mid 40s  and that is what we are focusing on here 
When it comes to the efficiency programs  I think of course when we go into 2020  we have with us  what was done in  19 and the foundations that was done in  19  But of course  we are continuing on our strategic roadmap toward our mid term targets 
And in that context  it s still early days  This is  year one  so to speak  in the three to five year journey toward the    around 12  adjusted EBIT that we have as a target in the mid term  So of course  as we get more and more traction on this roadmap  we will see it also gradually hitting the bottom line here  So in that sense  of course  you will see more    further in  when we get to the year  And I think also reflects the indication we have given on the quarterly progression here 
Hampus Engellau    Handelsbanken    Analyst
Thank you  Is it possible also if you would say how big the passenger safety market was last year and how it grew 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
No  I can t give you a number on that now  But as you know  we have said that in average  it grows 1  year over year roughly  And I think  without having any confirmation on it  we should expect that to be the case also for  19 
Hampus Engellau    Handelsbanken    Analyst
Fair enough  Thank you

Thank you  The next question comes from the line of Mattias Holmberg 
Mattias Holmberg    DNB Markets    Analyst
Thank you  Mattias Holmberg at DNB Markets here  At your CMD November  you guided for 3  to 4  outperformance versus light vehicle production in the medium term  Now with the guidance for 6  outperformance in 2020  just to understand what goes beyond 2020 then  Is this an indication that there should be a drop in your outperformance versus LVP beyond 2020  Or is it rather that the 3  to 4  stated at the CMD were too conservative 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
No  I think you should see it really as a continuation on the development that we    I mean we talked in the Capital Markets Day in  17  that we should expect or we should see around 6  outperformance year over year up to 2020  And what we have seen here in the past years  I mean  18   19 and now with what we are seeing for 2020 is exactly that  it s around 6  in average throughout these three years  Then what we said in the Capital Markets Day was from 2020 to the mid term down three to five years out  Of course  for us knowing that or assuming that the 6  that we now are talking for 2020 baked in 
So it ties together and there is no change to what we have communicated for a different time period  So the first  what we said for three years from  17 to  20  that we are now confirming with last year in that period  and for the next period  we maintain the 3  to 4   knowing what we have in 2020  So  no change there basically 
Mattias Holmberg    DNB Markets    Analyst
Thank you  A follow up on that  regarding the market share in the order intake compared to the market share on sales  where there still is a rather large discrepancy  Do you expect these two to converge over time  And in that case  how long would that take approximately 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah  I think it s important to see this conversion over a longer time period than just between single years here  There is anything    18 to 36 months in average from when you take in orders  so it goes into production  And of course if you take a single year  the distribution may look different  You may have some that is more back end loaded and so on  So that s why you can t compare really one year to another 
But what we have said here is that  our estimation is that we expect within this timeframe that we are talking about mid term here to grow    gradually growing into the mid 40s  So we need to see it over a longer period  But this year   19  we grow with roughly two percentage points

Thank you  Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh 
Vijay Rakesh    Mizuho    Analyst
Yes  hi guys  Just looking at the 2020  you mentioned high number of launches here  Just wondering what the number of launches you re expecting in 2020 versus 2019  And if you could give us some more detail on the launch costs that you expect the puts and takes in 2020 launch cost versus  19  Thanks 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think when it comes to the number of launches  we have no number to give to you here  But what we have said here is that  and I mean we talked more about the actual number of launches when we did this step change  And the step change is now beyond us  well behind us and we are now seeing launches on the new high level  which we then call the new normal  so to speak  And so  we continue to run launches with a high activity level that we have seen now for the last year 
When it comes to the elevated launch costs that we talked about in 2018  that should gradually go away during 2019  is done  So with the development that we re seeing quarter over quarter sequentially in  19  we have delivered on that  So when we go into 2020  we have a normal launch cost level of the launches we are doing  So of course it s more launches than it has been historically  but the average cost for a launch is at historic level  So we are back to where we should be  and we know how to do launches and that s where we are at now  where we have adjusted and trimmed the system to the new level of launches 
Vijay Rakesh    Mizuho    Analyst
Got it  And on the raw materials side  I know you mentioned costs going up  What s the expectation for 2020 raw material costs and how much was in 2019  Thanks 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
In 2019  we saw a headwind of roughly 60 basis points between  18 and  19  and the headwind was gradually coming down toward the end of the year  For 2020 we see    I would say yes  you can say tailwind  but marginal tailwind  so more of a flattish positive development here  So no significant tailwind from raw materials in 2020  according to our expectations here 
Vijay Rakesh    Mizuho    Analyst
Thanks 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
And as you know  there is delays in how it comes comes toward  So therefore  we don t see any major tailwind from raw materials in 2020

Thank you  The next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson 
Jason Stuhldreher    Barclays    Analyst
Hi  this is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian  First question just on the margin guidance  the at least 9 5   Question is what factors could allow your full year margin to be higher than that  Asked differently  why not just guide to around 9 5   why say at least 9 5  
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  I mean  as always  when you do guidance like this  is based on the    to our best knowledge how to deliver  And this is what we see in our reactions here under the set of parameters that we have talked about here  So that is to the best of our knowledge guidance and yes  so I think that s where we are 
Jason Stuhldreher    Barclays    Analyst
Okay  But we shouldn t assume that 9 5  assumes the bottom half or the bottom part of the growth range 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Maybe you can clarify growth range  You mean the margin expansion or    
Jason Stuhldreher    Barclays    Analyst
Within the 3  to 4   I guess I can follow up on that after  That s helpful color  Thank you  Just and then final question  I was wondering if you could    as it related to your order win rates  I was wondering if you could remind us of what your market share is by region right now  and where may be the highest delta is between where your order rates are per region versus what your current market share is per region 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  we don t disclose it per region or in that granularity here  But what we have said here is that  we see that we are gaining market share in the three dimensions that we talked about here  And I think we have showed you before  relative progression in the different regions and so on  but not in exact numbers  So what you saw on the Capital Markets Day  is basically what is coming through here in the numbers we have talked about here  So you can look at that progression there 
Jason Stuhldreher    Barclays    Analyst
Okay  thank you 
Operator
Thank you  Next question comes from the line of Erik Golrang 
Erik Golrang    SEB    Analyst
Thank you  Two questions from me  The you have the slide  I think slide 19  where you showed the 2020 tailwinds  I guess on the margin side  And I m just wondering if that is some kind of order of relevance  and also wondering  why the absence of the Mexico unrest isn t on that list 
And if you could perhaps  also on the other side of that  perhaps quantify a few of the major headwinds  perhaps particularly the drag from inflator replacement sales coming down  and the increase in depreciation and amortization 
And then the second question  just looking at your overall volume development  both for the full year 2019 and the fourth quarter  It s quite close to the organic growth you reported  implying that price mix is more or less zero  Is that a result of pricing being better or positive mix primarily  Thank you 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think in terms of tailwinds and headwinds  I think you see on the slide  there is the bigger ticket here  And as always when you have the year over year improvement  there is a large number of contributing factors to the development here  And of course Matamoros is one that we expect not to have this year  but is probably then being met by other headwinds that we see in other areas  So this is more of a net effect picture here But what you can say here is of course that    I mean we have done    we are doing then the structural efficiency program that is contributing to the overall operational challenges  With the light vehicle production  we will see the same portfolio mix headwind  We have    so that s an important component into this  We have also highlighted here  the inflator replacement sales  and what we see then as a tailwind  is very much of all the efforts that we are doing to manage the business cycle  together with the strategic roadmap here 
So without going into any specific details here  I already alluded to the raw materials here  that we see small positive effects from  But other than that  I would say  that it s many different components adding up to the totality here 
Erik Golrang    SEB    Analyst
Okay  And on the organic growth in Q4  19 versus the volume development  the delta there quite limited  Is that price or pricing better or mix that s offsetting continued negative pricing 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
No  I think  I mean we are not seeing any    what we are talking about here is  I mean  of course the mix comes into it as    when we look at our forecast for the year  we re looking at underlying LVP development in different countries  together with our own outperformance in respective regions  But you shouldn t read anything into it  when it comes to price development or anything like that 
Erik Golrang    SEB    Analyst
Okay  And then just one final question  if I really look at the sort of absolute levels of order intake  to what extent was 2018 really an extreme year for    in terms of industry awards for the market  and to what extent you feel that 2019 was perhaps a bit of a hangover from that  and perhaps a bit lower relative to the sort of the long term trend 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think in general  the business dynamics between the different years varies depending on how the customers renewal or updates of their product    car models looks like  So that is not evenly spread of course  Then another factor that you have when you look at the lifetime also is the light vehicle production volumes assumptions that is    at the respective year 
So of course  if you re in the year where you re at a high level and you don t expect to see any dramatic drops or dramatic increases  you have a certain level  and then you move forward  and then of course the market development comes into play  which also affects the numbers 
So there is assumptions built into it  based on the light vehicle production outlook  which affect the numbers also  And then of course the expected lifetime of the particular model  So there is many factors going into it 
Erik Golrang    SEB    Analyst
Thanks 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
But I think    but the key further    the key is of course that when we look at this  the 50  is 50  of available RFQs

Yes  good afternoon and good morning  Thank you for taking my questions  The first one would actually be on your working capital  if there was anything particular in Q4  that you do you want to highlight  And then more specifically around receivables  we heard other suppliers indicating that OEMs are paying late at the end of  19  Do you see similar development  and then maybe you can also just remind us on your level of factoring at the end of 2019  And then my second question on your leverage ratio  you say you re within range by the end of 2020  So I was wondering if that implies we could expect share buybacks to start in  21  Thank you 
Christian Hanke    Interim Chief Financial Officer
Hi Sascha  it s Christian here  Yes  so in terms of working capital  I mean  I don t think there is anything in particular  in the quarter per se  But I think  if you have followed our operating working capital and the ratio to sales  it has improved quite a bit since last year  So I think it s a continuous improvement and focus that we have in that area  We don t really see anything on the DSO side  day sales outstanding  I think it s slightly improved in the fourth quarter compared to where we were before  And in terms of factoring  it s on the same level as we close the year    last year  So that s on the factoring side 
Now in terms of    in terms of buybacks  I mean it s obviously not anything that we forecast or indicate to the market when we would do so  I mean it s more in terms of the focus is on the leverage ratio to get within the range  And then we ll    you will make any decisions based on where we are at that point in time  considering our cash flow performance  future cash flow performance and the market  So it s not so much more than I can say to that  Sascha

Thank you  The next question comes from the line of Erik Paulsson  Erik Paulsson  your line is open 
Erik Paulsson    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst
Yes  Sorry for that  The volume was so low  I have first one  its on quarterly seasonality  You talked about that you expected seasonality in 2020 to be more pronounced than in 2019  Is this due to your own call off or is it more of the underlying market  hence its your own call off and your own organic growth and that sounds more extreme 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think you could contribute it to actually both factors  What we see in terms of call offs is indicating clearly a very challenging Q1 and the beginning of the year  Then of course  you have natural seasonality  that in the end of the year  we also have the engineering income more pronounced in the fourth quarter and so forth  And maybe I should add also the outperformance there actually as well  because we see that also coming much more toward the end of the year here  In terms of our loan losses 
Erik Paulsson    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst
Thanks  And my final one is on the Corona virus  You mentioned it here earlier  but if this actually accelerates  what can actual impact be for you  What do you take in precautious like necessary    what you do here to prevent things happening 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think just  first of all  too early to draw any conclusions of where that may end up from a business perspective at this point in time  I mean  we are currently actually in the Chinese New Year break still  And we know that many regions or cities have talked about prolonging their time off in terms of guarantee in time  But first of all  we are following this by the hour  basically  first of all by our local Chinese management team  but also on a global level  to make sure that we are following all recommendations and suggestions from authorities and likewise 
First and foremost  to make sure that we protect our employees here  So  the traveling banned and restrictions on that  both in the regions affected  but also in a more broader Chinese context looking after that  We do not have our own facilities within the area that is    is in the focus right now  But of course we have customers and some suppliers here  And we are following it very  very closely to make sure that we manage it in the best possible way here and do some scenario planning etc  etc here  So of course if it continues  it will definitely add to the uncertainty and the challenges here  But as of today  too early to draw any conclusions on it

Thank you  Next question comes from the line of Sabrina Reeh 
Sabrina Reeh    Sabrina Reeh    Analyst
Hi gentlemen  Thank you for taking my questions  I have two  So the first question is actually going back to another question a colleague asked  So just on your 2020 EBIT margin guidance  would it be correct to assume that the 9 5  can be achieved at a 3  organic growth that you guide for  and light vehicle production of minus 3  or is the 9 5  margin achieved if light vehicle production ends up being even below minus 3   that would be my first  And the second one would be on  you mentioned in your presentation CO2 impact and specifically in Europe  do you see an increased risk that OEMs will put more pricing pressure on suppliers depending on the market acceptance for EVs and how much of that risk if at all  is baked into your guidance  Thank you 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think your first question there is that the guidance we have put out here of at least 9 5  is with the indication of the light vehicle production going down with 2  to 3   Will it be more pronounced decline  then it s a different scenario  Will it be much better  it s at least as we said here  and so  that s really the foundation for our guidance in totality  So you should see each of the lines together there  in the guidance we have given there 
Sabrina Reeh    Sabrina Reeh    Analyst
Okay  Thank you 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
When it comes down to the pricing pressure  I think there is always pricing pressure from our customers and with high expectations on year over year productivity and we don t see any difference now  And of course  I can t say that I see something directed toward us specifically related to electrical vehicle  It s more dependent on how the different OEMs are acting and having the challenges altogether  So it needs to be seen more case by case and in broader business context in our relationships with the customer  But for sure  a challenging discussion all the time around pricing for sure 
Sabrina Reeh    Sabrina Reeh    Analyst
Okay  thank you

Thank you  The next question comes from the line of Agnieszka Vilela 
Agnieszka Vilela    Nordea    Analyst
Thank you  My first question is about your guidance for six percentage point outperformance against the car markets 2020  and that s despite the headwind that you have from the inflator replacement business  Can you tell us about the kind of profile through the year  You mentioned that you expect higher outperformance toward the end of the year and also what are the main driving regions  And then additionally on the inflator replacement business  what is your view on the most recent recall of the inflators made by Takata  Thank you 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think in terms of the    I mean we don t give exact    I mean  we don t give a guidance here by quarter  But as we said here is that  I mean  it s really a question of gradually increasing the outperformance and a challenging first quarter altogether  both when it comes to LVP and our own outperformance  So  I think that s as far as I can say  when it comes to the quarterly progression there  When it comes to the recalls that has been announced around Takata  I ve actually nothing more to add and what is already out there  I don t see that any of these or expect any of these recalls to have any significant impact on us  So it s more outside our areas that we can scope 
Agnieszka Vilela    Nordea    Analyst
Okay  And any color on the regions 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
In terms of 
Agnieszka Vilela    Nordea    Analyst
In terms of outperformance in 2020  what will be main driver 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  I think as I said before  we don t go into regional details there  But what we re saying is that  it s maybe less of an outperformance in Americas this year  as they are through their step change that we saw last year and at least for now  So  in terms of outperformance it is really a question of Asia and there we have talked before about Japan being late in the outperformance and it started to come through now in the fourth quarter and that is what you will see going into 2020  So  Japan catching up with the rest of the regions here  Then we will see China also being on very healthy levels in terms of outperformance and then also Europe  but not as strong as Asia and China  but still above Americas 
Agnieszka Vilela    Nordea    Analyst
Perfect  And then my last question is on the capex  Why are you guiding for lower capex in 2020 despite the investments that you mentioned in your factories and also kind of how significant this decrease year on year could be in capex  Thanks 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
First of all  I mean  we support our overall efficiency improvements here to make sure that we scrutinize all our activities  including the capex and what we have said here is that the investments in factory of the futures should be done to very large extent within the frame of the regulatory capex here  And as you ve seen here  we have more flexible tools  etc  We also have longer  I mean longer periods of usage for this machine  and that can cover broader range of programs as well  So we should see some efficiencies coming through into capex as well here  So  that s clearly our ambition here and also support of course of our cash flow focus here

Thank you  And your final question today comes taken from the line of Ashik Kurian 
Ashik Kurian    Exane BNP Paribas    Analyst
Hi  thanks for taking my question  Just I have one question left as to why are you still winning 50  of the market share on orders  And I don t mean to be cynical  but at least on the seatbelt side  you would have thought that at some point cases should start to get some of the orders back given that it s slightly less controversial than avoiding may be contracts for airbags  So maybe just keen to get your thoughts as to why you are seeing in the industry landscape that you are still winning more than 50  or 50  of the order intake 
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
I think  I mean first of all  we are very focused on making sure that we deliver superior quality  that is on top of our agenda in terms of our customer commitment  Together with making sure that we are a supplier that is they will have high or flawless delivery both in the daily production  but also very importantly in the development projects  because you know all of these programs is requiring very close collaboration with the OEMs when it comes to tuning our products into the respective car model and of course  making sure that we have the top competence and commitment in delivering that  And last but not least being price competitive  So  it s really making sure that we are the best choice from these three categories and that is our focus on securing customer expectations on us 
Ashik Kurian    Exane BNP Paribas    Analyst
So if I can follow up  I mean the reason I m asking is  you still stick with your view that you continue to defend the 42  to 45  market share that s your eventual target in terms of what your auto market share is  So at some point  you do expect orders or the market share on orders to go back to maybe mid 40s  I m just wondering in your view  when and how does this flip happen  when does the order momentum and what causes it to go toward the 45  
Mikael Bratt    President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes  I think  I mean  I can only reemphasize our focus on customer commitment here and we of course think that it is important to be a very strong supplier to our OEMs  And when we say that our focus is to defend our market share is that we think that there is no reason why we shouldn t have an ambition  If it becomes more it is great  but I think growth in that sense is not a top priority  We will get the market share that we earned by being the strongest supplier  I will see where

116319,337834,ALV,Takata shares untraded with heavy sell orders  KSS seen backing restructuring,news,"TOKYO  Reuters    Shares in Japan s Takata Corp  T 7312  were untraded with a glut of sell orders on Monday after sources said the struggling air bag maker had selected Key Safety Systems  KSS  as the final bidder for its restructuring  raising a concern that the U S  auto parts supplier could lead Takata into a bankruptcy 
Reuters reported on Saturday that Takata s steering committee leading the selection process told the parts maker s automaker clients that it has tapped KSS  owned by China s Ningbo Joyson  SS 600699  to back Takata s restructuring 
KSS was among bidders which have favored a court led turnaround of Takata  which would cap their exposure to Takata s existing liabilities  estimated by some analysts to be as high as  10 billion for recall costs alone  sources have told Reuters previously 
If Takata files for a bankruptcy protection  it is likely that value in equities will be wiped out  which is a huge blow for shareholders including the founding Takata family 
Takata has been seeking financial backers through the selection process to help it deal with billions of dollars in costs related to the recall of millions of potentially defective air bag inflators that have been linked to at least 16 deaths globally

Kennedy said that by the end of the year  about 70 percent of replacement inflators for defective Takata air bags will be made by competitors TRW Automotive  TRWTA UL  and  Autoliv Inc    N ALV   which use guanidine nitrate as the chief ingredient in their inflator propellant ",2015-06-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/takata-says-output-of-air-bags-with-volatile-chemical-'will-go-down-rapidly'-344736,344736

116347,337862,ALV,Long Ideas  Autoliv And Westlake Chemical,opinion,"During the real earnings season  we find many companies whose reported earnings overstate economic earnings or the true cash flows  This disconnect can lead investors to believe a stock is cheaper than it truly is 
On the other hand  we also find many companies where reported earnings understate economic earnings  This disconnect can lead to undervalued stocks and great buying opportunities for investors  Our analysis of footnotes is critical to finding disconnects between reported and economic earnings  Autoliv Inc  NYSE ALV  and Westlake Chemical Corporation  NYSE WLK  are this week s Long Ideas 

Autoliv  ALV 

We upgraded Autoliv to Very Attractive  from Attractive  after we analyzed its 2018 10 K 

ALV is down 23   vs  S P  1   over the past year and the company missed consensus EPS expectations in three of the past four quarters  We dug through the footnotes of its 2018 10 K and found that these earnings misses are misleading and true profits are on the rise 

Understated Profits  In 2018  GAAP net income fell by 55  YoY while economic earnings increased 11  YoY  per Figure 1 

Figure 1  ALV s Misleading GAAP Net Income Masks Rising Economic Earnings



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 

ALV s GAAP net income misleads investors into thinking profits are falling when the opposite is true  This disconnect is partially attributable to significant non operating expenses included in operating earnings  We removed the following expenses from ALV s GAAP net income in 2018 

 212 million  111  of GAAP net income  in antitrust related payments
 9 million  5  of GAAP net income  in employee related restructuring charges
 7 million  4  of GAAP net income  in change in reserves
 5 million  3  of GAAP net income  in capacity alignment costs related to manufacturing capacity

In total  we identified  480 million in net non operating expenses that must be removed from GAAP net income to calculate ALV s true profits  After these adjustments  we found that after tax operating profit  NOPAT  grew 3  YoY in 2018 compared to GAAP net income down 55  

To get the full picture of a company s operations  one must also account for changes to the balance sheet  In 2018  ALV s invested capital fell 16  YoY  Two of the largest deductions to ALV s invested capital are  236 million  6  of reported net assets  in net deferred tax assets and  182 million  5  of reported net assets  in excess cash  We remove net deferred tax assets and excess cash because they artificially raise reported assets and do not help generate an operating profit 

Since economic earnings account for the cost of capital  ALV s declining invested capital  combined with its rising NOPAT  drives its 11  increase in economic earnings  The company s return on invested capital  ROIC  increased from 11  in 2017 to 12  in 2018 

With such strong fundamentals  ALV is well positioned to capitalize on an automotive safety market that is projected to grow 9  compounded annually through 2025  according to MarketsandMarkets  a business research provider  The company holds a commanding 40  share of the passive safety market  which includes products such as airbag systems  seatbelts  and steering wheels  Joyson Safety Systems is second with 24  and ZF Friedrichshafen is third with 17   ALV already provides safety products to the majority of the top global auto manufacturers  and 2019 will see the launch of Autoliv supplied automobiles such as the Honda CR V  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  Passat  Nissan Altima  and the Audi Q3 

Investors Overlook Undervalued Shares  Because of the understated earnings noted above  investors using flawed valuation metrics  such as P E  are fooled into thinking ALV is significantly overvalued  Its P E ratio of 38 is well above the Consumer Cyclical industry average of 19 and the S P 500 average of 21  However  when we remove accounting distortions and look at the expectations implied by the stock price  ALV appears significantly undervalued 

At its current price of  82 share  ALV has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 0 9  This ratio means the market expects ALV s NOPAT to permanently decline 10  from current levels  This expectation seems pessimistic given that ALV has grown NOPAT by 2  compounded annually over the past five years and 8  compounded annually over the past decade 

If ALV can simply maintain 7  margins  average of last five years  compared to 8  in 2018  and grow NOPAT by just 2  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  102 share today   a 24  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 

Such a scenario could prove conservative as well  even as IHS Markit Automotive  an industry research provider  projects global light vehicle production to grow just 1  in 2019  In its 4Q18 conference call  ALV s management noted the company outgrew light vehicle production by 6  in 2018 and they expect to outpace vehicle production by a similar amount in 2019  Outpacing industry growth could lead to even faster profit growth and boost an already undervalued stock 

Westlake Chemicals  WLK 

Westlake Chemicals continues to earn a Very Attractive rating after we analyzed its 2018 10 K 

WLK is down 36   vs  S P  1   over the past year as the market weighs Chinese tariffs and industry supply concerns  We dug through the footnotes of its 2018 10 K and found that reported earnings are significantly understated and that despite macro concerns  the true profits of the business continue to rise 

Understated Profits  In 2018  GAAP net income fell by 24  YoY while economic earnings increased 49  YoY  per Figure 2 

Figure 2  WLK s GAAP Net Income Falls While Economic Earnings Rise



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 

In its 10 K  we found non recurring items that artificially decrease reported profits  such as 

 44 million  4  of GAAP net income  in asset write downs hidden in operating earnings
 33 million  3  of GAAP net income  in non recurring transaction   integration costs

In total  we identified  141 million in net unusual expenses in operating earnings that must be removed to calculate WLK s true after tax operating profit  After these adjustments  we found that NOPAT grew 21   YoY in 2018 compared to GAAP net income down 49  

Even more impressive  WLK was able to generate higher NOPAT without significantly increasing its capital base  In 2018  WLK s invested capital grew just 2  YoY  which is slower than reported net asset growth of 3   The largest deduction to WLK s invested capital is  504 million  5  of reported net assets  in excess cash  Without making this adjustment  our calculation of invested capital  and subsequently ROIC  would be distorted by past profits and not reflect the ongoing operations of the business 

Relatively flat invested capital and rising NOPAT led to the significant increase in economic earnings noted above in Figure 2  Beyond economic earnings  WLK s NOPAT margin and ROIC also improved in 2018  NOPAT margins increased from 12  to 13  YoY while ROIC improved from 9  to 11  over the same time 

Rising economic earnings would seem to fly in the face of the larger industry narrative that China tariffs and oversupply will negatively impact WLK s profits  While these are undoubtedly real concerns  the disconnect in rising profits and market fears can be attributed to WLK s small overall exposure to China  As management noted in the 2Q18 conference call  WLK  does not export much to China   In fact  just 2  of sales were to Chinese customers in 2018  However  these concerns have dropped valuations across the industry and WLK now trades at a price where excessive downside is priced in to the stock 

Shares Are Undervalued  WLK looks undervalued whether we use traditional metrics or analyze the expectations baked into the stock price 

At its current price of  74 share  WLK has a PEBV ratio of 1 0  This ratio means the market expects WLK s NOPAT to never meaningfully grow from current levels  This expectation seems rather pessimistic given that WLK has grown NOPAT by 12  compounded annually over the past five years and 15  compounded annually since 2004 

Even if we assume global oversupply leads to WLK s NOPAT margin falling to 10   lowest in past seven years  down from 13  in 2018   if the company can grow NOPAT by just 4  compounded annually for the next decade  the stocks is worth  95 share today   a 28  upside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 

Best of all  investors can rest easy knowing that their interests  are also aligned with executives  interests  Executives  annual and quarterly bonuses are both tied to meeting a target return on capital employed  ROCE   which is similar to ROIC  ROCE has been a part of Westlake Chemical s executive compensation plan in some form since 2009  The focus on improving ROCE  much like ROIC  aligns the interests of executives and shareholders  helps to ensure prudent stewardship of capital  and lowers the risk of investing in the business

116369,337884,ALV,U S  regulator to Takata  Give us faulty air bag documents,news,"By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert  DETROIT  Reuters    U S  auto safety regulators on Thursday ordered Japanese supplier Takata Corp  7312 T  to provide documents and answer questions under oath related to the government s ongoing probe of potentially defective Takata air bags in millions of U S  vehicles   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent a special order to the supplier s American unit  TK Holdings Inc  ordering delivery of the documents by Dec  1   Takata spokesman Alby Berman said on Thursday the company  is cooperating fully with NHTSA and is working to meet their requests    For the past 18 months  Takata has been besieged by chronic  widespread problems with defective inflators in its air bags  which can explode with excessive force and spray metal shards into vehicle occupants   Since 2008  10 global vehicle manufacturers that use Takata air bags have recalled more than 10 million cars in the United States and more than 17 million worldwide to replace inflators that have been linked to at least four deaths and numerous serious injuries   In June  NHTSA launched its probe of whether Takata air bag inflators made from 2000 to 2007 were properly sealed or subject to other defects  It also asked the automakers to recall air bags in certain regions  such as Florida and Puerto Rico  where the parts were exposed to higher moisture and humidity that could cause deterioration of the explosive material inside   Critics have said Takata and NHTSA have not moved fast enough on the issue   On Thursday  lawyers for U S  consumers asked a federal judge in Miami to speed up a class action against Takata and four automakers  saying public safety was at stake   U S  District Judge James Lawrence King scheduled a Dec  8 hearing on whether Takata and the automakers should turn over internal company documents to the consumers  lawyers   One safety advocate criticized NHTSA for moving so slowly on issuing the special order  saying such moves typically occur within 30 days of the launch of an investigation    The big question is why didn t they send it sooner   said Clarence Ditlow  executive director of the Center for Auto Safety  which has been pushing for NHTSA to broaden the regional recalls to a national campaign    You cannot get to the bottom of this defect unless you have the facts  and to delay five months in sending out that letter is inexcusable   he added   CHEWING GUM  NHTSA Deputy Director David Friedman said the safety agency was forcing Takata to supply the documents and answer questions under oath as part the agency s probe   We expect Takata s full cooperation as we work to keep the American public safe   he said in a statement   NHTSA officials  including Friedman  were due to meet with Takata executives later on Thursday   In the special order signed by Chief Counsel Kevin Vincent  NHTSA ordered Takata to produce documents relating to communication between the Japanese company and its rivals  as well as its customers  related to ruptured air bags   NHTSA also asked the supplier for any documents related to manufacturing issues connected with problems in production of air bag inflators  including documents cited in an Oct  17 Reuters article about manufacturing problems at the Japanese company s Mexico inflator plant   The safety agency specifically asked for any documents cited by Reuters  including a March 2011 email from then supervisor Guillermo Apud titled  Defectos y defectos y defectos       In the email  Apud  who has since been promoted to engineering manager at Takata s Monclova  Mexico  plant and previously declined to comment to Reuters  said   A part that is not welded   one life less  which shows we are not fulfilling the mission   He also described in one instance finding chewing gum in an inflator   NHTSA also asked Takata for a list of every death or injury  lawsuit or claim relating to ruptured air bags   Takata also was ordered to provide details on its inflator production capacity to replace millions of potentially defective parts already recalled  as well as its ability to expand manufacturing capacity to meet the recall needs   NHTSA asked Takata whether other inflator makers can build replacement parts to speed the recall process   TRW Automotive  N TRW  Chief Executive John Plant said Tuesday his company had been contacted by Takata about helping with the recalls  but had not seen any extra business as a result

116370,337885,ALV,Exclusive  Takata changes chemical compound involved in air bag recalls,news,"By Maki Shiraki  Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman TOKYO DETROIT  Reuters    Takata Corp has modified the composition of an air bag propellant that contains a volatile chemical at the center of a recall of millions of cars worldwide  the company told Reuters 
A Takata official  who did not want to be named but spoke on behalf of the company  did not specify how the recipe has changed  but said ammonium nitrate remained a part of the mix  He told Reuters the shift was part of its process of  kaizen   or continual improvement  and the company believed the new composition was safer than the one used before 
In response to a question  the official said 
 There is no admission of a defect with the original version  There has not been any finding that ammonium nitrate or the earlier composition was somehow flawed  We changed the composition in an effort to improve quality  
The official said the company used the modified mix in replacement bags fitted in cars brought in during the recalls  but declined to say exactly when the change was made or in which models  and how many vehicles  air bags with the new propellant have been installed 
The official also declined to comment on whether the new mix was cheaper than the previous one   There have been no problems with the new versions so far   he said 
Takata has said the original version of the compound  when exposed to moisture or improperly processed  can cause the inflators to explode with excessive force  spraying metal shards inside the car  Its air bags  used by many leading car makers  have been linked to at least four deaths in the United States and are the focus of a U S  regulatory probe and multiple global recalls in the past six years 
Since 2000  Takata has made more than 100 million inflators according to industry estimates and company data  Starting in 2008  more than 17 million cars equipped with its air bags have been recalled  including more than 11 million in the United States 
While Takata has been using ammonium nitrate  an inexpensive chemical commonly found in fertilizer and explosives  rivals Autoliv  N ALV  and TRW Automotive  N TRW  use less volatile guanidine nitrate as the main ingredient  people close to the companies have said 
Takata made the disclosure about its reformulated propellant after Reuters had sought its comment about a Reuters analysis of internal Takata documents  The analysis found the company supplied millions more cars than previously known with air bags that used ammonium nitrate based propellant and were made at its plant in Monclova  Mexico 
Carmakers are not required to disclose their suppliers  but the Reuters analysis and senior employee profiles showed Takata provided air bags for some of Detroit s best selling models that have not been subject to recalls  There is no evidence of any air bag related incidents with any of those vehicles 
The Takata official declined to comment on the analysis 
Asked if it had reports of such incidents among vehicles not included in existing recalls  the U S  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said   There is no evidence that all Takata air bags produced over the past 15 years pose a current danger to the driving public  and it would be inaccurate to make such a claim  
 There is evidence  however  that certain Takata air bags inadvertently exposed to excessive moisture during manufacturing or regions with consistently high temperatures and humidity pose a safety risk   the safety regulator added 
BIG THREE
A 2012 Takata employee roster from Monclova shows a number of workers made air bag inflators for several Ford  N F  vehicles  And online profiles of three senior employees mentioned their involvement in the development of several popular Ford  GM  N GM  and Chrysler  MI FCHA  models 
Available data puts the total production of those models at up to 6 6 million cars  though it s not clear whether all were equipped with Takata air bags 
None of the big three carmakers would confirm that Takata air bags were installed in models that have not been subject to recalls or indicate any problems 
 We have no field data indicating a problem with Takata air bags in our vehicles   said GM spokesman Alan Adler   We are continuing to monitor the situation and will put our customers  safety ahead of all else  But we will not engage in what if scenarios  
Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said Takata was focused on testing those Ford vehicles that are part of a regional recall requested in June by regulators  and would not discuss other models 

A Chrysler spokesman said the automaker has used inflators from multiple sources and with varying designs  and none have caused any problems   All benefit from robust manufacturing processes and are subject to rigorous daily testing  None has exhibited the failure modes that have prompted current investigations

116371,337886,ALV,Special Report  Plant with troubled past at center of Takata air bag probe,news,"By Joanna Zuckerman Bernstein and Ben Klayman  CIUDAD FRONTERA Mexico DETROIT  Reuters    The dusty  industrial town of Ciudad Frontera  Mexico  has moved from the far reaches of the global auto supply chain to the front lines of an investigation into why air bags from Takata Corp are blowing up with lethal force in accidents   The Takata plant there has been confirmed as the source of defective air bags made in 2001 and 2002 and again around 2012  according to recall records  automakers and regulators  In 2006  the factory blew up  driving home for workers and residents the volatility and risk of the explosive compound at the core of Takata s air bags   Now  the U S  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  has ordered Tokyo based Takata Corp  7312 T  to submit a wide array of records  including those pertaining to manufacturing controls at the Mexican plant  as part of an investigation into why its air bags have shot shrapnel at drivers in five fatal accidents from Oklahoma to Malaysia   All five of the victims   including three in the last 14 months   were hit by shrapnel from air bags in Honda vehicles  At least another 160 injury claims involving cars from several automakers have been reported to NHTSA  according to a Reuters tally   Interviews with 21 former and current Takata workers and consultants  along with company presentations and email reviewed by Reuters reveal the pressure inside the Japanese supplier to ramp up output and drive down costs for inflators   the mechanism that triggers air bags to deploy in a fraction of a second after a crash   The accounts include the concerns of managers that workers broke quality rules to boost output  It isn t clear whether the productivity pressures and quality issues they describe led to specific accidents  But the portrait they draw suggests that top executives at the company were not fully aware of what was going on at the foreign factories that churned out millions of air bags  So far  the Takata problems have led to the recall of over 16 million vehicles worldwide    We are highly focused on cooperating with NHTSA and the  U S   government investigation   Takata s U S  spokesman Alby Berman said in response to questions sent by email   The NHTSA administrative order requires Takata to supply documents and answer questions under oath related to any problems in producing air bag inflators  The order was prompted in part by an Oct  17 Reuters report detailing production and quality problems at the Mexico plant  The company has until Dec  1 to comply  In addition to the regulatory probe  Takata faces a criminal investigation by U S  prosecutors The investigations come as the Mexico plant gears up to make parts needed to replace millions of air bags in the ongoing vehicle recalls    WE RE SCARED   On the evening of March 30  2006 Takata s Mexican air bag factory exploded a year into its run as the company s main inflator production point  The series of blasts blew out windows on houses a kilometer away and threw up fireballs as workers and residents fled to escape injury  witnesses say   Remarkably  residents and workers say  there were no injuries  Hundreds of workers inside the factory that evening all managed to evacuate  some by climbing over a factory fence because a gate had been mistakenly left shut   Takata  which accounts for about a fifth of global air bag production  never announced the exact cause of the 2006 explosion  workers there at the time said  An official at the fire department  where Takata has donated trucks  said he had no records from that time   Some workers said the blast was fueled by bunkers of ammonium nitrate stored next to the plant  Takata air bags are inflated using ammonium nitrate  an explosive propellant that is encased in a canister to make an inflator   Josefina Vargas lives next door to the Takata factory  She said the first sign of trouble from the factory was a thin line of smoke visible from the sidewalk in front of her house  Vargas  52  who did not work at Takata  remembers her shock as explosions threw fiery debris almost to her feet as she sat outside her house  Vargas and others fled by foot and by car    We re scared   Vargas told Reuters in recounting the explosion from her home where she sells tortillas and cookies   When we hear a sound now  we think it s the plant    Takata s Berman said the company s safety training had  allowed for the successful evacuation of thousands of employees within a few minutes of the discovery of the fire and prevented a possible loss of life   He said the company had put new safety policies in place after the accident   Alejandro Perez  a former Takata facility manager  stayed at work for four days straight after the accident  taking short breaks to go home and nap or shower  he said   The company offered workers who returned and stayed on the job special incentives  Perez and other workers say  Takata raffled off televisions  refrigerators and cars  and even held Easter services at the plant for workers on the job that April 16    Takata managers were proud of the comeback  They marked the rebuilding with a commemorative in house coffee table book with pictures of the blast  and baseball caps stitched with the exact date and time of the first explosion  The company took a  21 million charge as it prepared for an IPO in November of that year   Within a month  Takata had resumed production  fast enough so that customers such as Honda Motor Co  T   44157 7267Ford Motor Coor Co  N F  didn t have to shut down their own factories due to lack of parts  Rival Autoliv  N ALV  also stepped up its output to make up for what Takata could not supply  the companies said at the time        UNRELENTING PRESSURE  But on the ground  the pressure to restart and make up for lost production was unrelenting  especially from American managers who had been flown to Mexico  said Perez  the former facility manager  He was laid off at the plant in 2008  Other workers also said pressure remained high   Takata workers said they had to make a quota of inflators   sometimes more than 200 per hour   If you didn t make it  you would be behind and they wouldn t pay you a productivity bonus   said Jose Sanchez  42  a former worker who made inflators at Takata from 2004 to 2010   In 2010 and 2011  the Monclova plant was consistently behind quota in making a new kind of driver s side air bag inflator  In an effort to crack down  supervisors used security cameras to catch workers on a line  fooling around   and apparently engaged in conversation rather than making inflators  an email circulated to staff that included still images from a camera shows  Takata s Berman said security cameras at the plant were there to prevent theft and not intended to monitor workers   Around the same time  a worker was also cutting corners by trying to  rework  or fix defective parts on the inflator assembly line  That would have made it easier for them to meet output quotas  But Takata prohibited that practice in order to reduce the chances of bad parts being shipped to automakers  according to an email  Inflators identified as defective were supposed to be placed in a separate  red bin and then examined and repaired if possible by other workers  according to former workers   Guillermo Apud  a supervisor at the plant  scolded other employees about this problem in a May 2011 email reviewed by Reuters   Rework on the line is PROHIBITED      he said   We can t have leaders materials people operators REWORKING material left and right without ANY control  this is why we have defect upon defect   his email  translated from Spanish  said   We need to change NOW    Apud declined to comment  Berman said Apud was acting to reinforce company safety guidelines after finding an employee had improperly reworked an inflator   The email is an example of the manager performing his supervisory responsibility and enforcing company quality controls   he said   In 2012  Takata workers at the Mexico plant put the wrong part into inflators being readied for shipment  according to documents Takata and automakers filed with NHTSA  More than 350 000 vehicles from three different car makers were later recalled for that defect  The mistake was possible because parts bins were kept too close together  the company told regulators in Japan   The mistake was not discovered until after a lawsuit was filed over an October 2013 accident when Brandi Owens  then 25  hit another car in stop and go traffic while driving a new GM Chevrolet Cruze  The Cruze s air bag exploded and hit Owens so hard it blinded her in the left eye  she said in the lawsuit filed in April 2014  Her case prompted a recall two months later  in June  Owens settled with Takata and General Motors Co  N GM  on undisclosed terms in August   A fatal accident just after that June vehicle recall illustrates the complexity of the problem facing automakers and safety investigators  Takata said a defective inflator from its now shuttered plant in the U S  state of Georgia was installed in a 2003 Honda City assembled in Thailand and sold in Malaysia   On July 27  Law Suk Leh was driving that car when she hit another vehicle in the Malaysian town of Sibu on Borneo island  Law  who was in the final stages of pregnancy  was killed by a  severe puncture wound  to the neck when she was hit by a metal fragment after the car s air bag blew apart  Malaysian police said  Honda revealed details of the death last week in announcing a recall of another 170 000 vehicles to replace their air bags   BOOMING DEMAND  For Takata  building the factory in Mexico in 2000 would enable it to help meet booming demand for air bags with cheaper labor  projections prepared for executives show   By moving inflator production from two plants in the United States to Mexico  Takata saved  70 million in labor costs over five years to 2006  an internal company presentation shows  dropping the labor cost for making an inflator from  2 to about 75 cents  Takata s automaker customers benefited  the cost to them fell by more than 20 percent to less than  20 each  according to the presentation   By spring 2005  Takata s big bet on the Mexican factory appeared to be paying off  Workers at the Monclova plant  as it was known in the company  posed for a commemorative photo  raising both hands in the air in a banzai salute   Soon afterward  Takata closed its factory in La Grange  Georgia  southwest of Atlanta  Takata had been reducing inflator production there and at a second U S  plant in remote Moses Lake  Washington for four years  records show   Worker morale had suffered at the plant in Moses Lake  built on the site of a former U S  military base  workers there told Reuters  By 2000  a new management team prioritized meeting output quotas and enforced overtime as demand for U S  cars and SUVs soared  former workers say   We just burned people out   said one former worker  who like others asked not to be named  In 2002  the plant laid off 100 workers and sent more production to Mexico  media reports at the time said   A series of mistakes by workers in handling ammonium nitrate at the La Grange  Georgia and Mexico plants between 2000 and 2002 left the explosive compound exposed to dangerous levels of humidity  Takata told regulators in the United States and Japan   Takata says inflators could be susceptible to rupture if exposed to moisture or extreme humidity  The defect in Law s airbag in the Malaysian accident was caused by humid conditions at the Georgia plant  Takata and Honda said   It is unclear how much Takata s headquarters in Tokyo knew about the problems at its inflator plants  Takata did not dispatch permanent staff from headquarters to the Mexican plant as it ramped up output  workers say   A Takata safety auditor dispatched from the United States inspected the Mexican inflator plant in May 2011 and found problems in handling the volatile ammonium nitrate  His audit report  seen by Reuters  faulted the plant for not closing bags of the compound tightly enough and for storing scrapped or contaminated propellant near good material  risking mix ups  He said in his report he would not send the audit to Takata s headquarters in Tokyo   Shigehisa Takada  the grandson of the founder  now chairman and chief executive  has said the company made a mistake by allowing too much autonomy to its local managers in North America during a period of rapid growth  Takata acquired at least six companies in the United States and Germany between 1989 and 2012    Back then  the U S  markets were expanding very rapidly  and we could not see everything that was happening there   according to a recording of Takada s speech to a closed shareholders meeting in June  It was his most recent public appearance

Autoliv stock is beating the market  and it reports earnings soon  But does that make it a good buy today  To answer this question we ve turned to the Investment U Stock Grader  Our research team built this system to diagnose the financial health of a company 
Our system looks at six key metrics   
  Earnings per Share   EPS  Growth  Autoliv reported a recent EPS growth rate of  56 89   That s below the auto components industry average of 5 79   That s not a good sign  We like to see companies that have higher earnings growth 
  Price to Earnings   P E   The average price to earnings ratio of the auto components industry is 21 45  And Autoliv s ratio comes in at 15 51  It s trading at a better value than many of its competitors 
  Debt to Equity   The debt to equity ratio for Autoliv stock is 32 17   That s below the auto components industry average of 62 55   That s a good sign  Autoliv s debt levels are not out of control 
  Free Cash Flow per Share Growth   Autoliv has increased its FCF per share over the last year relative to its competitors  That s good for investors  In general  if a company is growing its FCF  it will be able to pay down debt  buy back stock  pay out more in dividends and or invest money back into the business to help boost growth 
  Profit Margins   The profit margin of Autoliv comes in at 2 29  today  And generally  the higher  the better  We also like to see this ratio above competitors  Autoliv s profit margin is below the auto components average of 8 36   So that s a negative indicator for investors

116440,337955,ALV,Auto Stocks Q4 Earnings  Key Forecast For PCAR  HOG   More,opinion,"With fourth quarter results getting released across all sectors  a few companies under the  sector have posted financial numbers  Two auto giants  Ford Motor Company   NYSE F   and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles   NYSE F    have already announced quarterly performance on Jan 25  While Ford s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Fiat Chrysler beat the same 
Now  let s evaluate how the four auto companies namely PACCAR Inc    NASDAQ PCAR    Harley Davidson  Inc    NYSE HOG    CNH Industrial N V    NYSE CNHI   and Autoliv  Inc    NYSE ALV   are placed ahead of reporting quarterly figures on Jan 30 
Per the latest   89 companies from the S P 500 category have already announced fourth quarter results as of Jan 24  registering earnings and revenue beat ratios of 80 9  and 74 2   respectively 
However  the auto sector s bottom line in the to be reported quarter is expected to record 12  growth while the top line is likely to witness a 5 1  year over year decline  However  the S P 500 companies are estimated to log a respective 10 8  and 7 3  year over year rise in earnings and revenues during the quarter 
Automakers are closely observing a shift in their customer preferences  A change in the buying pattern of consumers has compelled automakers to reassess their strategies  Nowadays  the auto sector is focusing more on developing its line up of pick up trucks and crossovers 
Now  let s take a look at the four auto companies scheduled to announce results on Jan 30 
We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model  combining a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold  with a positive   to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter  You can see  
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Per our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that with an ideal combination of the two key ingredients   Zacks Rank and ESP   chances of a positive surprise are as high as 70  for the stocks lined up for an earnings release 
Headquartered in Bellevue  WA  PACCAR primarily engages in the designing and manufacturing of premium light  medium and heavy duty trucks  Additionally  it develops and manufactures advanced diesel engines and distributes truck parts related to its primary business  Our model does not predict that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around with an Earnings ESP of  1 34  and a Zacks Rank  3 as the combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive 
Last quarter  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Per its impressive earnings history  the company beat estimates thrice and missed on a single count in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 1 48   PACCAR has a long term earnings growth rate of 10    Read more    
PACCAR Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   Milwaukee  WI based Harley Davidson is a leading manufacturer and seller of custom  cruiser and touring motorcycles  It also offers related apparels  accessories and related service parts for riders  Last quarter  the company s earnings matched the estimates  Also  it happened to deliver two positive earnings surprises  missed estimates once and posted in line results on another occasion in the trailing four quarters with an average miss of 0 39  
The company has a long term growth rate of 8 5   Per our model  it seems that Harley Davidson is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  That is because it has an Earnings ESP of  0 84  and a Zacks Rank  3   Read more    
Harley Davidson  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   CNH Industrial engages in designing  producing and distributing vehicles ranging from tractors  trucks to buses  It also offers powertrain solutions for on and off road plus marine vehicles  The company is a Zacks  3 Ranked player and its 0 00  Earnings ESP make surprise prediction difficult  However  CNH Industrial surpassed expectations with an average beat of 29 21  in all the trailing four quarters 
CNH Industrial N V  Price and EPS Surprise
   Based in Stockholm  Sweden  Autoliv is a worldwide leader in automotive safety  It engages in development  manufacturing and marketing of airbags  seatbelts and steering wheels  Last quarter  the company exceeded the earnings estimates  Per its mixed earnings track record  it outpaced as well as missed estimates twice  respectively  leading to an average beat of 2 46  
Autoliv has a long term growth rate of 8 2   Our model does not conclusively show that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around as it has an Earnings ESP of  1 34  and is also a  3 Ranked player  which leaves surprise prediction inconclusive 
Autoliv  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   In view of the above findings  it appears that PACCAR  Autoliv and CNH Industrial are not expected to come up with an earnings beat in fourth quarter 2017  while Harley Davidson is likely to beat the estimate

116494,338009,ALV,Nvidia  NVDA  Stock Gains As Analysts Become Bullish On AI Future,opinion,"Shares of Nvidia Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA   gained more than 2 5  in early morning trading Monday after several key analysts noted that the graphics chipmaker is positioned well in several emerging tech markets  including the artificial intelligence space 
In a recent note to clients  Citigroup  NYSE C  analyst Atif Malik praised Nvidia s new partnership with Chinese internet giant Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    which will see the two companies work hand in hand on a number of AI based projects 
Baidu will work to implement Nvidia s Volta GPUs into its cloud infrastructure  while Nvidia will provide its Drive PX system to Baidu s ongoing self driving car programs with Chinese automakers  Nvidia s Volta GPUs will also be optimized for Baidu s PaddlePaddle open source deep learning platform 
Malik mentioned how Baidu s chief operations officer recently said that China is entering an AI era  and the search engine behemoth is poised to break into that market 
 On top of the core business  search  mobile Baidu  and newsfeed   Baidu has expanded into new businesses like finance  cloud service  DuerOS  and autonomous driving all based on its AI technology   Malik said 
The analyst would ultimately conclude that Nvidia will also benefit from continued adoption of artificial intelligence technology 
In addition to its agreement with Baidu  Nvidia also recently announced a partnership with Volkswagen   OTC VLKAY    Volvo  and Autoliv   NYSE ALV   to develop next generation software systems for self driving cars  also read    
In a similar vein to Citigroup s note  a recent report from Jeffries mentioned Nvidia as a leader in what the firm is calling the  4th tectonic shift in computing  
According to Jeffries  every 15 years  an accumulation of technological innovations creates  tectonic shifts  in the existing computing model  The firm cited three previous shifts  a shift from mainframes to mini computers in the 60s  a shift to PCs in the early 80s  and a shift to cellphones and data centers in the late 90s 
 We believe we are at the start of the 4th tectonic shift now  to a parallel processing   IoT model  driven by lower memory costs  free data storage  improvements in parallel processing hardware and software  and improvements in AI technologies like neural networking that make it easy to monetize all the data that is being stored   the firm wrote 
Jeffries raised its price target for NVDA to  180 from  140  citing its belief that the company will be a  key beneficiary  of this new tectonic shift  The firm also noted Nvidia s  pole position  in deep learning applications and its decade long investment in parallel programming as reasons to be bullish on the stock

116495,338010,ALV,Should Value Investors Consider Autoliv  ALV  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Autoliv  Inc    NYSE ALV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Autoliv has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 5  While Autoliv s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 16 6 over the past five years  it stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a solid entry point However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks Auto sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 3  This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Autoliv s forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value  so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company s share price as of now  We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Autoliv has a P S ratio of about 1 1  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  This suggests that the stock is undervalued from the P S aspect as well Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Autoliv currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Autoliv a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Autoliv might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A  This gives ALV a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one upward estimate revision in the past 30 days compared to two downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a small impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has slipped by 0 7  in the past month  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Autoliv  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAutoliv is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  this Zacks Rank  3 company has a solid Zacks Industry Rank  among Bottom 15  of more than 250 industries   which hints at favorable broader factors  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a

116534,338049,ALV,Does Autoliv  ALV  Look To Be A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Autoliv  Inc    NYSE ALV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Autoliv has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 12  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 34  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Autoliv s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Automotive   Original Equipment industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 17  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Autoliv has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 54  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate In near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Autoliv has a P S ratio of about 0 94  This is far lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ALV is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Autoliv currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Autoliv a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Autoliv might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives ALV a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  The current quarter has seen no estimates going higher in the past sixty days compared to seven lower  while the full year estimate has seen no upward and ten downward movements in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 7 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dropped  by 3 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Autoliv  Inc  Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAutoliv is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  with a strong industry rank  Top 16  out of more than 250 industry   it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Automotive   Original Equipment industry has clearly outrperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name

116556,338071,ALV,June Market Strategy  U S  Expansion Carries On,opinion,"The following is an excerpt from John Blank s   To access the full PDF   
The title of this Zacks Market Strategy piece openly hints at my bull thesis  The U S  expansion carries on  Following that expansion tune    the S P 500 
June Strategy Update
We were trading around 2100 on the S P 500 in early June  The S P 500 breaks thru its high at 2135  Weak Q1 16 U S earnings can only be ignored via a summer 2016 look ahead to 2017  Earnings and revenue growth are not expected to return until 2H 2016 
Yes  the U S  remains in expansion  Recent monthly labor market evidence was NOT conclusive  however  
The U S  created just  38K new jobs in May  The number of new jobs was the smallest the economy created since the fall of 2010  Consensus had pegged an increase of  155K nonfarm jobs 
Given the screwy May jobs report  three caveats ask for inclusion Jobs figures were likely suppressed by a strike of about 35 000 Verizon workers  That began in late April and stretched through May A bout of  unusually cool  and  very wet  weather hit certain U S  regions  This may have also hit job growth estimates Consensus had expected a  weak reading  on employment at retailers  following a mild decline in April  This was payback for gains that averaged more than  50K a month in the first quarter of 2016 In a twist going the other way  the U S  unemployment fell to 4 7  rate in May after having ticked back up to 5 0  in March 2016  That s frictional unemployment Zacks June Sector Industry Company Telescope
The U S  consumer did show up strongly in late May macro data  It clearly helped analysts to upgrade earnings estimates for consumer sectors  In sum  Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary are back to the top of the S P 500 sector pack 
Materials   another Very Attractive sector   were led by industries that supply consumers 
Interestingly  deep defensives got upgraded to Market Weight  Financials are at the back of the heap  That shows the super low interest rate environment keeps a bid on dividend paying defensives and off rate earning banks 
 1  Consumer Staples upgraded to Very Attractive  The Food and Soaps   Cosmetics Industries lead the way  Tobacco  Food Drug Retail  and Misc  Staples all look good too 
Zacks  2 Rank  BUY  Company  Church   Dwight    NYSE CHD   
Church   Dwight Co  Inc  is the world s leading producer of sodium bicarbonate  baking soda   a versatile chemical  They sell their products  primarily under the ARM   HAMMER trademark  to consumers through supermarkets  drug stores and mass merchandisers and to industrial customers distributors 
 2  Materials keep on at Very Attractive  The best is Chemicals and Metals non Ferrous  Paper  and Containers   Glass  Those are tied to consumption 
Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Company  BASF    OTC BASFY   
BASF is the world s leading chemical company  Its portfolio ranges from chemicals  plastics  performance products and agricultural products to oil and gas 
 3  Consumer Discretionary upgraded to Attractive   Industry leaders are the big cyclicals of Home Furnishing Appliances and Autos Tires Trucks  Publishing and Other Consumer Discretionary also look good 
Zacks  1 Ranked  STRONG BUY  Company  Autoliv   NYSE ALV   
Autoliv Inc  is a worldwide leader in automotive safety  a pioneer in both seatbelts and airbags  and a technology leader with the widest product offering for automotive safety  All the leading automobile manufacturers in the world are customers 
 4  Health Care falls back to Attractive  Medical Care is best  Drugs and Medical Services are Market Weight 
 5  Industrials fell one notch to Attractive  Metal Fabricators  Business Services  Railroads  and Electrical Machinery lead the way here 
 6  Telcos are a Market Weight 
 7  Utilities are a Market Weight 
 8  Energy falls back to a Market Weight   Oil   Gas Integrated looks best  Drillers remain in the tank  along with Oil Misc 
 9  Info Tech fell to a Market Weight  The best is Electronics  The worst is Computer Office equipment 
 10  Financials are still Unattractive  The best is Real Estate and Banks Major and Banks   Thrifts  The worst is Investment Funds

116557,338072,ALV,Why Autoliv  ALV  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report  Consider Autoliv  Inc    NYSE ALV    a firm in the Consumer Goods industry  which could be a great candidate for another beat 
This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  In fact  in these reports  ALV has beaten estimates by at least 10  in both cases  suggesting it has a nice short term history of crushing expectations 
Earnings in Focus
Two quarters ago  ALV expected to post earnings of  1 88 per share  while it actually produced earnings of  2 08 per share  a beat of 10 7   Meanwhile  for the most recent quarter  the company looked to deliver earnings of  1 50 per share  while it actually produced earnings of  1 66 per share instead  a beat of 10 7  
Thanks in part to this history  recent estimates have been moving higher for Autoliv  In fact  the  for ALV is positive  which is a great sign of a coming beat 
After all  the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus  looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late  suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This is the case for ALV  as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2 27   so another beat could be around the corner 
This is particularly true when you consider that BRC has a great Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile  And when you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP  of the time  so it seems pretty likely that ALV could see another beat at its next report  especially if recent trends are any guide ",2016-06-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-autoliv-(alv)-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200134252,200134252

What s Weighing on Cooper Tire 
Cooper Tire has been facing weakness in revenues as its Chinese joint venture partner  Chengshan Group Company Ltd  decided to exercise its option to purchase the former s 65  ownership stake in Cooper Chengshan  Shandong  Tire Company Ltd    CCT    As a result  in Dec 2014  Cooper Tire sold its share for  262 million net of taxes  The sale of interest in CCT was primarily responsible for a year over year decline of 13 2  in the company s 2015 revenues 
Cooper Tire s first quarter 2016 revenues also dropped 2  year over year to  650 million  Further  revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  675 million  Revenues declined due to the adverse impact of price and mix  and currency changes  partially offset by an increase in unit volume 
Americas Tire Operations recorded a 3 2  decrease in revenues in the quarter to  579 million due to unfavorable price and mix  negative foreign currency impact  and lower unit volume  International Tire Operations reported a 3 6  fall in revenues to  103 million  mainly due to unfavorable price and mix  and negative foreign currency impact  partially offset by higher unit volume 
Cooper Tire had cash and cash equivalents of  434 million as of Mar 31  2016  down from  449 million as of Mar 31  2015

116571,338086,ALV,Autoliv  ALV   Moving Average Crossover Alert,opinion,"Autoliv  Inc    NYSE ALV   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for ALV broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 4  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for ALV stock 
If that wasn t enough Autoliv isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  6 estimates have been reduced  while none have moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for ALV ",2016-08-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/autoliv-(alv):-moving-average-crossover-alert-200148006,200148006

Indeed  with macroeconomic and sociopolitical uncertainties engulfing the world of investment  risk averse investors are in favor of companies bearing a low amount of debt  Of course  debt financing forms a crucial strategy of corporate financing  but too much debt bears the risk of dragging a company into financial distress 
This is because leverage holds the potential to move a company s earnings both up and down 
Historically  varied leverage ratios have been constructed to measure the extent of leverage that a company bears  One such renowned measure is debt to equity ratio 
The Formula
Debt to Equity Ratio   Total Liabilities Shareholders  Equity
A lower debt to equity ratio implies a more financially stable business  thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity  With the first quarter earnings season almost over  investors must be eager to spend money on stocks exhibiting a surge in earnings  But if the stocks bear a high debt to equity ratio  in times of economic downturns their so called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare 
So  instead of targeting stocks showing an earnings boom  which might be short lived  it would be wise for investors to go after those which are financially more secure and immune to financial bankruptcy

116609,338124,ALV,4 Automotive Stocks That Are Strong Buys Now,opinion,"The auto sector holds promise right now  given the strong sales volumes and impressive first quarter 2016 results  Low fuel costs  pent up demand  high incentives  favorable macroeconomic factors and attractive vehicle launches are boosting sales in the key auto markets of the U S   China and Europe 
U S  light vehicle sales remain strong  with a 3 3  rise to 5 6 million units in the first four months of 2016  The increase is commendable  given that sales hit an all time record in 2015  Total automobile sales in China also improved 6 1  during this period  while passenger car registrations in the European Union increased 8 5  
Moreover  low fuel prices are resulting in higher miles driven  thereby increasing the demand for replacement parts  The high average age of cars is also boosting replacement demand for both cars and car parts 
While the auto industry has several reasons to be optimistic  a number of challenges remain  The negative impact of foreign currency translation remains a major headwind for the auto sector 
Safety recalls and related costs have also become a major issue for most automakers in recent years  Following a record number of recalls in the last two years  auto recalls are set to be high this year as well  thanks to defective Takata airbag inflators  The Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG emission scandal is also resulting in a large number of recalls 
Still  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic on the broader auto industry for both the short and long term  According to IHS Automotive  global auto sales are expected to rise 2 7  to nearly 89 8 million units this year
