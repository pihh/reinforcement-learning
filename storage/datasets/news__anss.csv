12409,233924,ANSS,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  ANSYS  Citrix  Cadence And Adobe,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   June 22  2018   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Computer Software  including ANSYS  Inc    NASDAQ ANSS    Citrix Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CTXS    Cadence Design Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CDNS   and Adobe Systems  Inc    NASDAQ ADBE  Industry  Computer SoftwareLink  The Computer Software industry is benefiting from continued strong digital transformation demand environment Software has become the focal point of technological innovation  The last few years have witnessed a series of breakthroughs in cloud computing  predictive analysis  artificial intelligence  AI   self driving vehicles  digital personal assistants and Internet of Things  IoT   consequently setting the stage for strong growth in the software industry Moreover  continued enterprise investment in big data and analytics along with the ongoing adoption of Software as a Service  SaaS  presents significant growth opportunity for industry players Notably  the cloud offers a flexible and cost effective platform to develop and test new applications and the deployment time is also much shorter as compared with legacy systems Additionally  the increasing need to secure cloud platforms  amid growing incidences of cyber attacks and hacking  continues to drive demand for cyber security software Further  as enterprises continue to move their on premise workload to cloud environments  emergence of hybrid cloud   application and infrastructure monitoring have gained utmost importance  This is creating more demand for performance management monitoring tools that are not only scalable but also suitable for cloud based environments Industry Returns PositiveRobust demand for software and continuing innovations have been the key catalysts to consistent earnings and impressive sales growth  These are mainly behind investor confidence instilled in the Computer Software industry s growth prospects The   within the broader   has outperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 34 1   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 13 7  and 19 2   respectively We believe the near term growth prospects are bright given increased spending by enterprises on software procurement Stretched Valuation a ConcernHowever  the Computer Software industry s valuation looks stretched at the moment  One might get a good sense of the industry s relative valuation by looking at its price to earnings ratio  P E   which essentially shows how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit of earnings Notably  a lower P E ratio is always better The industry currently has a forward 12 month P E ratio of 26 65  which is close to the highest level over the past year The space also looks expensive when compared with the market at large  as the forward 12 month P E ratio for the S P 500 is 17 14 and the median level is 18 28 Moreover  a comparison of the group s P E ratio with that of its border sector ensures that the group is trading at a huge premium  The Zacks Computer And Technology Sector s forward 12 month P E ratio of 19 71 and the median level of 20 50 for the same period are way below the Zacks Computer Software Industry s respective ratios Improving Earnings Outlook to Drive OutperformanceNevertheless  strong industry fundamentals and expectations of solid top line growth should help Computer Software stocks continue generating positive shareholder returns in the near future Investors would also be eager to watch whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead  One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies  Empirical research shows that a company s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock One could get a good sense of a company s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year s reported number  but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry of  3 13 per share reflects solid year over year improvement  Moreover  the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group s earnings potential The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 2 6  upward since Mar 31  2018 Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued outperformance in the near term The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  63  which places it at the top 25  of more than 256 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Long Term Growth Prospects StrongThe long term  3 5 years  EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer Software industry appears promising  The group s mean estimate of long term EPS growth rate has remained steady since March 2018 to reach the current level of 11 89   This compares to 9 8  for the Zacks S P 500 composite Computer Software s long term growth prospects are alluring  Growing adoption of hybrid cloud computing models  rapid usage of AI and machine learning tools  the proliferation of wearables   self driving vehicles and increasing automation of the application development process bode well for the industry Moreover  the growing usage of Internet of Things  IoT  at home  in office  for cars and every other conceivable place is also an incredible business driver  These factors are expected to drive top line growth that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016 Another indication of solid long term prospects is the improvement in the group s gross margin Bottom LineThe role of software is evolving  Apart from running devices and applications  its usage is expanding in managing infrastructure  Moreover  the industry is significantly benefiting from the ongoing cloud transition SaaS companies are expected to register strong top line growth due to a higher percentage of recurring revenues  subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate  Moreover  strong spending by enterprises is a positive Moreover  software companies are poised to benefit the most from Trump s repatriation policy  This enhanced liquidity is expected to boost their appetite for strategic acquisitions Despite stretched valuations  investors can build positions in the Computer Software industry based on the above mentioned factors as well as strong earnings outlook Here  we list four stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see   ANSYS Inc   The stock of this Pittsburgh  PA based engineering simulation software and services provider has jumped 45 1  over the past year  The Zacks Consensus

12512,234027,ANSS,3 Things Under the Radar This Week,news,"Investing com   Three things that flew under the radar this week 

1  The Nasdaq 100 Welcomes New Stocks

Every year  Nasdaq analysts evaluate all the stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index and cull some in favor of up and comers they believe better represent the dynamics of the economy 
Late Friday  Nasdaq said it was adding six new stocks and cutting six current members of the index 

Coming in before the market opens on Dec  23 are 
  ANSYS    NASDAQ ANSS   which offers engineering simulation software and services CDW  NASDAQ CDW  a merchant of tech equipment and software Copart  NASDAQ CPRT   a leading online car auction company   CoStar Group   NASDAQ CSGP   which provides data analytics to the commercial real estate industry Seattle Genetics  NASDAQ SGEN   a biotech company focused on cancer cures Splunk  NASDAQ SPLK   SPLK   a top data analytics company 
Out will be 
Toy maker Hasbro  NASDAQ HAS  Medical and dental equipment and services company   Henry Schein    NASDAQ HSIC  National trucking company JB Hunt Transport Services Inc  NASDAQ JBHT  Generic drug maker Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  Cybersecurity company NortonLifeLock  NASDAQ NLOK   best known for its Norton suite of products Casino operator Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   which has huge presences in Las Vegas and Macau 
The problem with the outgoing stocks is they are mostly in industries with low growth prospects  toys for Hasbro   low profit margins  like J B  Hunt in the trucking industry  or exposed directly to geopolitical risks  Wynn in China  
Five of the newcomers are tech or tech related companies  Seattle Genetics  up 101  this year  is a hot biotech 

The new stocks are up an average 73 8  year to date  The weakest performer of the six is Splunk  still up nearly 37  compared with 34  for the Nasdaq 100 overall  It may also be a takeover candidate 

The departing stocks are up an average 21  this year  but Mylan is down 30  for the year 
2  Retail Sales Slipping at the Worst Time
Economic data was lost in the shuffle for the second Friday in a row as the continuous   and at times somewhat contradictory    statements from the U S  and China on the phase 1 trade deal garnered all the attention 
This time it was a tepid retail sales report that lost the spotlight  But investors should take note as the latest numbers don t bode well for a festive holiday shopping season 

Retail sales for November rose just 0 2   That was well off the 0 5  rise that economists had predicted according to forecasts compiled by Investing com  Core retail sales  which exclude autos  ticked up 0 1   shy of the 0 4  rise expected 
The consensus estimates may have been so strong due to bullish reports of record Black Friday sales  although Cyber Monday sales did land in December 
The numbers look especially anemic in comparison to the first eight months of the year  where retail sales averaged a monthly rise of 0 7  
 Spending at traditional department stores alone was down 7  from a year ago  while spending at clothing and accessory stores was off 3  from a year ago   Grant Thornton Chief Economist    That bodes well for those looking for more discounts this holiday season but suggests another round of retail bankruptcies in early 2020 as the broader retail market continues to adjust to consumers  shifting preferences for online instead of in store shopping  
 The consumer should look a lot stronger in December  too late for many retailers to move the needle on margins  which are already razor thin   Swonk added 
Keith McCullugh of Hedgeye Risk Management tweeted that his Nowcast for fourth quarter GDP ticked down to 0 36  after the retail sales numbers arrived 






The Atlanta Fed  remained at 2  for 4Q  the same as last week 
3  Machine Over Man
The effect of computerized trading and algorithms has been very clear to anyone following the stock market lately amid the trade war induced swings 
The indexes and futures have been spiking and diving based on one headline or tweet and then just as quickly reversing course on new information before retail investors have a chance to react 
The Economist analyzed the rise of the machines in October  looking at  31 trillion in U S  equities and it concluded that more are managed by computers and humans 

Statista broke this down with a very handy  this week 
Looking at the chart  35 1  of those U S  equities are now managed by automatic  or computerized  funds  That s followed by 25 3  managed by entities and governments and insurers  24 5  managed by humans and 15 3  held by companies ",2019-12-14,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/3-things-under-the-radar-this-week-2041357,2041357

 The Zacks analyst believes that AT T is improving critical services that support Public Safety and first responders using the FirstNet communications platform  The wireless carrier s LTE network

12537,234052,ANSS,4 Chip Stocks To Gain From China s Reliance On US Tech,opinion,Chip stocks witnessed a strong rally in 2019  largely driven by investors  optimism over a U S  China trade deal  This is because these companies have considerable exposure to the world s biggest chip market   China In addition  developments in the semiconductor industry last year brought the significance of U S  chip enabled products to the forefront for many crucial Chinese tech products and supply chains These developments coupled with an improving U S  China trade ties are bound to drive the semiconductor industry American Chip Design Tech is Paramount for China  Here s WhyA major factor driving the importance of U S  technology for China is the country s reliance on specific American technologies for its supply chains To look at this arrangement closely  one may note that the development of these supply chains requires tools that produce the hardware and software that design the integrated circuits that essentially make computer chips function  Therefore  the functionality of China s entire technology intensive supply chains comes down to the operations in the American chip design tools industry It is imperative to consider the significance of global semiconductor firms  and more specifically  American chipmakers here  This is because the chip design tools industry is dominated by just four U S  based companies  namely  Synopsys  Inc    NASDAQ SNPS    Cadence Design Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CDNS    ANSYS  Inc    NASDAQ ANSS   and Mentor Graphics  These four companies control 90  of the world market  as of 2018   according to S2C data Semiconductor Stocks at the ForefrontThis dependence on prominent U S  chipmakers naturally brings semiconductor stocks to investors  watch list  Since chipmakers comprise the majority of top U S  companies with revenue exposure to China  these are most sensitive to the upcoming U S  China trade agreement The much awaited phase one U S  China trade agreement is set to be signed on Jan 15  which promises to de escalate the tariff war  The deal is also expected to protect U S  intellectual property and drive penetration of U S  companies into the fast growing Chinese markets According to Evercore ISI  China accounted for 35  of global semiconductor sales in 2018  Therefore  with de escalation in the U S  China trade war  one can anticipate a possible rally in semiconductor stocks in the near future as demand for chip enabled products gain traction in both the countries Second  semiconductors form an integral part of almost every crucial  in demand tech product at present  These chip enabled products infiltrate everything  including those under the tariff fire right now  The upcoming U S  China trade deal is likely to help in that aspect as well 4 Chip Stocks to Buy in 2020 We have chosen four semiconductor stocks that are well positioned to gain this year from the aforementioned factors  All of these stocks carry
