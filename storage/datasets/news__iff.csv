Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  IFF presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/international-flavors-iff-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200434187,200434187

115152,336667,IFF,Earnings Preview  International Flavors  IFF  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects International Flavors  IFF  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This ingredients producer for food  cosmetics and consumer products industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 50 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 28 billion  up 37 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 83  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for International Flavors 
For International Flavors  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that International Flavors will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that International Flavors would post earnings of  1 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 22  delivering a surprise of  5 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
International Flavors doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-international-flavors-iff-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200412428,200412428

115159,336674,IFF,This Is Why International Flavors  IFF  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
International Flavors in Focus
Headquartered in New York  International Flavors  IFF  is a Basic Materials stock that has seen a price change of 0 95  so far this year  The ingredients producer for food  cosmetics and consumer products industries is paying out a dividend of  0 73 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 15  compared to the Chemical   Specialty industry s yield of 0 43  and the S P 500 s yield of 2  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 92 is up 2 8  from last year  International Flavors has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12 66   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  International Flavors s payout ratio is 49   which means it paid out 49  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
IFF is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 31 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 0 48  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  IFF presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-05-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-international-flavors-iff-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200424850,200424850

115169,336684,IFF,Shareholder pushes for changes at flavor maker Senomyx  letter,news,"By Harry Brumpton
 Reuters    A shareholder is calling on flavoring company  Senomyx  Inc  O SNMX  that works with PepsiCo Inc  O PEP  to drop its current chairman  to sell itself and add a new board seat  according to a letter reviewed by Reuters 
One of the company s large shareholders  Matthew Turk  who said he owns 4 percent of shares  or more than 1 9 million shares of common stock  is skeptical of the San Diego company s announced plans to explore a strategic review  and hopes to turn around its fortunes after its stock has lost 78 percent of its value since it went public in 2004  the investor said in the letter on Tuesday 
The flavors and ingredients space has been undergoing consolidation and growth as food multinationals  facing slowing growth for legacy food and drinks brands  adjust their offerings to appeal to new and healthier tastes  Last month  International Flavors   Fragrances Inc  N IFF  agreed to buy Israeli flavors and ingredients maker  Frutarom  Industries Ltd  TA FRUT  for  7 1 billion in cash and stock 
 There must not be a slow liquidation of Senomyx  but rather a complete sale either in whole or in parts as quickly as possible to preserve remaining shareholder value   Turk said 
Senomyx  which had a market capitalization of  62 8 million at the close of trading on Monday  could not immediately be reached for comment 
The company has seen its stock decline since Pepsi stopped a trial partnership involving using Senomyx ingredients in drinks such as Mug Root Beer ahead of what was widely expected to be a U S  nationwide rollout in late 2016 
The company still has a non exclusive agreement with Pepsi that runs until 2019  where Pepsi has access to natural flavor ingredients and sweeteners that were developed during their partnership  according to a news release  Pepsi could not be reached for comment 
Since changing the terms of its deal with Pepsi  the management team has not set up any new commercial partnerships despite claiming to have interest from at least 25 companies  Turk said ",2018-06-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/shareholder-pushes-for-changes-at-flavor-maker-senomyx-letter-1489298,1489298

115195,336710,IFF,International Flavors Rides On Acquisitions  Costs Rise,opinion,We issued an updated research report on International Flavors   Fragrances Inc    NYSE IFF   on Jan 21  The company will gain on cost cutting efforts  productivity initiatives  acquisitions and growth in global market for flavors and fragrances  particularly in emerging markets  Meanwhile  input cost inflation  disruptions in the supply chain owing to issues across International Flavors   Fragrances  ingredients suppliers and huge debt levels is likely to impact results in the near term  Let s take a brief look at the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds  Factors Favoring International Flavors   Fragrances Acquisitions Aid Growth  Over time  the company has made meaningful acquisitions  which have helped expand offerings and in turn profitability  In October 2018  the company completed the acquisition of Frutarom  an Israeli company which develops  produces and markets flavors and fine ingredients  Together  International Flavors   Fragrances and Frutarom will create a global leader in natural taste  scent and nutrition with a broader customer base  more diversified product offerings and greater exposure to end markets  Frutarom is expected to be accretive to International Flavors   Fragrances  fourth quarter 2018 top and bottom line results  The company provided sales guidance of  3 95  4 05 billion and earnings per share guidance of  6 25  6 45 for fiscal 2018  The company anticipates generating cost synergies of  145 million through raw material harmonization  footprint optimization and streamlining overhead expenses for third full year after the completion of the merger  International Flavors   Fragrances expects the acquisition to aid the top line by 5 7  and growth of more than 10  in adjusted EPS going forward  Recently  International Flavors announced that its Frutarom Division has completed the previously announced buyout of 60  share capital of Mighty  a Thailand based leading savory solutions company  Notably  Mighty produces  develops and markets reaction flavors  with an expertise in savory solutions  The company has a portfolio of marinades  seasoning blends  flavors and specialty functional raw materials for the food and beverage industry  The deal is in sync with Frutarom Division s growth strategy in Southeast Asia as well as pursuing attractive companies  Moreover  the company is committed to enhance its capabilities in savory solutions  Emerging Markets to Fuel Demand  The global market for flavors and fragrances continues to grow fueled by increasing demand for a variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances  The market which was around  24 8 billion in 2017 is projected to grow approximately 2 3  by 2021  primarily driven by anticipated growth in emerging markets  Growing economy in these countries bolsters demand for consumer products  and in turn the demand for flavors and fragrances used in them  Consequently  International Flavors   Fragrances is focused on gaining share in emerging markets with sales in these emerging markets accounting for around 48  of 2017 sales  Over the past five years  the company s currency neutral sales growth rate in emerging markets has outpaced that of developed markets  Backed by the company s global presence  diversified business platform  broad product portfolio  global and regional customer base  it will be able to capitalize on the expansion in flavors and fragrances markets and deliver long term growth  Cost Saving Initiatives to Aid Results  In February 2017  the company entered into a multi year productivity program designed to improve overall financial performance  provide flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and drive long term value creation  This initiative will enable the company to check costs  make strategic investments and expand businesses globally  This initiative is anticipated to result in the reduction of approximately 370 members of its global workforce  By the end of 2019  the company anticipates this productivity program to yield annualized savings in the range of  40  45 million  Factors Working Against International Flavors   Fragrances Share Price Performance  Poor Valuation  In the last year  International Flavors  shares have fallen 9 8   compared with the  s decline of 7 4    On a P E  TTM  basis  the company s shares look overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 22 0x and 18 6x in the last year  Rising Costs   Expenses to Dent Margins  Over time  the company has been grappling with the adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses  Further  the company s cost of sales increased 9  over the year ago comparable period in the first nine months of 2018  owing to higher input costs  Adjusted selling  general and administrative along with research and development expenses grew 6  in the first nine months of 2018  In 2018  higher costs of raw materials across a range of categories  including turpentine  citrus and petro derived products  will continue to impact margins  We believe  if unchecked  higher costs and operating expenses are likely to prove detrimental to its margins and profitability  Supply Chain Challenges to Impact Results  In 2017  a fire at the manufacturing facility of BASF Group   BASF    one of the company s suppliers  compelled them to declare a force majeure and resulted in a disruption of the availability of certain ingredients used in some of the fragrance and flavor compounds  This BASF supply chain disruption issue impacted the margins of the Fragrances segment in the first three quarters of 2018  which is likely to persist in the remaining part of 2018 as well  High Debt Level a Concern  The company s total debt total equity was pegged at 108  at the end of third quarter 2018  which is a concerning factor  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A few better ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Ingevity Corporation   NYSE NGVT    Cameco Corporation   NYSE CCJ   and Israel Chemicals Ltd    NYSE ICL    All the three stocks sport a Zacks

115197,336712,IFF,Analysts Estimate International Flavors  IFF  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects International Flavors  IFF  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This ingredients producer for food  cosmetics and consumer products industries is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 23 billion  up 43 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for International Flavors 
For International Flavors  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that International Flavors will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that International Flavors would post earnings of  1 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 54  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
International Flavors doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-international-flavors-iff-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200384400,200384400
115200,336715,IFF,International Flavors  IFF  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Miss Estimates,opinion,"International Flavors  IFF  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 22 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 29 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 40 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  5 43   A quarter ago  it was expected that this ingredients producer for food  cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of  1 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 54  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
International Flavors  which belongs to the Zacks Chemical   Specialty industry  posted revenues of  1 22 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 89   This compares to year ago revenues of  854 63 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
International Flavors shares have added about 8 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 5  
What s Next for International Flavors 
While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 68 on  1 33 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 63 on  5 39 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

115203,336718,IFF,What s in a scent  Perfume makers adapt to EU rules,news,"By Astrid Wendlandt  PARIS  Reuters    Seaweed may not be the first ingredient that springs to mind for perfume  But algae are among obscure ingredients to which perfume makers are turning to preserve the scent of their fragrances in the face of new EU anti allergy restrictions   The global high end perfume industry  generating  25 billion in annual sales  is readying itself for EU regulations that will come into force in early 2015    These will ban widely used ingredients such as oak moss  a natural substance  that was found in the original versions of best sellers including Chanel s No 5 and Miss Dior    Perfume creators say they love oak moss for its woody  earthy notes which give it depth and help make scent last longer  But on the grounds that between one and three percent of the EU population could suffer an allergic reaction   such as dermatitis   Brussels is banning two of its core molecules  atranol and chloroatranol   Perfume makers will only be allowed to use oak moss from which these two molecules have been removed  The makers say this results in a much lighter and less vigorous scent    I am crazy about oak moss  it is one of my favorite ingredients   says Marc Antoine Corticchiato  perfume creator or  nose  at his niche Parfum d Empire brand  A 100 ml bottle of scent costs 120 euros    Corticchiato  like many other  noses   is anxious about the new wave of potentially costly rules emanating from Brussels   The fragrance industry that supplies perfume makers like Corticchiato already has its own self regulation body   the International Fragrance Association  IFRA    financed by providers such as Givaudan  New York listed International Flavors   Fragrances  and Germany s Symrise  It has imposed restrictions on a growing list of ingredients over the years for various health reasons    In addition  perfume makers do a lot of their own in house and post market surveillance and do their own testing  which can cost several hundred thousands euros a year  depending on the number of products and ingredients involved   Leading brands such as Chanel  Dior and Hermes have  noses  and their own research laboratories  They do not publish figures for the costs associated with them but industry experts estimate them to be in the order of several million euros a year    A TOUCH OF ALGAE  One solution for oak moss  Corticchiato says  is to add a touch of algae as its wet  iodized smell coupled with other ingredients  can help recreate oak moss  moldy character    The European Commission is also banning a synthetic molecule called HICC  or lyral  which replicates the smell of lily of the valley  It too can cause dermatitis in allergy sufferers   L Oreal  which makes Lancome and Armani perfumes  said it was looking for alternatives  It declined to say which of its perfumes contained lyral     Perfume makers say they understand that their products need to be safe and recognize how damaging to their reputation any serious allergic reaction would be   But some say the industry is being unfairly targeted  Up until now  they say  there have only been minor cases of allergies manifested by skin irritations or eczema    I think Brussels  focus is a little exaggerated specially compared to alcohol and cigarettes which are sold freely and do more harm than perfume   says Patricia de Nicola  who created the French Nicola  perfume brand with her husband 25 years ago    She says she has never received a complaint about allergy but has reformulated some of her best sellers such as New York and Eau d Ete because they used oak moss and lyral respectively   The European Union denies targeting perfume any more than any other industry and says its new regulation seeks to address scientists  and doctors  concerns about the health hazards related to the use of perfume     NORTH SOUTH PERFUME LINES  Some inside the perfume industry say lobby groups representing the interests of tobacco firms are better financed and better organized than those representing perfume makers   One reason is the sheer size of the global cigarette industry  In sales terms  it is more than three times the size of the perfume industry  Cigarette lobby groups include the tobacco manufacturers  association and the tobacco retailer s alliance   By comparison  perfume makers rely on Cosmetics Europe  a bulky organization that represents 4 000 companies including deodorant  toothpaste and perfume providers which have very disparate interests   Even within the perfume industry  there is no united front as some brands are more affected than others by IFRA and new EU regulation   One of the industry s biggest players  L Oreal  says it uses mainly synthetic ingredients in its perfumes  These ingredients raise fewer allergy concerns than natural products found in niche perfumes and brands such as Chanel and LVMH s Dior and Guerlain   Another issue is that perfumes are not protected by intellectual property rights  The composition of a perfume is not legally recognized as a  creation of the mind  but rather an industrial formula that can be replicated and altered    Many perfumes have had to be reformulated even though they were considered masterpieces due to changing legislation   said Olivier Maure  head of Accords et Parfums  a supplier of major brands including Dior based in Grasse  likening it to  changing the colors of the Mona Lisa    Some industry executives say Brussels  recent focus on the perfume industry stems from its main advisory body  the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety  SCCS   Many of the committee s members come from northern countries such as Sweden and Denmark where there is opposition to perfume on health grounds     Clearly  there are more experts at the SCCS who are based in northern Europe than in the south but it is not a deliberate choice   said David Hudson  spokesman for consumer policy at the European Commission   We strive for geographic and gender balance but the primary selection criteria is expertise    Perfume is not as important to the economies of northern Europe as it is to southern countries  Perfumes and cosmetics are among France s top five exports and the southern city of Grasse is the historic capital of the perfume industry where many leading brands such as Chanel  Hermes and Dior source their essences    Added to that  research shows people from northern regions tend to be more vulnerable to allergies than those living around the Mediterranean  One theory is that people in northern countries are more susceptible because of their lifestyle and generally cleaner environment    MORE RESTRICTIONS TO FOLLOW   The SCCS published a report in July 2012 which recommended banning oak moss s core molecules and severely restricting the use of many core ingredients such as linalool  found in lavender  a move that threatened the high end of the perfume industry which relied heavily on these ingredients   Brussels included a few of the SCCS s recommendations  such as its ban on oak moss  and pledged to investigate what levels of concentrations could be considered safe for natural ingredients so that consumers did not develop allergies to them over time    Perfume makers are worried that this will lead to more restrictions  There have been suggestions that they should offer two types of perfumes   some with allergens in them and consumer advice about the content  and others with no allergen    I expected big groups to take the initiative on this matter but it turns out that they are the most risk averse   said Corticchiato  One problem for big perfume brands is that their label sells a dream which is incompatible with the message  this product may cause allergies    Dior  Guerlain and parent LVMH declined to comment for this article as did Hermes   Chanel said it stopped using lyral in 2010 and has been evolving its formulas in anticipation of new rules    At Chanel  we follow very closely talks about regulation and scientific findings concerning raw materials   Jacques Polge  Chanel s chief perfume creator for 36 years  said in an emailed response to questions   Polge said Chanel controls its formulas and supply chains to ensure its natural oak moss is bereft of the allergens targeted by Brussels  That way   we can respect the original scent    But  once you change an ingredient or two it can be very difficult to keep the scent absolutely intact  especially if those ingredients played an important role in defining the scent   says Maurice Roucel  creator of many perfumes including L Instant for Guerlain and Hermes s 24 Faubourg    
A few years ago  Roucel reformulated Dior s Fahrenheit perfume to remove lyral along with a few other ingredients and he is now working on the reformulation of about eight perfumes to make them meet new regulation     Big brands tell me  replace this and that and make sure it smells the same and costs the same to produce   Roucel said       Editing by Janet McBride ",2014-07-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/what's-in-a-scent -perfume-makers-adapt-to-eu-rules-293160,293160

customer base  gains from business expansion efforts and sound capital allocation strategies are key drivers for the company  On the flip side  risks related to international operations  high debts  rising costs and industry competition remain concerns The company  with a market capitalization of approximately  10 5 billion  currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Below  we briefly discussed the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring International Flavors   FragrancesNear  and Long Term Growth Potential Solid  International Flavors serves a wide customer base   through its two business segments  Flavors and Fragrances   in the food and beverage industries  Its products  including flavor compounds  fine fragrances  consumer fragrances and fragrance ingredients  are primarily used by manufacturers of perfume and toiletry  soaps  detergents  fabric care  household cleaners and air fresheners  Such diversity in the application areas of its products is a boon  Also  international diversity  especially the company s efforts for expansion in emerging nations  will be advantageous For 2018  International Flavors anticipates net sales growth to be 6 8  while predicting operating profit to grow 6 5 8 5   Earnings per share growth are likely to be around 5 5 7 5  In 2016 2020 time period  the company anticipates local currency sales to expand 4 6   operating profit to grow 7 9  and earnings per share to rise more than 10   Sales from acquired assets are predicted to range within  500 million to  1 billion  capital spending to be 3 3 5  of sales and cash returned to shareholders to be 50 60  of net income Strategic Initiatives  Expansion of product portfolio   through the addition of new and innovative compounds   has been a priority for International Flavors over time  It has a dedicated research and development wing working in these aspects  Also  several other initiatives like Tastepoint   a new company to serve middle market customers and Re Imagine   programs that enable capture of unaddressed opportunities in the food and beverage industry will prove beneficial in the quarters ahead  Additionally  it is working on a multi year productivity program  Through this program  it will be able to check on costs  make strategic investments and expand businesses globally  It intends to reduce the workforce by 5  globally  By the end of 2019  the company anticipates this productivity program to yield annualized savings of  40  45 million Acquisitions and Shareholders Return  Buyouts has been International Flavors  one of the preferred modes of business expansion  The acquisitions of David Michael   Company in October 2016  Fragrance Resources in January 2017 and PowderPure in April 2017 have proved beneficial since added to the company s portfolio Also  rewarding shareholders with dividend payments and share buybacks have worked in favor of the company  In 2017  it paid cash dividends of  206 1 million to its shareholders while using  58 1 million for repurchasing treasury stocks  In August 2017  it announced an 8  increase in its quarterly dividend rate while in November  it announced a  300 million share buyback program Factors Working Against International Flavors   FragrancesShare Price Performance  Poor Valuation   Earnings Estimates  In the last three months  International Flavors  shares have declined 13 3   worse than 7  decline recorded by the  On a P E  TTM  basis  the company s shares look overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 22 5x and 21 8x in the last three months  This makes us cautious about the stock  In addition  the stock s Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased 0 2  to  6 29 for 2018 and by 0 7  to  6 75 for 2019 Rising Costs   Expenses  Huge Debts Raise Concerns  International Flavors is exposed to risks  emanating from the rise in costs and expenses  In the fourth quarter of 2017  its cost of sales grew 14  year over year while research and development expenses increased 19  and adjusted selling and administrative expenses expanded 6 4   Margin profile was weak as adjusted gross margin slipped 110 bps year over year and adjusted operating margin fell 90 bps  Also  its long term debt was approximately  1 6 billion while exiting the quarter  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs and expenses  and huge debt levels can be detrimental to its profitability in the quarters ahead Threat From International Expansion   Industry Competition  Expansion of business in international arenas has exposed International Flavors to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies  Also  uncertainties in economic growth or reduction in consumer spending of the countries served can severely impact the company s businesses Moreover  International Flavors faces stiff competition from the companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses  Some key players in the

industrial gas producer and supplier currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  10 billion We briefly discussed the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds below Factors Favoring International Flavors   FragrancesDiversity and Strategic Initiatives a Boon  International Flavors serves a wide range of customers  including manufacturers of perfume and toiletry  soaps  detergents  fabric care  household cleaners and air fresheners  Also  the company s businesses are spread in North America  Europe  Africa and the Middle East  Latin America and Greater Asia  Such diversification helps the company to negate weaknesses in one or more business sources or operating areas In addition to diversity  the company s diligent efforts to innovate products  by a dedicated research and development wing  will be advantageous  Notably  the company s introduction of Veraspice   a fragrance ingredient  Re Imagine   programs that enable the company to pursue unaddressed opportunities in the food and beverage industry as well as assist the company in its innovation initiatives  and Tastepoint   a new company formed to serve middle market customers are worth mentioning here Also  the company has been working on its multi year productivity program  anticipated to yield annualized savings of  40  45 million by the end of 2019  These programs are predicted to help the company reduce its global workforce by 5   reduce costs  make suitable investments and expand business globally Acquisitions  Another interesting aspect about International Flavors is its acquisitive nature  Over time  the company has solidified its product portfolio and leveraged business opportunities through the addition of assets  Here  buyouts of David Michael   Company in October 2016  Fragrance Resources in January 2017 and PowderPure in April 2017 are worth mentioning In May 2018  the company signed an agreement to combine its operations with Frutarom  While anticipated to be neutral to earnings per share in the initial year of the deal closure  this buyout is predicted to yield double digits earnings accretion for the second year  Also  run rate cost synergies of  145 million are predicted to be realized by the third year For 2016 2020 timeframe  the company anticipates acquisitions to generate approximately  500 million to  1 billion in revenues Growth Projections  For 2018  International Flavors anticipates achieving better sales and operating income results  The company is now targeting the upper end of its previously issued sales and operating income growth projections of 6 8  and 6 5 8 5   respectively  Earnings per share are projected to increase 5 5 7 5  or 4 6  on a constant currency basis In the 2016 2020 timeframe  the company anticipates local currency sales to grow 4 6  while predicts operating income and earnings per share to expand 7 9  and more than 10   respectively  Results will benefit from business expansion in emerging markets and growth opportunities stemming from acquired assets  Capital spending will be 3 3 5  of net sales  Shareholders will be rewarded with returns amounting 50 60  of net income Factors Working Against International Flavors   FragrancesStock Performance and Earnings Estimates  In the last three months  International Flavors  shares have declined 11   underperforming 1 1  growth recorded by the  Moreover  earnings estimates on the company have been revised downward in the last 30 days  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  6 24 for 2018 and  6 79 for 2019  representing declines of 0 8  and 0 4  from their 30 day ago respective tallies  Also  the company has an  of  1 28  for 2018 and  3 09  for 2019  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Rising Costs   Expenses Raise Concerns  International Flavors is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and operating expenses  Notably  the company s cost of sales in the last five years  2013 2017  grew at 2 8   CAGR  while its operating expenses  including adjusted selling  general and administrative as well as research and development expenses  went up 2 4   The trajectory continued in the first quarter of 2018 as well  with costs and sales  and operating expenses increasing 13  and 7 6  from their respective tallies in the year ago comparable quarter  We believe that unwarranted rise in costs and expenses will prove detrimental to the company s margins and profitability Long Term Debt  International Flavors is a highly leveraged company  In the last five years  2013 2017   the company s long term debt has soared 11 8   CAGR  while grew roughly 2 7  sequentially to  1 676 million at the end of first quarter 2018  Also  the company s total debt total equity has increased from 63 6  in 2013 to 96 6  in 2017  It was 94 2  at the end of first quarter 2018  We believe  if unchecked  high debt levels can inflate the company s financial obligations and put pressure on margins Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the industry are DAQO New Energy Corp    NYSE DQ    Ferro Corporation   NYSE FOE

115271,336786,IFF,Factors That Could Mar Chemical Industry Momentum,opinion,"The chemical industry has gotten its mojo back on strength across major end markets and an improving world economy  While chemical makers should benefit from strategic growth measures and investment on capacity expansion  the industry is still reeling under certain headwinds  There are a few reasons to be cautious about the chemical industry in the near term  which we have outlined below  
China Woes Linger
Slowdown in China    a major market for chemicals    remains a deterrent over the short haul  The world s second biggest economy remains plagued by persistent industrial overcapacity  weak property investment and rising corporate debt  In particular  ballooning debt levels  manifested by rising debt to GDP ratio  and rapid credit expansion have raised a red flag on the Chinese economy 
The country s GDP expanded 6 7  in 2016  a deceleration from 6 9  a year ago  also the weakest annual growth in 26 years  The International Monetary Fund  IMF   its annual report on the Chinese economy  issued a warning about the country s surging debt level that has raised risks for a potential sharp decline in growth in the medium term  The IMF projects China s GDP to grow 6 8  in 2017  moderating to 6 5  in 2018  Moreover  the Chinese government has set a GDP growth target of roughly 6 5  for 2017 
Capital outflow pressures  rapid credit expansion  continued reliance on stimulus measures and geopolitical uncertainties are among the key risks to the country s economic growth  As such  a sluggish Chinese economy may weigh on demand for chemicals in this significant market 
Harvey Stoked Disruptions Pose a Concern
Hurricane Harvey weighed on U S  chemical production during the third quarter  knocking off a sizable chunk of production capacity  Harvey led to the shutdown of several chemical plants along the Gulf Coast    the epicenter of the U S  specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry 
In particular  the storm ravaged Texas that accounts for nearly three quarters of the U S  production of ethylene  which is among the world s most important petrochemicals and a basic ingredient for final products ranging from plastic bottles to tires to polyester fabric  Many chemical plants producing ethylene are located near the Gulf Coast s concentration of petroleum facilities 
According to IHS Markit  54  of total U S  ethylene production capacity was hit by Harvey  A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production  leading to reduced supply of this major chemical  The lingering effects of Harvey is a concern for U S  chemical companies  Lost production volumes as well as costs related to the disruptions caused by the storm may pose some headwinds for U S  chemical makers in the fourth quarter of 2017 
Still Challenging Fertilizer Agrichemical Space
Fertilizer and agricultural chemical companies are still grappling with a difficult pricing environment  While the potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows  the picture is not so good for nitrogen and phosphate 
Higher supply has contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment  Abundant nitrogen supply driven by new production capacity is expected to weigh on global prices in 2017  Additional nitrogen capacity including a significant increase in North America is expected to come online globally in the back half of the year 
Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices  Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is hurting prices  causing farmers to delay buying activities  As such  nitrogen margins of fertilizer producers remain thwarted by a weak pricing environment 
Excess capacity  outpacing demand  also continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed so far this year  Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied through the second half  thereby putting pressure on prices 
Moreover  agriculture market fundamentals remain weak and there is continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term  Insipid economic growth in certain key markets including Latin America is affecting demand for nutrients  Moreover  the prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies as it is hindering fertilizer usage by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on growers  income 
Prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  remain at their multi year lows as markets remain awash with grains  An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017 
Raw Material Pricing Headwinds
Commodity pricing remain a concern for many U S  chemical producers  Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy  given the competitive pressures in play 
A number of chemical companies including PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   Inc   PPG   Celanese Corp   CE  and Eastman Chemical Company  NYSE EMN   EMN  are witnessing a spike in raw material prices  exacerbated by short supply due to hurricanes  As a result  margins of these producers may be under pressure moving ahead amid an inflationary environment  A number of chemical makers  in their September quarter earnings call  have warned of continued headwinds from elevated input costs through the rest of 2017 
Stocks to Steer Clear Of
As you can see  there are a number of reasons to be watchful about the chemical industry  As such  it would also be a prudent choice to get rid of certain companies in the space that show weak fundamentals and carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank 
We hold a bearish view on KMG Chemicals  Inc   KMG   Compass Minerals International  Inc   CMP   Stepan Company  SCL  and Axalta Coating Systems Ltd   AXTA   each holding a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
We also suggest staying away from stocks such as PPG Industries  Platform Specialty Products Corp   PAH  and International Flavors   Fragrances Inc   IFF   all carrying a Zacks Rank  4  Sell

115303,336818,IFF,What s In The Cards For Univar  UNVR  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Univar Inc    NYSE UNVR   is expected to release second quarter 2016 results ahead of the bell on Aug 9 
Univar is a global distributor of chemicals and innovative services  offering solvents  resins  pigments  acids  bases  surfactants  glycols  inorganic compounds and alcohols  It also provides transportation and warehousing infrastructure  chemicals and hazardous materials  handling services  The company serves the coatings and adhesives  food  oil and gas  personal care and pharmaceutical industries 
Last quarter  this chemical company s earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company posted an average negative earnings surprise of 62 39  in the last four quarters 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Univar reported revenues of  1 999 million in the first quarter of 2016  down 13 1  from the year ago quarter owing to lower demand from oil and gas markets  deflation in chemical prices and currency headwinds  The company s net earnings fell to  14 million from  19 7 million in the prior year quarter 
Univar faced headwinds in the upstream oil and gas markets due to declining rig count in first quarter 2016  Demand in the market declined through the quarter and is expected to remain low  but not drop further  in the second quarter  Industrial demand in the first quarter was also soft and is anticipated to remain sluggish in the second quarter 
Univar s sales in the first quarter also declined due to prices  Chemical prices deflated in the quarter  Management expects a rise in prices due to seasonality in the second quarter  However  in the last earnings call  the company stated that it was yet to witness the increase 
Univar intends to continue implementing initiatives targeted at growth  The company plans to continue its pursuit of several acquisitions after the two acquisitions completed in the first quarter  The company is also executing several cost saving programs  in an attempt to drive productivity and operational excellence and grow organically  The company also expects its asset light business model  which provides stability  to sustain in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment 
For second quarter 2016  the company projects adjusted EBITDA to be modestly above  134 1 million reported in the first quarter  This is primarily due to a slower beginning to the usual seasonal increases in demand from industrial markets UNIVAR INC Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Univar is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Univar is currently pegged at 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 18 cents Zacks Rank  Univar carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions
