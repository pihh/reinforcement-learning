7284,228799,LNN,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Deere   Company  Lindsay  AGCO And Alamo Group,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 8  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks

Deere   Company   NYSE DE    Lindsay Corp    NYSE LNN    AGCO Corp    NYSE AGCO   and Alamo Group  Inc    NYSE ALG   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  Deere  DE  Lays Off 163 Employees to Cope with Low DemandDeere   Company has announced indefinite layoffs for 163 employees at its plants in Illinois and Iowa  per a Reuters report  Slump in demand owing trade uncertainties and weak agricultural sector has compelled the company to take such a step Deere will place about 50 employees on indefinite layoff effective Oct 28 at Harvester Works in East Moline  IL  which makes large agriculture equipment  Additionally  113 workers would be laid off indefinitely effective Nov 18 at its Davenport  IA construction and forestry plant The U S Agriculture industry has been grappling with low commodity prices and sluggish farm incomes  Tariffs imposed by China on U S  agricultural exports last year dealt a severe blow given that China is the largest export market for U S  agriculture producers  Per American Farm Bureau  the trade war led to a plunge of 50  in agricultural exports to China to  9 1 billion in 2018  Per the latest available data  farm bankruptcy filings have gone up 13  in the 12 month period ended June 2019  Moreover  delinquency rates for commercial agricultural loans are at a six year high Per the U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  latest available projections  net farm income  inflation adjusted  is anticipated to increase 3  year over year to  2 5 billion in 2019  However  it remains well below the high of  136 5 billion in 2013 This has weighed on farmer sentiment  making them more cautious about spending on farm equipment  This has impacted the Manufacturing   Farm Equipment industry s performance and the players in the industry like Deere  Lindsay Corp   AGCO Corp  and Alamo Group  Inc  Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration last year on steel and aluminum added to equipment manufacturers  woes by inflating raw material costs During third quarter fiscal 2019 conference call  Deere trimmed its expectation for net income for fiscal 2019 to  3 2 billion from the prior  3 3 billion  For the Agriculture   Turf segment  the company anticipates industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada to be flat in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior fiscal year Nevertheless  strong results from the Construction   Forestry segment will help negate the impact of a weak agricultural sector and tariffs  With order books extending into the fourth quarter  the segment is poised for improved results for fiscal 2019  Deere projects global sales for Construction   Forestry equipment to rise 10  in fiscal 2019 For the fiscal  U S  GDP  total construction investments  housing starts and oil activity remains at levels that will sustain equipment demand   Equipment rental utilization remains high and rental rates are likely to trend higher in 2019  Global transportation investment this year is expected to be up 5   spurring demand for road construction equipment  which bodes well for Wirtgen As a reminder  Deere acquired the world s leading road construction equipment maker  Wirtgen  for  5 2 billion in cash and debt in December 2017  The buyout significantly enhanced Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure as evident from its updated synergy target of 125 million euro by 2022 Deere is also assessing cost structure by reviewing organization efficiency and footprint assessment  which in turn will help improve margins  The company will benefit from concerted focus on launching products with advanced technologies and features  which provides it a competitive edge  The company remains focused on revolutionizing agriculture with technology in an effort to make farming automated  easy to use and more precise across the production process  Consequently  Deere continues to invest in technology leadership and data analytics Just Released  Zacks  7 Best Stocks

7303,228818,LNN,Trade Desk  Lindsay  Nordstrom And Urban Outfitters Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 22  2019    The Trade Desk   NASDAQ TTD   as the Bull of the Day  Lindsay Corporation   NYSE LNN   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Nordstrom   NYSE JWN   and Urban Outfitters   NASDAQ URBN   Here is a synopsis of all four stocks   The Trade Desk has seen its shares soar over 70  this year alone as the programmatic advertising firm continues to grow in a marketing environment that will only see algorithmic  real time bidding expand  Looking ahead  The Trade Desk is expected to grow both its top and bottom lines as it gains more traction and bolsters its business through artificial intelligence  from audio and mobile to connected TVs Business Overview The Trade Desk essentially allows companies who want to advertise the chance to find their target consumers in a more precise  efficient  and modern way  Fewer companies and advertisers want to deal with insertion orders that call for X amount of impressions to appear on website Y or TV channel Z  only to find out how the campaign performed after the ad run is over  This is where the Ventura  California headquarter firm comes in The Trade Desk and the programmatic approach which has become an ad industry mainstay allows clients to utilize its cloud based platform to create  manage  and optimize data driven digital advertising campaigns across a range of channels and devices in real time  These days  advertisers know that they can turn to Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  to reach massive audiences  TTD allows their clients to reach giants like these and find consumers across multiple channels  apps  and websites  across connected TVs  audio  mobile and more Growth PlansTTD rolled out its own AI technology it calls Koa last summer to help automatically surface data driven recommendations in real time to improve ad campaigns  The process allows customers to get a more market driven price on their ads  reach the right target audience on the right devices  and more  In the end  non ad supported services such as Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Prime  Spotify  NYSE SPOT  and soon enough Disney and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  will have made consumers harder to reach  Therefore  companies big and small need a more modern  data driven way to advertise  and The Trade Desk seems poised to benefit from these needs Investors should also note that The Trade Desk recently launched a programmatic ad buying platform in China  The firm also said that its newer connected TV and audio channels  grew multiples faster  than its more mature units  which is a good sign as smart TVs from the likes of Roku and digital audio and podcasts proliferate  On top of that  The Trade Desk boasted that its customer retention rate remained over 95  during Q1   as it has for the previous 21 quarters  Outlook   Earnings Trends The digital advertising platform operator is coming off a better than projected Q1 of fiscal 2019  The company s adjusted quarterly earnings soared 44  to reach  0 49 per share and crush our  0 25 per share Zacks Consensus Estimate  Meanwhile  The Trade Desk s first quarter revenue jumped roughly 41  to  120 99 million and also top estimates Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company s second quarter revenue to soar over 38  to reach  155 09 million  Peeking further ahead  TTD s full year revenue is projected to jump over 36  to touch  649 96 million   At the bottom end of the income statement  The Trade Desk s adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to jump 13 3  to  0 68 per share  The company s fiscal 2019 earnings are then expected to pop 8 5  to  2 93 a share  with 2020 s earnings projected to come in 22 7  higher than our current year estimate   As we mentioned earlier  TTD blew past our Q1 2019 earnings estimate by 96   Jumping back a little further  the firm topped our bottom line estimates by over 32  in Q4  Q3  and Q2 of 2018  On top of that  The Trade Desk has seen its earnings estimate revision activity trend heavily in the right direction recently  especially for fiscal 2019 and 2020  This means that at least some analysts are more optimistic about the advertising platform company s bottom line expansion  which is often a good sign Bottom Line Shares of TTD are up roughly 144  over the last 12 months  which destroys its industry s roughly 3  average and the S P 500  And as the chart at the top shows  The Trade Desk stock has been a top performer since it went public in 2016  TTD stock closed regular trading Tuesday at  199 03 per share  down 15  from its 52 week intraday trading high of 52 week  232 70 The firm s positive earnings estimate revision trends help The Trade Desk earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  right now  TTD s valuation metrics are still pretty stretch at the moment  which means value investors might want to stay away  Yet  for those searching for outsized growth in a potentially booming industry  The Trade Desk could be a stock to consider buying   Shares of Lindsay Corporation have fallen roughly 16  over the last 12 months  which falls below its industry s 5  average decline  The irrigation and road safety equipment maker is coming off a worse than expected quarter on the back of U S  China trade war worries  which have only escalated since it reported its second quarter fiscal 2019 results in early April    Overview   Recent PerformanceLindsay Corporation is a manufacturer and distributor of irrigation and infrastructure equipment and technology  The company is well known for its massive Zimmatic irrigation equipment  and other offerings  that have become popular with farmers around the world  The Omaha  Nebraska based company also operates an infrastructure division  which includes transportation safety and roadway maintenance products such as energy absorbing crash cushions and moveable barriers The company has been negatively impacted by the ongoing trade fight between the U S  and China that has hurt farmers and caused uncertainty  Lindsay Corporation s revenue fell 16  last quarter  some of which was attributed to previously announced business divestitures  Meanwhile  LNN posted a quarterly net loss of  3 4 million  or  0 32 per diluted share  down big from positive earnings of  0 16 per share in the prior year period Lindsay Corporation did report positive adjusted Q2 earnings and saw its international irrigation segment revenue jump 15   driven by strong sales in developing markets  Nonetheless  shares of LNN have dipped roughly 4  since it reported and 15  in 2019   North America irrigation sales volumes were significantly lower than anticipated as the unresolved US China trade dispute contributed to a further decline in farmer sentiment   CEO Tim Hassinger said in prepared remarks last quarter Overall  shares of LNN are down roughly 4  over the past five years  which falls well below its industry s 30  climb and the S P 500 s 53  expansion  Lindsay Corporation stock closed regular trading Tuesday at  80 61 per share  down roughly 26  off its 52 week intraday trading highs Outlook   Earnings Trends Looking ahead  the company s current quarter revenue is projected to fall over 19  to  136 87 million  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  The firm s full year fiscal 2019 revenue is then expected to slip nearly 14  to  472 03 million  Peeking ahead to fiscal 2020  the company is projected to see its full year revenue pop 6  above our 2019 estimate to reach  500 79 million  This  however  would still fall well below 2018 s  547 71 million Moving onto the bottom end of the income statement  LNN s adjusted quarterly EPS figure is projected to plummet over 41 5  to  0 97 per share  The firm s adjusted fiscal 2019 earnings are expected to fall roughly 37   Luckily for current long term LNN holders  the company s earnings are projected to soar 70  above our 2019 estimate in fiscal 2020 With that said  the company s earnings estimate revision activity has moved completely in the wrong direction recently  Investors will also notice just how much its quarterly and full year earnings estimates have come down  Bottom LineLindsay Corporation s negative earnings estimate revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  at the moment  The company also rocks a  D  grade for Value and an  F  for Growth in our Style Scores system

7304,228819,LNN,Deere To Bank On Construction Demand Till Agriculture Picks Up,opinion,Deere   Company s   NYSE DE   Construction   Forestry sales increased 11  year over year to  2 99 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  ended Apr 28  2019   The segment reported highest second quarter revenues This was driven by Wirtgen acquisition  higher shipment volumes and price realization  somewhat offset by unfavorable foreign exchange  This segment reported operating profit of  347 million  an improvement of 34  from the prior year quarter figure of  259 million  The Wirtgen acquisition contributed operating profit of  102 million in the reported quarter  Apart from it  price realization and higher shipment volumes partially offset by higher production costs and less favorable product mix drove profits  Operating margin in the quarter was 11 6  compared with 9 6  in the previous year   a 200 basis points expansion year over year Wirtgen Buyout  A Key Catalyst for Construction   ForestryDeere projects global sales for Construction   Forestry equipment to rise 11  in fiscal 2019  This will be backed by strong demand for equipment and the Wirtgen acquisition  With order books extending into the fourth quarter  the segment seems on track for improved results in the back half of the fiscal In forestry  global industry sales are expected to be flat to up 5  primarily driven by higher demand in EU28 countries and Russia  The segment s operating margin is projected to be about 11 5   The economic environment for the construction  forestry and road building industries holds promise and continues to support elevated demand for new and used equipment For fiscal 2019  U S  GDP  total construction investments  housing starts and oil activity remains at supportive levels for equipment demand  Equipment rental utilization remains high and rental rates will continue to improve in 2019  Global transportation investment this calendar year is anticipated to be up about 4   spurring demand for road construction equipment such as milling machines  rollers and asphalt pavers  which are all important product lines for Wirtgen  As a reminder  Deere acquired the world s leading road construction equipment maker  Wirtgen for  5 2 billion in cash and debt in December 2017  The buyout significantly enhances Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  The company has updated its synergy target to 125 million euro by 2022 This upbeat performance helped offset the impact of the ongoing weakness in agricultural sector on Deere s sales  The Agriculture   Turf segment s sales were up 3  year over year to  7 3 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  while operating profit at the segment declined 4  year over year to  1 019 million   Backed by the Construction   Forestry segment s performance  Deere reported second quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings of  3 52 per share  an improvement of 12  from the prior year quarter Citing ongoing concerns over the impact of the escalating trade war between the United States and China  weakening agricultural market for fiscal 2019  Deere lowered expectation of equipment sales year over year growth to 5  from the prior expectation of 7   For the fiscal  the company anticipates net sales to increase about 5  year over year  down from previously guided growth of 7   The expectation for net income for the fiscal is now at about  3 3 billion compared with its earlier expectation of  3 6 billion  For the Agriculture   Turf segment  Deere projects industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada to be flat to up 5  in fiscal 2019 Further  Deere s  results continue to bear the brunt of higher costs for raw materials on account of the implementation of tariffs and logistics  It will continue to hinder the company s margins till a resolution is reached Nevertheless  there is a ray of hope for Deere as well as other stocks like with exposure to the agricultural sector like AGCO Corporation   NYSE AGCO    Lindsay Corporation   NYSE LNN   and Titan International   NYSE TWI    Per the USDA s latest available projections  net farm is anticipated to increase 10  year over year in 2019 to  69 4 billion after a decline of 16  in 2018  Further  the USDA has announced a  16 billion aid program for American farmers who have been hurt by the U S  trade war with China  Payments will be made in up to three tranches  with the second and third tranches evaluated as market conditions and trade opportunities dictate  The first tranche will begin in late July or early August  and the second and third tranches will be made in November and early January  respectively  This is likely to improve farmer sentiment and bolster equipment sales

Lindsay s revenues Inflated Costs a Woe The company uses steel as a major raw material to manufacture products  Steel prices in the United States flared up primarily as a result of tariffs that were

7325,228840,LNN,The Truth About The Marijuana Industry,opinion,"When I was in high school  the only publication dedicated to covering the marijuana industry was High Times  Or the liner notes of a Cypress Hill album 
Pot smokers were  dopes  and outcasts 
But times have changed 
Roughly 60  of Americans believe weed should be legalized  And pot smokers are seen as entrepreneurs and industry leaders 
Now almost every single news and financial outlet covers the marijuana industry with vigor  And the reason is clear 
The industry is expected to grow more than 733  over the next decade 
So any stock remotely associated with cannabis and legalization is soaring  The number of OTC cannabis stocks continues to grow 
And in the past year  biotechs with a cannabis connection outperformed the markets  Some  like Cara Therapeutics  NASDAQ CARA   are up more than 134  in the past year alone 

The end of the eight decade long cannabis prohibition is triggering some exciting investments  Even better  there are medicinal and recreational markets  And that gives investors two flavors to pursue and profit from 
Growing Green Movement
We must look at marijuana as an agricultural product or soft commodity 
In 2016  legal marijuana sales in Colorado crossed the  1 billion threshold  That s a major milestone for a state on the leading edge of the legalization movement 
In turn  Colorado brought in close to  200 million in taxes  licenses and fees related to marijuana sales in 2016 
That s not too shabby 
But let s be honest    Colorado is small potatoes 
Colorado is one of the fastest growing states in the country  But its population is a mere 5 5 million  That doesn t put it in the top 20 
The real money is in California 
Los Angeles is the U S  s largest legal marijuana market  Not only is Los Angeles County more populous than 42 states  but its medicinal marijuana industry has already surpassed  1 billion  And that s been running since 1996 
But in November  California gave recreational marijuana use the green light  And it was just one of several states to do so 
In fact  four states legalized recreational use in November  bringing the total to eight states and the District of Columbia  And this year  11 more states are considering bills  including decriminalization measures in Texas and New York 
Those   and Florida  too   are the major markets to keep an eye on 
Last year  the legal U S  marijuana market was worth roughly  6 billion 
But recreational approval in California alone will triple the market 
California is the most important state in terms of product consumption because of its size  More than 12  of the entire U S  population lives there 
And this is one of the big reasons that by 2021  the legal U S  pot industry is expected to be worth  20 2 billion  From there  it s expected to more than double to  50 billion by 2026  So momentum rapidly escalates 
From Recreational To Industrial
Right now  1 in 5 Americans lives in a state where weed is legal 
And as the pot industry grows 733  in the next 10 years  we ll see a shift from small operations to large scale ones 
For investors with lower risk tolerances who don t want to miss out  that s good news 
Your options aren t just OTC or penny stocks 
For example  Scotts Miracle Gro  NYSE SMG  is popular with cannabis investors  And it s done well 
Sales increased 27  in the first quarter 
And over the past year and a half  shares of Scotts are up more than 40  

As marijuana goes mainstream  expect agricultural machinery companies like AGCO  NYSE AGCO  to benefit  And expect a renewed boon for irrigation equipment companies like Valmont Industries  NYSE VMI  and Lindsay Corporation  NYSE LNN  
Valmont has the added benefit of being an infrastructure  as well as an energy and mining  play  So a renewed focus on infrastructure and a large scale pot revolution could be a windfall for it 
Plus  investors can t ignore tobacco companies 
The rise of e cigarettes and vaping is buoying cigarette manufacturers  Now combine that with legal weed  That s a potential gold mine 
Over the next 20 years  projections are that Big Tobacco will control one fifth of the cannabis industry  with marijuana sales adding more than 20  to its revenue 
The pot industry provides plenty of opportunities for investors  But not all of them have to be high risk penny stocks  There are plenty of solid  low risk plays out there

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key Factors to ConsiderLindsay s backlog as of second quarter fiscal 2019 end was at  44 4 million  down from  90 2 million as of Feb 28  2018  This can be attributed to a decrease in Irrigation and Infrastructure backlogs  While  14 8 million of the backlog reduction resulted from business divestiture  lower backlog of Road Zipper System orders compared with the prior year also led to a  28 5 million reduction in backlog  This will impact revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  137 million indicates decline of 19  from the prior year quarter The North American agricultural market remains plagued with lower farm income and lesser commodity prices  Further  it was affected by reduced exports  as a result of the U S  China trade dispute during the quarter to be reported  Inclement weather has delayed the planting season in most productive farming regions in the United States  All these factors will impact Irrigation segment s revenues in third quarter fiscal 2019  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Irrigation Equipment segment s operating income is  5 5 million  suggesting decline of 62  from the year ago quarter  The Zacks Consensus estimate for the Irrigation Equipment segment s sales is  109 million  indicating decline of 15  from the year ago reported figure Recent lower order levels for the Road Zipper system will impact the Infrastructure segment s revenues in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the Infrastructure segment s revenues for the to be reported quarter is at  27 6 million  indicating decline of 33  from the year ago quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the Infrastructure segment s adjusted operating income for the May end quarter is at  15 29 million  a projected drop of 15  from  18 07 million in the prior year quarter Lindsay s results will continue to bear the brunt of rising steel prices as a result of tariffs  Additionally  the company will bear the brunt of elevated costs incurred in connection to its Foundation for Growth performance improvement initiative The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the second quarter is pegged at 97 cents  suggesting decline of around 42  from the year ago reported figure Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lindsay is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive   and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  But that is not the case here  as you will see below Earnings ESP   Lindsay s Earnings ESP is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand 97 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks Rank   Although Lindsay s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  its 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Share Price PerformanceLindsay s shares have declined 17 1  in the past year against the  s growth of 15 8  Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Roper Technologies Inc    NYSE ROP   has an Earnings ESP of  0 82  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  NAPCO Security Technologies  Inc    NASDAQ NSSC   has an Earnings ESP of  4 00  and a Zacks Rank  1 Flowserve Corporation   NYSE FLS   has an Earnings ESP of  4 52  and a Zacks Rank  2 The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lindsay-lnn-to-report-q3-earnings-whats-in-the-cards-200436733,200436733

MIDD  and IDEX Corporation  NYSE IEX  OPPORTUNITIES Fiscal government expenditures play a counter cyclical role by curbing the ill effects of slower economic development and a tight credit market  In China s structural stimulus package  government spending on social welfare  construction of low cost housing and completion of infrastructure projects on agriculture  forestry and water resources  received special attention  Moreover  the U S  Congress had a stimulus package designed in 2009 that had money flowing into infrastructure spending  Also  the American Energy   Infrastructure Jobs Act  H R  7  will boost spending in infrastructure projects  The President s Fiscal 2015 Budget includes a  302 billion investment proposal for development of surface transportation  This  if approved  will boost industrial products demand as well as create new jobs  In Sep 2014  the European Central Bank  ECB  stunned the global market by announcing fresh cuts in all interest rates and negative rates on bank deposits  In addition  a stimulus plan  infusing money in the market through purchase of covered bank bonds and asset backed securities  was also announced  These initiatives are aimed at combating the ill effects of low inflation in the region  The news weakened the Euro to a 14 month low against the U S  dollar  while the European stock and bond markets rejoiced the sudden surge in prices WEAKNESSES We remain wary of the rising raw material costs for some of the major players of the machinery industry  Steel prices along with energy  especially coal and fuel prices  remain the prime causes for concern  At the same time  research and development costs are on the rise for machine makers as they seek to manufacture more sophisticated and technologically advanced machinery  Availability of funds remains a stumbling block as some major nations are still struggling to stabilize their own economies  Although favorable commodity prices are a boon  government policies affecting prices along with export and import policies and trade relations with other countries  will impact the machinery industry at large To Conclude  Promising Prospects With persistent economic uncertainties in many parts of the world  presence of headwinds cannot be ruled out  Sincere efforts are being made to overcome these hurdles  with greater emphasis on growing trade relations and implementation of better policies  These  along with growing population  require technologically advanced equipment in infrastructure  agriculture  mining and other industries  Moreover  going ahead  the growth path widens for the emerging and developing nations  which will inevitably become rewarding destinations for machine makers worldwide ",2014-09-10,Zacks Investment

increase in irrigation system unit volume with comparable pricing to prior year  along with a modest increase in other irrigation component revenues  International irrigation revenues edged up 1  to

equipment revenues increased 3  year over year to  99 9 million Infrastructure revenues improved 24  to  33 million owing to higher Road Zipper System sales and higher unit volumes in road safety

Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD 

Bull Flag Breakout


 14  gain over 2 week holding period


Bought 11 29  Sold 12 14

After thrusting off support of the 50 day moving average on heavier than average volume  AMD formed a bull flag continuation pattern 
To confirm a bull flag  we look for declining volume while the flag is being formed near the top of the range 
Lighter volume during consolidation is bullish because it indicates traders are holding onto their gains  rather than selling into strength of the preceding rally 
In the November 29 issue of our swing trading newsletter  sent to subscribers the evening of November 28   we listed AMD as a potential buy entry above the November 28 high 
AMD triggered our buy entry on November 29  when the price moved above resistance of the previous day s high 
The daily chart of AMD below shows the bull flag pattern that enabled us to list the stock as a Wagner Daily buy setup 

Bull flag breakouts are momentum driven  so we typically look for the price action in a bull flag pattern to move sharply higher within just 5 to 10 days of our buy entry 
However  after buying AMD on November 29  the price failed to follow through right away and closed well off the highs of the session 
This led to a two day pullback that found support just above the 20 day exponential moving average  a reliable indicator of short term support  
We stopped out of partial share size just beneath the November 29 low  but the stop on the remaining position  below the 20 day EMA  gave the trade some breathing room 
After two days of consolidation  AMD finally cleared the swing high  with strong volume  on December 6 
The breakout after the shakeout prompted us to re enter the shares we previously stopped out of the following day 
This time  AMD followed through with the bull flag breakout and zoomed over over the next few days 
Since we knew there was major resistance in AMD around the  11 level  see a monthly chart   we decided to lock in the solid gain  rather than trying to squeeze every penny out of the advance 
As such  we alerted subscribers to exit the position on the December 14 open and netted a 14  gain on the initial entry  with a 12  gain on the shares that were re entered 
The entry  exit  and overall price action described above can be seen on the daily chart of AMD below 

Planet Fitness Inc  NYSE PLNT 

Cup and Handle Breakout


 13  gain over 1 week holding period


Bought 11 08  Sold 11 14

One of our favorite chart patterns is the cup and handle  a bullish  that precedes some of the most powerful and reliable breakouts 
As shown on the stock chart below  PLNT formed a cup and handle from late August to early November of this year 
The  handle  of the pattern formed from October 27 to November 8  with the price action finding support at the rising 20 day EMA and 50 day MA  around  20 50  
Our signal to list PLNT as a potential setup came on November 7  as the price rallied above the short term downtrend line  upper channel of the handle  
When we spotted this  we placed a buy limit order to enter PLNT on a slight pullback to  21 35 in the following session 
The chart below shows the cup and handle pattern  as well as our subsequent buy entry on November 8 

PLNT immediately surged higher after our buy entry  breaking through the high of the handle and giving us a nice profit buffer of 4  just one day after our entry 
However  volume failed to confirm the bullish move because turnover was lighter than the previous day and well below average 
Because of this apparent lack of demand at a critical pivot point  we decided to treat PLNT as a quick momentum swing trade  rather than holding on to the position for a bigger core gain over two to three months 
We sold PLNT at  39 44 on the November 14 open  due to weak volume on the breakout and the ugly reversal candle that formed on November 13 
The chart below shows the price action after our buy entry  as well as the exit that locked in a 13  gain over just six sessions 

Lindsay Corporation  NYSE LNN 

Flat Base Breakout


Bought 11 23  still open 

Unlike AMD and PLNT  our trade in LNN remains an open long position in  model portfolio 
The long term monthly chart below caught our attention at the time of buy entry  as there were two failed bases leading to the third base of consolidation 

Many new and experienced stock traders spend way too much time scanning for new trades on the daily chart timeframe 
Although the daily chart is useful for seeing short term trends  trade setups on the monthly timeframe can be more explosive  especially when they align with bullish price action on the weekly and daily chart intervals 
The high volume gap up in mid October was an extremely bullish signal  which led to several weeks of tight basing action around the rising 20 day EMA and above the rising 50 day MA 
On November 21  we alerted Wagner Daily subscribers that we were placing a buy stop to enter LNN above the highs of the range 
That setup triggered for  official  buy entry on November 23  and we remain long the position 
Our plan is to hold LNN through any short term pullbacks  in anticipation of a 30  40  on this core trade 

Through 14 years of experience since Morpheus was founded in 2002  we have been tweaking and fine tuning our winning stock trading strategy 
But rather than seek the elusive  of trading  we simply focus on mastering the nuances of the most basic  yet highly reliable and profitable chart patterns 
The bull flag breakout  AMD   cup and handle  PLNT   and flat base breakout  LNN  are three of our most frequently traded chart patterns ",2016-12-15,Deron Wagner,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/winning-charts:-$amd-bull-flag-breakout,-$plnt-cup-and-handle,-$lnn-flat-200169833",200169833

Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter earnings remained unchanged over the past 30 days Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 14 8  compared with the  s growth of 34 2  Will the upcoming earnings release provide a boost to Pentair s stock  Let s take a look Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsPentair has undergone certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing fixed cost structure  which is likely to have boosted margin growth in the fourth quarter  However  inflation in material and other costs  which include the impact of tariffs  is likely to get reflected in the company s performance and consequently the bottom line for the quarter  Notably  productivity improvement and price hikes to combat higher input costs are likely to have negated the impact of elevated raw material costs on its quarterly results A wet and cold weather delayed pool construction activity in several of Pentair s key markets  As a result of slower sell through  inventory levels have built up  which is likely to have impacted the Aquatic Systems segment s performance during the period under consideration  However  the company is focused on stabilizing its inventory levels

segment manufactures and sells pumps used in agricultural irrigation and crop spray  Late planting due to unfavorable weather is likely to have depressed the sale of its agriculture sprayer products  Consequently  weakness in the agricultural sector is likely to have eroded the segment s revenues in the October December period Pentair projects fourth quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share at 64
