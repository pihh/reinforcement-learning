129946,351461,ZBH,How Zimmer Biomet Holdings Beat Expectations in Q4,news,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings  NYSE ZBH  delivered a sizzling performance in 2019  with shares soaring 44   But 2020 started off flat    the medical device stock traded essentially sideways through January 
That could change now  Zimmer Biomet announced its 2019 fourth quarter and full year results before the market opened on Tuesday  Here are the highlights from the company s update 

By the numbers
Zimmer Biomet reported fourth quarter revenue of  2 13 billion  up 2 6  year over year  That topped analysts  average prediction of  2 11 billion  Net income was  321 4 million  or  1 54 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   That was a considerable improvement from the GAAP net loss of  902 5 million  or  4 42 per share  in the prior year period 
The company s adjusted net income was  2 30 per share  up from  2 18 per share in Q4 2018  Zimmer Biomet s adjusted earnings also easily beat the consensus Wall Street estimate of  2 27 per share 
Behind the numbers
Foreign exchange fluctuations hurt Zimmer Biomet somewhat in the fourth quarter  The company stated on a constant currency basis  its revenue climbed 3 2  year over year  well above the reported 2 6  increase 
Over 60  of Zimmer Biomet s total revenue comes from the Americas region  where fourth quarter sales rose 2 3  to  1 29 billion  The growth picture looked even better in the Asia Pacific region  where sales jumped 9 2  to  367 million  However  Europe was a weak spot     sales there slipped by 1 1  to  471 million 
The company reported 4 9  year over year sales growth for its knee replacement products and 3 2  growth for its hip replacement products  Management noted that sales of the ROSA Knee System  picked up momentum from Q3  and also said that the Q4 launches of the Persona Revision knee system and Avenir Complete hip system went well 
Zimmer Biomet s restructuring initiatives made a big impact  Operating expenses in Q4 were down 37  from the prior year quarter to  1 79 billion  Those cost reductions combined with revenue growth led to significant improvement on the bottom line 
Looking ahead
Management forecast that revenue will increase by between 2 5  and 3 5  in 2020  and projected adjusted diluted earnings per share of between  8 15 and  8 45 
Some healthcare stocks could experience significant volatility over the next year as the future of the U S  healthcare system is debated in the presidential campaign  Other companies could run into challenges related to the coronavirus outbreak  with travel restrictions and business shutdowns in China cause problems  The latter could be more of an issue for Zimmer Biomet because of its Asian segment  However  CEO Bryan Hanson said that the company is  operating from a position of strength for 2020 and beyond  ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pqzkv,2075682

Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorGood morning  ladies and gentlemen  and welcome to the Zimmer Biomet fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call   Operator

investor relations and IRO  Please go ahead  sir Cole Lannum    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations  and IRO Thank you  operator  and good morning  everyone  Welcome to Zimmer Biomet s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call  In the room with me today  we have Bryan Hanson  our president and CEO  our CFO  Suky Upadhyay  and our new senior vice president of investor relations and chief communications officer  Keri Mattox  Now before we get started  there are a few things I want to go over with you  I d like to remind you first that our comments during this call will include forward looking statements  Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties  Please note  we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially  Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward looking statements In addition  the discussions on this call will include certain non GAAP financial measures  Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet com  With that  I ll now turn over the call to Bryan  Bryan  Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Cole  I appreciate it  And before I jump into it  I just wanted to say the congratulations  first of all  to Keri  Obviously  Keri Mattox  it s her first call with us in Zimmer Biomet in her new role  I d say it s early on  but we re pretty excited about what we think she s going to bring to the table  So I m looking forward to that  I also want to make sure that I take just a minute here and say thanks  Cole  It s been harder to leave but already two years that we ve been working together in this capacity  And I would say that we ve come a long way  and a lot of that has to do with your guidance along the way  So I certainly appreciate it  I know you re not going anywhere  We re going to have access to you  but this will be the last time you re on one of these calls  So I wanted to make sure that I call you out for what you ve been able to do for us over the last two years and look forward to next year together  All right  So getting into the quarter  we re encouraged by our performance in the fourth quarter  We posted solid revenue growth  slightly above our weighted average market growth rate expectations and grew earnings per share faster than revenue  This was driven by improved performance versus prior year across all geographic regions as well as most of our businesses  We also made further progress in executing on our short term priorities  supply  quality remediation  new product introductions and ZB s mission and culture  We also continued to invest for growth  This progress has laid the foundation for further innovation and commercial execution that will drive our accelerated growth over the long term  These are all important steps forward  And while we are happy with our progress  we re certainly not satisfied  Rest assured that we are still striving to continuously improve our business  our performance and the value we deliver to patients  as well as customers and investors  Along those lines  let me talk about the team s momentum around the key short term priorities  Regarding supply  we have consistently met customer demand and improved service levels  further enhancing the confidence of our global sales teams and putting them back on offense  With this supply stabilization  we are focusing more on opportunities to decrease the complexity and increase the efficiency of our supply chain  I m happy with our progress thus far  On quality  I can confirm that the FDA recently concluded a reinspection of our Warsaw North facility  This inspection is anticipated based on the progress reports we ve been providing the FDA on site readiness  We want to thank the agency for a productive and collaborative visit  By way of background  the FDA last inspected this facility in April of 2018  and we ve been executing a comprehensive remediation plan over the past couple of years  We believe the latest FDA inspection validates the significant improvement and progress that has been made at the Warsaw North facility  Not surprisingly  the FDA issued observations at the conclusion of the inspection  and we are confident in our ability to address them to FDA satisfaction  Our anticipated path forward with the FDA is fully contemplated in the 2020 guidance that we provided earlier this morning  We look forward to continuing to partner with the FDA as we strive to make Warsaw North a best in class medical device manufacturing facility  Let me take a moment to thank our quality and operations teams for their tireless work and dedication to patient safety  What they have accomplished over the past two years  and what I know they will deliver for ZB moving forward  is impressive  With improvements made in supply and quality  we also continue to sharpen our focus on innovation  Our enhanced R D efforts drove significant new innovation in 2019 and give us increased confidence in our new technology pipeline as we move into 2020 and beyond  And these programs increasingly include enabling technology and solutions around our implants  such as robotics  mini robotics  informatics and operating room efficiency  While the implant is core to what we do  our goal is to provide a complete ecosystem that is both patient  and customer centric  At the upcoming AAOS meeting in March  we ll showcase additional innovations inside this ecosystem that connect our implants  data and robotics  all designed to optimize decision making and improve patient outcomes  Moving to mission and culture  we continue to communicate and drive the mission of the ZB organization  I can say today with confidence that everyone in the organization considers themselves as part of one team  Our strategy is very clear and cascades down to all team members in the organization  It s important that everyone knows where we are going and how we are going to get there  Now turning to our fourth quarter results  All three of our regions performed well versus prior year  with strong performance from Asia Pacific and improving performance in the Americas  Relative to our businesses  we are pleased with the performance of the knee franchise with solid results across all three regions  Our core knee business accelerated  driven by Persona  including the recently launched Revision system  ROSA Knee also accelerated and drove a little more than 50  of the overall global knee growth  ROSA placements were strong  accelerating from Q3  and our customer pipeline continued to grow  supported by a very positive feedback so far  We project continued growth with ROSA in 2020 as we increase our commercial efforts  including sales force expansion and enhanced surgeon training support  In summary  we are very pleased with the ROSA Knee launch and the overall robotics uptake  While S E T  continues to be an important focus area for us  it is not yet delivering at our goal of durable mid single digit growth  We will continue to prioritize innovation and accelerate the expansion and investment in our specialized sales channel in order to drive scale in the high growth S E T  markets  Our dental team delivered its third consecutive positive growth quarter  The team s focus on strategic priorities  execution and culture  along with the targeted investments in key areas  continues to drive the business forward  We still have much to prove in this business  but I m happy with the current momentum and the performance of the dental team  Relative to our Spine   CMF business  although we did see improvement from Q3  we continued to perform below market in the quarter  The primary focus areas for this business will be working through the final steps of our channel consolidation and leveraging our new product pipeline  including recent and upcoming product launches  We are making steady progress driving innovation and shaping the future of this organization  We ve built a strong foundation and are now better positioned to accelerate our innovation and execution strategy  I m encouraged as we reshape Zimmer Biomet for sustained success  With that  I ll turn the call over to Suky to get further into the financials Suky Upadhyay    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Bryan  We delivered solid financial performance in the fourth quarter with accelerated revenue growth and leveraged earnings while increasing investments for long term growth  Also  through robust cash generation  we continue to make progress in delevering the balance sheet for strategic flexibility  I ll provide some highlights on our fourth quarter financial results  and unless otherwise noted  the numbers I will be discussing on a constant currency basis  Net sales totaled  2 1 billion  a reported increase of 2 6  over the prior year with an increase of 3 2  excluding the impact of foreign currency changes  During the quarter  all three of our geographies performed well  Our Asia Pacific team delivered 8 6  sales growth driven by continued strength across both developed and emerging markets  The Americas increased 2 4  with strength in knees and hips driven by new product introductions  supply stability and improved commercial execution  Our Europe  Middle East and Africa team delivered 1 4  revenue growth led by strength in developed markets  Turning to our businesses  In Q4  our global knee business grew 4 9  with improved execution in new product launches  Our hips business grew roughly in line with market growth at 3 2  and was aided by the recent launch of Avenir  where we are seeing good early market acceptance  S E T  grew 3 1   slightly below our expectations  but we remain focused on growing that business at mid single digits over time  Dental posted another solid quarter at 5  growth  driven by increased commercial and channel investments throughout 2019  Spine   CMF posted 0 2  revenue growth  While the growth was positive and sequentially better  we still have more work to do to stabilize the business  Turning to the P L  We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter of  1 54  Adjusted diluted earnings per share were  2 30  a 5 5  increase over the prior year  Better adjusted operating margins and lower interest expense drove this leverage earnings profile  Adjusted gross margin was 73 1   a sequential improvement  an increase over prior year due to higher volumes and favorable timing of costs within the quarter  Adjusted operating expenses increased sequentially due to sales commission and investments across commercial and R D priorities in our knee and S E T  businesses  Overall  adjusted operating margin was 29  in the quarter  Moving beyond operating margin  Interest expense of  52 million was down both sequentially and versus prior year due to debt paydown  Lastly  we had solid free cash flow generation of  295 million in the quarter and paid down an additional  161 million of debt  further deleveraging the balance sheet  It was a solid quarter  Looking ahead  our growing confidence in the business is evident in the 2020 guidance that we provided in our press release  Starting with revenue  While quarterly results may fluctuate due to seasonality and timing  we expect our full year constant currency growth to be between 2 5  to 3 5   The first quarter will benefit from about one additional billing day with no material impact expected in the remaining quarters  We expect our adjusted operating margin for the full year to be between 27  and 28   Our adjusted effective tax rate should be between 16  and 17   and we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between  8 15 and  8 45  Against the backdrop of these 2020 expectations  I d like to spend a few minutes on incremental steps we re taking to enhance shareholder value and to move our financial profile closer to top quartile  We have begun to implement a comprehensive multiyear restructuring plan with the objective of reducing costs and driving a mix shift of investments to higher priority growth opportunities  We estimate that these activities will generate gross annual adjusted pre tax operating expense savings of approximately  200 million to  300 million by the end of 2023  This program gives us additional confidence that we can invest for growth and accelerate adjusted operating margins  I know the next question will be what does accelerate margins mean  Well  we expect to deliver operating margins of at least 30  by the end of 2023  To support this restructuring  we estimate approximately  350 million to  400 million in onetime costs over the same period  Consistent with this  during the fourth quarter  we recorded a charge of  31 million  As part of these restructuring activities  we have also reorganized several businesses to drive enhanced strategic alignment across our key growth areas  As a result of this reorganization  you can expect that we will modify elements of our external reporting in the first quarter of 2020  and we ll share that information with you before our next earnings call  With that  I ll turn the call over to Bryan Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Suky  And in summary  we are proud of the progress that we are seeing in 2019  We ve clearly stabilized many parts of the business  We ve made key investments in priority areas  We drove better top line growth and delivered solid  sustainable financial performance  While there s clearly more work to do  we enter 2020 with increased confidence in our business and remain optimistic about our future  Now I ll turn the call over to Cole and Keri to manage the Q A portion of the call Cole Lannum    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations  and IRO Thanks  Bryan   Operator instructions  With that  operator  may we please have the first question  Questions   Answers  Operator Operator instructions  We ll take our first question from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies Raj Denhoy    Jefferies    Analyst Good morning  I wonder maybe I could start with the knee growth in the quarter  It really stood out  So Bryan  maybe a couple of questions there  One  can you maybe offer whether you think you have stabilized that business on an underlying basis  You offered it half the growth with some ROSA  But on an underlying basis  do you feel your share position is now secure  And then on ROSA  is there anything more you can offer in terms of where you re seeing placements  what the demand has been  Just really anything you can offer in terms of how that system is faring Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  absolutely  I would tell you that we re pretty excited actually about the quarter  It is unmistakable with that across the business  but particularly knees was strong for us  And what I like about it  in addition to us  we saw strength in other parts of the market  So I know it s just one quarter  We don t want to get too excited about that  But the fact that we were able to surge in the market as others did  I think that is a good sign  And yes  ROSA was clearly a big part of that contribution and knee growth  As we said  it s a little bit more than half of the overall growth  But even when you look at the base business  I would say that we re seeing that business move as one would expect  It s not where we need it to be  I need the overall market in knee  our business in the market in knee to be able to outperform the overall market  We re not there yet  but the fact is we re definitely seeing traction in base knee as well  It s actually one of our best growth quarters in base knee that we ve seen since the merge  What I would tell you is that ROSA demand is very strong  Probably we do have the largest funnel right now for replacements than we ve ever had  We ve done over 2 000 procedures already  And again  we re just a couple of quarters into this launch  So that would tell you that we re really seeing acceleration of focus in this area  I had an opportunity to be out in the field and see a few cases  one particularly on the West Coast  where I had a surgeon continue to look across the operating room and say   I couldn t do this before without ROSA   He was making 0 5 millimeter adjustments in tissue balancing and getting real time feedback in the procedure  And he was practically giddy about the response he was getting from the robotic system  And so again  I think people are seeing this  As a result of that  more people are desiring to get trained on the system  and we re going to continue to see that momentum go forward  It was great to see our competition have a really strong quarter as well  That tells you that the uptick in robotics is real  and that benefits all of us  So again  I m pretty happy with where we are right now with base business  as well as momentum with ROSA  Still have a lot to do  I think it s going to take us some time to get above market growth in knee  Remember  we have a very large base  That s going to take time to influence it because it s a significant number  We still have some of that negative inertia associated with the competitor s placements of robotics  It s going to take a while for us to disrupt that inertia  but I think we will over time  And we still have the major products that are out there that are launching  They re doing well  but they re early  So again  I feel really bullish in the area  but it s just going to take us some time to be able to get that business growing above market Raj Denhoy    Jefferies    Analyst Great  Thank you Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks Raj  Next question please OperatorOur next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    Analyst Hey guys  Thanks for taking my question  If I could  maybe a two part question  One  ROSA expectations for 2020  I know you said a sequential step up in placements for  19  Is that still the margin assumption for 2020  And on the margin side  Suky  implicitly  we re looking at 60  70 basis points of annual margin expansion  When does that kick in  right  Is that kick starting in 2020  Or is it more for 2021 nuance  And congrats Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer OK  Yes  I ll start off with the ROSA and then cast our view certainly obviously on the margin piece  Yes  as I said before  ROSA funnel is as strong as it s ever been  We re adding commercial infrastructure to be able to support that  and we re adding significant training capabilities so that we can get people trained with a safe and effective use of the product  So I absolutely expect 2020 to be better than what we saw in 2019  It s kind of logical just given the fact that we will have it for the full year  We did not have it for the full year of 2019  but that momentum is real  I would expect it to continue and certainly be a driver for us in 2020 Suky Upadhyay    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Regarding margins and the overall restructuring program that we announced just a few minutes ago  you re right  We talked about 30  operating margins by 2023  at least 30  operating margin  So your math is right  If you sort of took a linear glide path  that s about 60 to 70 basis points per year  However  I would say that it may not be linear  right  depending on the overall revenue profile  our investment profile  Over that three  to four year horizon  that margin expansion could be a bit lumpy  and it could fluctuate  So I wouldn t look at it as sort of in a linear fashion  Regarding 2020  operating margins  completely consistent with how we have characterized this all the way through 2019  including our third quarter call  where we said we see the opportunity for modest operating margin expansion in 2020  And if you look at our guidance  that s represented in the top half of that guidance  But we also said  given the number of attractive opportunities we have across the business  that we may use some of that margin upside to instead invest against the business for top line growth because we do see top line growth as the best  most durable pathway to long term margin expansion  earnings growth and shareholder value  And so that s reflected more in the bottom half of that overall margin profile guidance  I would say we re in early days as part of that restructuring program  However  we do expect to see some benefit into 2020  and that s been fully incorporated into the margin guidance that we ve provided today Vijay Kumar    Evercore ISI    Analyst Thanks guys Suky Upadhyay    Chief Financial Officer Thanks Vijay  Next question please OperatorOur next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse Matt Miksic    Credit Suisse    Analyst Thanks so much for taking the question  Just one follow up on Raj s question on knees  and then I have one follow up as well if that s OK  On the knee growth  Bryan  you mentioned it s going to take a while to get above market growth in knees  If you could talk maybe a little bit about where you are in the U S  in terms of holding share and what the timing looks like in the U S  given the trajectory robot sales and some of the other projects  You mentioned timing to get back to or get above market growth Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So I won t give specific timing on that  but just know we have our sights on getting above market growth  and we also believe that we have the fuel to do it  And I ll just go through a couple of those things that I think will give us that confidence  But when I think about the U S   we re still below market  We re still seeing share  but the rate that we re losing market share is much lower  So we re clearly closing that gap  and our confidence level is high  I mean the U S  momentum is real  I was just at a kickoff meeting for the Americas  Obviously  a big part of that is the U S  commercial organization  And I can tell you in all my years of doing kickoff meetings around the world  I have never been to an event where the energy was as high as it was in that meeting  So people are ready to go  They re fired up  and that momentum is real  and that s meaningful  Beyond products and innovation  supply and everything else  the way people feel  their confidence absolutely drives traction in the field  and I can say right now it s there  So that s probably the first thing that would tell me that we have a pathway to get above market  The real brass tacks is associated with products  though  As I mentioned before  ROSA s strength is real  As I am out in the world and I m seeing ROSA placements  I am seeing people that we did not even expect  surgeons that are competitive surgeons now getting trained rapidly to understand how to use our robotic system  And as a result of that  over time  we re going to expect to see that pull through because they have to use our implants when they begin to use the ROSA system  Now that will take time because they have to first drop the implants that they re using  really get trained and understand how to use the robotic system that we have  And then we re going to get that uptick  but that will take time because we re early in the launch but it will happen  When I look at cementless  we are still seeing traction in Persona cementless  I am not going to get into specifics here  but there s no question this gives us an opportunity for mix  A little bit of conversion opportunity  too  particularly tied with robotics  but a big part of it is mix benefit  and then Persona Revision  I got to tell you  there s a few different ways we can drive revenue growth here  but the traction we re getting and the momentum that we re getting is bigger than we expected  As a matter of fact  we re actually building triple the amount of sets that we expected based on the demand that we re seeing  So there s no question in my mind people love the revision system and it s being well accepted in the marketplace  Really three different ways that we can grow business inside of Revision  First one is I ve already got Persona users out there that are not using my revision system because we re just launching it  There s no reason if they like the Persona product that they wouldn t convert to the Persona Revision system  So that s the first order of business  Go to our current accounts where they re using Persona  and get the revision business  The second one is I ve got an opportunity to get out and get those surgeons that wanted to move to Persona but wouldn t go there until we got the revision system  And the third one is just competitive conversions  We have a great revision system  Revisions are always a little more challenging for surgeons  So when you can make a revision easier as a result of a system like Persona  there s an attraction to that system  That opens the door to competitive conversions  So those are the pieces that I know we have in place to get us to at or above market growth  But the key thing is it s going to take time  We re early on in the rollout of these things  but I can guarantee it s going to happen  It s just a question of when  and I just can t give you a specific time right now Matt Miksic    Credit Suisse    Analyst I appreciate that Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer I am sorry  Can we just have one question per person  Sorry  Next question please OperatorSo our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley David Lewis    Morgan Stanley    Analyst OK  I ll keep it to one question there  Cole  Bryan  you just talked about the 2020 outlook  I think you ve been adamant around 2 5   2  to 3  growth  This is 50 bps better on the margin  and the comps are going to be tougher in 2019  So you re clearly guiding to improving momentum in the business at 2 5  to 3 5  for 2020  Can you sort of walk us through where that confidence is coming from  either by segment or sort of across the business broadly  I think that s the kind of the key focus here on the call  Thanks so much Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So David  it would have been funny if you were to come on and say you had a three part question  but you re also  inaudible   So I would tell you yes  it s a number of things  First and foremost  it s just the momentum we re seeing  I mean if you look at the last couple of quarters  there s no question that there s a difference in the business right now  that the momentum is real and we have proven that now for two quarters  And that s a big confidence booster for all of us  If you think about it  the performance is good  but there hasn t been that many quarters as a company that we ve had that type of performance  So half two in a row does give you some of that confidence  So certainly  that strength across all regions  that performance that we ve had already and the future looking impact of new products gives us the confidence to be able to take their revenue  I am not going to follow up guidance but our view of what 2020 is going to look like up  So that was really the major impact  I mean I look at it to say we re still not delivering what I expect us to deliver in S E T  but the investment is there  New product innovation is there  So that is going to happen  I have confidence It is going to happen  We are not where we want to be yet  But just given the amount of investment and focus in this area  I know it s coming  I already talked about knee  Hip just continues to hang in there  The Avenir Complete is going well  We have a robotic application that will be coming soon  That may be the catalyst for us to be able to boost the hip performance as well  We have been hanging in with market  but I d like to see that above market  And I believe that the robotic application would give us that momentum  So again  a lot of things moving in the right direction  I always want to balance that with some of the things that could be challenges for us  The fact is we do have great momentum in our products  The demand is high but they are early  So that momentum has got to continue  Suky just talked about a multiyear restructuring program which is a must have because it is going to allow us to invest for growth while also driving margin expansion  but there is always a risk obstruction when you put a program like that into place  So I am trying to look at the ebbs and flows  the puts and takes for our business and give you guys what we really believe is going to happen in 2020  And there s enough momentum  there s enough positive to offset all those things that could be disruptive  and that s why we took the number up OperatorWe will take our next question from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Bob Hopkins    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Great  So I guess my one question  I d love to  Bryan  if you do not mind  follow up a little bit more on your comments on S E T  and just maybe a little more specifics on kind of what is coming and when  and when we might see better growth  And obviously  a lot of people are trying to wonder if some of the merger activity going on around you might lead to some opportunities  So maybe just a little more color on S E T Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Yes  So when I just take a step back  when I think about this business over time  obviously we re not suggesting in 2020 being at the overall business  ZB  being at a midsingle digit grower because that s where we need to go  When you think about our strategic pillar  of being a top quartile performer in total shareholder return  it requires us to increase our growth rate  We have to get to that midsingle digit growth rate  And one of the major contributors to that is going to be a sustained kind of durable growth rate in that market growth range for S E T  As a matter of fact  really need to see it on the top end of that range  that midsingle digit range  and we need to see the outperformance of knee  So those are the two major categories that we re going to be heavily focused on to ensure that we get ZB at midsingle digit growth  right  again  over time  but that s what s got to happen  When I think about us being able to do that  it was pretty clear to me we have the formula in place  Number one  we ve got to be able to increase the innovation pipeline  And we ve been doing that  not just the pipeline but the cadence of those new products  Things like the Alliance Glenoid that we are launching that gives a more personalized way to do a total shoulder is going to be exciting to surgeons  We re early on in this  but I can tell you right now the response in surgeons is very strong  The Signature ONE Planner  we lagged in this area  When you look at presurgical planning  we no longer lag in this area  And we have a lot more coming when it comes to informatics and or robotics in this space as well  So I feel confident that the innovation cycle is real  It s coming  and it will have an impact  And the other one that we ve been talking about for a long time now and we re really doubling down in is continued investment in a dedicated channel  This takes time  obviously  The hope would be that with some of the disruption out in the marketplace  that facilitates quicker expansion of our sales organization  We re certainly going to try to make sure that we take advantage of that  but the fact is we ve got to be able to get that channel in place  We re investing in it now  And then the operating mechanisms around that channel to make sure that we are driving accountability and focus brings all these things together  So I know the formula is there  The variables are all lined up  We discussed all the equation  And it s just a matter of time  So I have high level of confidence it is going to happen  It s just not happening yet  and it s not happening durably yet OperatorWe will take our next question from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink Richard Newitter    SVB Leerink    Analyst Thank you  Just a follow up on the restructuring  Could you maybe just elaborate a bit on the types of projects or initiatives and the timing within that three year trajectory  I guess really if you could also parse it out between things like sales  incentives  structure changes or any kind of incentive structure changes throughout the organization  what s low hanging fruit versus kind of maybe the harder stuff to go after and when in the time frame  the three year time frame  you re going to go after each Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Why don t I just kind of provide just a real general overview of what we were trying to accomplish in the restructuring  And again  early days so we don t know that we ve done these things yet  but just the intent of the restructuring  And then Suky  maybe you can get into some more detail of the underlying assumptions  First of all  the whole goal of this was to drive better alignment  better accountability and efficiency  right  So we really do believe the restructuring is a better way to manage the business with efficiency included  And if I just think about it  we ve taken all businesses now  We have them under one leader  And the whole intent behind that is to have faster and less biased resource deployment decisions  right  We still have centers of excellence around robotics and informatics and other areas that you want to have unbiased views of how you are going to deploy those resources across the businesses  That now exists by having all businesses going to one person  We also want to have clear accountability  So if you are going to make these decisions on resource deployment  you better have accountability for getting it done and accountability for executing against it  And we are streamlining the organization  We re making it less complex  And as a result of doing that  you can drive margin expansion  right  So those are the reasons why we have done this  Ultimately  it is going to allow us to invest aggressively for growth while expanding margins and managing the business more effectively  So that was the purpose behind it  And then Suky  if you want to give some additional detail Suky Upadhyay    Chief Financial Officer Yes  sure  So Richard  you re thinking about it the right way  There are a number of initiatives  and there are going to be cadence at different times just based on sort of complexity and time it takes to get some of these initiatives up and running  In the early days  I would say it very much is about blocking and tackling and some of the low hanging fruit that you sort of referenced  One  we took a complete cost taxonomy of the organization  and we looked at that cost taxonomy relative to that spending versus external benchmark  relative to internal benchmark  relative to our growth opportunities in our markets and our businesses  And that s leading to  quite frankly  a mix shift in a lot of our spending but also some very clear areas of opportunity to reduce spending in lower value areas  Blocking and tackling things like T E  procurement  just basic costs down  again  blocking and tackling  The second area that s more near term  Bryan talked about the reorganization of some of our business units  That is leading to efficiency  It is leading to efficiency by delayering the organization  So we are putting our commercial leadership closer to our customer and closer to the patient  and that is also leading to some reductions in redundancies  So those are all we call no regret moves because they lead to margin expansion but also make the organization more efficient and effective  Longer term  we re also putting things into place  It s going to take some while for those to mature and bear fruit  But it s around consolidating a pretty fragmented footprint when you think about the two companies  Zimmer and Biomet  coming together and then follow on acquisitions and some of the focus that the companies had to spend over the last few years in supply and quality remediation  We can now start to turn the corner from stabilization to efficiency and start to think about how we consolidate some of that footprint and make ourselves more efficient  And then of course  there s going to be some opportunity in the longer term around centralization of back office and G A type functions  So those are just a few examples  There are several other initiatives  There are a number of initiatives as we ve talked about going on in manufacturing supply chain which we think over time  after we have stabilized gross margins  can lead to some modest improvement in gross margin as well  So hopefully  that gives you a little bit more color as to how we re thinking about it and how we re approaching it Richard Newitter    SVB Leerink    Analyst Thanks for that  Next question please OperatorWe ll take our next question from Matthew O Brien with Piper Sandler Matthew O Brien    Piper Sandler    Analyst Thanks for that question  and Cole  good look in the future  Bryan  I was hoping to talk a little bit about ROSA  Over the last maybe four or five years here  you ve lost about 400 or 500 basis points of knee share  So I m curious on the ROSA side  and I know it s early  but you talked about this massive funnel  Can you talk about what you are seeing in that funnel in terms of is it just more people that have been using Zimmer over the last several years and have been good customers  Or is it a majority of those people that are in the funnel right now  Or have you been surprised by the number of folks that you ve worked with in the past that have come back into the funnel and could be customers here in the near term again  Or even just de novo people that you ve never worked with in the past  If you could kind of weight where some of those clinicians would kind of fit within those three buckets  I think that would be helpful Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Absolutely  It s kind of a mixture  When we put the strategy in place  it was pretty clear that our first intent was to go after those accounts that are already using us  The folks that know and love our implants have always had an interest in moving into robotics but wouldn t do it if they couldn t use their own implant  So there s no question that  that s a pretty big element of our success  just pursuing those that love the implant of Zimmer Biomet and now can use that implant in concert with robotics  But what we re finding is that it s never a perfect world in the way you roll out a plan  and there are situations that are competitive where we know accounts that we would not have pursued in the first place are actually active in looking at robotics  So naturally  as a result of having a robotic solution  we get involved in that process  And we have found that in those competitive situations  even where we didn t have the primary strength in the account  we re winning some of those decisions  And so as a result  we are actually seeing conversions being a part of the placement that we see with ROSA  So it s kind of both  And then on top of that  what we re also finding  which I kind of referenced before  is once we do get a robotic system in place  even in an account that is one of our platinum accounts  one of our big users  there s always individual surgeons that are using competitive implants  And if they want to migrate to robotics  there s obviously a natural gravitational pull to do that  but they have to use our implants  And so that was what I was referencing before  I was just in an account where five surgeons that were using competitive or are using competitive implants are now getting trained on robotics  want to begin using robotics  which is great because that will drive conversions  but it will also drive demand for another robotic system because that s going to get tapped out pretty quick  So again  it s a combination of those things  I also want to make sure that we recognize that there s multiple ways to drive revenue when we do place robotic system  The obvious upfront capital purchase is clearly an opportunity for us  You get a mix benefit  kind of a share of wallet benefit because there is an increased price associated with the disposables you need to do a robotic procedure  And then you get that natural pull through that I just referenced  where you get competitive conversions to be able to use robotic system  So again  it s all coming together  I mean the fact is it is early  We re rapidly training and getting these things out there and building the commercial infrastructure to be able to support demand  but it feels good so far OperatorOur next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo Larry Biegelsen    Wells Fargo Securities    Analyst Just on the ROSA pipeline  just a question on that  Bryan  I heard you talk about hip coming soon  So could you give us an update on the hip  uni and revision knee or those 2020 approvals and if ROSA ONE Spine is still an early 2020 launch Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So I would just take a quick step back and just let you know that there s been a pretty significant shift of focus in the organization  We ve done a very good job of rethinking how we deploy resources inside of research and development and commercial infrastructure  by the way  But we ve really taken a hard look at the R D pipeline  started to get more biased toward robotics and informatics and spent significantly more money  Almost a mix shift that has occurred in those areas  It doesn t mean that we re not going to continue to do implants  But the fact is a good portion of that money is shifting toward ROSA  toward mini robotics  toward informatics  toward efficiency in doing the procedure  So that was a pretty significant innovation shift for the organization because we think it could bring real value to the patient and the customer  So that was a big shift that occurred  As a result of that  we now have more in the pipeline in applications for ROSA and other areas  And so the next things that you are going to see from ROSA  we ve been very transparent about this  a partial knee application  as well as a hip application  Those will likely come in 2020  but I don t want to give specifics  You ll learn more about these at the AAOS meeting  but those are the next in line  Revision is something that we re clearly working on  We have an opportunity to be able to do this because we don t need a CT scan to be able to use the robotic system  It opens the door for our revision procedure  but that s a challenging application to provide  It would be a big window because it is one of the most challenging procedures to do  So if you could have robotic assistance inside of that  it would be attractive  But I don t want to give a view on time line for that  So again  we re shifting dramatically our innovation pipeline to those very important elements of the ecosystem that are around the implant  We don t lose focus on the implant  but we enhanced our capability to bring the implants to the market in a way that helps patients and customers more OperatorOur next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS Matt Taylor    UBS    Analyst So I just wanted to clarify one thing on this operating margin guidance  When you talk about the 30  in 2023  is that the full year number  And the reason I asked is because if we use the midpoint of this year  that does imply higher than that 50 to 70 bps beyond this year over that time frame  And I guess I was wondering if that is right  And what has to happen on the top line for you to achieve that Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer I d say it is interesting because we re talking about 30   and 30  of our questioners have been  inaudible  but I m sorry  Suky Suky Upadhyay    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So you re thinking about it correctly  Matt  It is 30  in year in 2023  Again  as I said earlier in the call  we would not expect the cadence to be linear  It could happen sooner  It could be more in the back end of that period  depending on top line growth and our level of investment back into the business  and I ll come back into that  You re right  Relative to 2020  the midpoint would not suggest any significant margin expansion on an operating margin level  And that is consistent with how we ve talked about the year  where we could see some modest improvement in overall operating margin  However  again  coming back to if we see the right opportunities to invest for long term growth    near term growth for that matter  we will make that decision  And the overall guidance range reflects that optionality  if you will  around margin expansion or investment  I will say  though  I ve got confidence  And we are early days  but the team is executing extremely well against these programs that we ve launched  And I would say that we re going to see margin expansion as early as 2021  But again  I don t know that you can take a linear footprint from today to 2023 and March 2021 in that way  but we do expect to see some margin expansion into 2021 Cole Lannum    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations  and IRO Matt  it probably is worth it to expand on that just to remind everyone again  we don t guide to midpoints  We guide to ranges  and that s exactly what Suky is talking about there  And I think that s an important thing to keep in mind as we think very carefully about what ranges to give OperatorOur next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel Rick Wise Some people won t miss Cole  Bryan  Maybe turning to some of the financial perspectives  maybe I missed sort of the operating cash flow guidance  But obviously  the balance sheet made significant improvement over the last 12 months  A year ago  it was almost four times levered  Now you re roughly two times levered  Are you where you want or need to be  Just where are you aiming toward from here  And does this progress on the balance sheet and driving cash flow open the door in some way  Should we imagine the doors a little more open to increased growth enhancing M A in the year ahead Suky Upadhyay    Chief Financial Officer Yes  Thanks for the question  Rick  So first of all  on 2019  we ended the year at about  1 1 billion of free cash flow  As we move into 2020  we expect that number to be somewhere between  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion  again  2020  And that s inclusive of these restructuring charges that I talked about a bit relative to the restructuring programs that we re initiating  Again  we re saying operating costs or investments for that program will be somewhere between  350 million to  400 million over the time horizon to 2023  We think a little more than half of that will be in 2020  So again  our guidance for free cash flow in 2020   1 1 billion to  1 3 billion  And again  that is inclusive of these restructuring charges that we ll have to take  You re right  We ve made good progress on the balance sheet in delevering  We got ourselves to a point where we are just under three on a net debt basis ending 2019  And relative to our overall capital allocation priorities  we expect to continue to make progress on delevering the balance sheet into 2020  And again  that strong  durable  sticky cash flow generation is a big component of that  The second thing I d say  though  is beyond the priority to continue to delever the balance sheet  we are in a better position now operationally  financially  I think strategically as well  where if we see attractive M A targets that meet our strategic filters  our financial filters  but also maintain a strong capital structure and profile and investment grade  we may decide to invest capital into M A in 2020 and beyond  So again  organically  we expect to continue to delever the balance sheet  But again  we may also decide to deploy some capital toward M A that meets all of our structures that I talked about OperatorOur next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan Robbie Marcus    J P  Morgan    Analyst Just for me  Bryan  I was hoping you could give a little more color on the updates with the FDA inspection  What exactly did the new items entail  How should we think about the seriousness of them  And then is this something that can get resolved in 2020  Or do you expect a resolution more in 2021 time frame Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So first of all  I just want to say any time that we re talking about interaction with the FDA  quality  patient safety  any of those things  I just want to be very clear that we take quality of our products and patient safety as the most important thing we do as an organization  The mission of this company is to alleviate the pain of people in the world and make their quality of their life better  That absolutely means that our product needs to do what it s intended to do and keep them safe  So that s the first thing that we look at  and we feel very confident we re in check there  The fact is it also shows  when we saw the FDA come in  that we ve made real progress  I mean it s hard to describe because you have not been able to see the factory  but a lot of the same FDA investigators that were there actually were there from the very beginning  And even for me  when I walk in the factory  it just looks different  It literally looks different  And the culture  the energy in the factory is different  and that was recognized by the FDA  The fact is we ve got observations  though  We have eight observations in the factory  I would tell you that all of the observations we feel are manageable  And we feel very confident that we can respond to the FDA in a way that s going to be satisfactory to them  The way I look at these things is we already have money earmarked to be able to continuously improve that factory  And the fact that the FDA has given us guidance in the way that they have on where we should focus  it s actually a good thing  Because if we re going to spend money  I d rather spend in an area that I know the FDA is concentrating on  So it s basically a road map for us to be able to do that  But I want to reiterate the fact that we feel very confident that we re going to be able to respond in a way the FDA is going to be satisfied  and we re going to be able to continue to move that factory forward  I think it is important to recognize  though  that this isn t going to be an issue that gets resolved in 2020  It s just not  I mean the only way you move down a path to remove a warning letter is to have an audit where you have basically very little to no observations  And obviously  that didn t happen this go around  And from here  it is just up to the FDA  And when they come back in  we re going to respond to the observations in a very timely manner  in a comprehensive way  keep that dialogue moving with the FDA  But ultimately  it is their decision when they come back in  And even when they come back in  if we get a stellar audit and we have very few to no observations  it still takes time to be able to remove a warning letter  So it is just a process that s involved  At the end of the day  though  even with the warning letter in place  I just want to reiterate the fact that we can absolutely function effectively out of that factory  So I appreciate the question  We feel really good about the progress that we re making  Obviously  some work to do still  but we feel confident we can get there OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham   Company Mike Matson    Needham and Company    Analyst I guess I just wanted to ask another ROSA question  So I did not really hear any commentary on the status of the spine and brain version of robot  So can you maybe talk about the launch plans there and whether or not you sold any in the fourth quarter Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  Yes  I appreciate that  We have folks using the ROSA Spine system  but it is really just those that are developers  And so we are not in really a launch mode yet for that system  But if I just take a step back and I think about the spine business overall  I think about it in a few different ways  We clearly have not been performing the way I would like  and we re not performing right now with predictability in that business  There are key areas that we need to concentrate on  The No 1 thing is we have to get the channel that we have decided on to be able to take advantage of the portfolio that we have  The fact is we have the best cervical disc in the market  And we need to make sure that now we re taking advantage of the Mobi C in the way that we should  now that we have stability in the channel  We have The Tether  which is an absolute pivotal change for those with scoliosis  It dramatically changes the care for that patient population  a very exciting technology  but the channel has got to take advantage of that  And we have now gap fillers like the TrellOss titanium 3D printed interbody  That was a major gap for us  We now have that 3D printed interbody that we need to make sure that we are taking advantage of  And we have to launch ROSA  and that is got to happen in 2020  It is not just ROSA  though  It is got to be ROSA in concert with our mini robotics platform and Walter because that provides a comprehensive solution for the surgeon when we talk about robotics  not just placing screws but also being that third or fourth arm for the surgeon and the procedure  All those things need to come together in a predictable way so that we can start to turn that business  So ROSA Spine is definitely a part of the equation  it s just not the whole equation and the intent is to launch that in 2020 OperatorOur next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG Ryan Zimmerman    BTIG    Analyst Great  So just want to follow up  Bryan  I heard you loud and clear on the S E T  business  And I just want to dig into the components of that between sports  extremities and trauma  Can you just talk about kind of where you re most focused of those three if we were to kind of parse that out a little bit more than kind of what we ve seen thus far Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Yes  It s a great observation  I mean the fact is the S E T  businesses  although in aggregate  they do grow in that midsingle digit growth area  they are not all created equal  obviously  And the whole idea in our organization is to make sure we are disciplined and focused  So as a result of that discipline and focus  we need to make sure that we re picking the most attractive submarkets inside of S E T  And I can tell you it is kind of obvious when you look at it  Sports and extremities will be the areas that we focus most on  And so you re going to see a lot of our attention not just in research and development but also from a commercial channel standpoint  training and education being focused in those areas  The fact is we already have a significant right to win  and we need to take advantage of that in upper extremities  I want to see us build more scale in lower extremities and absolutely become a market share leader there  and we have a lot of traction and opportunity for us in sports  So those are going to be the areas where you re going to see significant investment  significant focus  Our operating mechanisms are being built around that  and that will be the area that we concentrate inside of S E T Ryan Zimmerman    BTIG    Analyst Thanks for that Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer Next question please  operator OperatorNext question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen Josh Jennings    Cowen and Company    Analyst Hey good morning  Thanks for taking the questions  I was hoping to just get an update on the sales force  I know there is different sales forces for different divisions  But just from a high level  can you just share with us the attrition rates you re experiencing entering 2020 or exiting 2019 versus exiting 2018  And then I think you ve talked historically about the compensation scheme being in place to drive the sales force coming on offense  Can you help us understand if there are any nuances to that compensation scheme and when that was put into effect  Thanks for taking the question Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer I would tell you it is we have actually had zero regrettable turnover in the commercial organization  And I always look at it to say if you stuck with the organization through all the hell that occurred over the last number of years and you leave the organization now when the momentum comes  I probably don t want you in the organization anyway because you are not making rational decisions  But that s playing out  I said it kind of tongue in cheek in the past  But the fact is we have had zero regrettable turnover in the commercial organization  It is a testament to the fact that people understand momentum is coming  that we have a market leadership position in large joints  We have potential to do the same thing in S E T  And we have new products that are coming that get the sales organization excited  Again  I see that momentum  I feel it  I was in the Asia Pacific kickoff meeting  I felt significant energy there  Same thing in Americas  I ll be in actually after this event  we will be heading to Spain for the European kickoff event  And I can tell you the energy is just there  So we re not seeing that turnover  When you see momentum like this and you don t have a critical turnover  it gives you the opportunity to decide who stays in the organization and who doesn t  And that gives us an opportunity to upgrade talent as we go  That will be a major focus of this organization  always ensuring we have the best talent  developing the best talent and retaining the best talent OperatorOur next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank Pito Chickering    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Cole  thanks for your help over the years  While still early in the ROSA launch  I m curious what percent of ROSA Knee are being done cementless right now  I m certain that you use that with knees and the robots  Are you starting to convert the non ROSA Knee to cementless Bryan Hanson    President and Chief Executive Officer So yes  So the cementless opportunity is kind of bifurcated  We have an opportunity to be able to convert knees to cementless without ROSA  So we are certainly trying to do that and are doing that  At the same time  when you look at the robotic application  you get such confidence in cuts that typically what you find is people are more willing to go to cementless as a result of having robotics in  So it is a combination of those two things  And you would naturally see in robotic cases a higher mix of cementless versus nonrobotic cases  But either way  we do not have a lot of robotic systems out there today  And we re not slowing down in our pushing of the cementless option because we think it s a very good one  So it s both of those things  right  So we are going to go after conversions and get a mix benefit for those that are already using our implant with cementless  And we re absolutely going to take advantage of robotics to be able to drive cementless as well OperatorOur next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Barclays Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst Thanks for taking my questions  Cole  I guess you will be missed  I have a question just about the restructuring program in general  So if I look at the pre tax savings that you re expecting to be generated  it looks like that contributes pretty much all of the operating margin expansion over the next several years  And then the free cash flow I guess as well  I guess that s also eating into the cash flow  I guess  that you re expecting as well  the  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion that you re guiding to  How should we just think about the operating cash flow for the next couple of years  too  Because  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion seems kind of flattish relative to where you ve been at for the last couple of years  So I m just trying to understand what kind of the base business is doing absent this restructuring charge or charges and savings Suky Upadhyay    Chief Financial Officer Yes  sure  So you re right  Kristen  If you took the range that we discussed   200 million to  300 million by 2023  and you dropped all that to margin  you could effectively get to 30   right  Your math is right on  But I think it is important to understand that  that program is not just about margin expansion and through cost reduction and dropping that  It really is more about creating a mix shift and providing us the ability and the confidence to invest against our highest priority opportunities to drive top line growth  right  So I would say the program is more about creating and leveraging that funding to drop top line versus just a sheer drop down into operating profit  So we think it s actually going to be a combination of accelerating revenue growth from where we are today but also improving overall margins as we leverage our infrastructure and grow SG A at a slow rate than top line  OK  So that s how we think about overall the margin profile between now and 2023  where we re seeing at least 30  operating margin  Relative to free cash flow  again  we ended 2019 at just about  1 1 billion  We do expect to see an improvement into 2020  So our guidance  our guidance has that profile baked into the  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion  And again  that  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion is burdened by some of these restructuring costs that we said will be  350 million to  400 million over that three  to four year period  again  more than half of that being in 2020  So the underlying cash flow operationally within the business is  in fact  improving and improving at a really healthy clip into 2020  And again  as we think about what are our key metrics and financial priorities  revenue growth  margin expansion  free cash flow conversion  we do expect to see an increase and an improvement in overall free cash flow conversion into 2020  So hopefully  that gives you a little Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst Yes  Is that  1 1 billion to  1 3 billion  is that an adjusted cash flow  Or is that like a real cash flow number Suky Upadhyay    Chief Financial Officer No  That s straight cash flow  That s operating cash flow less property  plant and equipment and instruments Kristen Stewart    Barclays    Analyst OK  I ll have another question online Cole Lannum    Senior Vice President  Investor Relations  and IRO Yes  let us do the last off line because we re at the bottom of the hour  So we re going to wrap it right there  Thanks

130013,351528,ZBH,Here s Why You Should Retain NuVasive  NUVA  Stock For Now,opinion,NuVasive  Inc    NASDAQ NUVA   has been showing solid progress on robust performance within U S  Spinal Hardware and U S  Surgical Support businesses as well as rapid expansion into international markets The company has a market cap of  3 19 billion  It has an expected earnings growth rate of 11 9  for the next five years Over the past year  this company s share price has outperformed its industry  The stock has gained 22 8  compared with the  s 4 1  increase and the S P 500 index s 4 4  rise Riding on solid prospects  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is worth retaining for now What s Favoring the Stock International Business Flourishes  According to NuVasive  international regions hold tremendous growth opportunity  In the first quarter of 2019  the EMEA region witnessed a solid uptick on strong contribution from the United Kingdom  Southern  NYSE SO  Europe and Benelux  The tender secured last year in Germany and Benelux contributed to international revenues in the first quarter  Revenues earned from the Asia Pacific region grew on solid contributions from Japan  Australia and New Zealand Solid Growth in U S  Spinal Hardware Business  NuVasive s U S  Spinal Hardware business has been performing well of late  The first quarter revenue growth was driven by strong adoption of new products coupled with new surgeon conversions  The company registered a healthy uptick in its XLIF and ALIF franchises on momentum gained in a lateral single position surgery solution  now branded as the X360 System  In particular  the Advanced Materials Science portfolio with the COHERE  cervical  and TLIF Porous PEEK antibodies saw massive growth from the year ago period Robust Performance by U S  Surgical Support Business  Within the Surgical Support business  NuVasive completed the acquisition of Safe Passage at the end of the first quarter  With this acquisition  the company has solidified its leadership position as the largest provider of outsourced intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring services  Per management  the market is gradually experiencing greater adoption and increasing demand for its offering of surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption Downsides However  there are a few factors which have been deterring growth of the stock lately Macro economic Headwind May Hamper Growth  The market for spine is highly susceptible to any change in economic  political and regulatory influences which may slow down the spine market s growth rate  These changes include pricing pressure from the continued consolidation of hospital customers and the expansion of group purchasing organizations  unfavorable third party payer coverage  reimbursement policies  and new and proposed legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare Pricing Pressure Persists  Pricing continues to be a major headwind for NuVasive as it experiences declining prices for its products due to increasing competition in the spine market Tough Competitive Landscape  The presence of a large number of players has made the medical devices market intensely competitive  The orthopedic industry  in particular  is highly competitive with the presence of bellwethers like Zimmer Holdings  NYSE ZBH   Stryker  NYSE SYK   Johnson   Johnson s DePuy  Orthofix International N V  Vyaire Medical  formerly VIASYS Healthcare  a division of Becton  Dickinson and Company  and Medtronic  NYSE MDT  Which Way Are Estimates Heading For the second quarter of 2019  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 56 cents  indicating a 3 5  fall from the year ago figure  The same for revenues stands at  291 8 million  implying a year over year improvement of 3 6  from the prior year reported number For 2019  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at  2 28  suggesting 2 2  year over year growth from the year earlier figure  The same for revenues is pegged at  1 15 billion  hinting at 4 8  rise from the reported figure in the prior year quarter Key PicksSome better ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Cerner Corporation   NASDAQ CERN    Penumbra   NYSE PEN   and Bruker Corporation   NASDAQ BRKR    While Cerner sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   the other two stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Cerner s long term

130014,351529,ZBH,Zimmer Biomet Grows Internationally Despite Pricing Pressure,opinion,"On Jun 11  we issued an updated research report on Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc    NYSE ZBH    The company continues to witness strength in the Asia Pacific  APAC  and Europe  Middle East and Africa  EMEA  regions  However  pricing persists to be a major concern for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company 
This leading musculoskeletal healthcare company has outperformed its  over the past six months  The stock has rallied 10 7  compared with the industry s 8 5  rise 
During the first quarter  although Zimmer Biomet registered sluggish segmental numbers  the results were slightly above its expectations  The company saw strength in the Europe  Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific belts as well as in the Spine   CMF business 
Zimmer Biomet is also executing well within its priority areas like quality remediation  supply recovery efforts and product launches  In terms of new products  the solid roll out of ROSA robotics platform was clearly a major feat Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc  Price

   Over the recent past  Zimmer Biomet has been working to solidify its foothold in the emerging markets that provide long term opportunities  The company s strategic investments in these zones over the last several quarters to improve its operational and sales performance are yielding results  Zimmer Biomet expects strength in the APAC and EMEA markets to be consistent in 2019 
The company should benefit from favorable long term trends that point toward sustained growth  driven by obesity  wear and tear of joints from more active lifestyles  growth in the emerging markets  new material technologies  advancements in the surgical techniques and proven clinical benefits of joint replacement procedures 
We are also upbeat about the company s plan to deliver 2 3  growth in 2020 and stabilize its business  In order to achieve this goal  the company has designed a three pillar strategy for 2020 and beyond  First  it is targeting to be labeled as the most preferred organization to work in  Second  Zimmer Biomet is trying to build its brand image as a trusted partner to its stakeholders  Third  the company wants to deliver high shareholder returns  For this  it is aiming to implement a five year program that will help improve the company s financials 
However  the company s top line growth has been partially offset by an unrelenting pricing pressure  We are worried about this pricing scenario as it will be affected by cost containment efforts by governmental healthcare  local hospitals and health systems  In the first quarter of 2019  pricing pressure was negative 2 6   in line with the company s expectations 
Furthermore  escalating costs and expenses are denting the company s adjusted operating margin  Adverse currency movements are a lingering downside 
Key Picks
Some better ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Cerner Corporation   NASDAQ CERN    Penumbra   NYSE PEN   and Bruker Corporation   NASDAQ BRKR    While Cerner sports a Zacks Rank  1  Penumbra and Bruker carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Cerner s long term earnings growth rate is expected to be 13 5  
Penumbra s long term earnings growth rate is projected at 21 5  
Bruker s long term earnings growth rate is estimated at 11 7

130059,351574,ZBH,Stryker  Halo to get second chance at enhanced patent damages,news,By Andrew Chung NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Supreme Court on Monday said federal judges should have more discretion to boost penalties in patent infringement cases and ordered an appeals court to review whether Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc  N ZBH  willfully violated  Stryker  Corp  N SYK  patents on a surgical cleaning wand  In a unanimous opinion  the high court also ordered the appeals court in a separate case to review whether Pulse Electronics Corp willfully infringed Halo Electronics Inc s patents   The justices said a test for determining willful infringement  which can allow judges to triple damages awarded to a patent owner  was too rigid and allowed some egregious infringers to escape liability  The test had been developed by the U S  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington  D C   the nation s top patent court   Industry groups were closely following the cases because lowering the bar for judges to award enhanced damages could hand patent owners a potent new weapon to file infringement cases and push for licenses   Stryker  a medical device maker  and Halo  which makes circuit board transformers  were denied enhanced damages by the Federal Circuit after winning patent infringement lawsuits against competitors  The appeals court has said that to be awarded enhanced damages  meant as punishment for deliberate and reckless copying  a patent owner must prove a defendant acted despite a high likelihood of infringement and had no reasonable explanation for doing so   Halo and Stryker argued that the test allowed a willful infringer to escape punishment if it can muster any reasonable defense  even if it acted in bad faith  Writing for the court  Chief Justice John Roberts agreed  saying the test wrongly insulates a  wanton and malicious pirate  who infringes to steal a patent owner s business from enhanced damages   In court papers  some Silicon Valley companies that are frequent targets of patent suits  including  Google Inc   O GOOGL  and Cisco Systems Inc  O CSCO   urged the Supreme Court to maintain the current system to discourage  meritless allegations of infringement    Roberts said concerns that so called patent trolls  who make money by suing over patents  would be emboldened by the ruling  do not justify the rigid test   Stryker sued Zimmer in 2010 for infringing its patented surgical wand and was awarded more than  210 million for willful infringement  a finding overturned by the Federal Circuit in 2014  Halo sued Pulse in 2007  The Federal Circuit similarly found that Pulse s infringement of several Halo patents was not willful  The cases are Halo Electronics  Inc v  Pulse Electronics  Inc and Stryker Corp v  Zimmer  Inc  in the Supreme Court of the United States  Nos  14 1513 and 14 1520 ,2016-06-13,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/stryker,-halo-to-get-second-chance-at-enhanced-patent-damages-408059",408059

130089,351604,ZBH,Should Value Investors Pick Zimmer Biomet  ZBH  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc    NYSE ZBH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Zimmer Biomet has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Zimmer Biomet s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 15 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 24 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Zimmer Biomet has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 3  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Zimmer Biomet s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Zimmer Biomet has a P S ratio of about 3  This is slightly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Zimmer Biomet currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ZBH a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 8  which is noticeably better than the industry average of 18 6  Clearly  ZBH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Zimmer Biomet might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of F  This gives ZBH a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen 11 estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and nine downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 2 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineZimmer Biomet is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 35  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Nonetheless  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest

compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Zimmer Biomet s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 15 8  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 3  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Zimmer Biomet has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 0  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Zimmer Biomet s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Zimmer Biomet has a P S ratio of about 3 1  This is marginally lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Zimmer Biomet currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ZBH a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Zimmer Biomet is just 1 5  a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 2 6  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 9  which is considerably better than the industry average of 19 2  Clearly  ZBH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Zimmer Biomet might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D  This gives ZBH a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen eleven estimates go lower in the past sixty days  compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen fifteen downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 1 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineZimmer Biomet is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 37  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-10-02,Zacks Investment

Our Take
Zimmer Biomet ended the quarter on a mixed note  While earnings and revenues both topped the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  the lowered 2017 guidance added to our concerns  Nevertheless  improved top line show across all geographies was encouraging  Also improved Knees encouraged us after a sluggish performance  However  Dental still remains flat 
We look forward to the expected synergy from the LDR Holding acquisition  which should broaden and complement the company s musculoskeletal offering  We are also encouraged by the strong strategic and financial goals which the combined entity expects to reach now that the deal has been closed

130253,351768,ZBH,Zimmer Biomet  ZBH  Q2 Earnings  A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Orthopedic reconstructive products manufacturer  Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc    NYSE ZBH   is slated to report its second quarter 2016 financial numbers on Jul 28  before the opening bell  
Last quarter  the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 63   Encouragingly  Zimmer Biomet s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters  with an average beat of 3 45   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise  
Our proven model shows that the company is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  Zimmer Biomet has an  of  1 02   That is because the Most Accurate estimate is  2 00 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  1 93  This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Zimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Zimmer Biomet s Zacks Rank  2 and  1 02  ESP makes us reasonably certain of a positive earnings beat ZIMMER BIOMET Price and EPS Surprise
    
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
During the last reported quarter  Zimmer Biomet witnessed severe revenue related headwinds in its dental division caused by a supply disruption linked with a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue  However  we are encouraged by the company s commitment to find solutions for the issue by the end of the second quarter  Hence  we expect to see a rebound in the company s dental revenue down the line which may commence from the second quarter itself 
Overall  the market assumption for 2016 remains quite favorable for Zimmer Biomet  According to the company  the musculoskeletal market is expected to grow approximately 3  in 2016 with global market conditions remaining stable when compared to full year 2015 
We are looking forward to Zimmer Biomet s assurance of revenue acceleration across multiple product categories through portfolio expansion throughout 2016 with strategic internal and external development opportunities  Previously the company projected planned commercialization schedule of over 50 new product launches in 2016  of which around 12 were completed in the first quarter 
Additionally  starting from the first quarter through 2016  Zimmer Biomet expects to realize increasing sales force productivity  driven by added stability and specialization in its global sales organizations  and aided by benefits of its medical education and training programs 
In the second quarter 2016  the company projects revenue growth rate of 3  to 4  at constant exchange rate  Foreign currency translation is expected to reduce the company s reported second quarter revenues by 1   Second quarter adjusted EPS is envisioned between  1 93 and  1 98 
Further  with a strong cash balance  Zimmer Biomet intends to return half of its net income to its stockholders through annual share repurchase programs and target suitable acquisitions in the musculoskeletal space  A step to attract more investors to the stock 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  
Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   has an Earnings ESP of  1 49  and a Zacks Rank  1 
Teligent Inc    NASDAQ TLGT   has an Earnings ESP of  100  and a Zacks Rank  2

results  The share price decline can be primarily attributed to the company s soft third quarter earnings guidance Stryker reported adjusted earnings of  1 39 per share  which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and improved 15 8  from the year ago quarter The adjusted earnings figure was also better than management s guided range  The upside was primarily driven by a 16 8

Consensus and EPS Surprise   In the U S  sales increased 5 9   driven by a 9 5  increase in Trauma and Extremities and a 6 8  growth in Knees  Sales growth was driven by strong performance of 3D printed Tritanium revision cones and cementless knee products  The U S  Hips business posted low single digit growth due to softness in the revision market Stryker sold 17 MAKO robots globally during the quarter  The company noted that the order trend is encouraging  driven by expanded indications and the planned launch of the Total Knee system  expected in 2017   Robust procedure growth in both

However  management noted solid demand for its newer 3D printed Tritanium products  Further  Spine s international growth was dampened by product supply issues and continued challenges in China Acquisitions Drove SalesManagement noted that the recently closed acquisitions of Sage Products LLC and Physio Control International contributed  240 million to sales in the quarter     Sage Products sales increased 9  in the quarter  Sage s products are complementary to Stryker s portfolio of ICU and MedSurg products  with disposables targeted at reducing never events The acquisition also expands Stryker s hospital product offerings and improves its product mix  single use versus capital products   Management at Stryker believes that Sage s total addressable market in North America is currently worth  1 4 billion  The company expects double digit revenue growth in the second half of 2016 Stryker believes that a newly launched product like AirTap provides significant growth opportunity in the long haul  Management plans to expand manufacturing capacity beginning 2018 to support anticipated growth The other completed acquisition   Physio Control   has a dominant position in the development  manufacture and sale of defibrillators and monitors  automated external defibrillators  AEDs   and CPR assist devices  Per management  on a global basis  Physio Control s total addressable market is worth approximately  1 7 billion The Physio Control acquisition significantly improves Stryker s product mix as it has an attractive mix of 60  capital and 40  recurring business  Notably  Stryker s EMS business is almost 100  capital in nature Management believes that Physio Control s expanding product portfolio and new product launches will drive strong sales growth in the long run Physio Control s sales also grew roughly 9  in the quarter  The company now expects high single digit growth from the Physio Control business in the second half of 2016 MarginsAdjusted gross margin contracted 10 basis points  bps  to 66 2   primarily due to a favorable mix  foreign exchange rate and two year suspension of medical device tax Research and development  R D  expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased 10 bps to 6 4  On the other hand  adjusted selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses declined 120 bps to 34 9   primarily due to leverage from recent acquisitions as well as improving sales mix and operating efficiencies Adjusted operating margin expanded 100 bps on a year over year basis to 24 8   on the back of strong top line growth  a favorable mix and lower SG A expenses LiquidityStryker exited second quarter 2016 with cash and cash equivalents of  3 66 billion as compared with  6 98 billion at the end of first quarter 2016  Long term debt  excluding current maturities  was  6 71 billion  flat with the first quarter GuidanceFor the third quarter of 2016  Stryker expects adjusted earnings in the range of  1 33 to  1 38 per share  An unfavorable foreign exchange rate is expected to impact earnings by 3 cents per share  although it is forecast to have a neutral impact on quarterly sales Stryker expects organic sales growth of 6  to 6 5   up from the earlier guided range of 5 5  to 6 5   for full year 2016  Unfavorable foreign exchange is expected to hurt sales by about 1  and have a negative impact of 10 12 cents on full year 2016 Moreover  gross margin is expected around 67  for the rest of 2016 Adjusted net earnings are projected in the range of  5 70 to  5 80 per share compared with the earlier guidance of  5 65 to  5 80 Stryker expects ongoing challenges in the MedSurg segment in China to continue throughout 2016 as the company strives to solve issues with distributors and drive end customer demand Management also expects the product supply headwind in the Spine business to continue affecting sales in the third quarter and start improving from the fourth quarter of 2016 Our TakeWe believe Stryker s innovative product pipeline will be a key catalyst in the near term  Growing adoption of MAKO will drive sales in the orthopedic and reconstructive surgery market Moreover  the acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio Control have significant growth potential in our view  With Sage  the company has the opportunity to expand internationally in markets like Canada  Europe  Japan and Australia  although management believes that the process will take some time However  pricing pressure will continue to hurt sales  Moreover  China is expected to remain a challenging market for the company for the rest of 2016  Further  product supply issues are expected to impact the Spine business that can drag down top line growth in the second half of 2016 Moreover  intensifying competition is a major headwind  Management did not note any significant change in market share in the second quarter  However  we believe that the growing presence of its peers like Zimmer Biomet   NYSE ZBH   and Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ   will curb Stryker s growth prospects in the near term Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently  Stryker carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   A better ranked stock in the medical sector is Boston

NuVasive posted adjusted operating income of  30 1 million in the reported quarter  reflecting a 3  decline from the year ago number  Adjusted operating margin contracted 255 bps to 12 7  in the reported quarter 
Outlook
NuVasive    the consolidated company  post the acquisitions of Ellipse Technologies and Mega Surgical  has once again provided an update on its full year 2016 guidance  This latest guidance takes into consideration the acquisition effect of Biotronic NeuroNetwork and the impact from the adoption of the ASU for employee share based payment accounting  as well as expected changes in foreign currency rates 
The company currently expects 2016 revenues of approximately  962 million  an increase from the earlier quoted guidance of  928 million   up 18 6  from 2015  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  934 2 million remains below the expectation 
NuVasive has also provided its estimate for the full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share at  1 64  Earlier prediction was  1 48   up approximately 25  from the 2015 EPS number  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 51 remains much below the company s guidance  Additionally  adjusted operating margin for the year is projected at 16   15 8    up 60 bps on a year over year basis 
Our Take
NuVasive performed well in the second quarter of 2016 with both earnings and revenues steering past the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Strong growth in core international business along with solid contribution from NSO  the newly added segment contributed to the growth 
According to management  there is tremendous growth opportunity for NuVasive overseas  given that it currently holds a mere 4  of the total market share therein  In addition  we are also happy to see the continued strong contribution from NuVasive s core U S  spinal hardware business  With the raised 2016 guidance  we can also conclude that  this growth process is going to continue in the rest of 2016 as well 
NuVasive  at present  is rapidly developing technologies and services for spine surgery  expanding its global footprint in the existing and new markets  and building itself as a commercial powerhouse with integrated sales  service and specialized customer marketing programs  To this end  the company recently acquired privately held Ellipse Technologies that works on the transformation of procedural solutions for complex skeletal deformity 
In addition  the company s acquisition of Brazilian distributor  Mega Surgical has already started to contribute to its growth in 2016  Its latest acquisition of Biotronic NeuroNetwork is also expected to strengthen the company s foothold in the growing spine procedure solutions space 
The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

130264,351779,ZBH,CVS Health  CVS  Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"CVS Health Corporation   NYSE CVS   is scheduled to report its second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Aug 2 
Last quarter  CVS Health posted earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 72   CVS Health has beat earnings in two of the prior four quarters  with a positive average surprise of 0 65    Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
CVS Health is optimistic about sustaining its solid year over year earnings trend in the rest of 2016 driven by the gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment  However  according to the company  there are several timing factors that will affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year CVS HEALTH CORP Price and EPS Surprise
   These factors include the introduction and timing of break open in generics  the timing of profitability in Medicare Part D business  the timing of the benefits from the company s strategies to drive growth in the front end  and the timing of share repurchases along with certain tax benefits among others 
Consequently  even after delivering a better than expected first quarter  these timing factors will lead to a back half weighted profit growth in 2016  The second quarter as a result  may remain dreary in terms of profit 
On the optimistic side  CVS Health had already completed the 2016 selling season with the retention rate of 97 3   Turning to 2017 selling season  despite tough pricing competition  CVS health is currently benefiting well displaying high levels of service and execution  competitive pricing along with unique integrated model that allows the company to provide diverse products and services that generate savings  better health outcomes and convenience  The company last declared that it had completed over a third of its client renewals already 
We take note of the recently completed Omnicare and Target Pharmacy acquisitions that are currently undergoing the integration process  According to CVS  both the acquisitions are strategic fits and it anticipates gaining from the multiple opportunities for driving enterprise value from Omnicare and Target in both the near and long term 
CVS Health had earlier provided its second quarter 2016 adjusted EPS projection  The company forecasts adjusted EPS in the range of  1 28  1 31  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 30 falls near to the upper end of the guided range 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank 1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  CVS Health s Earnings ESP is 0 77  since the Most Accurate estimate falls at  1 31 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands lower at  1 30

Our Take
Zimmer Biomet reported a better than expected second quarter with respect to both earnings and revenues  Encouragingly  the company posted sales growth in all other geographies  However  the still sluggish sales in Dental concern us  The huge margin contraction also poses a major threat 
We still look forward to the expected synergy from the grand  13 35 billion acquisition of Biomet  We are encouraged by the strong strategic and financial goals which the combined entity expects to reach now that the deal has been closed  The raised guidance for 2016 also boosts up our confidence on the stock

130285,351800,ZBH,Will GNC Holdings   GNC  Q1 Earnings Surprise Investors ,opinion,"GNC Holdings  Inc    NYSE GNC   is slated to report its first quarter 2016 financial numbers on Apr 28  before the opening bell  
Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1 61   However  GNC Holdings  earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 of the past four quarters  with an average miss of 4 75  

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
GNC Holdings ended 2015 on a mixed note  in the face of volatile sales and stock performance that significantly affected the specialty retail industry  However  the company s strong cash balance and latest rebound in domestic company owned same store sales are encouraging 
Meanwhile  management is quite optimistic that its recent initiatives will drive performance in quarters ahead  starting from the first quarter of 2016 
Coming to its first quarter s performance  the company expects to register a sequential increase in domestic company owned same store sales in the first quarter  as well as the following quarters  which in turn has raised the company s guidance for this metric for 2016 
However  management expects a shift in Easter timing and the weather conditions in the month of January to impact GNC Holdings  first quarter results  This is turn is expected to result in a negative low single digit comp in the quarter  Meanwhile  EBIT margins are likely to be impacted by increased marketing expenditures  for the quarter 
With respect to the bottom line performance  management anticipates a year over year decline in first quarter adjusted EPS owing to higher marketing expenses 
On a brighter note  management believes that GNC Holdings will overcome the aforementioned adversities in the remaining quarters of 2016  In particular  the company has adopted a four pronged strategy to drive growth  refranchising  pricing  customer loyalty and the Gold Card  and the industry coalition 
For full year 2016  GNC Holdings expects adjusted EPS in the range of  3 15  3 35  excluding the positive impact from corporate to franchise store conversions to enhance comparability with prior periods  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 EPS is pegged at  3 22  within the company s guidance 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that GNC Holdings is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   GNC Holdings has an earnings ESP of 0 00  That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 75 cents 
Zacks Rank  GNC Holdings has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  a 0 00   ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions
