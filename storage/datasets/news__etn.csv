14715,236230,ETN,Blast at machine shop rips through Houston neighborhood  killing two,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN  HOUSTON  Reuters    A massive explosion at a machine shop ripped through a Houston neighborhood early on Friday morning  killing at least two people and damaging homes while sending out blast waves for miles  The pre dawn explosion devastated two working class neighborhoods surrounding the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing facility in northwest Houston  leaving behind collapsed and smoldering wreckage on the grounds and knocking several nearby homes off their foundations  Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said early indications pointed to a leak of propylene gas  a colorless  flammable  liquefied gas with several industrial uses  But Police Chief Art Acevedo said that was  just a huge assumption  and cautioned that the investigation could take several days  weeks or months  Officials stressed that they had no reason to believe the explosion was intentionally triggered   The multi agency probe will focus primarily on whether any regulatory violations were committed by either Watson Grinding or its vendors  Acevedo said  adding the company was cooperating fully   While investigators sought to positively identify the two victims  there is a  high probability  they were two men who worked for the company  Acevedo said  Numerous homes had windows blown in  Others were surrounded by shattered piles of debris    I thought it was thunder   said Bruce Meikle  78  an owner of nearby manufacturer ChemSystems  who heard the explosion from his home about a mile  1 6 km  from the scene  The force of the blast bent the metal loading doors at his business and caused minor damage inside  he told Reuters  Paul Crea  59  a chemist who works for Meikle  said the blast woke him 10 miles  16 km  away in Katy  a Houston suburb  and his dogs bellowed at the sound  Acevedo asked people as far as a mile  1 6 km  away to search their yards and neighborhoods for evidence   Look for any debris  any body parts  anything that may be related   Acevedo said  Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the blast was felt as far away as 14 miles  22 km   based on social media reports   The moment of the explosion  around 4 25 a m  CST  1025 GMT   was captured on video by a home security camera  It showed a blinding flash in the distance followed by a fireball  Firefighters secured a 2 000 gallon propylene tank outside the building and would allow any remaining fires to burn out  Pena said  Rescue crews fanned out to examine nearly 200 homes   Some of them are off the foundation  the ones especially that are closer to the explosion site   Pena said  A temporary shelter was established for people left homeless

14718,236233,ETN,Heavy and medium sour crudes jump in U S   Canada after killing of Iran commander,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN 
HOUSTON  Reuters    Heavy Canadian and U S  medium sour crude differentials strengthened on Friday following a U S  air strike in Baghdad that killed Iran s military commander Qassem Soleimani and stirred Middle East geopolitical tensions  traders said 
Iran promised harsh revenge following the U S  attack that killed Soleimani  considered by many to be the second most powerful figure in Iran after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
Key North American heavy and medium sour crude grades jumped on speculation that potential retaliation by Iran could disrupt flows of similar crudes in the Middle East  traders said  Most of the heavy sour crude imported by the United States comes from Canada  but the nation also brings in significant shipments from Iraq and Saudi Arabia  according to federal data 
Mars Sour crude  the flagship medium sour U S  Gulf Coast grade  traded  1 55 over U S  crude futures  up from around  1 20 on Thursday  traders said 
Western Canada Select  WCS  crude at Hardisty  Alberta  for delivery in February traded  22 50 below West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude on Friday  narrowed from Thursday s  23 50 settlement  according to traders and pricing data provided by Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co 
Canadian crude shipments by rail to U S  refiners were expected to rise from already high levels  traders and analysts said  as Canadian crude  even with rail costs factored in  was profitable to sell in the U S  Gulf  said Matt Murphy  analyst at Tudor Pickering 
WCS Houston for March delivery currently trades at about  4 90 under WTI  and rail transportation to the U S  runs at about  12 per barrel  WCS at Hardisty  Alberta  for March traded  21 25 under WTI on Friday  traders said 
 It s pretty telling in terms of how much these Gulf Coast refiners want to pay for these barrels   Murphy said 
Canadian crude by rail shipments to the United States hit a record 500 000 barrels per day  bpd  in early December  according to Tudor  Most of those barrels remained in the U S  Gulf  however 
Only one shipment of 500 000 barrels of Canadian crude loaded for export from the U S  Gulf Coast last month  according to vessel tracking firm ClipperData 
 It makes a lot more sense for that crude to stay in the Gulf Coast and crack the heavy molecule into diesel and gasoline instead of exporting to places less well equipped to handle the crude   said Abudi Zein  chief executive of ClipperData ",2020-01-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/heavy-and-medium-sour-crudes-jump-in-us-canada-after-killing-of-iran-commander-2052070,2052070

call  With me today are Craig Arnold  our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon  Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer  Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company s performance in the fourth quarter  As we have done in our past calls  we ll be taking questions at the end of Craig s comments  The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and also the presentation we ll go through today have been posted on our website at   Please note that both the press release and the presentation including reconciliation to non GAAP measures  A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay Before we get started  I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward looking statements  Our actual results may differ materially from our projected future earnings due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and presentation that are also outlined in our related 8 K filing  With that  I will turn it over to Craig Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  thanks Yan  appreciate it  Hey  we ll start with Page 3 with our recent highlights  Two weeks ago  as everybody knows  we announced the agreement to sell our Hydraulics business to Danfoss for  3 3 billion  which represents a 13 2 times 2019 EBITDA  This decision is part of the ongoing transformation of Eaton into a company with higher growth  higher margins  and more consistent earnings  We re really pleased with that  We believe this transaction will create substantial value for our shareholders and allow our Hydraulics employees  importantly  become part of a company that has a strong commitment to the Hydraulics industry Our team has made significant progress on other portfolio actions including closing the acquisition of Souriau Sunbank and the sale of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business at the end of the year  The sale of our Lighting business is expected to close in Q1 and as you ve read  we ve just announced the acquisition of Power Distribution  Inc  Power Distribution  Inc  is a  125 million company that serves the data center market and will become part of our Electrical Systems and Services business Switching to our Q4 results and I d summarize the quarter s performance as one with strong earnings  record margins  strong cash flow despite slower than expected growth in our end markets  Organic revenue excluding Lighting and Hydraulics was down 2   Earnings per share of  1 49  Phonetic  on a GAAP basis and  1 46 excluding  0 28 of acquisition and divestiture costs and  0 09 for costs we expect to incur related to vehicle warranty  At  1 46  our results were flat with last year and at the high end of our guidance range of  1 36 to  1 46  Our sales of  5 2 billion were down 4  organically with negative currency of 0 5   offset by 0 5  from acquisitions  We continued to generate strong margins and delivered a Q4 record of 17 8  excluding acquisition and divestiture costs and the expected vehicle warranty costs  These margins were above the high end of our guidance range and 40 basis points above prior year  And we re also pleased with our operating cash flows  which were  937 million in the quarter  So stepping back  I think we d all agree that it s been a busy and a very productive period for Eaton Turning to Page 4  we summarize our Q4 financial performance and I ll note just a few highlights on this page  First  we increased our adjusted segment operating margins by 40 basis points and our team  I d say here executed well and we had a detrimental margins of less than 10   Second  our adjusted segment operating profits were  933 million  down 2  despite 4  lower organic sales  Net income of  452 million was down 28  and this was primarily due to acquisition and divestiture costs of  140  Phonetic  million and vehicle warranty charges of  39 million  and both of these numbers I would note are on an after tax basis  Similar to Q3  these strong results are I think a good indication of how we intend to manage the company during periods of market weakness  running our operations efficiently  proactively managing costs and accelerating our share repurchases Moving to Page 5  we ll start with our segment summaries with Electrical Products  Revenues were down 2  and excluding Lighting  organic revenue increased 1   Strength was driven by residential markets in the Americas  our distribution business  and Canada  Adjusted segment operating profit increased 9  and adjusted operating margins were up 210 basis points to 20 3   a Q4 record  The sale of our Lighting business to Signify for  1 4 billion remains on track and we expect to close in Q1  Excluding Lighting  orders were down 2  with strength in residential  commercial construction markets in the Americas  and this was really offset by industrial markets globally Turning to Page 6  we show a summary of our Electrical Systems and Services segment  Revenues increased 4  with 2  organic and 2  from the acquisition of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions  Organic growth was driven by strength in the North American utility and commercial construction markets primarily  Adjusted segment operating profits increased 7  with adjusted margins of 17 1   up 50 basis points over prior year and on a rolling 12 month basis  our Electrical Systems and Services orders increased 2 5  with growth really across all regions of the world  Excluding hyperscale data centers  the 12 month rolling average of orders was up some 4   And just yesterday  we announced the acquisition of Power Distribution  Inc  which is a leading supplier of mission critical power distribution switching and power monitoring equipment for the data center market  Power Distribution  Inc  really builds on our strong position in the fast growing data center market and adds new capabilities in the area of overhead bus way and power distribution  So we re really pleased with the prospects of what PDI will add to our Electrical Systems and Services business Moving to Page 7  we summarize our Hydraulics results for Q4  Revenues were down 13  with orders down 11  and this is driven by continued weakness in global mobile equip markets and destocking that continues at both OEM and then also with our distributors  And as I mentioned earlier  we re really pleased to have announced the agreement to sell the Hydraulics business to Danfoss for  3 3 billion and we expect this transaction to close at the end of the year  And as we ve announced  we are retaining our Filtration and Golf Grip businesses  We expect cash taxes from the sale of Hydraulics to be approximately  450 million  so our net proceeds will be approximately  2 85 billion  And a number of you have asked how we intend to use proceeds and I d say that the options of additional acquisitions and share repurchases are both on the table  For M A  I would also add that our pipeline remains very active and so it s great to have this optionality as we look forward On Page 8  we summarize our results for our Aerospace segment  Revenues were up 3  including 2  organic and 1  from acquisitions  We experienced in this segment continued strength in commercial OEMs and also in commercial aftermarket  Orders on a rolling 12 month basis increased 6  with particular strength in military  aftermarket and biz jet  Certainly  strong execution in this segment led to a 9  increase in adjusted segment operating profits and 130 basis point improvement in adjusted margins which were 24 2   And I d just say here that the business delivered another quarterly record capping what s been a very strong year  We re also pleased to have closed the acquisition of Souriau in late December  We ve welcomed the Souriau team to Eaton and our integration teams have already begun working to deliver the synergy plans  which includes the opportunity to take our new electrical connectors capabilities into our core electrical markets Turning to Page 9  we summarize our Vehicle business for Q4  Revenues were down 19  and this includes 18  organic and 1  from currency  Declines here were due to a number of factors  the GM strike  Class 8 OEM orders  in fact  Class 8 production was down some 20  year over year and continued global weakness in light vehicle markets  which were down 9   And I d say here and a clear example of our grow the head and fix the tail strategy  which is really about how we ve really focused the company  we completed the sale of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business at the end of the year  During the quarter  we also took a  50 million pre tax charge for expected warranty costs  This charge is being undertaken to correct the performance of one of our products that incorporated a defective part from a supplier and we re actively looking for ways of recouping these costs as well  Adjusted operating margins were 17   at a very high level  but down 90 basis points from prior year Next up on page 10  we summarize the results for our eMobility segment  Revenues were down 6  and I d say here  while growth in electric vehicle platforms  this was more than offset by weakness in legacy internal combustion engine platforms  Operating margins declined to 1 3  due to a significant step up in research and development as well as manufacturing start up costs associated with electric vehicle programs here  I would like to highlight that since the formation of this segment in the first quarter of 2018  the mature year revenue from new wins is expected to be  450 million and so this segment continues to run ahead of our own internal expectations and as you can imagine  we re pursuing a large number of additional programs as the industry continues to make the transition to electric vehicles Before turning to 2020 guidance  I would like to take a minute just to summarize the results of 2019  which are shown on Page 11  First  we generated all time record margins of 17 6   which were up 80 basis points over 2018 excluding acquisition and divestiture costs and the expected warranty costs  In fact  over the last three years  our segment margins have increased 260 basis points  which we see as a strong validation of our strategy  Earnings per share of  5 76 excluding the one time items I just mentioned was up 7  over 2018  We set all time records for both operating cash flow of  3 5 billion and free cash flow of  2 9 billion  with growth of 17  and 20  respectively  Our free cash flow to sales was 13 4  and our free cash flow to net income conversion was 129   This continues to be a key strength for Eaton and something that you can expect from us in the future  And as we noted  2009  Phonetic  was a year of significant progress on our journey to transform Eaton into a company with higher growth  higher margins and more earnings consistency  We closed three deals for  1 2 billion  Ulusoy  Innovative Switchgear in Electrical  Souriau Sunbank in Aerospace  We announced two divestitures with Automotive Fluid conveyance closed in 2019 and Lighting scheduled to close in Q1  And our robust cash flow allowed us to return  2 2 billion to shareholders including  1 2 billion of dividends and  1 billion in share repurchases  I d also note that we purchased these shares at an average price of  80 a share  Finally  it was a very good year for our shareholders  who had a 43  total return  50  Phonetic  basis points over the median of our proxy peer  So overall  I d say another record year and clearly very proud of what our team was able to deliver Turning to Page 12  we provide our revenue and margin guidance for 2020  Overall  we expect organic growth to be anywhere from down 1  to up 1  with weakness in the first half and a bit stronger in the second half as a result of easier prior year comps  Beginning with Electrical Products  we expect to see 1  to 3  organic growth with continued strength in residential and data center markets  flat commercial construction markets  and continued weakness in industrial markets  In Electrical Systems and Services  we anticipate 0  to 2  organic growth with strength in utility markets  flat commercial construction  and weakness in industrial facilities and particularly in oil and gas markets  For Hydraulics  we re forecasting organic revenue declines of 4  to 6  driven by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and in Aerospace  we expect organic growth of 2  to 4  with continued strength in military OEM markets  solid aftermarket growth for both commercial and military markets partially offset by expected weakness in commercial OEM markets  For Vehicle  we see organic revenue declines of 7  to 9  and this is mostly due to the 33  decline that we re forecasting in NAFTA Class 8 truck markets  but also some weakness in global light vehicle markets as well  And for eMobility  organic growth is expected to be up 3  to 5   We re seeing double digit growth for our electrical vehicles markets  offset by some modest declines in internal combustion engine platforms Now turning to segment operating margins and operating margins for Eaton  We expect Eaton to be 17 8  to 18 2  at the midpoint  a 40 basis points improvement from 2019 and in taking a look at our segments  Electrical Products we think will be 21 2  to 21 8   At the midpoint  180 basis point improvement from 2019 and this is primarily a result of the Lighting divestiture  For Electrical Systems and Services  we re forecasting 16 4  to 17   up 10 basis points at the midpoint  Hydraulics at 11 7  to 12 3   up 80 basis points at the midpoint  Aerospace at 22 9  to 23 5   down some 110 basis points  and this is largely due to the acquisition of Souriau  And Vehicle we expect it to be between 15 7  and 16 3   down 80 basis points and largely as a result of lower volumes  and eMobility at 2 5  to 3   Phonetic  as we continue to invest heavily in R D and start up costs and new manufacturing capabilities And on Page 13  we pick up the balance of our 2020 guidance and here I d say we expect full year adjusted EPS to be between  5 60 and  5 90 at the midpoint of  5 75  This is essentially flat with 2019 when you exclude the one time items noted on previous slides  Organic growth is expected to be essentially down 1  to up 1  with acquisitions adding 2  and divestitures negatively impacting sales by 7 5   We expect our corporate costs including pension  interest and other corporate costs to be flat with 2019 levels and our tax rate to be between 14 8  and 15 8   Operating cash flow is expected to be between  3 4 billion and  3 6 billion and capex of approximately  550 million  With strong cash flow plus the proceeds from the Lighting sale  which we think will be  1 4 billion  we plan to significantly increase our share repurchases and at this point  we expect to spend between  2 4 billion and  2 8 billion in share repurchases  And if I can just summarize our Q1 guidance  we expect EPS to be between  1 16 and  1 26  we expect organic revenues to be down 3   2  from acquisitions and 3  from divestitures  segment margins are expected to be between 15 8  and 16 2  and our tax rate should be between 15  and 16  So overall  I d say we expect really another solid year in 2020 with strong margins and cash flow  We have a lot of confidence in the Eaton business system and our ability to continue to execute strongly  We think the changes that we ve made and announced will position Eaton for higher growth and higher margins and better earnings consistency as we go forward and with our strong cash flow and proceeds from the Hydraulics sale  we have outstanding optionality as we go into the best approach to create additional shareholder value  So with that  I ll stop there and turn it back over to Yan for questions Yan Jin    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsHey  thanks Craig  Before we begin the Q A section of our call today  I think that we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions  Given our time constraint of an hour  please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow up  Thanks everyone  Phonetic  for your cooperation  With that  I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners  Please go ahead Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Jeff Jeffrey Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystHey  two things from me  first on Hydraulics  given just kind of the slippery slope that the end markets are on  certainly great to see it go at that valuation  but are you guys subject to any kind of hold back or performance that could affect kind of the ultimate price that we receive for the asset Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  no  Jeff  we re not  I mean  and I think we actually posted our documents and so that information is certainly available for public consumption and the  3 3 billion number is firm and we fully expect to close as Danfoss has also agreed to take whatever remedies would be required in order to ensure that the transaction closes Jeffrey Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystGreat and just a guidance question too  I was just wondering on ESS specifically 0  to 2   does that sort of imply you re going to be up a bit in the first half and then down in the second half or how do you see that really playing out relative to what s going on in your backlog Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think we    almost  Jeff  just the opposite of that and I mean given what we ve seen certainly in our order intake and negotiations  we think that the back half of the year will be slightly stronger than the first half of the year and as we take a look at what we re experiencing today  one of the reasons why we guided to our overall revenues being down 3  in Q1 and so we do think that the back half of the year will be slightly stronger and a lot of that I d say quite frankly is a function of easier comps when you look at the year over year comparisons and from an EPS standpoint  we re really pretty much well balanced in terms of what we ve been historically where some 47  of our EPS is generated in the first half of the year and 53  in the second half and so that s very much consistent with our guidance this year as well Jeffrey Sprague    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystGreat  thanks for the color OperatorThank you very much  And our next question in queue that will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning  everyone Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystCraig  maybe just kind of starting off on Hydraulics and congratulations there  obviously  I guess as you think about the pipeline  you mentioned very active  I d love to hear how you re thinking about potential prioritization of acquisitions and then also  you ve been very active from a divestiture standpoint  are we done at this point Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I appreciate the comment  Joe  As I mentioned in my opening commentary  we think it s an outstanding outcome for all parties  We think it s great for Eaton and our shareholders  We think it s outstanding for our employees and great for Danfoss as well  I d say the priority for us really haven t changed  What we ve said historically is that our priorities from an M A perspective continue to be growing our Electrical business  Aerospace and also selectively we re looking at things we could potentially do in this new space for us called eMobility and so those priorities really have not changed  As I mentioned in my commentary  we are seeing today kind of a more active pipeline than we ve seen historically and so as we think about the optionality of what we do with that cash  certainly M A is an option  buying back shares is an option  So we re very much comfortable with where we sit in terms of making sure that we maximize shareholder value as we think about how we deploy those proceeds that will come in And with respect to portfolio  we like where we sit  I mean at this point  think about the remaining parts of our company and I know there s been a lot of speculation about vehicles  So I ll go ahead and address that right upfront  We like our Vehicle business  it delivers extraordinary margins and they tend to be at the very top of their industry with respect to returns  The business today  given what we ve done today with our joint venture in Cummins  will be a lot less cyclical as we go forward  It certainly helps us as the whole world moves toward this more electric outcome to getting the volume and scale that we need to really drive dividends across the organization and so  yes  we absolutely we like our portfolio and where we sit today Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThat s helpful and then just one quick one on aero  I don t recall you guys having much exposure to the MAX  but can you maybe just talk about that specifically as it relates to your guidance and also  how you think about margins in the aero segment as well in 2020 just given the strength in 2019 Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the MAX is an important program for Eaton as well  I think anybody in the aerospace industry  I d say the MAX is going to be an important program for them and so our content tied to the MAX at the OEM level is order of magnitude just north of  100 million and what we ve done as a part of the Aerospace forecast and our guidance is we ve essentially taken what Boeing has given us in terms of their current build schedule and that s what s reflected in our Aerospace guidance  one of the reasons why we re not seeing more robust growth in our Aerospace business in 2020 is clearly the impact of the MAX  I will tell you as you think about the margin implications for the MAX  what you typically trade off with OEM volume is aftermarket volume  So we think from a margin perspective  independent of what happens with the MAX  we think the margins will be just fine  We think we ll be just fine from an EPS standpoint  but it could have certainly an impact on revenue  So our Aerospace margins  as we provided guidance  2019 was a record year with really extraordinary improvement in our margins  The margins will be down slightly in 2020 and this  as we mentioned  was largely a function of the acquisition of Souriau  but also we were running at very frothy levels in 2019 in terms of the margins of the businesses  So we think the guidance that we provided for 2020 are very much in line with where we think the business should be Joe Ritchie    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question will come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystAnd congrats on Hydraulics  I like everyone s comments  Can you help us or can you tell us what the exiting share count was and then how we should be thinking about the cadence of the repurchases through 2020 Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI ll address that  The total share count for Q4 was 415 million  It was not very different right at the end of the year  In terms of repurchases  we are going to do as we ve done in the past  We decided against doing an accelerated repurchase and we re going to execute the transactions on our own  We do have the ability to buy about  70 million worth a day based on the Safe Harbor  so we can make significant moves fairly quickly and we will be executing those repurchases as we deem it most effective for our shareholders obviously taking into account market conditions John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thank you  And then as we think about the EP orders ex lighting down 2   can you maybe help parse that out between end market and if you re still seeing any kind of destocking at your distributor partners Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I appreciate the question  I mean  if we think about our markets  I mean as we provided a little bit of color on it  we think today that we still see growth in non res construction  we did mention the fact that commercial construction we think is flat  we think industrial controls will be down  the residential continues to be up nicely  we think mid single digit and in the IT piece  the data centers  which is reported for Electrical Products  we think will also be up low single digit  And so  we think on balance  these markets continue to kind of bounce around the low kind of single digit growth kind of neighborhood and we re hopeful once again as some of this uncertainty continues to ebb away as it relates to trade  as it relates to the North America trade agreement that  that continues to be buoy confidence in our customers in general  and I think in general  distribution is fine  I mean distribution certainly in Q4 held in there and our distributors are generally pretty positive around 2020  So we think distribution continues to be a strong point as well John Walsh    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  I ll pass it along  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question in queue will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research  Please go ahead Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  good morning guys  Obviously there s a lot of moving pieces on the portfolio  Just to be clear  so given the buyback you got in place for 2020  does that offset the dilution completely from Lighting  but you still have some dilution obviously come in the first half of the year  And then Rick on the tax rate  does the portfolio moves have any significant impact on the tax rate  both ex lighting  but also ex Hydraulics Richard H  Fearon    Vice Chairman  Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsI can answer both those questions  Yes  the buyback does offset the dilution  So that s why we re able to keep EPS flat between the years  And then the tax rate  we don t think will be changed from these portfolio actions  So we still think it will be between 14  and 16  Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  great  And my follow up question is regarding distributor consolidation  Obviously  WESCO is an important channel partner for Eaton  How does fewer but larger distributor partners impact your business the way you go to market Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think it s obviously a question of which distributor combinations we re talking about it and as it relates to WESCO s acquisition of Anixter  which has maybe the one that s prompted the question  we think that s an outstanding combination for Eaton and our relationship with WESCO as we go forward and so we think that one is really positive for Eaton  We have a very strong relationship with WESCO as you know and we have a very strong relationship with Anixter and so we think that combination bodes extremely well for our future together and certainly is positive for Eaton Nigel Coe    Wolfe Research    AnalystGreat  thanks guys OperatorThank you very much  The next question in queue will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research  Please go ahead Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystHi  good morning guys Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Scott Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystLot of good questions have been asked already  but I would love to hear your view  Craig as you walk around the world  what markets you think are going to be or what geographies I guess more specifically  are going to be better or worse than perhaps 2019 run rate Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I appreciate the question and I think in many ways  Scott  that is the  64 000  Phonetic  question in terms of what the future economic outlook looks like and I d say  if you d asked me that question maybe three weeks ago before the coronavirus  I would say China for sure  I mean clearly we saw a much stronger Q4 in China  That economy had continued to strengthen  We ll see what the coronavirus does in terms of the impact in China  really the impact of it has around the world  We clearly see somewhat slowing growth in the U S   but there are certainly pockets of strength  Residential markets continue to be quite strong  data center markets continue to be strong  utility markets continue to be strong  We think South America will have a better year than they had in 2019 as they work through some of their historical issues and so we re clearly seeing some strengthening in South America  We think Europe slows a bit overall  We think India had a really tough year in 2019  We think India is better as well and if you think about a lot of the emerging markets around the world  we think they generally have better years in 2020 than they did in 2019 Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystOkay  helpful  And the one thing that I know eMobility is small  but what are you thinking over the next kind of three years we should be tracking and caring more about  is it the backlog that you re building in the business  but as you start to get a sell through in 2021 that s meaningful that  that segment starts to move the needle with some sort of margin attached to it and just a sense of  is this a five year out  three year out or start to see progress kind of 1 year and change from now Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I appreciate the question  Scott and it s one that we get from others as well and we d say that    and the real inflection point for eMobility will be around 2022  A lot of these new electric vehicle platforms will launch in 2021 and so we think it s really 2022 before you get to the point where you start to see our revenues that have a meaningful impact on our eMobility segment and for Eaton overall  but as you think about the underlying assumption and what s going on in electrification in general  we think the story around electrification is obviously much bigger than what s going on at eMobility and passengers cars as we think about the more electric everything  you know  homes are becoming more electrified  commercial facilities  planes  trains  everything is becoming more electric and one of the real advantages we think we have with respect to our eMobility segment is that anytime you re dealing with automotive kinds of scales  you re now also creating real advantages that you can then take back into your core business as well and so we think there is a a much bigger story and a much bigger play for Eaton as we think about how we play in eMobility than just what happens in the light vehicle market Scott Davis    Melius Research    AnalystOkay  perfect  Thank you  Good luck  guys Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorAnd our next question that will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank  Please go ahead Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystYeah  thanks  good morning guys Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Nicole Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystSo I just want to start with a clarification just I m pretty    99  sure this is the way you guys are doing your guidance  but lighting is excluded beginning in the like first day of the second quarter  is that correct Richard H  Fearon    Vice Chairman  Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsWe actually have put it in for two months sort of the middle of the first quarter Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  Thanks  Rick  And then when we think about rolling forward the calendar on free cash flow after you guys complete the Hydraulics sale  would that create a major change in your free cash flow relative to how you guys have guided for 2020 Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  first of all  we expect the sale to conclude at the end of the year  So  it shouldn t have really any impact on 2020 Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystAll right  but I m thinking about like framing 2021 free cash flow Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  what I d say Nicole  with respect to Hydraulics  I mean I think what you ll see from the company in general post Hydraulics is a company that will deliver once again more consistent free cash flow as a function of that industry in general  The cash flows in Hydraulics are about as volatile as the industry itself  And so I think what you ll see from Eaton post the divestiture of Hydraulics is a company that delivers once again very strong free cash flow and you ll see a lot more consistency overall Nicole DeBlase    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGot it  That s fair  Thanks  Craig  I ll pass it on Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThe next question in queue that will come from David Raso with Evercore ISI  Please go ahead David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  good morning  I have the math correct backing out Lighting and looking at the Electrical Products margins improvements  Phonetic   the guidance shows a 180 bps and it depends exactly the revenues for the 10 months that you won t have Lighting  I m using about  Technical Issues  so I know we don t have the exact margin on Lighting but obviously it was below the segment average  So I m just trying to back into what is the margin improvement just excluding Lighting from 10 months  I m getting as much as a 140 bps  130 bps and then that leaves the kind of legacy Electrical Products not really having to expand margins much to hit the target Richard H  Fearon    Vice Chairman  Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsYeah  I think that s a fair way of thinking about it  Dave  something just north of 100 bps of improvement from Lighting and some underlying improvement in the business is the right way to think about it David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystAnd that said then if the margins are  let s say run rating close to 21  Phonetic  just getting rid of Lighting  I know 2  organic is not that robust but still the margin improvement is a bit modest at least relative to your recent performance  Is there something within Electrical mix  price cost  whatever may be that s not allowing a little more expansion versus recent history Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I d say that we certainly had a very strong year in 2019 and posted very strong margin improvement  At this point  as we look at the year  we think this is the best way to think about the segment for the year  Could we be a little better than that  We hope so  but at this point  we think this is the right way to think about the segment and the appropriate guidance  And I might have missed this  I apologize  but the assets that are left in Hydraulics after the sale  are those potential opportunities for further potential opportunities for further sales during the course of this year or is it all just TBD for right now and    If you think about what s remaining  and we did disclose a bit kind of in the context of the Hydraulics close  these are really attractive businesses that have great positions in their respective industries  we like those assets and we intend to retain them David Raso    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  thank you very much  I appreciate it OperatorThank you  The next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays  Please go ahead Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning  Maybe just a first question around the data center market  I heard that the outlook is pretty good in the EP side  wondered if there was any nuance or difference within ESS and really the reason I ask is that the commentary perhaps as always from different people is mixed  Some of the Internet service providers sound fairly optimistic  some of the equipment suppliers like Regal or Cummins talked about push outs in data center activity this morning  So just wondered what your core assumption was for that market for this year in the medium term Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Julian  we appreciate the question and not surprising by the way that you do    your commentary around the segment that in some cases could be in conflict depending upon where every supplier is and the timing of some of these large projects and where you are in terms of your exposure to hyperscale and other pieces of the market  I d say for us  we do think that data center market based upon everything that we ve seen  grows kind of low single digit in 2020 which given kind of some of the underlying trends around data generation and consumption is a relatively modest number  We did in fact see a better second half of the year in hyperscale specifically and data centers continue to be growth segments for us overall  but I d say that  no  I mean  Electrical Systems and Services  which as you know  more than three phase that we report as a part of ES S and more the single phase that we report in Electrical Products  but we think that data centers largely as a category continues to be a very attractive category and then  but it will be lumpy  There will be periods of time when you see extraordinary growth and there ll be periods of time when some of the hyperscale guys essentially take time out to absorb kind of what they ve actually done and will pause in their purchases Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThank you  Craig  And then a second question for you  maybe a slightly broader one  You ve certainly surprised me with the success on the margin ramp the last couple of years  it s really been extraordinary  Just wondered if you were at all worried that that focus on the cost out hurt the organic growth profile of Eaton at all and how satisfied you are with that  If we look at the last five years or last 10 years  the organic sales cake is about 1  companywide  Do you think that the company is now poised for that to move higher in the medium term Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I ll deal with the margin question first  Julian because I will tell you that if you think about where the margin expansion has come from inside of our company  it really has been essentially around eliminating operational inefficiencies in our company and so we ve not in any way sacrificed growth opportunities for the sake of margin  I think it s really around a lot of the portfolio work that we re doing as we talk about  what is it that drives the margin expansion in Eaton and we talked about running our factories more efficiently  we talked about leveraging our scale and we talked about also where we focus  This idea of grow the head and shrink the tail and so those are the things that we ve been doing as a company to accelerate margin expansion and quite frankly  we re not done  there s more opportunities there  On the organic growth front  I d say we too have not been pleased with our organic growth  It s one of the reasons why we ve really set that as the number one priority for the organization and we ve been investing heavily in organic growth inside of our organization  And so we think that organic growth relative to the markets that we re in  we think we ve been fine and in fact overall  public data that we get says that we ve actually gained a little share in many of our businesses  but we need to do better than that and so that continues to be the number one priority for the organization to drive organic growth Julian Mitchell    Barclays    AnalystThat s very helpful  Thank you OperatorThank you  The next question in queue that will come from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities  Please go ahead Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThanks a lot  Good morning  everybody Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Andy Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystWithin ESS ex the hyperscale data centers that just went through  in the past I think you talked about some project deferral in them  Incorporating the first half second half directional comments I understand those  but are you seeing thaw in the uncertainty driven project deferral at this point Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I d say  Andy  maybe not really  We continue to see I d say projects deferred  I d say that the rate has not escalated from what we ve seen in prior quarters  but there remains a fair amount of uncertainty around the global economy and so I think to the extent that we re dealing in this uncertain environment  whether it s trade or most recently the coronavirus  Brexit  I mean there has been a whole host of geopolitical events that have you have caused many of you know our customers in and around large projects specifically to wait and see a bit and that continues to be the case  but not necessarily at an increasing rate  more like in line with what we ve seen during the course of much of    the second half of 2019 Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Craig  And then secondly on potential acquisition opportunities  Can you talk about whether the pipeline is full at this point and relative to what you saw maybe last year  are the valuations becoming any more attractive Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I d say the pipeline is certainly more active than we have seen a year ago and our teams are busy working through a number of potential opportunities  I think with respect to valuations  I d say that not really  Valuations I think for the most part continue to be quite sporty and what we commit to you is that we will maintain our discipline  We have a very clear view on what our cost of capital is and what our expected returns are and so we will make sure that as we think about deploying our ample free cash flow that we re smart in the way we do it and we continue to be very comfortable with the option of buying back stock Andy Casey    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystOkay  thank you very much OperatorThank you  The next question in queue will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  good morning guys  Craig  just a question for you on EP  one of your competitors this morning had some tariff exemption that helped out their electrical business and got a bit of a claw back going into even 2018  Anything that you guys qualified for in the EP portfolio and any benefit that was recognized Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  not at all  There was no one time benefits  We d be interested to know what that was and we ll find out who that was and see if we missed something  but no  there s been    there were no one time benefits associated with tariff exemptions in our EP results at all Richard H  Fearon    Vice Chairman  Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsAnd Josh  we ve commented that we produce in region for region  So we don t have large shipments coming out of China into other parts of the world  So it wouldn t be something where there would be a big opportunity for us Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  That s helpful and then just a follow up on the acquisition pipeline  I think you guys have been very clear on your role in the data center or kind of being end to end on electrical and not really wanting to stray too far from that  I guess  Craig  are there any gaps in that  are there other pieces that you could add on to either on the front end or closer to the rack and as this market has evolved  are you seeing other product sets within the data center that just given the attractiveness of the end market start to look more interesting to you as you build out the portfolio  Thanks Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey Josh  I appreciate the question  I think on the margin  we have a great portfolio today that we offer and sell into data centers from all the power distribution equipment to the power quality equipment  we think this acquisition of PDI by the way as we mentioned   125 million business  that goes into the data center market is very much about filling a product portfolio and also  in this case  giving us better access to the co located    the colo operators of data centers and so on the margins there is some minor things that we can do and we ll continue to look at  but by and large  we think our position in data centers is very well situated and no big gaps at all Josh Pokrzywinski    Morgan Stanley    AnalystAll right  Thanks  Craig OperatorThank you very much  The next question in queue that will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer  Please go ahead Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer    AnalystThanks  good morning and congrats on an excellent 2019 Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Richard H  Fearon    Vice Chairman  Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsThanks Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer    AnalystOn the    just wanted to kind of hit on Jeff s question about the ESS splits transferring that to vehicle on the down 8  organic  want to make sure we get the magnitude in the first half right  So I m wondering how you seeing that linearity Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI m sorry    so the transferring it to vehicle  I m not sure  Speech Overlap   Yeah  I d say that if you think about kind of our guidance with respect to revenue  we do think that the second half of the year will be a bit stronger on a V basis versus the first half and I would say  but most of that I would just say is really more a function of the comps and the comparables year over year  If you take a look at the second half of 2019 was clearly a much weaker period of time for us than the first half  And so I think it s really a function of the comparables more than it is we re anticipating anything dramatically different in terms of the seasonality that we historically see in our business with respect to our own revenue growth Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer    AnalystOkay and then on the eMobility comments you made a couple of quarters in a row now of being ahead of plan  I m wondering if you re seeing that in terms of the pace of design cycles or your win rates Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think there s probably a little bit of both on that one in terms of  I think that every major automotive OEM around the world and commercial vehicle customer around the world  everybody today has an initiative around electrification of their fleet and that has certainly gained momentum and we ve been a benefactor of that and at the same time  our team has done an extraordinary job from a standing start really building a whole broad range of product capabilities that have enabled us to really be an effective alternative and a viable alternative in this particular space and so I think it s really been a combination Christopher Glynn    Oppenheimer    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you very much  And the next question in queue will come from Markus Mittermaier with UBS  Please go ahead Markus Mittermaier    UBS    AnalystImprovements over the years  you ve been closing the gap to a large extent across the Electrical business as some  Phonetic  of your global peers  particularly if you look at the European low voltage players  Now  how should we think about this going forward  I mean is there any structural reasons why these margins shouldn t align to where some of your peers are  I mean it s already mentioned that if I take out sort of the Lighting impacts in EP ex lighting  you re basically already up the margin levels that you re guiding for  So how should be structurally think about this  maybe not into 2020 but sort of medium term  how much upside is there to closing that gap to the peers fully Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I guess  Markus  I mean  the first thing I would say with respect to our Electrical business  I d say we don t believe there is a gap  In fact  we think today  when you take a look at our Electrical business relative to most of our peers that our margins are actually as good as or better than most of them  You have to really think about it in the context  I m not sure which companies you re referring to  but our Electrical Products business for example  which is largely a components business that goes through distribution and those margins we think compare very favorably to the industry overall and in Electrical Systems and Services  I d say once again that business performs very favorably and I think it s really    you got to really think about the peers in the context of we play across the whole spectrum of electrical  some of the peers that maybe you re referencing tend to be more niche  maybe they are a Electrical Products business only or they are a components business only  but when you look at in aggregate against our primary peers  the ones who play across the whole spectrum in Electrical  I would argue that our margins are as good or better than almost any of our competitors and by the way I would acknowledge that we re not done  We think we have opportunity that remains to continue to expand margins and that s clearly what we expect to do and we ll    as a part of our investor meeting in the first week of March  we ll provide some guidance around what we think the future outlook looks like Markus Mittermaier    UBS    AnalystSure  Great  that s very helpful and then just briefly as a follow up on aviation  aftermarket OE  what was that split sort of in Q4 and what s embedded in the guide for 2020 here Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think you can think about our business as 60 40  60  OE  40  aftermarket and those numbers vary slightly depending upon what quarter you are talking about or what year you re talking about  but kind of the long term view  60   40  split is generally where we re at Markus Mittermaier    UBS    AnalystGreat  thank you very much Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorThank you  The next question that will come from Mig Dobre with Baird  Please go ahead Mig Dobre    Baird    AnalystYes  good morning  Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a good 2019  I wanted to go back to ESS as well and maybe ask a couple of things  On power distribution  can you give us some color on the margin for that business and then how do you think about the cadence of this segment s margin through the year given that you ve got some pretty difficult comps on incrementals in Q2 and Q3 Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  our power distribution margins inside of Electrical Systems and Services I d say are largely in line with the segment overall  So I don t know that we see significant differences in the margins in power distribution assemblies overall though obviously projects can impact that perhaps a little bit more than some of the other parts of the business  In terms of cadence  I mean this business always tends to be a little bit back end loaded and if you think about the company split of revenue  first half second half  Electrical Systems and Services always tends to be a little bit of a back end loaded business and as a result  you get higher volume and higher margins in the second half of the year and I think that s just very much consistent with what we ve seen from this business over a very long period of time Mig Dobre    Baird    AnalystYeah  Craig  just to clarify  I was talking about the acquisition    the power distribution acquisition Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOh PDI  OK  Yes  PDI s margins I would say today are below the average for Electrical Systems and Services  We obviously  we like the business  we like the space  We think we have an opportunity to clearly expand margins  but they do come in to the company at slightly below the margins of the segment overall Richard H  Fearon    Vice Chairman  Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsAnd we ll make some improvement in terms of synergies this year  but probably more so in 2021 in PDI Mig Dobre    Baird    AnalystSure and then lastly on Hydraulics  just looking at your guidance  your margin guidance for 2020 and kind of comparing it to what we ve seen exiting 2019  How do you think about the drivers for margin expansion here and what s different going forward than what we ve seen in 2019  Thank you Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the answer in Hydraulics    we ve spent a lot of time over the last couple of years talking about the level of inefficiencies that we were driving in the Hydraulics business as we dealt with this pretty significant market ramp in the midst of a perhaps the biggest restructuring program in the history of the business and so  as I mentioned in prior calls  we were kind of caught in the middle of doing this massive restructuring and movement of parts and pieces when the industry ramped and we had a lot of inefficiencies that were in the business as we were halfway complete in terms of many of these restructuring programs and so as we think about 2020 and where the improvement comes from  it s largely a function of getting these things completed and behind us and we re very confident in our ability to deliver the margin guidance that we ve laid out for Hydraulics Mig Dobre    Baird    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you very much  The next question that will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets  Please go ahead  Thank you  Good morning  everyone Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Deane Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  just got a couple of quick ones here  First  when I look at the 2020 guidance  the organic revenue growth of minus 1  to plus 1  seems a bit tighter than I would have expected just given the macro uncertainty  So maybe some reflect on that if you could and is there any impact now with the recast portfolio  earnings    better earnings consistency  does that reduce some of the cyclicality and might that explain some of the tighter range Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the first thing  Dean  to your point  I mean we agree it s a fairly tight range and we could have said approximately flat  but there always is a fair amount of uncertainty in general in these businesses and so I d say I wouldn t over read at least for 2020 the fact that the range is minus 1  to plus 1  other than to say that we think our markets are going to be approximately flat for the year is the right way to think about that and to your point  lots of uncertainty  we ll see how the year unfolds  but that s really where we ve landed at as an organization  Yeah  I do think  to your point though  as we go forward  once we get beyond 2020 into 2021 and we get Hydraulics divested  there is no question that there ll be a lot more earnings and revenue consistency inside of the organization when you go forward  And so it s very much consistent with the strategy that we laid out around driving better consistency of earnings  Hydraulics will help tremendously in that regard  I wouldn t over read the minus 1  to plus 1  Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGood  I promise not to over read  And then just last question would be    it is interesting how many questions you ve had today on data center  Obviously  some of it from Network Power acquisition  but what do you make of the new ownership of the former Emerson Network Power and does that change in any way expectations about some of the competitive dynamics  maybe some more price competition  I d be interested in your thoughts there Craig Arnold    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean  I d say    appreciate the question  Deane and I know Dave Cote well  I used to work from him by the way  so it s    I can imagine that he will certainly bring some strong leadership to that business  but no  we d say we love our position in data centers  Today  if you think about where we play and first of all  we don t overlap completely with Vertiv  I mean we play in    in some    many cases  different parts of the market than they do  but we think we re clearly number one or number two in the world depending upon where you re at in data centers  We like our strategic position there  We think at the end of the day  competition is good  it will make us all better  but we like our position in data centers and we think we re well positioned  We think we continue to do extraordinarily well in that market and so  no  we don t think it changes the competitive dynamic at all Deane Dray    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you Yan Jin    Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsHey  good  I thank you all  We have reached the end of the call and we do

150445,371961,ETN,Crude exports boom on U S  Gulf Coast  allaying bottleneck fears,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN  and Devika Krishna Kumar
HOUSTON NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  crude exports from Corpus Christi  Texas  have surged to a record in recent weeks  often surpassing hubs such as Houston and Beaumont  Texas  thanks to faster than expected infrastructure additions 
The infrastructure boom at Corpus Christi helped push crude exports there to a weekly record of 1 59 million barrels per day  bpd  in late December  more than doubling levels that held for the first eight months of last year  and above Houston s 2019 peak of 1 36 million bpd  according to vessel tracking firm ClipperData 
The heavy flows suggest that fears of a bottleneck that would impede U S  exports have not materialized 
 Those  export  numbers are truly astonishing  and at times  Corpus volumes have accounted for more than half of all crude exports moving out of the U S  on a weekly basis   said John Zanner  senior strategist at Uplift Energy Strategy 
The four week average of overall U S  crude exports reached a record 3 72 million barrels per day  bpd  in the week ended Dec  27  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration 
 GRAPHIC  Exports from Corpus Christi  Houston   
Analysts had expected a crude bottleneck in the Permian Basin to shift to the Gulf Coast as three new pipelines opened last year  New flows out of the nation s biggest oil field were expected to overwhelm export capacity in Corpus Christi and weigh on regional prices 
But the rush of crude has been absorbed following last year s addition of almost 2 million bpd of inbound pipeline capacity and 5 million barrels of storage capacity in Corpus Christi  according to market intelligence provider Genscape 
 GRAPHIC  Inbound pipeline capacity   
Analysts expect flows to rise further as three new pipelines from the Permian Basin to the U S  Gulf Coast begin full service in the first half of 2020  The lines are owned by EPIC Midstream   Plains All American Pipeline  LP  N PAA  and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  Partners LP  N PSXP  
Another 18 million barrels of storage capacity were under construction in the Corpus Christi area in the week to Jan  3 
Waterborne trading dominates Corpus Christi  in contrast to Houston markets where the established grade trades at Magellan s East Houston terminal  Corpus prices have on average traded 50 cents to  1 per barrel below West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude at Magellan East Houston  or MEH   traders and analysts said

150448,371964,ETN,U S  refiners grab unloved Russian fuel oil on back of new shipping rules,news,"By Julia Payne and Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN 
LONDON HOUSTON  Reuters    U S  refiners are scooping up cheap high sulfur fuel oil for processing from Russia and the Baltic states as they take advantage of new shipping rules that have cut demand for the dirtier marine fuel  according to oil traders and shipping data 
U S  refiners Valero Corp  N VLO    Chevron  Corp  N CVX  and Phillips 66  N PSX  have been buying HSFO  traders said  taking advantage of their complex operations to turn HSFO blended with crude oils into products like diesel  gasoil and gasoline 
This month  2 2 million tonnes of fuel oil  largely from Russia and the Baltic states  will arrive in the United States  highest in at least three years  according to oil analytics firm Vortexa Ltd  Two thirds of the total is Russian in origin  its data shows 
New maritime rules known as IMO 2020 mandate that the shipping industry has to burn cleaner  low sulfur fuels in tankers  The rules  which took effect Jan  1  have clipped demand for marine fuels such as high sulfur fuel oil  The surplus marine fuel is becoming a salve for refiners  according to traders  who have seen margins drop sharply due to weak global demand for refined products like diesel and gasoline 
Valero did not reply to requests for comment  Chevron and Phillips 66 declined to comment 
HSFO sold for  39 55 per barrel on the U S  Gulf Coast on Wednesday  down 30  from a year ago  according to price tracker S P Global Platts  January U S  imports are expected to be 54  greater than December s  according to Vortexa 
 Fuel oil  is  going directly from Russia to the U S   instead of Europe   said Lars van Wageningen  operations manager at Dutch consultancy Insights Global  which tracks fuel oil stocks in the Antwerp Rotterdam Amsterdam region 
Refiners are buying HSFO to replace the loss of crudes from Venezuela and Iran that have been barred by U S  sanctions  and traders said they see an opportunity for big margins on products refined using HSFO  even though such a blend yields fewer barrels than processing crude oil into products 
HSFO is also is trading below Mexico s Maya and Canadian heavy crudes  HSFO traded about  23 per barrel below Brent crude  compared to an estimated  10 discount to Brent for Maya and Canadian crude  said analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt   Co 
 The yields aren t quite as good  but right now  with Maya crude at a  10 discount to Brent   refiners  are getting a  13 head start   said Matthew Blair  a Tudor Pickering refining analyst  The yield  or percent of oil that can be converted to diesel or gasoline  affects a refiner s profit 
Valero was one of the most active purchasers of HSFO in the U S  Gulf Coast  according to three trade sources  It has used the fuel at refineries in Louisiana and Texas  one of the traders said 
The tanker Tarbet Spirit was scheduled on Friday to discharge a cargo of about 500 000 barrels of fuel oil loaded in Antwerp at Pascagoula  Mississippi  according to Refinitiv Eikon data  where Chevron has a refinery

150453,371969,ETN,As Virus Spirals  Markets  Bullish Bent Proves Tough to Dislodge,news," Bloomberg     Anyone who used China s health scare as an excuse to bail from stocks or redouble bets on bonds is learning again how hard it has become in American markets to shake investors of their optimism 
Even in a world ruled by fear over the scope of the coronavirus outbreak  risk assets are proving impossible to hold back whenever the pace of news flow levels off  Equities as measured in the S P 500 are having the best two day surge since October  while 10 year Treasury yields have now climbed the most in almost two months  The yen  a currency haven  is lower for the year again and credit spreads are contained 
That it s happening as infection rates show no sign of slowing is testament to both the cold blooded logic of traders and the persistent strength in the global macro backdrop  Convinced there s no way to assess how bad the virus will get  they re clinging instead to what they can confirm  especially solid U S  earnings  a rebound in manufacturing data and a drumbeat of assurances from the Federal Reserve 
 We ve seen this repeatedly    May  August  October  and now    external shocks  political and geopolitical events have difficulty slowing down the U S  equities on the way up   said Paul Christopher  head of global market strategy at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Investment Institute   The long term impact of the virus is still unknown  but the attention has shifted to things that are more predictable  like monetary policy  
Coronavirus fears have dominated sentiment since mid January  with infections topping 20 000 and the death toll rising to 425  Headlines on the outbreak sent the U S  stock market to its worst days since August last week  while this week has seen two of its best 
With underlying data pointing to an expansion  several Wall Street strategists have reaffirmed outlooks  The virus shouldn t derail the economy  Morgan Stanley s Michael Wilson wrote in a note  Unless a pandemic develops  economic volatility will remain low  Evercore ISI s Dennis DeBusschere said Tuesday 
 The data has been solid  inventories are low and consumption is firm   DeBusschere  the firm s head of portfolio strategy  wrote   Given the collapse in yields and only a potential short term impact on EPS  stocks are unusually attractive relative to bonds  
Strategists in currencies and bonds markets haven t rushed to alter forecasts  Despite the dollar s best start to a year since 2016  Paresh Upadhyaya  a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management  says the currency will still lose ground once global economic growth rebounds after the virus is contained 
 My outlook for a recovery in global growth has been delayed  not derailed   Upadhyaya said Friday  China over the weekend moved to shore up its markets and economy with a massive injection of stimulus  bolstering optimism any downturn won t have a lasting impact

 The latest health scare poses a significant risk to our constructive call  and could lead to continued de risking in the short term   strategists led by JPMorgan s Mislav Matejka wrote in a note  But  they said   the fundamental backdrop is supportive  and the fallout from the outbreak is unlikely to hurt activity prints over the medium term

150457,371973,ETN,Earnings Preview  Eaton  ETN  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Eaton  NYSE ETN  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 1  
Revenues are expected to be  5 33 billion  down 2 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 42  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eaton 
For Eaton  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 23  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eaton will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eaton would post earnings of  1 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 52  delivering a surprise of  0 66  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Eaton doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-eaton-etn-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200502361,200502361

3 Top Ranked Mutual Funds
There you have it  some prime examples of truly bad mutual funds  In contrast  here are a few funds that have achieved high Zacks Ranks and have low fees 
MassMutual Select Equity Opportunities R5  MFVSX   Expense ratio  0 84   Management fee  0 69   MFVSX is classified as a Large Cap Blend fund  More often than not  Large Cap Blend mutual funds invest in companies with a market cap of over  10 billion  Buying stakes in bigger companies offer these funds more stability  and are well suited for investors with a  buy and hold  mindset  This fund has achieved five year annual returns of an astounding 10 73

What s Next for Eaton 
While Eaton has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

150484,372000,ETN,Offseason doesn t wait  Nationals have big decisions to make,news,"Not everybody associated with the Washington Nationals gets to spend a long time on the party train after the franchise s first World Series title 
The offseason is here and it will be a busy one for general manager Mike Rizzo  Beating the Houston Astros in seven games was terrific fun  but now is when the big time headaches begin 
The first big decision will occur by Saturday as World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg has 72 hours from the final out to decide whether to opt out of his current contract  Strasburg has four years and  100 million remaining on his deal 
Star third baseman Anthony Rendon  a National League MVP candidate  is an unrestricted free agent  He reportedly didn t bite on a seven year offer worth more than  200 million in September 
Other key players with decisions looming include late inning relievers Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson and infielders Howie Kendrick and Asdrubal Cabrera 
 There are certain milestones that come up throughout the offseason  We ll start making decisions two days after the World Series   Rizzo told The Sports Junkies  a Washington radio show  on Thursday   We ll be making our decisions  We ve already thought about what our offseason plan list is going to look like  We ve got some big decisions to make  
The first involves Strasburg  who is coming off a postseason for the ages by going 5 0 with a 1 98 ERA and 47 strikeouts against four walks in 36 1 3 innings 
The 31 year old has served the first three seasons of a seven year   175 million contract  Agent Scott Boras has been known to encourage his clients to strike when they have the leverage and Rizzo said he doesn t know how things will play out 
 I m not sure  We haven t spoken at all about it   Rizzo said regarding whether Strasburg will opt out   We did not want to speak about it  I haven t spoken to his agent about it  We ll certainly be communicating diligently over the next couple of days  seeing what he s going to do  
Part of Strasburg s decision may come down to things outside baseball 
He was a huge fan of his hometown San Diego Padres as a kid and hitting icon Tony Gwynn was his idol  He later played for Gwynn    who died in 2014    at San Diego State en route to becoming the No  1 overall pick of the Nationals in 2009 
With the Padres now close to being contenders  returning home for bushels of money could appeal to Strasburg 
Regardless  Rizzo is hoping the relationships Strasburg has with the Nationals will be a more important factor 
 He knows my feelings towards him  his feelings towards me and this organization  and we ll take the next step   Rizzo said   It all starts with an open line of dialog and communication  and we have a very strong line of communication  
The situation involving Rendon is tough to forecast 
The 29 year old just experienced a career year with a  319 average  34 homers and 126 RBIs while on a one year   18 8 million deal  He also proved he could be the main cog in the offensive attack after Bryce Harper left as a free agent 
The Nationals won a  Bryceless Title   but can they afford to lose another big stick in free agency for a second straight year 
Rendon may be looking for a deal on par with Colorado s Nolan Arenado  who received an eight year   260 million last offseason 
Rizzo says finances won t be a factor and that ownership always lets him make moves without interference 
 We have certainly had the resources to field a competitive team   especially  since 2012   Rizzo told the station   I do not believe that that s going to change  They ve always given me the resources to put together a championship caliber club  and I do not see that changing in the near future  
The bullpen situation is one to watch with the club holding a  6 5 million option on left hander Doolittle while right hander Hudson was picked up off the scrap heap from the Toronto Blue Jays at the July 31 deadline  Hudson was the team s main closer in the postseason and is set to become an unrestricted free agent 
Kendrick  who will become an unrestricted free agent  is 36 years old but was a major force in the postseason  He hit the decisive grand slam to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Division Series and followed up by being NL Championship Series MVP during a sweep of the St  Louis Cardinals 
Cabrera also will be an unrestricted free agent after being a solid contributor 
Other players with club options include franchise icon Ryan Zimmerman   18 million   outfielder Adam  Eaton   NYSE ETN    9 5 million  and catcher Yan Gomes   9 million  
Of course  no matter what moves occur in the offseason  Washington will have still have solid starting pitchers with Max Scherzer and Patrick Corbin  shortstop Trea Turner and 21 year old left fielder Juan Soto to reshape the roster around as it attempts to defend its title

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Victory Capital Holdings has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that VCTR has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
VCTR currently has a forward P E ratio of 5 58  while EV has a forward P E of 13 20  We also note that VCTR has a PEG ratio of 0 14  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  EV currently has a PEG ratio of 1 97 
Another notable valuation metric for VCTR is its P B ratio of 2 94  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  EV has a P B of 4 53 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to VCTR s Value grade of A and EV s Value grade of C

150491,372007,ETN,Why Eaton Vance  EV  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance in Focus
Eaton Vance  EV  is headquartered in Boston  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of  1 91  since the start of the year  The investment manager is paying out a dividend of  0 38 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 28  compared to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 22  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 81  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 50 is up 5 3  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Eaton Vance has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 31   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Eaton Vance s payout ratio is 43   which means it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  EV expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is  3 59 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 06  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that EV is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2020-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-eaton-vance-ev-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200502410,200502410
150492,372008,ETN,Eaton Vance  EV  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Eaton Vance is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Eaton Vance imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Eaton Vance
For the fiscal year ending October   2020  this investment manager is expected to earn  3 59 per share  which is a change of 4 1  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Eaton Vance  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 6  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Eaton Vance to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eaton-vance-ev-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200502396,200502396

150516,372032,ETN,Argentina s Fernandez reassures creditors with  no haircut  talk,news,"By Adam Jourdan and Rodrigo Campos
BUENOS AIRES NEW YORK  Reuters    Argentina s presidential front runner Alberto Fernandez said that if elected next month  he would aim to avoid haircuts on bond payments and seek a moderate  Uruguay style  debt restructuring  music to the ears of the country s creditors 
Investors are closely watching Fernandez s comments on debt after the South American nation was forced to announce plans to renegotiate around  100 billion in bonds after a sharp market crash in August pushed the country toward default 
The Peronist candidate  who soundly beat market friendly incumbent President Mauricio Macri in an August primary  is the favorite to win the Oct  27 general election  How his administration will handle the debt crisis is one of the key questions for the country and its local and global backers 
 Hearing Fernandez refer to a Uruguay style re profiling is a very positive thing   said Roger Horn  senior emerging market strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities America in New York  adding that most investors were braced for some sort of loss 
 It at least shows a market friendly intention  
Fernandez  in comments posted on Twitter late on Thursday  said debt was Argentina s  biggest issue   but that the country   in recession for much of the last year   would meet its obligations in full if given time to revive growth 
 We never said we wouldn t pay or that there would be a haircut   he wrote  He aimed criticism at Macri s administration for taking on too much debt 
 We will pay the debts by growing and exporting    The only way is to export  The other channel has been exhausted  which is to borrow   he said 
In separate comments at an event in Cordoba  he said Argentina should be able to replicate the model of neighboring Uruguay  which successfully undertook voluntary debt renegotiations in 2003 and is widely seen as a positive model 
By contrast  in 2005 and 2010  under a prior Peronist government  Argentina pushed bond holders to take a massive  haircut  that hurt its reputation on financial markets and sparked a multi year battle with  holdout  creditors 
BONDS RALLY
 Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  said in a note on Friday that Fernandez s comments were decent news for the country s creditors

150517,372033,ETN,Egypt s investment allure tarnished as protests challenge reforms,news,"By Ulf Laessing  Karin Strohecker and Tom Arnold
CAIRO LONDON  Reuters    Egypt s reputation as an emerging market star lost some of its sparkle last month when street protests revealed a population yet to benefit from years of economic reforms that had impressed investors  That reality check may prove to be uncomfortable 
Rare protests against President Abdel Fattah al Sisi served as a reminder of the turmoil that followed the 2011 overthrow of Hosni Mubarak  briefly upsetting the country s  12 billion stock market and putting pressure on its sovereign debt 
Markets stabilized this week after security forces managed to deter more dissent  reassuring investors who had piled in since Cairo struck a  12 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund in 2016 
Devaluing its currency in 2016 and embarking on reforms  Egypt implemented austerity to help cut the deficit 
Yet investors fear authorities might roll back measures such as a cut in subsidies for fuel and other goods which have proved painful for Egyptians  a third of whom live below the poverty line 
 Investors are wary of the risk of fiscal slippage through the reversal of subsidy reforms or raising spending on public sector wages or cash transfers   said Farouk Soussa  senior economist with Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  
 The main risk is that any fiscal slippage could reduce the likelihood of Egypt coming to an agreement with the IMF over a new deal after the current one expires in November  
In a possible first sign of such slippage  the supply ministry said it had returned 1 8 million people to its food subsidy plan since February  following earlier cuts in the program 
 We are watching the government s response to this vocal but small minority to see if there s any type of populist policy response which would derail the economic reform program   said Marshall Stocker  a portfolio manager at U S  based investment management firm  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance 
HEFTY EXPOSURES
Egypt s domestic government bond market has proven a hit with investors hunting for yield in a world where central banks are pushing interest rates ever lower  Yields of Egypt s sovereign bonds in the JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  emerging local bond benchmark are near 14    the highest across the index 
In August  foreign holdings of government debt including bills and bonds reached  20 billion  a sharp recovery from the  31 million trough in 2015 in the wake of the Arab Spring 
 The reality is that as a foreign investment destination these past few years Egypt has not been attractive beyond the sale of short term debt  thanks to offering some of the highest interest rates on the market   said Timothy Kaldas from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy 
But the combination of large financing requirements   Cairo needs to raise  6 7 billion in the next financial year  analysts say   and lack of detail on future engagement with the IMF beyond November means the best times for investors may be over 
Egypt has a large financing need and  that can be challenging without an IMF backstop   said Ray Jian  head of EM aggregate debt at Amundi 
 GRAPHIC   Egyptian treasury bills held by foreigners   
Equities listed on Cairo s  12 2 billion bourse have also been popular  MSCI s Egypt stock index  has soared 32  since the start of the year compared to the overall emerging equity index  MSCIEF  which has eked out a 3 6  gain over the same period 
Allocations to Egyptian stocks among emerging market equity fund managers have ticked up in recent months with average holding weights hitting 4 year highs  according to Copley Fund Research

There is some genuine discontent among ordinary Egyptians  said Andrew Brudenell  lead senior portfolio manager for frontier markets equities at Ashmore Group  adding that reforms were taking time and benefits had not yet trickled down to much of the population   Hopefully this is just on the cusp of changing   he said 
But Hasnain Malik  managing director  frontier markets equity strategy at Tellimer  said last week s fall of 6  in the benchmark  EGX30  was not justified 
 The Egypt market is still attractive compared to other emerging markets   he said 
The reforms have helped temper inflation but have failed to create jobs to meet the demands of a country of 100 million 
Foreign direct investment  FDI  fell to  5 9 billion in the 2018 19 fiscal year from  7 7 billion the previous year   a far cry from the  11 5 billion foreseen by the IMF at the outset of its Egypt program and the revised  9 5 billion from April 
Businessmen blamed bureaucracy  a slow judiciary and an expansion of firms linked to the military  Growth rose to 5 6  in 2018 19 
 Egypt needs growth of 6 7 8  of private sector led growth if people are going to feel it and living standards are generally going to increase   said Gregory Smith  sovereign debt strategist at Renaissance Capital ",2019-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/egypts-investment-allure-tarnished-as-protests-challenge-reforms-1990885,1990885

150520,372036,ETN,Signify to buy U S  firm Cooper Lighting for  1 4 billion,news,"By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM  Reuters    Signify  AS LIGHT   the Dutch based lighting company  has agreed to buy U S  firm Cooper Lighting Solutions from  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Corp   EATO UL  for  1 4 billion in cash to boost its presence in North America 
Signify shares rose 4 6  to 25 00 euros in early trading in Amsterdam after the company said the deal would add to earnings per share in the first year and lead to cost savings of  60 million annually within three years 
The acquisition is the largest by Signify  the world s largest lighting maker that was formerly known as Philips Lighting  since it was spun off from Philips in 2016 
The deal aims to boost Signify s position in the global professional lighting market  where it is the No 2 player  and in North America  where it suffers from a lack of scale and competes with rivals like  Acuity Brands Inc    N AYI   CFO Stephane Rougeot said 
 The rationale from a strategy standpoint is to get a much stronger market position in North America in professional   he said in a telephone interview 
 With Cooper we are getting a very large player in North America professional  They have great market positions  they have a large agent network  they have very deep customer relationships  they have great brands over there  
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 pending regulatory approvals 
Peachtree City  Ga  based Cooper Lighting Solutionst sells professional lighting and controls under the Corelite  Halo  McGraw Edison and Metalux brands 
It reported 2018 sales of  1 7 billion and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation  EBITDA  of  187 million 
ING analyst Marc Hesselink  who rates Signify shares at  hold   said the deal was a  good strategic fit for Signify and price paid seems reasonable  
Still  Cooper would not add technology or new capabilities to Signify s portfolio and the deal would not really change the growth or margin profile of the company  he said 
Signify said it intends to keep dividends steady or increase them after the acquisition  but its main focus will be to reduce debt of the combined company from two times net debt to EBITDA to one time in the next three years 
During that time Signify will make further merger and acquisition activity less of a priority  Rougeot said

150521,372037,ETN,Saudi Arabia plans bumper Aramco IPO  relying on easy loans and rich locals,news,"By Marwa Rashad  Tom Arnold and Hadeel Al Sayegh
RIYADH LONDON DUBAI  Reuters    Saudi Arabia is setting the stage for a blockbuster listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco in Riyadh  relying on easy credit for retail investors and pushing rich locals to invest with cash held abroad to achieve a  2 trillion valuation target 
The world s largest oil firm could announce plans next week to float a 1  2  stake on the kingdom s Tadawul market before a possible international listing  launching an initiative that is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman s economic diversification drive 
If the state raises more than  25 billion  it would be the world s biggest initial public offering  IPO   topping Alibaba s 2014 debut 
To capitalize on local interest  Aramco can take advantage of new market rules that allow issuers the flexibility to sell more shares to retail investors  likely exceeding the usual 10  seen in recent IPOs  two banking and one legal source said 
A government committee has met in the past few months with dozens of wealthy Saudi individuals to secure pre sale agreements  two bankers and a potential investor said 
One source said those discussions included encouraging investors to repatriate cash held overseas to avoid draining too much liquidity from the Saudi banking system   The national interest requires bringing money from overseas   he said 
Aramco declined to comment and the government s media office did not respond to a request for comment 
 Listing first on the Riyadh exchange is a great opportunity for Aramco to access first the type of investors that might be most excited about the public offering   said Ellen R  Wald  president of Transversal Consulting and author of the book Saudi  Inc 
 Between the domestic Saudi enthusiasm for the company and government encouragement of investment in Aramco  Tadawul is bound to give Aramco the best opportunity for a high valuation  
EASY LOANS
Large Saudi banks are facilitating loans for local retail investors  three other banking sources said  amid strong liquidity in the banking system where deposits exceeded loans by 215 billion riyals   57 billion  in August 
Bankers expect at least 6 million 7 million local investors to participate  more than took part in the  6 billion 2014 IPO of National Commercial Bank  SE 1180   which was 23 times oversubscribed 
 The IPO will be a gift from the government to the Saudi people and they will want as many of them as possible to take part in it   said a Riyadh investment banker 
Saudi investors see the IPO as a chance to own part of the kingdom s crown jewel and an opportunity to show patriotism after the attack on Aramco oil plants on Sept  14 that temporarily knocked out more than half the country s output  which is now about 10 million barrels per day 
Potential investors told Reuters they had been preparing for months    saving money  selling land plots and exiting other stocks  Saudis flooded banks with phone calls asking how to participate after Aramco announced bank mandates last month 
 I have seven boys and I wish I could invest in Aramco IPO for each of them   said retired civil servant Abu Abdullah 
Online adverts promoting the IPO to locals have gone viral 
 The Aramco IPO is a chance that comes once in a lifetime  and one must seize it   said a Saudi real estate investor 
EQUAL TREATMENT
Some foreign funds fear the domestic focus may crowd them out 
 It s quite a valuable asset we think is fairly well run  but if all the cream is taken by locals it will be harder to attract foreign investors   said Marshall Stocker  portfolio manager at U S  based investment firm  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance 
 It s an important economic principle that investors are treated equally regardless of their nationality   he said 
A person familiar with the deal said the process was transparent for all institutional investors  including Qualified Foreign Investors registered with the Tadawul bourse  who can bid for the share allocation 
Besides helping to hit the valuation target of  2 trillion   a figure cited by the crown prince although bankers have suggested a lower number   a local listing will also aid Riyadh s efforts to promote Tadawul to investors abroad 
Bankers say Tadawul s membership in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and FTSE Global Equity Index should boost demand for the IPO  but one source familiar with the transaction said the expected level of passive fund investment was uncertain 
 We are studying the opportunity  If we participate  most likely it would be the international space where we think liquidity should be greater   said Peter Marber  chief investment officer at active asset manager Aperture Investors 
Foreign funds bought more Saudi stocks this year after Riyadh entered both indices  but the Saudi market  TASI  is down 4  year to date  as local institutions sold shares to prepare for the Aramco deal  fund managers and analysts say 
Tadawul should have enough liquidity for a 1  2  Aramco float given daily trading worth 5 billion riyals in August  analysts say  Inflows from foreign passive funds helped lift trading from 3 2 billion riyals a year earlier ",2019-10-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/saudi-arabia-plans-bumper-aramco-ipo-relying-on-easy-loans-and-rich-locals-1998049,1998049
150522,372038,ETN,Up 2 0  Nationals taking nothing for granted against Astros,news,"In the dugout celebration following his eighth inning World Series home run Wednesday  Washington Nationals outfielder Adam  Eaton   NYSE ETN  plopped on the bench with teammate Howie Kendrick and the duo simultaneously hit the throttle on an imaginary race car 
Laugh at the concept of a high powered machine with dual gas pedals if you must  but the Nationals have been operating with an abundance of force in these playoffs  long before they took a 2 0 lead in the World Series over the favored Houston Astros 
The Nationals will return home for Game 3 on Friday two victories away from the first title in franchise history  not necessarily in need of the love from their own fans but they will take it  Washington is on an eight game postseason winning streak and only two of those games were at Nationals Park 
 We know the series isn t over   Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon said   I think it would have been a success if we only came in and stole one game  obviously  playing at this stage and playing with the crowd and at their home field  But for us to obviously steal two games from them at their home field is great  But we still have a job to finish and we have two more to go  
Going back further  to Sept  23  the Nationals have won 18 of their past 20 games  The only defeats were in the National League Division Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers 
The Nationals  weakness was supposed to be an overmatched bullpen  but Washington finished off the Astros just fine in Game 2  The Nationals broke open a 2 2 tie with a six run seventh inning and a three run eighth for a 12 3 victory  The blowout allowed the Nationals  two dependable bullpen arms   Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson   to take the day off 
Anibal Sanchez  1 0  0 71 ERA in the 2019 postseason   who was four outs away from a no hitter in Game 1 of National League Championship Series against the St  Louis Cardinals  will take the mound for the Nationals in Game 3 
In 10 career regular season starts against the Astros  the 35 year old Sanchez is 4 2 with a 3 39 ERA  last facing them in 2016 and last earning a victory against them in 2013 
The Astros will send Zack Greinke  0 2  6 43  to the mound in Game 3  Acquired at the trade deadline to form a formidable rotation for the upcoming postseason  Greinke now must be the pitcher to get the team on track after Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander were unable to lead the Astros to victories 
Greinke  36  has dominated the Nationals in his career  going 6 1 with a 1 27 ERA over nine starts  The latest meeting came at Washington on June 13 when Greinke was a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks  He gave up just two hits over 7 1 3 scoreless innings as Arizona earned a 5 0 victory 
In addition to a dominating pitching performance  what the Astros need is a lead  They held a slim advantage for the first three innings of Game 1 but they haven t been in front since 
History says the Astros  chances are slim  Only three teams have won the World Series after losing the first two games at home  the last being the 1996 New York Yankees 
 They re halfway to a race to four wins   Astros manager A J  Hinch said of the Nationals   Clearly  Game 3 becomes critical for us  We re going to get on a plane  we re going to go to Washington  I doubt the Nats are going to feel too confident that they have this sewed up and they can start planning the parade  We re going to give them a fight for it

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Legg Mason has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that LM is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
LM currently has a forward P E ratio of 10 76  while EV has a forward P E of 13 19  We also note that LM has a PEG ratio of 0 94  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  EV currently has a PEG ratio of 2 61 
Another notable valuation metric for LM is its P B ratio of 0 90  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  EV has a P B of 4 48

150529,372045,ETN,LM Vs  EV  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Financial   Investment Management stocks have likely encountered both Legg Mason  LM  and Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Legg Mason is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that LM has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
LM currently has a forward P E ratio of 9 89  while EV has a forward P E of 13 27  We also note that LM has a PEG ratio of 0 78  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  EV currently has a PEG ratio of 2 94 
Another notable valuation metric for LM is its P B ratio of 0 83  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  EV has a P B of 4 54 
Based on these metrics and many more  LM holds a Value grade of A  while EV has a Value grade of C 
LM has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than EV  so it seems like value investors will conclude that LM is the superior option right now ",2019-12-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lm-vs-ev-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200495206,200495206

150545,372061,ETN,Attacks on Saudi facilities threaten spare oil capacity  price hikes,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN 
HOUSTON  Reuters    Saturday s attacks on key Saudi Arabia processing plants will test the world s ability to handle a supply crisis as it faces the temporary loss of more than 5  of global supply from the world s biggest crude exporter 
The Iranian backed Houthis group in Yemen claimed responsibility for attacks that shut two plants at the Abqaiq facility  the heart of the Saudi oil industry  which will cut the kingdom s production by about 5 7 million barrels per day  bpd   more than half of the kingdom s output  according to a statement from state run Saudi Aramco 
Crude prices could spike by several dollars per barrel when markets open Sunday night as a prolonged outage could prompt the United States and other countries to release crude from their strategic petroleum reserves to boost commercial stocks globally  The U S  Energy Department said on Saturday it is ready to release oil from its strategic reserve if needed 
 Oil prices will jump on this attack  and if the disruption to Saudi production is prolonged  an SPR release     seems likely and sensible   said Jason Bordoff  founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York 
It is too early to know the extent of the damage to the processing plants and the Saudi supply chain that brings crude from oil fields to export facilities  The chief executive of Saudi Aramco  Amin Nasser  said in a statement that the company will have more information within 48 hours  as it works to bring back the lost output 
Aramco exported more than 7 million barrels per day  bpd  of crude last year  with almost three quarters of its crude exports delivered to customers in Asia last year  The country has about 188 million barrels in reserve  or roughly 37 days of Abqaiq s processing capacity  according to a Saturday note from Rapidan Energy Group 
The spare capacity held by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries   OPEC  to supply consumers in the event of a significant production shortfall has been declining for decades as aging oil fields have lost production capacity 
Saudi Arabia s 2 3 million bpd of effective spare capacity in August accounted for more than two thirds of OPEC s on hand supply of 3 2 million bpd  according to the International Energy Agency  with most of the rest from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates 
Russia may have spare capacity following the international pact between OPEC and its allies to curb production in support of crude prices  analysts said 
The U S  Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently holds about 644 million barrels  according to the U S  Energy Department  roughly equal to 52 days of U S  production 
A prolonged outage could spur higher production and exports from the United States  but it takes months for U S  companies to respond to price signals because of logistical limitations  analysts and traders said 
The United States now produces more than 12 million bpd and exports more than 3 million bpd  but it is unclear if U S  export facilities can handle additional shipments 
 Every day the facility is shut down  the world loses another 5 million barrels of oil production   said Andy Lipow  president of Lipow Oil Associates   The world s spare capacity is not 5 million barrels per day  ",2019-09-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/attacks-on-saudi-facilities-threaten-spare-oil-capacity-price-hikes-1978120,1978120
150546,372062,ETN,Next wave of U S  LNG export projects to be  tougher   Blackstone Energy CEO,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN 
HOUSTON  Reuters    The next wave of U S  liquefied natural gas  LNG  export projects will be  tougher  to bring online  as companies with existing facilities take advantage of lower costs to expand capacity in coming years  the chief executive of Blackstone  NYSE BX  Energy Partners said on Wednesday 
Blackstone CEO David Foley said at the Gastech Energy Conference in Houston that only one or two new startup projects may reach a final investment decision  FID  in the next wave of U S  LNG export projects 
 In terms of liquefaction capacity that gets FID from the U S   the hit rate will be a lot higher on projects either sponsored by major oil companies or expansions of existing facilities   Foley said 
The energy focused private equity group  a unit of Blackstone Group  has owned a stake in Cheniere Energy  A LNG   the nation s biggest LNG exporter  since 2012  Cheniere was the first company to build a large LNG export terminal in the lower 48 states  which started shipping to other markets in February 2016 
The United States began shipping LNG to foreign customers from the lower 48 states in 2016  with exports reaching a record 5 2 billion cubic feet per day in July  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration 
Demand for the gas that is super cooled so that it can be transported on ships has increased from numerous markets  particularly from China and India  to meet growing energy demand while moving away from dirtier coal plants 
Operators are racing to reach FID new U S  export projects that would sell cargoes into a global market where excess supply  which is currently abundant  is expected to shrink within five years 
Five LNG projects reached FID this year  more than any other year  with three in the United States  and the others in Mozambique and Russia  Combined  the projects would have capacity of 9 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day  according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie

150547,372063,ETN,Investor Netter pushes FSD to restructure or return cash,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
NEW YORK  Reuters    Investment manager Donald Netter is stepping up his battle with First Trust High Income Long Short Fund  FSD  by asking the closed end fund to restructure or give investors their money back because it has been trading at a discount for years 
Netter  whose Dolphin Limited Partnership I LP owns 450 000 shares of FSD valued at approximately  6 7 million  is criticizing the First Trust fund for trading at 13  below the fund s net asset value 
While closed end funds sometimes trade at a discount the range is traditionally much smaller  analysts said  Netter  who first began complaining to FSD a year ago  said the fund s managers have failed to appropriately swap out certain fixed rate securities at a time interest rates are rising 
 Dolphin now resubmits a revised proposal  which it originally had made to FSD in December 2018  designed to close the persistent and sizable market discount to net asset value or  in the alternative  nearly a year later  promptly liquidate the Fund   Netter wrote to FSD in a letter seen by Reuters 
To ratchet up the pressure on FSD  Netter said he plans to make his letter public for all investors to see 
Mackay Shields LLC subadvises the fund  A representative for First Trust Advisors could not be immediately reached for comment 
Netter is not the first investor to criticize FSD  Two years ago  Saba Capital Management  the  1 7 billion hedge fund run by Boaz Weinstein  reached a settlement with the fund that included a cash tender offer for 15  of the fund s outstanding common shares 
One reason for the persistent discount is that this fund  unlike some other similar offerings from Blackstone  NYSE BX   Nuveen and  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance  is that the FSD fund is a perpetual fund with no target date for it to be wound down ",2019-09-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/investor-netter-pushes-fsd-to-restructure-or-return-cash-1981092,1981092

What s Next for Eaton Vance 
While Eaton Vance has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

150552,372068,ETN,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  Eaton Vance  EV  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance in Focus
Eaton Vance  EV  is headquartered in Boston  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 35 1  since the start of the year  The investment manager is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 38 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 16   This compares to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 37  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 8  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 50 is up 17 2  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Eaton Vance has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 31   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Eaton Vance s current payout ratio is 42   meaning it paid out 42  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  EV expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 60 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 35  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout

150579,372095,ETN,Exclusive  Lotus Midstream mulls reversing West Texas to Cushing pipeline   sources,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN 
HOUSTON  Reuters    Pipeline operator Lotus Midstream LLC may reverse flows on a line now sending crude from West Texas to Cushing  Oklahoma  the main hub for pricing U S  crude futures  three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday  an unusual move that could lift U S  benchmark prices by draining supplies 
Reversing the flow on a portion of Lotus s Centurion pipeline would send oil on a circuitous route from the country s main storage hub at Cushing to the its top shale field in West Texas and then via new pipelines into Gulf Coast export hubs  they said 
But with the operators of the new pipelines offering discounted prices to attract shippers and as oil in West Texas fetching higher prices than in Cushing  the reversal would be lucrative for shippers  traders and analysts said 
 Centurion is always evaluating the best ways to serve its shippers   said Lotus spokeswoman Casey Nikoloric  declining further comment 
Centurion  which consists of two lines rated at 170 000 barrels per day  bpd  combined  had the smaller line flowing to West Texas  But in 2014 former owner Occidental Petroleum  NYSE OXY  shifted its direction to Cushing to take advantage of the then deep discounts on shale in the Permian Basin 
For a graphic showing storage levels at Cushing  see 
Lotus is considering reversing the flows on either its Centurion North Line  which has 110 000 bpd of capacity  or the South Line  with 60 000 bpd capacity  the people said 
Permian output has risen to 4 3 million bpd from 1 68 million bpd since that reversal  helping drive U S  crude exports this year above 3 million bpd  according to U S  government data  Three new pipelines from the Permian will increase existing capacity by two thirds  with about 2 5 million bpd in additional space 
Reversing one line would support crude prices at Cushing as storage there is drained  and restrain Midland prices that have risen with the startup of new  Plains All American Pipeline  LP  N PAA  and EPIC Midstream Holdings LLC s lines  traders and shippers said 
 The Midland differential to Cushing would be a lower premium than expected   one U S  trader said   The reversal would help pull down Cushing  inventories  faster   he added 
Inventories at Cushing fell to 44 8 million barrels in the week ended Aug  9  after peaking at 53 5 million in mid June 
On Tuesday  Midland crude for October delivery traded 25 cents a barrel above the Cushing benchmark  traders said  Houston prices for September delivery traded at a  2 per barrel premium 
 It would actually have an enormous psychological impact on market even if the flow isn t huge   an oil trader said   To be able to swing from Cushing back into Midland would be very  very interesting  
Crude volumes on the Centurion pipeline fell to 126 000 bpd last month from a 2019 peak of 230 000 bpd in February  according to market intelligence firm Genscape  February volumes were boosted by the use of drag reducing agents  it said 
 We expect flows to taper off as spot shipments favor new capacity to the Gulf  and the Centurion pipeline has been the canary in the coal mine for that   said Ryan Saxton  Genscape s director of oil and midstream ",2019-08-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-lotus-midstream-mulls-reversing-west-texas-to-cushing-pipeline--sources-1959560,1959560

Two other energy pipeline operators also could raise their prices if Plains  surcharge sticks  analysts have said  They have pointed to  Kinder Morgan  Inc s  N KMI  Gulf Coast Express  a natural gas pipeline  and an EPIC Midstream crude pipeline  which were constructed after the steel tariffs were levied ",2019-08-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-oil-firms-challenge-pipeline-surcharge-for-steel-tariff-filing-1959239,1959239

150584,372100,ETN,Eaton Vance  EV  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Q4 Release,opinion,"The market expects Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This investment manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 89 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 7  
Revenues are expected to be  439 75 million  up 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 39  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eaton Vance 
For Eaton Vance  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 12  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eaton Vance will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eaton Vance would post earnings of  0 87 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 90  delivering a surprise of  3 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

Chad Bettis relieved starter Jon Gray  one run  two hits allowed in four innings  to begin the fifth inning and saw Eaton send his first pitch curveball over the wall in right field to give the Nationals a 2 1 lead  Eaton s homer was his seventh of the season and first since belting a solo shot in Washington s 5 2 win over San Diego on June 9

Colorado answered its lopsided series opening 11 1 loss to Washington by opening the scoring in the fourth inning  Alonso ripped a double to right field to lead off the frame before advancing to third on a groundout and coming home on McMahon s sacrifice fly to left

150609,372125,ETN,Olympics  Skateboarders stoked to send sport to greater heights at Games,news,"By Jack Tarrant
TOKYO  Reuters    In exactly a year from Friday  skateboarding will make its Olympic bow at the Tokyo 2020 Games with top skaters hoping the global exposure will help take the sport to the next level of popularity 
What started with surfers attaching rollerskate wheels to wooden slats in 1950s California is already a professional sport  of course  but the Olympics offers skaters the chance to do their thing on the biggest sporting stage of all 
 The publicity that skateboarding will get from the Olympics in Tokyo 2020 is just going to change everything for skateboarding   said American Jagger  Eaton   NYSE ETN   who made his X Games debut at the age of 11 
  It makes it  more accessible for people like me who love competing and want to compete  
The International Olympic Committee s drive to reach a more youthful audience led to the inclusion of skateboarding along with four other new sports for Tokyo In a sport that is still firmly rooted in the streets and urban skateparks  not everybody has been happy with the prospect of skaters vying for gold  silver and bronze 
For the likes of Eaton or three time street world champion Nyjah Huston  though  skateboarding is all about competing    and winning 
 I have a super competitive drive and I have worked my life  everything  to get where I am at  to compete with the pros and I just won t let anybody take that away from me   said 18 year old Eaton 
Huston  who has also won the Street League Skateboarding competition five times  is the hot favorite for gold in Tokyo and sees the Olympics as the extra motivation he needs after a decade at the top 
 It adds extra pressure but I am always going into every contest with the same mindset  Going out there and doing the best to win  I love a day out there competing   said the 24 year old American 
 I feel like people might think I would be less competitive now or less fired up after winning so much over the years  but I think the feeling keeps growing and the love for skateboarding keeps growing  
COMPETITIVE EDGE
They will both need that competitive edge just to get to the Games with only 20 spots for men and women in the two disciplines of park and street skateboarding up for grabs 
Skaters can qualify with a podium finish at the next world championships   in September for park boarders and next year for street   or by placing in the top 16 in the Worldskate rankings 
Triple Olympic snowboard champion Shaun White is among those who have declared an interest in taking part and Eaton said the threats might not come from the usual suspects 
 The thing about Tokyo is that it is an open contest   explained the 2018 X Games silver medalist 
 Not everybody is invited to the X Games or these other contests so that is why you have got to keep on your toes  
As hosts  Japan are guaranteed one spot per event but they are likely to need more than that  such is the depth of skating talent in the country 
Chief among that pool of talent are current street skating world champion Aori Nishimura  who turns 18 on Wednesday  and 13 year old Misugu Okamoto  who currently leads WorldSkate s park rankings and is in pole position for Olympic qualification 
With eight skaters in the top 10 rankings across the two disciplines  Japan s women are taking the sport by storm 
 In terms of girl skaters  we have had a lot more competing internationally since it was announced to be an Olympic sport   Nishimura told Reuters 
 In Japan  they put a lot of emphasis on the Olympics  
YOUNGEST COMPETITOR
Skateboarding has long been a young person s game and they do not come much younger than 10 year old Cocona Hiraki  who will break Eaton s record as the youngest competitor in X Games history in Minneapolis next week 
Whether she qualifies or not  Hiraki hopes the Olympics can help to further inspire a burgeoning skateboarding community in Japan 
 If we try to introduce the  skateboarding  style so that everyone can join in and enjoy  then we can inspire people who do not know anything about skateboarding   she said 
The IOC is hoping Hiraki is right and that a whole new audience embraces skateboarding  and in turn the Olympics  come Tokyo 2020 
 It is the biggest sporting event in the world and there will be millions of people watching this   said Nishimura 
 It is going to be a good opportunity for skateboarding to be seen across the world  
That exposure will undoubtedly also help continue the transformation of skateboarding from an urban recreation to a truly international professional sport 
 I think a lot of people thought of skateboarding as a hobby  as opposed to a career and parents seeing their kids making a good living out of it   said Huston 
 My dad  he was a skateboarder  but his parents weren t supportive of it  but  I think it has now got to the point where people take it more seriously and I am stoked to be out there and be a part of it  ",2019-07-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/olympics-skateboarders-stoked-to-send-sport-to-greater-heights-at-games-1935646,1935646

150611,372127,ETN,Young skaters challenge old dudes at Minneapolis X Games,news,"By Jack Tarrant
TOKYO  Reuters    Skateboarding has always been a young person s game but when the X Games kicks off in Minneapolis on Thursday  competitors as young as 10 will be fighting it out for the most prestigious prizes in the sport 
With skateboarding set to make its Olympic debut in Tokyo next year  the competition is hotting up with qualification events for the Games already underway 
The X Games does not count as a qualification event for Tokyo 2020 but for skaters it still holds a special place in their hearts as the key driver in bringing the sport into the competitive and professional era 
  The  X Games is special  mainly because it has been around for so long  It is crazy   nine time X Games gold medallist and Olympic hopeful Nyjah Huston told Reuters 
 Major shout out to those guys for getting skateboarding to the point where it is in the Olympics and stuff  
The X Games was founded in 1995 and ever since has been seen as the pinnacle for skateboarders  with many choosing the competition to unveil their newest tricks 
Both park and street skateboarding   the two disciplines to feature at the 2020 Olympics   are on the schedule for the four day event in Minneapolis 
For these four days  the skaters are keeping the Olympics out of their minds 
 The X Games isn t related to the Olympics or anything like that   stressed current street skating world champion Aori Nishimura 
 For me  the X Games is its own battle and its own contest  The Olympics is a different story  
In qualifying for vert skateboarding on Wednesday  Brazilian Gui Khury became the youngest ever X Games competitor at 10 years and eight months old in a further indication of the growing strength of a new wave of pre teen skaters 
Also in Minneapolis is Japan s Cocona Hiraki  another 10 year old  who will become the youngest female to compete at the X Games 
These youngsters are not only competing  they are winning and challenging the very best 
Misugu Okamoto  13  currently leads WorldStake s park rankings following her victory at the Dew Tour event in June  while 11 year old Brazilian Rayssa Leal won the Skateboarding League World Tour event in Los Angeles on Sunday 
Many of his competitors are so young that 18 year old Jagger  Eaton   NYSE ETN   who held the title of youngest X Games competitor for seven years until Khury s arrival on the scene  feels like a veteran 
 I can tell you from experience that     in two or three years you are going to see a whole new wave of skate athletes that are going to put so much pressure on the people chilling right now   Eaton  who was 11 when he made his X Games debut  told Reuters 
 Everybody has got to keep your head up and your eyes wide open because these kids right now are hungry  I was there too but I am still hungry for success 
 There will be five to 10 kids in every single event that will beat out the old dudes in two or three years  ",2019-08-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/young-skaters-challenge-old-dudes-at-minneapolis-x-games-1941850,1941850
150612,372128,ETN,U S  shale shippers will pay surcharge for Trump steel tariffs,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN 
HOUSTON  Reuters     Plains All American Pipeline  LP  N PAA  said on Friday it will tack on a fee for users of a new oil pipeline to pay for the cost of the Trump administration s tariffs on imported steel  with analysts and traders calling it the first U S  energy pipeline operator to do so 
In addition to the steel levies announced last year  President Donald Trump on Thursday said he plans to expand U S  tariffs to  300 billion in Chinese imports  escalating a trade dispute that has increased costs for American consumers of everything from steel to electronics to shoes 
Houston based Plains will begin charging shippers a 5 cents per barrel fee on its 670 000 barrel per day  bpd  Cactus II pipeline next April to offset higher construction costs from  governmental regulation and tariffs   according to a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
Plains last year estimated the 25  steel tariff would add  40 million to its costs for the  1 1 billion pipeline  which runs 550 miles from the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico  the top U S  shale field  to the U S  Gulf Coast 
The Trump administration last year imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to shield U S  producers from overseas competition and protect jobs  It was one in a series of tariffs imposed by Trump since becoming president in 2017 
Two other new pipelines could also raise their prices if Plains  surcharge sticks  three analysts said  They pointed to  Kinder Morgan  Inc s  N KMI  Gulf Coast Express pipeline and a EPIC Midstream s pipeline  which were constructed after the steel tariffs were levied 
 There s certainly a risk of them passing on inflationary costs   said Kendrick Rhea  an analyst at pipeline industry researcher East Daley Capital   This is an issue for the next go around of pipelines   added Matthew Blair  an analyst at Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co

150614,372130,ETN,Gold comfort for Warner as he defends Pan Am decathlon title,news,"By Steve Keating
LIMA  Reuters    While a successful defense of his Pan Am Games decathlon title on Wednesday was the result Damian Warner had been aiming for  the chilly conditions meant it was not the world championships  warm up  the Canadian was expecting 
 It s cold   said Warner  wrapping himself in the Canadian flag for a bit of warmth as much as pride 
 It s tough  especially coming from Ontario where it has been super hot then coming here where the sun is never really out and it is on the chilly side  
The overcast  dreary conditions of Peru s winter have seen athletes bring out mittens and wool hats  while the decathletes brought blankets from their hotels to wrap themselves in between the 10 events of the gruelling two day competition 
While the Canadian spends as much of the year in the snow as he does in the sun  Warner was caught a little off guard by the conditions  which may have prevented him from improving his Games record of 8 659 points set four years ago in Toronto 
However  he was still a class apart in an elite field that boasted three of the world s top five decathletes  posting a score of 8 513 to finish comfortably ahead of Grenada s Lindon Victor  the Commonwealth Games gold medalist  who took silver with 8 240 
Warner s team mate Pierce LePage held on for bronze with
8 161 
The conditions in Lima will be far different from the blazing temperatures Warner can expect to face in October at the world championships in Doha where he will try to improve on the silver he won four years ago in Beijing 
 Doha is going to be a lot hotter  you can t really compare the weather  that will present different challenges   said Warner   Mini challenges we faced here can be taken into Doha  
The battle for gold in Doha is shaping up as one of the championships  most intriguing duels with Warner renewing his rivalry with Kevin Mayer  the French world record holder and reigning world champion 
Decathletes compete only two or three times a season so when they do it is always an occasion 
Before next year s Tokyo Olympics  Warner will compete at the world championships as well as decathlon s unofficial worlds in Goetzis  Austria next year 
With 2016 Olympic champion Ashton  Eaton   NYSE ETN  having retired  the gold medal will be up for grabs in Tokyo with Rio silver medalist Mayer and bronze medalist Warner the favorites 
The only decathlete to score higher than Warner over the last three years has been Mayer 
 I know when we go to Doha there is going to be no moment early on when you re going to think this is over   said Warner   You have to be on the whole time 
 Some guys will put up really good scores and will be out there pushing all the way through to the end and you have to be ready for that  ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/gold-comfort-for-warner-as-he-defends-pan-am-decathlon-title-1948935,1948935

150618,372134,ETN,New U S  pipelines poised to start price war for shale shippers,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN 
HOUSTON  Reuters    The operators of two new pipelines in West Texas shale fields are offering discounted prices to attract shippers accustomed to high fees to move oil to export hubs  according to the pipeline companies and federal filings 
These bargain rates  in one case half the initial published rate  will aid strapped oil producers that once had to sell their oil for about  10 less per barrel because of transport constraints to move their oil from the largest shale oil field in the country 
But pipeline companies  which have in the past year raced to add new capacity to flow oil from the Permian Basin to the refining and export hub on U S  Gulf Coast  will face pressure to cut rates in coming weeks  said oil traders and analysts 
The two operators   EPIC Midstream and Plains All American  N PAA    are opening lines that combined will in coming months be able to carry about 1 6 million barrels of oil per day  bpd  from West Texas to the Gulf Coast 
A third line  the 900 000 bpd line being developed by Phillips 66  N PSX   will open later this year that will boost total capacity to flow oil from the region by two thirds 
 There s no way another 2 5 million bpd are waiting to get sent to Corpus Christi  Texas    said Sandy Fielden  an analyst at Morningstar   Clearly  there s going to be too much capacity     There will be buying up of barrels in Midland like it s going out of style  
Rates for most Permian pipelines have ranged between  4 a barrel and  7 a barrel for the past year because of soaring shale production and a lack of pipeline space  Some companies have turned to railcars for transport  which can cost  6 to  8 a barrel 
EPIC halved its spot rate to  2 50 a barrel on a pipeline from the Permian  prior to even beginning to load oil onto the 400 000 bpd line  The rate was  more in line with market conditions   and will let the company achieve volumes  at a level we re happy with   said President Brian Freed 
Around the end of 2019  EPIC plans to flow its crude volumes on a larger  permanent line that can carry around 900 000 bpd 
Plains All American LP  which begins operations on its 670 000 bpd Cactus II pipeline next week  set contract rates between  1 05 and  3 20 a barrel  below what analysts and traders anticipated  It posted spot rates of  4 75 to  5 60 a barrel  but analysts said most of its capacity is under contract 
Plains did not reply to requests for comment 
PERMIAN OVER PIPED
Companies have raced to build the new Permian lines to accommodate the shale boom which has helped the United States become the world s biggest oil producer  overtaking Saudi Arabia and Russia 
Permian oil production is set to reach 4 21 million bpd this month  according to the latest government forecasts  more than double the same month in 2016 
But the basin already has 3 9 million bpd of existing outbound pipeline capacity  according to energy investment bank Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co 
 We see the Permian as over piped   said Matthew Blair  an analyst at Tudor Pickering   Spot rates are going to be pretty cutthroat  with really low tariffs  given all this extra capacity  
As service startup nears  oil priced in Midland  the heart of the Permian  dropped this week to an about  3 50 a barrel discount to Houston prices  the narrowest since March 2018  traders said 
If the low prices remain  existing Permian pipeline operators  Magellan Midstream Partners LP   N MMP  and  Enterprise Products Partners LP   N EPD  may have to choose between lowering tariffs or sacrificing volumes  traders said 
Magellan  which operates two existing long haul pipelines that ship about 700 000 bpd out of the Permian  does not anticipate spot shipments on either line beyond the third quarter  Chief Financial Officer Jeff Holman said on a conference call last week 
 We expect differentials to narrow as additional takeaway capacity out of the Permian comes on line   Holman said  One of the two pipelines charge spot rates ranging from  4 and  5 per barrel  Magellan said 
Spot rates on Enterprise s Midland to ECHO line  which transports 575 000 bpd of crude from Midland to the Houston area  average above  7 a barrel  filings showed  It did not respond to requests for comment 
 Pipelines are going to have to charge lower and lower fees   said John Zanner  an analyst at consultancy RBN Energy   You re going to see them really narrow their margins in order to attract those barrels  ",2019-08-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/new-us-pipelines-poised-to-start-price-war-for-shale-shippers-1950039,1950039

150655,372171,ETN,New Orleans braces for flooding  Trump declares emergency ahead of Storm Barry,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN  and Kathy Finn NEW ORLEANS  Reuters    City officials warned New Orleans residents on Friday to secure their homes  stock up on supplies and prepare to huddle indoors with Tropical Storm Barry poised to make landfall as the first Atlantic hurricane of 2019  Barry s maximum sustained winds were clocked at 65 miles per hour  100 kph  as it churned through the northern Gulf of Mexico toward Louisiana  Meteorologists warned that torrential rains   as much as 2 feet  60 cm  in some places   are likely to unleash severe flooding  While New Orleans authorities refrained from ordering evacuations and advised residents to shelter in place instead  tourism officials reported an exodus of hotel guests checking out early on Friday  Some airlines  including British Airways  have canceled outbound flights from the city through Saturday  Mandatory evacuations were imposed in flood prone coastal areas of two neighboring parishes south of the city  U S  President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for Louisiana  and the region s oil production was scaled back by nearly 60 percent as energy companies evacuated offshore drilling facilities   A performance scheduled for Sunday by the Rolling Stones at the Mercedes Benz Superdome  which served as an emergency shelter during the Hurricane Katrina flood catastrophe of 2005  was postponed until Monday  The impending storm was widely seen as a key test of the fortified flood defenses put in place following Katrina  which inundated much of the city and killed some 1 800 people   Barry is expected to cross the coastline southwest of New Orleans on Saturday morning  It is forecast to reach Category 1 hurricane strength by then  with winds of at least 74 mph  119 kph   the National Weather Service said  DANGEROUS AND LIFE THREATENING The storm s flood potential  rather than its high winds  posed the greatest danger to the low lying metropolitan landscape of New Orleans  a city virtually surrounded on all sides by rising waters   Tropical Storm Barry is a dangerous and life threatening storm   Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott said at a news conference   Major to     record flooding will be possible    Authorities were keeping a particularly watchful eye on the levee system built to contain the lower Mississippi River  which winds through the heart of New Orleans and was already well above flood stage from months of heavy upstream rainfall over the Midwest  A coastal storm surge into the mouth of the Mississippi is expected to push its crest to 19 feet  5 79 m  in New Orleans on Saturday  the highest level since 1950 and dangerously close to the top of the city s levees   The brunt of Barry was expected to skirt the western edge of New Orleans  avoiding a direct hit  But Mayor LaToya Cantrell said 48 hours of heavy downpours could overwhelm pumps designed to purge streets and storm drains of excess water   There is no system in the world that can handle that amount of rainfall in such a short period   Cantrell said on Twitter  New Orleans was already saturated after thunderstorms drenched the city with a foot of rain on Wednesday   If it s worse than the other day  it d be the worst week since Katrina   said musician Robert Harris  61  polishing his trombone while sitting in a folding chair on a sidewalk  FLOODGATES AND LEVEES While street flooding seemed probable  officials from the U S  Army Corps of Engineers insisted that significant breaching of the 20 foot tall levees in New Orleans was unlikely   All levee floodgates were being closed  along with a giant surge barrier erected after Katrina  The chance of overtopping levees seemed greater farther downstream  where the levee walls are lower   The level of Lake Pontchartrain  an estuary on the city s northern flank  rose by 3 feet on Friday  triggering the closure of a flood gate on a canal that breached during Katrina  said Derrick Boese  chief administrator for the local flood control agency   Mandatory evacuation orders were issued for areas of Plaquemines Parish beyond the levees southeast of the city and for low lying communities in Jefferson Parish  to the southwest  New Orleans residents planning to ride out the storm flocked to supermarkets for bottled water  ice  snacks and beer  thronging grocery stores in such numbers that some ran out of shopping carts  Throughout the city  motorists left cars parked on the raised median strips of roadways hoping the extra elevation would protect them from flood damage  City residents were asked to remain indoors after 8 p m  on Friday  Larry Gumpert  the 74 year old owner of a pest control company  said he planned to hunker down at home  cooking and catching up on household chores   If all the predictions come true  we re going to see major street flooding   Gumpert said   The Army Corps has spent time  money and energy trying to fortify the city  This is a good test of what they have accomplished since Katrina  We ll see

150658,372174,ETN,Wall Street Trading Costs to Surge as New Rules Hit Derivatives,news," Bloomberg     Wall Street s heavyweights are prepping their clients for bad news  Some trades are about to get a lot more expensive 
Firms including  Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C     Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   are warning customers to get ready for new rules that require more collateral for certain trades  The regulations take effect for some clients in September  but the snare gets even tighter in 2020  when more than 1 000 hedge funds  asset managers and insurers will get caught for the first time 
The so called uncleared margin rules require banks and their clients to  exchange margin  for derivatives traded directly between participants instead of being cleared through an exchange  Citigroup is sounding one of the loudest alarms about potential fallout  saying in a recent report that  for one model it tested  fees at its foreign exchange prime brokerage got 31 times more expensive if it passed along higher costs 
 It s going to be really tough   said Audrey Blater  a senior analyst at researcher Aite Group   People are dragging their feet and kicking and screaming that they actually have to do something  Up until now  a lot of buy side firms weren t touched by the regulation to the degree that a bank is  so they re not used to doing stuff like this  
The regulations will hit the currency market particularly hard  because some foreign exchange products are rarely  if ever  cleared through an exchange 
In response to the regulations  Citigroup is proposing new fees for its prime brokerage unit    ones that would hit not only clients but also the brokers or banks they trade with  counterparties that until now had escaped such charges 
 All participants should share in these new costs   Citigroup said in its report  Executing brokers  should pay their fair share  
That idea has drawn mixed reviews  Some of Citigroup s competitors say they won t need to raise prices  Others  such as  Societe Generale   PA SOGN  SA s John O Hara  say there s no system in place to begin charging the executing banks  and those firms would pass the fee onto clients anyway 
 As far as charging the executing dealers  I don t think that will get any traction   O Hara  head of prime brokerage and clearing in the Americas at Societe Generale  said in a telephone interview  Still  he acknowledged   the costs of FXPB services are going to increase significantly  
Cost Estimates
Just 20  of buy side firms have begun to examine the impact the new rules will have on their trading costs  according to a June report from Greenwich Associates  Less than 40  of the firms would consider listed options for their currency trades when their firm becomes subject to the new margin rules  the study found 
 The only thing it can do is cause the cost of prime brokerage to me to go up   said Michael O Brien  director of global trading at  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance Corp   I strongly believe that clearing is the primary solution for the uncleared margin rules when it comes to asset managers  There are a lot of complicated things to address  but I think you want to minimize the impact on the portfolio by minimizing the number of trades it impacts  
Transaction fees and operational challenges were among the biggest obstacles to moving to a cleared model  based on responses to the Greenwich Associates study 
 Our analysis suggests these hurdles are diminishing quickly and  in some cases  may be more perceived than real   David  Stryker   NYSE SYK   a principal at Greenwich Associates  said in the June report  which also noted that shifting to listed foreign exchange options could reduce costs by as much as 70  per trade 
September 2020 is the deadline for the fifth and final phase of the new regulations  requiring firms with more than  8 billion in exposure to derivatives to begin socking away more margin  a threshold that will vastly increase the number of hedge funds and asset managers that would have to comply with the rules 
While big banks have long had large special units dedicated to managing their margin  many hedge funds and asset managers have little experience in this area  Smaller buy side firms had at least one win this month  The U S  Commodity Futures Trading Commission ruled that firms below the  50 million margin threshold don t have to undergo the legal documentation process 
 Phase 5 will have a big impact on the market because more of the buy side will come into scope then   said Ilene Froom  a partner in the financial industry group at law firm Reed Smith LLP   The documentation relief from the CFTC will be a big help  ",2019-07-19,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-trading-costs-to-surge-as-new-rules-hit-derivatives-1928500,1928500

150660,372176,ETN,Two top fixed income portfolio managers exit Eaton Vance,news," This July 19 story corrects to say the fund has a negative process pillar rating  not negative overall rating  in the fifth paragraph 
By David Randall and Kate Duguid
NEW YORK  Reuters    Bond fund managers Kathleen Gaffney and Henry Peabody left  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance Corp at the end of June and have been replaced by existing members of the firm s fixed income team  a spokeswoman told Reuters 
Among other duties  the pair managed the  364 million Eaton Vance Multisector Income fund  whose 6 1  annualized return over the last 3 years puts it in the top 8th percentile among the 296 funds in its Morningstar category  Over the last year  however  the fund has returned 3 2   dropping it into the 97th percentile among its peers over that time period 
Peabody told Reuters he has since joined MFS Investment Management  while Gaffney said separately that she is still in the process of determining to which firm she will move 
Eaton Vance said the two left to pursue  other opportunities  and Gaffney and Peabody would not say why they left 
The management shakeup does not affect the fund s rating  Morningstar wrote in a report  The fund currently has a negative process pillar rating due to its concentrated risks 
 While it is possible that there will be changes to the approach under its new management team  there is not enough information to revisit the Process rating at this point   the report said

150687,372203,ETN,Here Is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Eaton Vance  EV  Now,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this investment manager a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Eaton Vance is 6 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 5 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 2  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Eaton Vance is 35 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 5  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Eaton Vance have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Eaton Vance a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Eaton Vance is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-08-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here-is-why-growth-investors-should-buy-eaton-vance-ev-now-200460293,200460293

But a couple of weeks could be noise  Indeed  year to date results reveal that liquidity and low volatility factors are comfortably in the lead

The year to date return for iShares S P 500 Value  IVE  trails  but only modestly  the ETF is up 20 6  this year

Is the discount enough to give value an edge   at a time when the US economy is facing what appears to be an extended period of softer growth  perhaps to the point of threatening a recession 
It s fair to say that skepticism abounds  which is a byproduct of value s long running underperformance vs  growth 
 This recent activity that you ve seen in value over growth hasn t been accompanied with massive participation    Chris Hempstead  an ETF consultant and former head of ETF sales at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn    Sure  there might be some people positioning the way it s suggesting  but I would probably guess that the trend is going to continue  growth is going to be in favor  momentum s going to be in favor and value s going to still lag

Is the discount enough to give value an edge   at a time when the US economy is facing what appears to be an extended period of softer growth  perhaps to the point of threatening a recession 
It s fair to say that skepticism abounds  which is a byproduct of value s long running underperformance vs  growth 
 This recent activity that you ve seen in value over growth hasn t been accompanied with massive participation    Chris Hempstead  an ETF consultant and former head of ETF sales at  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn    Sure  there might be some people positioning the way it s suggesting  but I would probably guess that the trend is going to continue  growth is going to be in favor  momentum s going to be in favor and value s going to still lag

and another mass demonstration in protest against a proposed extradition law that would allow people to be sent to China for trial  as the Chinese ruled city s leader vowed defiance   Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said she would push ahead with the bill despite deep concerns across vast swaths of the Asian financial hub that triggered its biggest political demonstration since its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997   In a rare move  prominent business leaders warned that pushing through the extradition law could undermine investor confidence in Hong Kong and erode its competitive advantages  The extradition bill  which has generated unusually broad opposition at home and abroad  is due for a second round of debate on Wednesday in the city s 70 seat Legislative Council  The legislature is controlled by a pro Beijing majority  An online petition has called for 50 000 people to surround the legislature building at 10 p m   1400 GMT  on Tuesday and remain until Wednesday  Britain handed Hong Kong back to China under a  one country  two systems  formula  with guarantees that its autonomy and freedoms  including an independent justice system  would be protected  But many accuse China of extensive meddling  denying democratic reforms  interfering with local elections and the disappearance of five Hong Kong based booksellers  starting in 2015  who specialized in works critical of Chinese leaders  Sunday s protests plunged Hong Kong into political crisis  just as months of pro democracy  Occupy  demonstrations did in 2014  heaping pressure on Lam s administration and her official backers in Beijing  She warned against any  radical actions   following clashes in the early hours of Monday between some protesters and police after Sunday s otherwise peaceful march   Police erected metal barriers to secure the council building as a small number of protesters started to gather on Tuesday evening despite torrential rain and thunderstorm warnings  Police conducted random ID checks at train stations   Pro democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo urged people to join the rally and encouraged businesses to strike  for a day  or two  or probably for one whole week   Nearly 2 000 mostly small retail shops  including restaurants  grocery  book and coffee shops  have announced plans to strike  according to an online survey  a rare move in the staunchly capitalist economy    Eaton   NYSE ETN  HK Hotel  which is owned by Langham Hospitality Investments and operated by Great Eagle Holdings  said it respected workers   political stances  and would allow them to rally   The student union of several higher education institutions and the Hong Kong Professional Teachers  Union urged people to strike on Wednesday  Nearly 4 000 teachers said

150699,372215,ETN,Yield Hungry Emerging Market Traders Seek Cue from Trump and Xi,news," Bloomberg     Emerging markets are entering a pivotal week as investors look to see whether the U S  and China can find a path toward a trade agreement when their two leaders meet in Japan 
Developing nation currencies and bonds just staged their best weekly performance since 2017 after the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank signaled the prospect of looser monetary policy  Now all eyes turn toward President Donald Trump s meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the June 28 29 summit of Group of 20 nations in Osaka as they try to head off a further escalation in the trade war between the world s two biggest economies 
 With yields across the developed world getting back to ridiculously low levels  it makes emerging market debt assets all the more attractive   said Eric Stein  a Boston based money manager at  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance Corp   an investment management firm that oversees about  470 billion globally   Certainly there are risks and the G 20 is one of them  It s tough to know exactly what is priced in for the meeting but I think the baseline of many market participants is a kick the can down the road kind of agreement  
Risks in the Persian Gulf are also back on investors  radars  with Iran set to breach a cap on its enriched uranium stockpile by Thursday  potentially heightening tensions with the U S  Trump said Saturday he intends to impose additional economic sanctions on Iran Monday  and that military action is  always on the table until we get this solved  
Trade Talks and Fed

The U S  put five more Chinese tech entities on a trade blacklist just days before the Trump Xi summit  after a similar move on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co  last month
Only after both sides experience the increasingly negative effects of the trade war later in the year will they be prepared to make concessions and finally strike a deal  according to ING

Even if Trump and Xi are open to resuming talks   there are many bridges to cross before a deal is struck   ING analysts  including Raoul Leering  wrote in a report   We re confident that a resolution will eventually be reached though  which limits the need for aggressive Fed rate cuts 
Investors will focus on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell s speech at a Council on Foreign Relations event on Tuesday as they seek clues on the likely timing of any rate cut

150723,372239,ETN,3 Reasons Why Eaton Vance  EV  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this investment manager a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth

While the historical EPS growth rate for Eaton Vance is 6 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 4 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 1  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Eaton Vance is 35 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Eaton Vance have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Eaton Vance has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

What s Next for Eaton Vance

150734,372250,ETN,Special Report  As Trump rewrites health rules  Pence sees conservative agenda born again,news,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb and Joseph Tanfani WASHINGTON  Reuters    In a sweeping social policy shift  the Trump administration is seeking to remake health rules at home and abroad for women  gay and transgender people  restricting access to abortion  curtailing support for contraception and narrowing the scope of civil rights in healthcare  The turnaround has its foundations in the quiet  behind the scenes influence of Vice President Mike Pence  who has been driven throughout his political career by his evangelical Christian beliefs to restrict abortion and prioritize the rights of religious conservatives  Pence has been in the spotlight for leading the administration s failed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare  But other changes  affecting health policy domestically and abroad  are moving ahead with far less attention  Under the direction of two secretaries recommended by Pence  the Department of Health and Human Services has moved to slash funds from teen pregnancy prevention programs  curb abortion both in the United States and abroad and strip civil protections for transgender patients  The administration has emphasized abstinence programs  led by appointees who believe contraception harms women  and pushed to cut government funds for Planned Parenthood   a longtime cause for Pence while he was in Congress  Planned Parenthood  a national network of healthcare providers  offers infertility services  contraception and abortions  Public health civil rights offices  marshaled to strengthen LGBT rights under Obama  have been retooled into a new Office of Conscience and Religious Freedom  This month  the office unveiled a final  conscience rule  to strengthen protections for healthcare workers who object to performing abortions and sterilizations or treating gay and transgender patients  And the HHS  along with the State Department   headed by Pence ally Mike Pompeo  also an evangelical Christian   has expanded the campaign beyond U S  borders  Trump appointed officials are seeking to delete language in international documents at the United Nations they contend promotes access to abortion and expands healthcare rights to transgender individuals   There has never been anything like it   Marjorie Dannenfelser  president of the Susan B  Anthony List  an anti abortion group  said of her working relationship with Pence   The policy I believe can t get done without Vice President Pence and his team   A cadre of religious conservatives appointed in the early days of the administration is driving the changes  largely from within HHS  which administers most government health programs  along with the State Department and White House  Many appointees come from religious and conservative groups  some of whom regularly protested outside abortion clinics during the Obama years  In the Trump Pence West Wing   everywhere I turn are colleagues  mentors and friends who have fought in the pro life trenches for decades   Katy Talento  who handled health policy in the White House  told an anti abortion group in Texas  She last week announced plans to leave the administration   I still can t believe they let us all in the complex every day   Emboldened by the movement and by the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court  states including Alabama and Missouri have passed laws in recent weeks that nearly outlaw abortion  spurring nationwide protests  The shift has generated legal challenges  and chunks of the agenda are bottlenecked in the courts  Recently  a federal judge in Washington State blocked new rules meant to cut funding from facilities offering abortion   The campaign has been more successful abroad  Pompeo in March held a rare news conference to say the administration was strengthening an effort to combat abortion globally   We re determined to make sure that we don t allow taxpayers  dollars to get to those places   he said  citing groups performing or referring abortions  and announcing a cut in funds to Latin America  Pompeo s declaration marked an expansion of the Mexico City Policy  which requires foreign non governmental groups that receive U S  health aid not provide  refer or counsel on abortions  Implemented by every Republican administration since 1984  the policy in the past applied to U S  family planning funds  or about  600 million  In one of his first acts as president  Trump signed an order expanding the rule to cover nearly all U S  global health aid  or more than  8 billion  Nationally  this public health battle has often been pushed to the background by the nonstop churn of Trump s tweets and controversies   One of the benefits of Trump s Twitter approach is it creates headlines  and that s what it s intended to do  and underneath those headlines  everyone else in the administration can go about peacefully doing their job   said David McIntosh  president of the conservative Club for Growth and a longtime Pence friend  HHS has  released several very important  significant regulations that changed the nature of Obamacare  of healthcare  with very little coverage in the press   The effort has startled some public health veterans   It s very  very extreme   said Megan Huchko  director of the Center for Global Reproductive Health at Duke University   It seems we re moving backward in pretty profound ways   The vice president declined interview requests for this article  Administration officials say his voice matters  Kellyanne Conway  senior counselor to the president  praised Pence s advocacy on cutting federal support for Planned Parenthood   It means a great deal to the president to hear that from somebody who had been a legislator on Capitol Hill for 12 years  a governor for four  and somebody who like the president is trusted by the small c conservative movement as a full spectrum conservative   Conway said  One senior HHS official told Reuters the agency is correcting the course set by the Obama administration on the government s role in enforcing LGBT rights and whether providers have to perform abortions   Our rights to religious freedom have too long been treated as a second class right compared to others and it s time for that to change   said Roger Severino  director of the agency s Civil Rights Division  THE PENCE EFFECT When Trump secured the GOP nomination in 2016  he had yet to win over skeptical evangelical voters who questioned his varying stances on critical issues  most notably abortion  Trump previously had said he supported a woman s right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy  His selection of Pence as his running mate helped him win over those voters  The Trump Pence ticket ultimately secured 80 percent of white born again and evangelical Christians  In a White House marked by turnover  the amiable Pence has been a quiet presence prodding the administration to align with his faith based agenda  Aides describe him as a man whose effectiveness is rooted in a willingness to shun the limelight and put like minded proteges in crucial jobs   Pence s influence has come from   getting people who have the same worldview as Pence in key positions at things you care about and then trusting them to make decisions   said Paul Winfree  who served as deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under Trump and is now at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank  The vice president s allies and former aides are salted throughout the administration  carrying out significant shifts in federal health insurance programs  One change cheered by the religious right made it easier for employers to not cover contraception  A key Pence ally is Seema Verma  a healthcare consultant who worked with him in Indiana  now administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  Under Verma  the agency has worked to roll back Obamacare s expansion of Medicaid  the insurance program for the poor and disabled that covers more than 70 million Americans  Both HHS secretaries under Trump were pushed by Pence  Tom Price  an ally in Congress who was fired in 2017 for using expensive charter flights for public business  and Alex Azar  who worked as a senior pharmaceutical company executive and lobbyist in Indianapolis while Pence was governor  At a January event  Azar called Pence  my friend and mentor   The agency took on a new religious tone  Price hosted a Bible study on Wednesday mornings for members of Congress and political appointees  a former senior HHS official said  SOLDIER IN ABORTION WARS After being elected to Congress on his third try  in 2000  Pence formed connections to the Washington anti abortion movement  including Dannenfelser  the Susan B  Anthony List president  Dannenfelser had previously served as staff director of the Congressional Pro Life Caucus  She and Conway encouraged Pence to run for president in 2012  though he declined  Three times  he introduced bills to bar HHS from funding Planned Parenthood  His efforts failed  but won him fierce loyalty among anti abortion activists  Elected Indiana governor in 2012  Pence signed a bill that banned the use of fetal tissue in research  a law now being challenged in court  Another bill he signed banned abortions for reasons of the sex  race or disability of the fetus  and required that fetal remains be cremated or buried  This week  the Supreme Court upheld the burial requirement but left in place a lower court ruling that blocked the abortion ban  In the Trump White House  Pence serves as a chief advocate for religious conservatives  making sure they have a voice in policy making  While he does not always have a hand in specific policies  Pence s ardent support has empowered the administration s religious conservatives to action  Other times  he gets directly involved  During the Republican campaign to repeal Obamacare  Dannenfelser said she attended a meeting in Pence s office  helping the vice president and staff craft language to add anti abortion provisions to the failed bill  Another focus has been the Mexico City Policy involving U S  aid to non government groups   It s unfortunate enough that we continue to fund Planned Parenthood here in the U S   we don t need to export a pro abortion ideology overseas   Pence said at a House hearing in 2007  Now  under the expanded Mexico City rule Pence advocated  some groups have refused U S  funding because abortion is part of their mission  One result  shuttered clinics  GLOBAL FALLOUT In Kenya  services are already being reduced  said Jedidah Maina  director of the Trust for Indigenous Culture and Health  which offers programs on sexual and reproductive health and operates a health services hotline  One partner organization no longer provides free healthcare for the impoverished  and another was forced to reduce HIV services  she said  In Peru  the reproductive rights advocacy group PromSex said it was unable to apply for a grant to combat human trafficking from the U S  Agency for International Development because it fights for access to abortion  In a November 2017 email obtained by Reuters  a USAID contracting officer said if the group  were carrying out activities or planning to carry out any activity related to family planning methods  it could not commit itself with the Government of the United States   Despite the changes  a USAID spokesperson said  the U S  remains  the largest donor  of family planning aid in the world  At the United Nations and World Health Organization  U S  representatives appointed under Trump Pence have worked to pull references to  gender  and  sexual and reproductive health  from international rights documents  In April  the United States threatened to veto a U N  resolution aimed at combating rape as a weapon of war because it would have included language providing victims with sexual and reproductive healthcare  The phrase  sexual and reproductive health  was cut from the final resolution  A spokesman for the United Nations Population Fund said the cut was  regrettable   adding that  denying survivors access to such services is a human rights violation that can have dire consequences   One document obtained by Reuters outlined talking points for U S  officials before a WHO summit  In it  political appointees wanted to make clear the United States  does not support abortion in our reproductive health assistance  nor do we recognize abortion as a method of family planning   In a statement  HHS said the phrase  sexual and reproductive health  has  unfortunately evolved  to include abortion   The United States under President Trump s leadership unequivocally supports the empowerment of women and girls  including health promotion for women and girls across the lifespan   it said  Emails and memos from U S  officials at the U N  obtained by Reuters show the influence of the Center for Family and Human Rights  or C Fam  a private U S  research institute formed to affect policy at the U N  to align with conservative Catholic views  In a fundraising pitch  C Fam s president  Austin Ruse  said  sexual orientation and gender identity is code for odious sexual behavior and gender lunacy   Starting in 2017  when the center had a seat on the U S  delegation to a U N  conference on women s rights  administration officials have worked to accommodate its positions  the documents show   Thank you for having sent proposed changes  to a draft document of the Commission on the Status of Women  an aide to then U N  Ambassador Nikki Haley wrote C Fam in 2018   We reviewed them all carefully and included many  many of them in our initial comments   In 2017  during negotiations over a document on violence against women  another C Fam official wrote an email flagging language he thought would help establish a right to abortion for migrants   This is just tragic and speaks volumes about the culture we are projecting to the rest of the world   wrote Stefano Gennarini  the group s vice president for legal affairs   Oh dear   replied a State Department official   I do hope we can find a way to rectify this language   The phrase  alluding to  reproductive rights   did not make it into the final version  Gennarini said the administration  while not granting all his group s requests  has been true to its promises in promoting anti abortion policies   Simply put  for U N  language related to abortion and used to promote abortion  this administration has certainly taken the strongest position that any Republican administration has ever taken   he said  TITLE X BATTLE Last year  Pence made a forceful argument directly to Trump to rewrite the rules regarding Title X  the U S  federal program dedicated to affordable birth control and other reproductive healthcare  to cut out abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood  administration sources said  The new version of Title X released in February would begin to accomplish Pence s goal  making it clear the program barred the use of funds to  perform  promote  refer for  or support abortion as a method of family planning   Such language would limit Planned Parenthood operations and prevent doctors from discussing abortion with patients  A federal court blocked the rule  Planned Parenthood still received Title X money this year  though cut from about  28 million to  16 million  And HHS took a new step  awarding up to  5 1 million to Obria  a network of medical clinics in southern California funded in large part by Catholic groups that describes itself as  led by God  and does not offer abortions  Obria in May sued HHS on religious freedom grounds  saying it shouldn t have to participate in abortions to spend the grant money   Many women want the opportunity to visit a professional  comprehensive health care facility   not an abortion clinic   for their health care needs   Kathleen  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Bravo  founder and CEO  is quoted saying on the group s website   Today HHS gave women that choice   Pro  and anti abortion groups say the grant marks a noteworthy shift   It s very clear from how quickly we were able to hit the ground running that the vice president certainly had an influential role   said Kristan Hawkins  president of Students for Life of America  who regularly meets with Pence   One example is opening the door to life affirming pregnancy centers and businesses through federal grant programs like Title X   HHS Secretary Azar gave political appointees more power over grants  Appointees changed the points system for evaluating applicants  giving less emphasis to  adequacy of the applicant s facilities and staff   while boosting those who promoted  natural family planning  and abstinence  Christine Dehlendorf  director of the Person Centered Reproductive Health Program at the University of California  San Francisco  said HHS canceled two grants for ongoing research into contraception  One was restored through litigation  Dehlendorf said she lost about  800 000 in funding for a study of how well medical providers meet women s contraception preferences  which included natural family planning methods favored by some conservatives  There was  no reason to eliminate it other than a lack of a general desire to meet women s reproductive health needs   Dehlendorf said  A day after creating the new Conscience and Religious Freedom division last year  HHS proposed a new rule that would allow health workers to deny care based on religious or moral objections  The final rule was put in place this month  and applies to foreign groups that receive U S  funding  HHS also proposed a rule  not yet final  to strip  gender identity  from the non discrimination protections in the Affordable Care Act  the agency said it cannot enforce those protections because of court decisions  At the Office of Personnel Management  the government s HR office  the website was changed last year to remove references to transgender people in a section advising managers to avoid discrimination   They clearly say that they don t think transgender people have any protections in law   said Gillian Branstetter  of the National Center for Transgender Equality  In a May commencement speech at Liberty University  a Virginia evangelical institution  Pence depicted Christians as under siege from the  secular left    Some of the loudest voices for tolerance today have little tolerance for traditional Christian beliefs   he told the graduates   You re going to be asked to bow down to the idols of popular culture    Decide here and now that you re going to stand firm

150765,372281,ETN,Sweet seats and candy canes  Inside Fiat Chrysler s Toledo turnaround,news,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman TOLEDO  Ohio  Reuters    Lots of workplaces have a hot seat  At the Jeep assembly plant in Toledo  Ohio  there is a  sweet seat   In the production line where Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicles are made at the rate of about one a minute  a panel must be screwed into the bottom of the vehicle  It used to be back breaking work for two union members to carry the panel and screw it on as the vehicle moved down the line   Occasionally  they would miss screws  Now two workers sit comfortably on adjacent chairs that follow the vehicle  Lasers point out where the screws go  reducing errors   What is remarkable about the so called  sweet seat  at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV s Toledo plant is that like many other innovations here  it originated with United Auto Workers union members on the factory floor   Production workers here create proposals to simplify tasks that are  too heavy or too hard   said millwright Greg Harman  who is on a team of 10 UAW workers that implements those ideas  A handful of automakers have adopted aspects of a similar system  pioneered by Japan s Toyota Motor Corp   The uncommon level of union collaboration with Fiat Chrysler  FCA  management in Toledo offers a road map for union negotiations this summer with Detroit s Big 3  FCA  General Motors Co  NYSE GM  and Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co   According to officials at the automakers  their key focus in this year s contract talks will be on productivity and profitability in the face of an anticipated downturn in vehicle sales and non unionized competition from the likes of Toyota  Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG  That clashes with union demands to maintain healthcare benefits and boost job security  and comes on the heels of GM s warning that it could shutter a car factory in Lordstown  Ohio  along with three other UAW represented plants  GM S move drew harsh criticism from President Donald Trump  and prompted the UAW s new president to bulk up the strike fund   serving notice the union is not afraid of a fight over jobs  At a time when national UAW membership fell 8 percent in 2018 after rising for nine consecutive years  and has failed to organize a single U S  assembly plant owned by a European or Asian automaker  FCA s Toledo plant has more than tripled its workforce to 5 700 workers since 2009  For a graphic  click  The biggest reason  Americans  love with the Wrangler and other high margin SUVs  The Wrangler became so hot that FCA started running the plant virtually round the clock  So UAW Local 12  which represents workers at the Toledo plant  pushed for a flexible system under which workers could choose to work between four and seven days per week   a first for any FCA plant   Temporary workers fill in the gaps  and Local 12 sought more protections for those workers  including providing a clear path to full time employment status   Our members went way  way  way beyond the call of duty to provide what the company s needs were   said Mark Epley  the plant s union chairman   It s a competitive market out there and we know that any plant can be taken away at any time   Thanks largely to its success at FCA  UAW Local 12 has hit a 40 year high in membership through organizing workers at many other companies in the area  including a Dana Inc plant where workers make Wrangler axles  SANTA ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE  Success at Toledo took years to build  A decade ago  when the former Chrysler Corp was going through its government funded bankruptcy  Toledo had a reputation as the automaker s worst run plant   As Italian automaker Fiat S p A took control of the Chrysler  then Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne turned to Fiat executive Mauro Pino with a challenge  which legacy U S  Chrysler plant should they use as a proving ground for what Fiat called  World Class Manufacturing   a version of Toyota s lean production strategy but adapted to the Italian automaker s culture  Pino chose Toledo with the idea of turning the worst performing plant into the best  He had two years to prove he could turn the plant around  he told Reuters in an interview outside Cleveland  where he now runs an  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Corp aircraft parts plant  Pino found a workforce of around 1 700 people  demoralized by Chrysler s bankruptcy  The plant produced just over 140 000 vehicles in 2009   He began working to win the workers  trust  He dressed as Santa Claus before Christmas 2010 and handed out candy canes to workers on the line  greeting each by name  workers at the plant recall   Pino also pushed for more productivity but did so by asking workers how they would redesign their own cumbersome jobs       Usually you need to convince people to change  but when they saw what we were doing they started coming to us   he said    The new system gave everyone a voice   said Cheryl Reash  a 36 year worker at the plant   Tracy Seymour  also at the plant nearly 36 years  said the team of 10 millwrights   a team started by Pino   came up with a system for parts kits that eliminated the need for vast amounts of inventory on the line  That made it possible for workers to build 10 different engine types without having to bend over  lift heavy objects or walk off the line in search of parts   I wouldn t run without their equipment   Seymour said   It would be impossible   RUNNING HOT Over time  workers and managers at Toledo worked to unplug bottlenecks up and down the assembly line    Why we succeed and exceed is that union and management came together   Seymour said  Soaring customer demand for sport utility vehicles also helped the Toledo plant  As workers cranked out around 500 000 Wrangler and Jeep Cherokee SUVs annually from 2014 to 2016  the plant s two production lines began running at well over 100 percent capacity  according to data from AutoForecast Solutions  This level of capacity utilization is rare in the industry  Still  Fiat Chrysler could not keep up with demand in both the United States and in the 105 countries where the Toledo made Wrangler is sold  To ease the crunch  the company proposed moving the Cherokee to another factory so Toledo could make more Wranglers  In return  Local 12 was promised another new product  Baumhower said the local accepted the move based on that promise  The plant is now ramping up production of the Gladiator pickup truck  which shares many parts with the Wrangler and is getting glowing reviews in the automotive media  But while FCA s Toledo success shows what can happen when a Detroit automaker and its union work together  it also shows how a strong local can also punch back  In February 2018  for instance  Local 12 publicly protested an FCA plan to replace 88 UAW represented truck drivers with contractors  forcing the company to back down  
 We re good at getting along if you want to get along   said Bruce Baumhower  who has been president of Local 12 for 26 years   And we can fight all day if you want to pick a fight  ",2019-04-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sweet-seats-and-candy-canes-inside-fiat-chryslers-toledo-turnaround-1829670,1829670

150804,372320,ETN,Eaton Vance  EV  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance in Focus
Eaton Vance  EV  is headquartered in Boston  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 24 08  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 35 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 21   In comparison  the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield is 2 76   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 88  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 40 is up 9 4  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Eaton Vance has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 76   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Eaton Vance s current payout ratio is 43   meaning it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for EV for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 34 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 4 05  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that EV is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eaton-vance-ev-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200439264,200439264
150805,372321,ETN,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn t Overlook Eaton Vance  EV ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this investment manager is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Eaton Vance is 6 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 3 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 1  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Eaton Vance is 35 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 3  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Eaton Vance  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 2  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Eaton Vance has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

150850,372366,ETN,What Makes Eaton  ETN  A New Buy Stock,opinion,"Eaton  NYSE ETN  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Eaton basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Eaton imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Eaton
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this power management company is expected to earn  5 89 per share  which is a change of 9 3  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Eaton  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 5  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Eaton to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-06-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-makes-eaton-etn-a-new-buy-stock-200430839,200430839
150851,372367,ETN,Can Value Investors Consider Eaton Vance  EV  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance Corporation   NYSE EV   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Eaton Vance has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 51  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 88  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Eaton Vance s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 87 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 12  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Eaton Vance has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 37  which is higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Eaton Vance has a P S ratio of about 2 79  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Eaton Vance currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Eaton Vance a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Eaton Vance might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F  This gives EV a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been solid at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and none down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 6 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has jumped by 5 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Eaton Vance Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat bullish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEaton Vance is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 33  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that

150853,372369,ETN,This Is Why Eaton Vance  EV  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance in Focus
Eaton Vance  EV  is headquartered in Boston  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 18 45  since the start of the year  The investment manager is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 35 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 36   This compares to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 82  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 92  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 40 is up 9 4  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Eaton Vance has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 8 76   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Eaton Vance s current payout ratio is 43   meaning it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for EV for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 34 per share  with earnings expected to increase 4 05  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that EV is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-06-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-eaton-vance-ev-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200434926,200434926
150854,372370,ETN,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Eaton Vance  EV  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this investment manager a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Eaton Vance is 6 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 3 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 9  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Eaton Vance is 35 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11 3  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Eaton Vance have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Eaton Vance has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

Another notable valuation metric for EV is its P B ratio of 4 41  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  HRGLY has a P B of 21 02 
These metrics  and several others  help EV earn a Value grade of A  while HRGLY has been given a Value grade of F 
EV stands above HRGLY thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that EV is the superior value option right now ",2019-06-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ev-vs-hrgly-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200435248,200435248

150858,372374,ETN,Fed policymakers say U S  rate hikes can wait  for now,news,"By Jonathan Spicer and Howard Schneider RIVERWOODS  Ill  CHATTANOOGA  Tenn   Reuters    U S  Federal Reserve policymakers say they will wait to deliver more interest rate hikes until they have a better handle on whether slowing global growth and financial market volatility will undercut an otherwise solid U S  economic outlook  Presidents of four of the 12 Fed regional banks on Wednesday said they wanted greater clarity on the state of the economy before extending the central bank s rate hike campaign any further  Minutes of the Fed s December meeting  released on Wednesday  showed fellow policymakers widely shared that view  seeing risks from markets and abroad as making  the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier    The message underscores a sense that the Fed is nearing the end of its rate hike cycle  It also synchs broadly with the view of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell  who last week eased market concerns that the Fed was ignoring signs of an economic slowdown and assured markets he would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year  Stocks had suffered their worst December performance since the Great Depression  Other signs of tightening financial conditions had surfaced as well  including a sharp slowdown in issuance of corporate bonds    I think they have certainly changed their tune   said Eric Stein  a portfolio manager for  Eaton   NYSE ETN  Vance who attended Rosengren s talk   If financial conditions continue to ease from here  as they have to start the year  and growth stays strong  I think they will still look to hike  but for now a wait and see approach is prudent    Stocks extended a fourth straight day of gains on Wednesday as policymakers spoke and the minutes were released  partially reversing the precipitous drop in the fourth quarter of 2018  UNCERTAINTY PROMPTS POLICYMAKER CAUTION Three of the four policymakers who spoke Wednesday    Charles Evans of Chicago  Eric Rosengren of Boston  and James Bullard of St  Louis    are voting members this year on the Federal Open Market Committee  the bank s 10 member policy setting panel   While Bullard has long opposed the Fed s rate hikes  the caution from Evans and Rosengren marked a shift in their views  Evans  who has been among the most vocal backers of gradually tightening U S  monetary policy  told reporters Wednesday he still believes the Fed will need to deliver three more rate hikes this year   But  in his first public comments since November  he nodded to an array of  tough to read  factors highlighted by the recent market selloff  With inflation showing no signs of breaking above the Fed s 2 percent target  he said   we have good capacity to wait and carefully take stock of the incoming data and other developments    Rosengren similarly said he expects solid growth this year and said he suspects financial markets are  unduly pessimistic   and said in a Bloomberg TV interview he thinks the Fed will need to raise rates twice this year   But in a break from speeches last year  when he emphasized the risks of allowing unemployment to stay below sustainable levels for too long  Rosengren on Wednesday highlighted potential threats to growth  He said he was taking on board the cautionary signals from markets  including rising bets on rate cuts    There should be no particular bias toward raising or lowering rates until the data more clearly indicate the path for domestic and international economic growth   Rosengren told the Boston Economic Club   I believe we can wait for greater clarity before adjusting policy    CALL FOR PATIENCE The Fed s own forecasts  released after the central bank s fourth 2018 rate hike in December  called for two more rate hikes this year  Traders disagree  Short term U S  interest rate futures are now pricing in less than a one in four chance of a rate hike this year  and about a one in four chance of a rate cut by next January  The minutes of the Fed s December meeting released Wednesday provided a more nuanced view of the policy outlook  While the voting members unanimously backed the December rate hike  they judged a  relatively limited amount of additional tightening likely would be appropriate   A few of the seven non voting members of the panel opposed the rate increase   And  in a strong indication the Fed may pause what has been a steady quarterly diet of rate increases  many of the entire group of 17 thought the Fed  could afford to be patient about further policy firming   the minutes showed  December s rate increase marked the ninth increase of a quarter percentage point since December 2015  when the Fed began lifting interest rates from near zero  where they had been since the financial crisis in 2008  St Louis Fed s Bullard  who has long been critical of the Fed s rate increases  told the Wall Street Journal that while the Fed had  a good level of the policy rate today   there was no rush to push them higher   The fourth president to speak Wednesday  Raphael Bostic of Atlanta  said earlier this week that the Fed was likely to need at most a single rate increase this year   On Wednesday he said his view was driven by conversations with business executives  who say they have become more defensive in preparing for slower growth by paying down debt and holding off on new plans   
Those conversations  are not consistent with the business sector ramping up   Bostic told the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce  Bostic  who backed all four rate hikes in 2018 as an FOMC voter  does not have a policy vote on the panel this year ",2019-01-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/more-fed-officials-say-caution-is-needed-before-more-rate-hikes-1742363,1742363
150859,372375,ETN,U S  oil export boom sparks a battle to build Texas ports,news,"By Collin  Eaton   NYSE ETN  CORPUS CHRISTI  TEXAS  Reuters    Booming U S  oil exports have set off a scramble to build Gulf Coast ports to handle more than 3 million barrels per day in new supplies expected over the next five years  Of seven proposed oil export projects  nowhere is the opportunity greater or the competition more fierce than in Corpus Christi  Texas  where three firms are vying to open the state s first deepwater port  Commodities trader Trafigura  TRAFGF UL  has taken an early lead with a planned offshore facility that has an easier path to regulatory approval and faces fewer objections from environmentalists   Its chief competitor   a partnership of investor  Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG  and the Port of Corpus Christi to build an onshore port   has responded by petitioning regulators to kill Trafigura s project  Port lobbyists have cited past criminal allegations involving the firm in other countries and potentially  catastrophic  environmental impacts  Rising demand for new ports follows a 2015 decision by the U S  Congress to lift a 40 year ban on crude exports after advances in drilling techniques sparked a rapid rise in domestic shale production   especially in Texas  The United States had been the world s top oil buyer for decades  and its port infrastructure was built to import rather than export  Now  surging exports threaten to overwhelm existing ports as U S  production is projected to hit 12 million barrels per day  bpd  this year  up from 9 35 million in 2017  U S  crude producers send more shale oil to the world       We ve got a wave of oil headed toward the coast   said Jeremiah Ashcroft III  chief executive of Lone Star Ports LLC  the Carlyle backed company formed to develop its Corpus Christi project  Only one U S  facility  the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port  can fully load supertankers capable of carrying 2 million barrels  The Corpus Christi port   the closest to the most prolific shale fields in Texas   exports less than 1 million bpd  and its harbor is too shallow to fully load supertankers  The market ultimately may support more than one new deepwater port  but the first firm to build near Corpus Christi will have the best shot at cutting long term deals with producers expected to ship an estimated 2 1 million bpd to the region through new pipelines set to open this year   Right now  there s only enough room for one project   Ashcroft said  Carlyle plans a  1 billion port to handle 1 4 million bpd  Trafigura  which has not disclosed its planned investment in the port  would handle much less  at 500 000 bpd  But Trafigura s operation would siphon off revenue from the Port of Corpus Christi and Carlyle s project because Trafigura would serve shippers offshore  before they reach the harbor  Carlyle declined to make an executive available for an interview and referred questions to Lone Star  Trafigura said in a statement that its port would leave room for other projects because it would handle only a portion of the expected new oil flows  A third competitor  pipeline operator Magellan Midstream Partners LP  plans an export terminal on the Corpus Christi harbor  near Carlyle s proposed site   But Magellan faces a roadblock because port officials last year agreed to work exclusively with Carlyle  Magellan said in a statement that it has not decided whether to build the project  Companies including  Kinder Morgan  Inc  NYSE KMI   JupiterMLP and Tallgrass Energy have also proposed offshore ports along the Gulf Coast   BRAZIL CHARGES  Carlyle said last October that it could open its facility by late 2020  But that assumes its plan for dredging to accommodate supertankers will not require a full environmental review  which is sought by opponents and could take two years   As Carlyle and the Port have tried to navigate those obstacles  port lobbyists have petitioned regulators to halt Trafigura s project  In an August letter  the port s law firm called on the U S  Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration to reject Trafigura s application  citing a  criminal history   The letter from Baker Wotring LLP pointed to the trader s 2006 guilty plea for selling a U S  company oil from Iraq that Trafigura falsely claimed had been authorized under a United Nations humanitarian aid program  U S  companies at the time were barred by government sanctions from buying Iraqi oil except through the program  After the regulators declined the port s request  its law firm in December raised bribery allegations brought earlier that month by Brazilian prosecutors against two former Trafigura executives  The firm asked regulators to halt Trafigura s work until the allegations were  fully investigated    Trafigura said in a statement that its management had no knowledge of any improper payments made to employees of Brazil s state run oil firm Petrobras  Trafigura did not comment on the port law firm citing its guilty plea involving Iraq oil sales  Last month  five Corpus Christi area lawmakers asked Texas Governor Greg Abbott to veto Trafigura s application on environmental grounds  citing a risk of  catastrophic crude oil spills  and  excessive air emissions    Federal rules require state governors to sign off on offshore ports  Abbott has made no decision  a spokesman said  Lone Star s Ashcroft said onshore terminals are safer than offshore projects because oil spills are more easily cleaned up in harbors than in open water  Trafigura said it chose to go offshore to ensure supertankers can safely and efficiently load cargoes and that its application will be reviewed by more than 30 government agencies  BATTLE FATIGUE Carlyle is essential to building the Port of Corpus Christi s crude export business  Port officials started pursuing federal approval to dredge its harbor 28 years ago  but Congress only recently approved  59 million  a fraction of what s needed   We don t have 28 years  we have two   said Sean Strawbridge  chief executive of the Port of Corpus Christi Authority  referring to its timeline for readying the port for new oil flows  Port officials last year sought to kickstart the dredging by issuing  217 million in bonds  That money will allow it to start dredging to a 54 foot draft   not deep enough for supertankers  If Trafigura s port wins approval  it could take business from the Port of Corpus Christi  Port revenues could fall by about 12 percent  estimated investment researcher Morningstar Inc   a loss that could hurt its efforts to finance dredging not covered by the government or Carlyle  In October  Carlyle agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to cover the dredging needed to get achieve a 75 foot draft in the outer harbor to accommodate supertankers   ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER  Environmentalists favor offshore ports over what they consider the harmful impact of dredging harbors  The newly formed Port Aransas Conservancy in south Texas has argued Carlyle s plan would endanger sea turtle nesting areas  dump silt onto nearby islands  and threaten shellfish that reach estuaries through the ship channel   Trafigura has countered environmental concerns about its offshore operation by proposing to tunnel under sand dunes and wetlands to install a pipeline instead of digging a trench through environmentally sensitive areas   Sea turtles are always an issue with dredging  because it brings in salt water  said Jayson Hudson  a regulatory supervisor at the U S  Army Corp of Engineers  which oversees permitting for Carlyle s project  He called Trafigura s horizontal drilling plan a  good option for avoiding permanent impacts   Dredging the harbor  by contrast  would have wide ranging impacts  said John Donovan  president of the Port Aransas Conservancy

What s Next for Eaton Vance 
While Eaton Vance has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions

150894,372410,ETN,Why Eaton Vance  EV  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance in Focus
Headquartered in Boston  Eaton Vance  EV  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 14 84  so far this year  The investment manager is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 35 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 47   This compares to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 95  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 40 is up 9 4  from last year  Eaton Vance has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 8 76   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Eaton Vance s payout ratio is 44   which means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for EV for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 22 per share  with earnings expected to increase 0 31  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  EV is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-eaton-vance-ev-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200424370,200424370
150895,372411,ETN,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Eaton Vance  EV ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this investment manager a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Eaton Vance is 5 7   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 3 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 3  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Eaton Vance is 35 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 4 9  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Eaton Vance have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Eaton Vance a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this investment manager a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Eaton Vance is 6 9   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 3 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 9  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Eaton Vance is 35 2   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 11  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 3  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Eaton Vance have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5 7  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Eaton Vance has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Eaton Vance is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2019-06-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eaton-vance-ev-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why-200430083,200430083

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Hargreaves Lansdown plc has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that EV likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than HRGLY has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
EV currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 33  while HRGLY has a forward P E of 44 04  We also note that EV has a PEG ratio of 2 32  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  HRGLY currently has a PEG ratio of 3 64 
Another notable valuation metric for EV is its P B ratio of 4 29  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  HRGLY has a P B of 25 45 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to EV s Value grade of A and HRGLY s Value grade of D 
EV has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than HRGLY  so it seems like value investors will conclude that EV is the superior option right now ",2019-06-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ev-or-hrgly-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200430511,200430511

150902,372418,ETN,Brexiteers Bet the U K  Can Defy Gravity in Post Divorce Trade,news," Bloomberg     The U K  s hardline Brexit backers are making their move  If they get their way on the U K  s new trade arrangements  they ll face a test of gravity 
Many of those plotting to oust Prime Minister Theresa May also favor reverting to basic World Trade Organization rules    thereby creating new barriers with Europe    arguing that it would supercharge economic activity with other  faster growing countries further afield  That s at odds with the theory of trade gravity  which states that the level of commerce between two countries is in proportion to their size and proximity 
The idea is that a twofold increase in the distance between countries leads to a corresponding decline in trade volume by half  According to research by the London School of Economics  it helps explain why the U K  has far greater trade with Germany than Canada    a nation with which it shares more historical and cultural links 
It s also the reason    along with its current membership in the single market that aims to remove all barriers    why the U K  sent 236 billion pounds   300 billion  of total exports to the EU in 2016  That compares with sales of 100 billion pounds to the U S   an economy of similar size to the combined countries of the bloc 
When it comes to the new relationship  trade gravity is a key dividing ground between those economists who predict it will be difficult for Britain to replace its commerce with the EU with other  faster growing markets after Brexit  and the smaller group who espouse the benefits of a clean break 
Earlier this year  pro Brexit advocates Jacob Rees Mogg and Boris Johnson    the most prominent critics of May s plans    presented research from the anti EU Economists for Free Trade which dismissed the gravity model and argued that the risks had been overstated  In a series of tweets on Monday  U K  lawmaker John Redwood returned to the theme  pointing out that non EU trade had been growing at a faster rate than within the bloc 
The EU currently accounts for a just under half the U K s trade  and research from Bloomberg Economics    using a gravity model    showed that striking deals with the U S   India  China  Australia and New Zealand won t be enough to compensate for the economic losses from leaving the world s largest single market 
The gravity theory extends to trade in services as well as goods  research from Jonathan  Eaton   NYSE ETN  and Samuel Kortum  joint recipients of the 2018 Onassis Prize in International Trade  showed in September  That has particular implications for the U K   where services make up about 80 percent of the economy 
Given that Europe is both big and close  most economists would argue that the U K  will never get a better Brexit trade deal than the one it already has as an EU member 
The idea of trade gravity  is just a statement of fact   said Grant Lewis  an economist at Daiwa Capital Markets and a former Treasury official   The only true free trade agreement is that within the EU  where you have no regulatory barriers and no trade barriers    that doesn t exist anywhere else  ",2018-11-15,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/brexiteers-bet-the-uk-can-defy-gravity-in-postdivorce-trade-1690852,1690852

150937,372453,ETN,Eaton  ETN  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Eaton  NYSE ETN  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 25 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 6  
Revenues are expected to be  5 40 billion  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eaton 
For Eaton  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 21  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eaton will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eaton would post earnings of  1 43 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 46  delivering a surprise of  2 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Eaton doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eaton-etn-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200409508,200409508

150941,372457,ETN,LM Or EV  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Financial   Investment Management sector have probably already heard of Legg Mason  LM  and Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  both Legg Mason and Eaton Vance are sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
LM currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 08  while EV has a forward P E of 12 55  We also note that LM has a PEG ratio of 0 75  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  EV currently has a PEG ratio of 1 64 
Another notable valuation metric for LM is its P B ratio of 0 80  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  EV has a P B of 4 31 
Based on these metrics and many more  LM holds a Value grade of A  while EV has a Value grade of C 
Both LM and EV are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that LM is the superior value option right now ",2019-05-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lm-or-ev-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200420752,200420752
150942,372458,ETN,Near Term View For Manufacturing Electronics Industry Bleak,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies that produce various electronic goods like battery charges  battery accessories  outdoor cabinet enclosures  power transmission products  electrical motion controls  water management products and motive power devices  These businesses also offer customer support and after market services to end users These products and services are offered in various end markets like robotics  semiconductor  defense  aerospace  medical equipment and satellite communications Here are the industry s three major themes  We believe U S  manufacturing companies have been gaining from the government s emphasis on infrastructure development and technological advancement in manufacturing processes  Also  the corporate tax overhaul has created unused corpus that can be used by companies for funding growth projects  In addition to these  the industry is witnessing a surge in e commerce business  which has opened up opportunities for the companies  Healthy operating conditions in the manufacturing arena are a boon as well  U S  manufacturing companies are currently dealing with a full blown trade war between the United States and China  Notably  the White House and Beijing have slapped tariffs on goods valuing billions of dollars so far  resulting in tighter trade conditions  We notice that these duties are resulting in material cost inflation and dragging down margins of many companies manufacturing electronic products  A few manufacturers are defying inflation with selling price adjustments  Nonetheless  these changes are making exports expensive and denting overseas revenues of these businesses  Also  a stronger U S  dollar is currently weighing on the overseas trading arms of these companies  Efforts to keep pace with the rising demand for technologically advanced products are prompting manufacturing companies to invest in innovation  Though such initiatives help in tapping demand from existing and new customers  they often make the players more leveraged  exerting extra burden on margins  Shortage of skilled workforce and high freight costs in the industry as well as dimmed growth prospects of the global economy add to the woes  Moreover  the International Monetary Fund has lowered its growth projection for the global economy by 20 basis points  bps  for 2019  The U S  economy is now projected to grow 2 3  in 2019  down 20 bps from the previous expectation  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Manufacturing Electronics industry is a 17 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  206  which places it in the bottom 20  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates cloudy near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of disappointing earnings prospects for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimates for the current year have moved roughly 14 5  down Before we present a few manufacturing electronics stocks that reflect solid earnings growth prospects  let s take a look at the industry s stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Underperforms S P 500   SectorThe Manufacturing   Electronics industry has underperformed the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year While the stocks in this industry have collectively declined 13 6   the S P 500 registered growth of 10 8  and the Industrial Products sector fell just 4 9                                            One Year Price PerformanceIndustry s Current ValuationEV EBITDA ratio is one of the commonly used metrics for valuing manufacturing stocks The industry s forward 12 month EV EBITDA ratio is 14 74  This clearly shows that the industry is trading above the S P 500 s forward 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 12 15 and the sector s 14 31 Over the past five years  the industry has traded at the highest level of 25 01x forward 12 month EV EBITDA and the lowest level of 9 81x  The median level  over the same period  was 12 57x               Manufacturing   Electronics  Valuation Versus Sector                 Manufacturing   Electronics  Valuation Versus S P 500Bottom LineDemand arising from technological advancements in manufacturing processes is a boon for the industry  while tariffs  inflation  forex woes  high labor and huge freight charges are concerning factors for the players in the manufacturing electronics industry We believe that the industry might not be able to tide over the prevailing issues in the near term  Nonetheless  investors might prefer buying or holding some stocks in their portfolio that have bright earnings growth prospects Here we discuss in brief four

150972,372488,ETN,3 Funds To Buy As Fears Of Recession Rise ,opinion,"Recession fears have been looming large lately amid Fed s extremely dovish stance and slowing global economic growth  A reliable indicator of recession also flashed red last week  adding to investors  worries 
Although investors regained some optimism over resumed U S  China trade negotiations  they could not shed recession fears entirely  Therefore  at present  it s prudent to invest in funds that grow on the back of unfailing demand 
Treasury Yield Curve Inversion
A closely watched measure  the yield curve inverted for a brief while on Mar 22  igniting fears of a possible recession  The yield on the 10 year Treasury note hit a 15 month low of 2 44  against the 3 month Treasury note  which closed at 2 46   While the latter has remained constant since then  the former edged down to 2 43  on Mar 25 and 2 41  on Mar 26 
This is the first time that the 10 year Treasury note has dropped below the 3 month Treasury note since mid 2007  A yield curve inversion has been an indicator of every U S  recession since 1955 with just one exception  per the Federal Reserve of San Francisco 
A yield curve maps the path of returns provided by government bonds of same quality but of different maturity periods until the principal amount has been paid  A yield curve inversion occurs when returns on shorter duration securities are higher than those of longer duration ones 
This means that investors are willing to pay a premium for long term bonds  This implies that they are taking a dim view of the economy in the short term  
Global Economic Slowdown  Fed s New Found Dovishness
But the inverted yield curve isn t the only thing worrying U S  investors  Contraction in Germany s manufacturing sector for the third consecutive month in March indicated slowing growth in the Eurozone 
Germany s federal statistics office data in February showed that the European country may have narrowly escaped a recession in the fourth quarter  with the economy growing 0 0  from third quarter 2018  This data comes amid rising concerns over global economic slowdown 
In addition  Federal Reserve indicated last week that it wasn t planning on further interest rate hikes  currently in a range of 2 25  2 5   this year and will conclude the process of reducing its balance sheet in six months  The central bank s overly accommodative stance could be an indication that it is preparing for an imminent economic slowdown

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  Federated Investors is sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that FII is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
FII currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 05  while EV has a forward P E of 12 80  We also note that FII has a PEG ratio of 1 32  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  EV currently has a PEG ratio of 1 67 
Another notable valuation metric for FII is its P B ratio of 3 76  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  EV has a P B of 4 39 
These metrics  and several others  help FII earn a Value grade of B  while EV has been given a Value grade of C 
FII has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than EV  so it seems like value investors will conclude that FII is the superior option right now ",2019-03-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fii-or-ev-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200402252,200402252

151014,372530,ETN,This 14 2  Yield Is Too Good To Be True  But This 9 5  Payout Isn t  ,opinion,"Most dividend investors understandably love the idea of an 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio  It s a simple yet  game changing  idea that you don t hear much from mainstream pundits and advisors 
Find stocks that pay safe 7   8  or more and you can retire comfortably  living off dividend checks while your initial capital stays intact  or even appreciates  
Now this strategy is a bit more complicated than simply finding 8  yields and buying them  Granted the recent stock market pullback has benefited investors like us because we can snag more dividends for our dollar  Yields are higher overall  and that s a good thing 
Next we must smartly select the stocks that are going to pay our dividends securely   without tapping their own shares prices to pay us 
Consider Cohen   Steers Infrastructure Fund  NYSE UTF   a closed end fund focused on energy  water  transportation and other infrastructure related companies  It was distributing a fat 8 8  back in February 2016 when I recommended it to my Contrarian Income Report subscribers  Its healthy 9  yield helped deliver 70  total returns  including dividends  in just three years 
Here s What a Healthy 9  Yield Can Do
On the flipside  consider Tupperware  Tupperware Brands Corporation  NYSE TUP   This ubiquitous home brands name was yielding 8 4  in late October 2018 when I warned investors about its increasingly unstable condition   just a few months after I wrote a cautionary note that TUP s dividend had been climbing for all the wrong reasons 
The good news  Fast forward less than half a year  and Tupperware s dividend is a much more manageable sounding 3 9  
The bad news  Tupperware yields so much less now because it hacked its payout by roughly 60   It also reported sinking fourth quarter revenues and served up an ugly forecast for 2019  sending investors fleeing to the tune of  24  since my October warning 
Tupperware  TUP  Shares Melt in the Microwave
Today  I want to examine a half dozen high yield picks delivering anywhere between 8 2  and 14 2  in annual income that you might be eyeballing right now  A few of them are indeed worthy of your attention   but a few could take your legs out 
Ares Capital  ARCC Dividend Yield  9 5 
Let s start with Ares Capital  NASDAQ ARCC   a business development company 
If you re not familiar with BDCs  you re not alone  This is a young business structure that Congress created back in 1980 to provide financing to small and midsize businesses that they otherwise couldn t get from bigger banks  The world of BDCs is small  and these aren t big firms   Ares Capital is top dog at just  7 1 billion  which  for perspective  makes it smaller than GrubHub  NYSE GRUB  
Ares Capital boasts more than 300 investments across the business spectrum from dental service providers to ignition interlock device manufacturers to biotech software makers  It leans heavily on floating rate debt while borrowing at fixed rates  which means hikes to the LIBOR rate can actually help Ares  profitability 
This BDC is on the right by a lot track  The Small Business Credit Availability Act signed into law in 2018 will allow Ares to ramp up its leverage to juice returns  And the company not only delivered its first dividend hike in six years  in August 2018   but it s backing that payout with fatter profits  In its third quarter  the company cranked out 45 cents in core earnings   a 25  jump in profitability that covers its new and improved 39 cent payout with room to spare 
Prospect Capital  PSEC Dividend Yield  10 4 
The main thing you need to know about Prospect Capital  NASDAQ PSEC   another BDC  can be shown in one chart 

Prospect Capital is like many BDCs in that it invests across a wide array of small to midsize companies  covering dozens of industries including consumer finance  media  internet software  energy equipment and even mining  It does so primarily through first  and second lien senior loans  as well as mezzanine debt  and it also invests in some other high income producing strategies  such as collateralized loan obligations  CLOs  and marketplace lending 
Good in theory  rough in practice  PSEC s net investment income  NII  an important BDC profitability metric  has trailed off over the past couple of years  from  371 million in 2016 to  287 million in 2018  But the real concern is the tight to nonexistent dividend coverage that has caused it to slash its payout several times in the past  Prospect Capital not only slashed its dividend by 28  in 2017 as its NII was on the decline  but even by about 25  in 2015 while NII was actually on the rise 
In its fiscal 2018  PSEC paid out 77 cents in dividends per share on 79 cents of net investment income   it would have overpaid if it weren t for the dividend cut 
Even if Prospect Capital temporarily finds itself on recovery road  the company s highly aggressive  and questionable  dividend practices make it an untenable holding 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance Tax Advantaged Dividend Income Fund  NYSE EVT Dividend Yield  8 2 
I mentioned Cohen   Steer s UTF earlier  and I can t stress the importance of having a CEF or two in your portfolio 
While exchange traded funds have grown in popularity because of their dirt cheap fees  the best actively managed closed end funds have managers who can better navigate complex investing environments  they can use debt to amplify their bets  and they can use other tactics such as options trading to generate higher income out of the very same holdings you d find in ETFs 
The Eaton Vance Tax Advantaged Dividend Income Fund  EVT  is a blended fund that  seeks to distribute a high level of dividend income that qualifies for favorable federal income tax treatment   It does so by holding mostly American dividend stocks  72  allocation  such as JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   but also junk bonds  9    investment grade corporates  9   and preferred stock  6   and a small smattering of other assets 
This exposure to high yield assets  as well as the use of leverage  helps this fund generate an 8  plus distribution rate   but more importantly  better results than widely held dividend ETFs such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF  NYSE VYM  and the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF  NYSE VIG  
Eaton Vance s EVT Generates a Little Extra Juice
CenturyLink  NYSE CTL Dividend Yield  14 2 
AT T  NYSE T  and Verizon  NYSE VZ  have long been the reasons why investors equate telecoms with high dividends  They ve been good stewards of that reputation  too  offering stable and rising dividends for some time 
However  smaller telecoms have sullied that image  Windstream  NASDAQ WIN  suspended its dividend in 2017  and Frontier Communications  NASDAQ FTR  did the same in 2018 
Now  everyone is waiting to see whether CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  will be the next to drop the ball 
Louisiana based CenturyLink provides residential high speed internet  TV and phone services  as well as business and government communications services  across 37 states  And the company expanded its horizon with the 2017 acquisition of Colorado based Level 3 Communications   a move meant to stave off declines in its core business 
It s difficult to say whether CenturyLink will in fact cut its dividend  While its payout ratio as a percentage of straight up earnings has long sat north of 100   its cash payout ratio looks much more acceptable 
CenturyLink s  CTL  Situation Isn t as Dire When You Look at Cash
The problem is  even the bullish pros aren t ruling out the idea of a dividend cut  While Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst Simon Flannery thinks the likeliest scenario of its Feb  13 conference call will be  constructive  guidance that includes maintaining a dividend  he also sees two other  less likely  scenarios that involve a cut   one in which the payout is cut less than expected  and another in which it s worse than feared 
It s entirely possible that CTL enjoys a relief rally following its quarterly results  but a will it won t it dividend situation isn t where you should build the foundation of a buy and hold portfolio  Organic growth remains a problem  too  with third quarter revenues showing a 4  decline 
Don t gamble on CenturyLink  If a true turnaround is in the cards  you won t have to get in at the absolute bottom to enjoy fat long term total returns  This is a  show me  stock  so wait for it to show a little more 
Starwood Property Trust  STWD  Dividend Yield  8 7 
Starwood Property Trust  NYSE STWD  is a mortgage REIT dealing primarily in first mortgages  but also in bridge loans  mezzanine loans  subordinate debt  preferred equity and conduit first mortgage loans in the United States and Europe  And during its most recent quarter  the company s asset base reached a record  16 billion  and its commercial loan portfolio hit an all time high  7 5 billion 
This is a diversified mREIT  too  with exposure to offices  36    retail  34    multifamily residences  11    lodging  11    industrial  6   and a hint of self storage  It also has geographical balance  with double digit exposure to every major region   the Southeast  38    West  22    Southwest  16    Northeast  13   and Midwest  11   
Vital to income investors is the company s dividend coverage  While some mREITs really stretch to make their payouts work  STWD has averaged an 89  payout ratio of its core earnings  Yes  that s probably too high to expect increasing dividends going forward  but it does mean the current level of dividends is manageable 
GameStop  NYSE GME Dividend Yield  13 4 
Three months ago  I warned GameStop  NYSE GME  shareholders and potential investors alike 
 If GameStop can t catch a break while console sales are red hot  it s going to be staring at an enormous problem when the console cycle slows down again  and as more game purchases are done online  
There s a problem 
Quick  Someone Blow Into GameStop s Cartridge 
The company slashed its 2018 earnings outlook in late November alongside its third quarter earnings report  from a range of  3 00  3 35 to a range of  2 55  2 75   this despite strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales 
Even at the low end of GameStop s new earnings forecast  the retailer is still paying 60  of its profits out as dividends  which on its own is far from a red flag  Still  the announcement is yet another continuation of GameStop s deteriorating business situation  and it certainly qualifies as  bad enough  
Then came a new wrinkle in January  GME shares cratered by nearly 30  after it announced it was calling off its search for a buyer  That s a disconcerting statement about the value that investors saw in GameStop  namely  they weren t expecting a fundamental turnaround  but instead they were hoping for a white knight to swoop in and save the company 
GameStop is flailing right now  It didn t look good at a 10  yield  and it doesn t look good at 13

151015,372531,ETN,Legg Mason Could Be Hurt By Higher Outflows And Expenses,opinion,"Legg Mason s   NYSE LM   bottom line is expected to be adversely impacted primarily by escalating expenses  Moreover  higher equity asset under management  AUM  outflows and a stricter regulatory landscape remain headwinds for the company 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings moved down to a loss of 48 cents from earnings of  2 93  over the past 30 days  This underlines analysts  bearish sentiments regarding the company s earnings growth prospects  Thus  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong sell  
Looking at the fundamentals  the company s expenses witnessed a three year  2016 2018  CAGR of 7 5   mainly due to higher global operating platform development and advertising costs 
Moreover  Legg Mason has been witnessing equity AUM outflows over the last 12 years due to a number of factors  including investment management performance issues  The company s dismal investment management performance will further escalate its equity AUM outflows  This  in turn  will likely restrain it from achieving overall net inflows  In fact  the company recorded equity outflows in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 as well 
Legg Mason has been increasing its dividend annually since 2010 and has a share repurchase plan in place  However  its capital deployment activities may not be sustainable  given its unfavorable debt equity ratio compared to the industry  Additionally  the company s stock price performance has been volatile in the past few quarters

151018,372534,ETN,Fed Interest Rate Policy Making Economists Nervous,news,"By    With the annual Jackson Hole  Wyoming  Economic Policy Symposium approaching this week  economists are expressing nervousness on whether the U S  Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates before inflation sets in  With the U S  unemployment rate at 6 2 percent in July    more than a full point lower than July 2013    and private sector earnings up 2 percent for hourly workers  a handful of Fed officials admit worry is justified  the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday 
 The idea that the Fed might get behind the curve is a powerful one  and that s certainly been the history of the institution  People are right to worry about that   St  Louis Fed President James Bullard told the Journal 
Arun Raha  chief global economist for Eaton Corp  NYSE ETN  the Cleveland industrial manufacturer  said he s  nervous  Given the strength of the job market  manufacturing and nonresidential construction  it s about time they got rid of their low rates for an extended period viewpoint  
Fed forecasts show interest rates beginning to move up next year  probably toward the middle of the year  The world s other central banks are waiting for the Fed to make the first move  the Journal said 
Yields on 10 year U S  Treasury notes fell Friday to 2 345 percent  a 14 month low and a 3 percent drop from the beginning of the year  Yields had been expected to go up with the end of the Fed s  85 billion a month bond buying program 
Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said he thinks nothing should change until the economy is on a firm footing  but Allen Sinai  president of Decision Economics  said any move would be more effective if it were pro active rather than reactive 
 We look for new clues on how the Fed plans to gain greater control of the Fed funds rate as it tightens policy  while the system is still swimming in reserves as a result of the three quantitative easing programs undertaken   said Victoria Clarke  economist at Investec LON INVP 

With U S  inflation figures due out Monday  the results could impact discussions   We expect inflation data to test monetary policymakers  resolve before the end of the year  but do not expect that challenge to begin with the July report   Brian Jones  economist at Societe Generale  EPA GLE   told Reuters 
Another major issue is the rising tensions in Ukraine   Even if the issues today are resolved and there isn t a shooting war  that ongoing tension between the Ukraine and Russia puts an underlying bid into the Treasury market   Lou Brien  market strategist at DRW Trading  NYSEARCA DRW  in Chicago  told Reuters

151042,372558,ETN,Eaton Vance  EV  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 27  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This investment manager is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 85 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 4  
Revenues are expected to be  442 36 million  up 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5 9  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eaton Vance 
For Eaton Vance  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 25  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eaton Vance will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eaton Vance would post earnings of  0 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 82  delivering a surprise of  1 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line

151043,372559,ETN,Is EAFAX A Strong Bond Fund Right Now ,opinion,"There are plenty of choices in the High Yield   Bonds category  but where should you start your research  Well  one fund that might be worth investigating is Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance Floating Rate Advantage A  EAFAX   EAFAX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2  Buy   which is based on nine forecasting factors like size  cost  and past performance 
Objective
EAFAX is part of the High Yield   Bonds section  which is a segment that boasts many possible options  Often referred to as   junk   bonds  High Yield   Bonds funds sit below investment grade  meaning they are at a high default risk compared to their investment grade peers  However  one advantage to junk bonds is that they generally pay out higher yields while posing similar interest rate risks to their investment grade counterparts 
History of Fund Manager
EAFAX is a part of the Eaton Vance family of funds  a company based out of Boston  MA  Eaton Vance Floating Rate Advantage A debuted in April of 2008  Since then  EAFAX has accumulated assets of about  1 69 billion  according to the most recently available information  Scott H  Page is the fund s current manager and has held that role since April of 2008 
Performance
Of course  investors look for strong performance in funds  EAFAX has a 5 year annualized total return of 4 09  and is in the middle third among its category peers  Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3 year annualized total return of 5 97   which places it in the middle third during this time frame 
When looking at a fund s performance  it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns  The lower the standard deviation  the less volatility the fund experiences  Compared to the category average of 7 89   the standard deviation of EAFAX over the past three years is 3 27   Over the past 5 years  the standard deviation of the fund is 6 51  compared to the category average of 7 69   This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half decade 
Bond Duration
Modified duration is a measure of a specific bond s interest rate sensitivity  and is an excellent way to judge how fixed income securities will respond to a shifting rate environment 
If you believe interest rates will rise  this is an important factor to look at  EAFAX has a modified duration of 0 2  which suggests that the fund will decline 0 2  for every hundred basis point increase in interest rates 
Income
We must remember to consider the fund s average coupon  as income is traditionally a big reason for purchasing a fixed income security  A fund s average coupon is simply its average payout in a given year  For example  this fund s average coupon of 5 18  means that a  10 000 investment should result in a yearly payout of  518 
While a higher coupon is good for when you want a strong level of current income  it could present a reinvestment risk if rates are lower in the future when compared to the initial purchase date of the bond 
Because income is only one part of the bond picture  investors should also consider risk relative to broad benchmarks  With a beta of 0 05  this fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities  Taking this into account  EAFAX has a positive alpha of 3 95  which measures performance on a risk adjusted basis 
Expenses
For investors  taking a closer look at cost related metrics is key  since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing  Competition is heating up in this space  and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart  all things being equal  In terms of fees  EAFAX is a load fund  It has an expense ratio of 0 94  compared to the category average of 1 03   From a cost perspective  EAFAX is actually cheaper than its peers 
Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is  1 000 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount 
Bottom Line
Overall  Eaton Vance Floating Rate Advantage A   EAFAX   has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank  and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance  average downside risk  and lower fees  Eaton Vance Floating Rate Advantage A   EAFAX   looks like a great potential choice for investors right now

In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  8 91  due to these changes 
VGM Scores
At this time  Eaton Vance has a subpar Growth Score of D  however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C  Following the exact same course  the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side  putting it in the middle 20  for this investment strategy 
Overall  the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C  If you aren t focused on one strategy  this score is the one you should be interested in 
Outlook
Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months ",2018-12-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/eaton-vance-ev-down-17-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-rebound-200371349,200371349
151045,372561,ETN,4 Finance Stocks With Dismal Earnings Prospects To Avoid ,opinion,"The Finance sector witnessed major volatility in 2018 with share prices rallying at the start of the year  followed by a substantial downtrend  Election promises fulfilled by Trump kept investors bullish at the beginning  until factors i e  the U S  China trade war  uncertainty over Brexit  changing yield curve and expectations of global economic slowdown among others  began weighing on the investor sentiments   
Thus  the year that began on an optimistic note turned out to be one of the worst since the 2008 financial crisis  Over the past year  the S P 500 and Zacks  sector declined 7 1  and 14 4   respectively 

Finance companies benefit from rate hikes as higher rates lead to increase in net interest income and net interest margin  However  flattening and sometimes even inversion of the yield curve  as witnessed in the past few weeks  is bad news for the sector 
Also  as the Federal Reserve has decided to lower the number of rate hikes planned for 2019  companies will not be able to reap benefits to the full extent 
Moreover  fears of global economic slowdown  Brexit related issues and trade war uncertainty kept customers wary and led to lower investment activities  slowdown in loan demand and decline in consumer spending in 2018  Corporate spending is likely to remain low as well until there is further clarity on trade talks with China 
Further  the artificial intelligence wave has engulfed the finance sector  leading to large investments being made by companies to withstand the growing competition  While this spending will brighten prospects of the companies  it is likely to weigh on financials in the near term   
Elevated expenses  due to technology related investments  are likely to partially offset the benefits of rising interest rates  and thus might impact the bottom line 
Due to these factors  companies might not have been able to generate significant returns in 2018  and are not expected to deliver solid earnings in the near term as well 
 

 
Finance Stocks to Steer Clear Of

151046,372562,ETN,Eaton  ETN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Eaton  NYSE ETN  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This power management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 43 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 42 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Eaton 
For Eaton  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eaton will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Eaton would post earnings of  1 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 43  delivering a surprise of  0 69  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

151047,372563,ETN,UPDATE 1 US jobless claims rise 30 000 in latest week,news," Adds details 
 WASHINGTON  July 23  Reuters    The number of U S  workers
filing new claims for jobless benefits rose roughly as expected
last week  but the data was distorted by an unusual pattern of
layoffs in the automotive industry 
 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose by
30 000 to a seasonally adjusted 554 000 in the week ended July
18  the Labor Department said on Thursday  Analysts polled by
Reuters had expected claims to increase to 550 000 from a
previously reported 522 000 
 A Labor Department official said there were more layoffs
than anticipated based on past experience in the automotive
sector and elsewhere in manufacturing  following two weeks when
there had been fewer layoffs 
 Because the department uses past history to try to smooth
out the impact of seasonal patterns  this amplified the rise in
claims last week  Actual claims fell by less than expected  in
part because they had risen by less than anticipated in the
previous two weeks 
 U S  stocks index futures held gains  while prices for U S 
government bonds slipped and the euro rose against the dollar 
after the data was released 
 Economists cautioned the seasonal adjustment problems made
it hard to accurately determine the underlying trend  but they
said a big drop in claims earlier this month hinted the pace of
layoffs was slowing 
  I do think it tells you there s a trend involved here  I
wouldn t say the economy s necessarily improving  but it s not
getting worse  And maybe it is improving slightly  ever so
slightly   said Robert MacIntosh  chief economist at Eaton
Vance Corp in Boston 
 So called continued claims of people still on jobless aid
after an initial week of benefits fell by 88 000 to 6 225
million in the week ended July 11  the latest for which data is
available  Analysts had expected continued claims to be 6 32
million 
 In another gauge of labor market health  the 4 week moving
average for new claims fell to 566 000 from 585 000 the
previous week  This measure is closely watched because it is
supposed to iron out weekly volatility  It has now fallen for
four straight weeks

   Growth contrasts with surprise drop in US Midwest

   S Korean exports fall less than expected as demand
recovers
   Japan firms less gloomy but still plan big spending cuts
 By Yoo Choonsik and Hideyuki Sano
 SEOUL TOKYO  Oct 1  Reuters    Manufacturing activity in
South Korea and Australia extended rebounds in September 
echoing a strong pick up in growth across Asia that contrasted
sharply with a surprising and worrisome slowdown in the U S 
Midwest 
 South Korean factory activity expanded for a seventh month
in September  though the pace slowed  while Australian
manufacturing hit a 21 month high  private surveys showed 
 Activity at U S  factories in the nation s heartland 
however  slowed unexpectedly last month and private employers
cut more jobs than expected  suggesting the road back to global
economic health will be rocky even if Asia builds up momentum 
 The Institute for Supply Management Chicago said on
Wednesday its business barometer fell to 46 1 in September from
50 0 in August  A reading below 50 indicates contraction  while
levels above 50 reflect expansion 
  What it comes down to is how much of this recovery is
going to be sustainable  I m not a believer yet that this is a
robust economy  This is going to be a very frustratingly weak
growth period   said Robert MacIntosh  chief economist at Eaton
Vance Corp in Boston 
 A nationwide U S  manufacturing activity survey due later
in the day is expected to show growth accelerated last month 
while reports from the Eurozone could show business is close to
expanding again  Factories in Britain  meanwhile  likely saw a
slight rebound after an unexpected dip in August 
 ASIA IMPROVES AS THE WEST STRUGGLES
 Reports from across Asia show much of the continent is
gathering strength  though Japan s economy continues to
sputter 
 China s manufacturing activity expanded for a seventh month
in September  with new orders from at home and abroad picking
up  official data showed on Thursday  largely in line with a
private survey on Wednesday 
 The official purchasing managers  index  PMI  rose to 54 3
from 54 0 in August  the strongest reading in 17 months  the
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing  CFLP  said  The
new export orders sub index hit 53 3 versus 52 1 the previous
month 
 The report adds new evidence that growing domestic
consumption in China is helping to offset weak export demand 
though some economists worry the economy is still too reliant
on government stimulus to generate activity  concerns which are
shared by many policymakers around the world 
 In South Korea  the HSBC Markit manufacturing Purchasing
Managers  Index  PMI  also showed activity expanding for a
seventh month  though the rate of growth eased slightly to 52 7
from 53 6 in August
 Separately  the government reported South Korean exports in
September fell 6 6 from a year earlier  much less than
expected 
 The Australian Industry Group PriceWaterhouseCoopers
Performance of Manufacturing Index  PMI  rose 0 3 points to
52 0  adding to August s 7 2 point jump and holding above the
50 level that separates growth from contraction 
 The survey of 200 companies found a marked turnaround in
employment after 20 months of decline  The index of employment
climbed 9 2 points to 49 7  indicating hiring and firing was
essentially in balance  A return to job creation is vital for a
durable economic recovery 
 In Japan  the world s second largest economy  business
morale improved further from a record low earlier this year but
remained negative overall for the fifth quarter  the central
bank s tankan corporate sentiment survey showed 
 However  large companies continued to cut their capital
spending plans    one of the weakest links in the economy now
   suggesting the economy will struggle in the months ahead

151079,372595,ETN,A O Smith  AOS  Beats On Q1 Earnings  Raises  18 Guidance,opinion,A  O  Smith Corporation   NYSE AOS   reported first quarter 2018 earnings per share of 60 cents  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents  The company continues its earnings beat streak of 25 straight quarters  which it broke once when it reported in line earnings in second quarter 2017 The figure improved 18  from the year ago quarter s tally  The upside mainly came on the back of robust sales growth  However  higher steel prices and inflationary pressure on freight and other costs dampened earnings growth to some extent Inside the HeadlinesThe company generated record sales in the quarter which rose 6 5  year over year to  788 million  However  the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  793 million by a whisker  A thriving water heater industry in the United States  strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top line growth A O  Smith s sales in the North America segment  comprising U S  and Canadian water heaters and boilers  grew 3  year over year to  501 7 million  Higher volumes of commercial water heaters  strong sales of boilers and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region  Water treatment products contributed about  8 million to revenues and boosted the segment s growth Segmental operating earnings inched up 2  year over year to  106 million  The segment s profit was favorably influenced by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and pricing actions  However  the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel and other costs  Consequently  adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points  bps  to 22 5  on a year over year basis Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment  including China  India and Europe  were up 13  year over year to  293 8 million  The improvement came on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A O  Smith s gas tankless water heating and water treatment products  Also  favorable pricing actions added to the top line  However  a significant decline in air purification product sales in China dampened growth to some extent Operating earnings at the segment climbed 11  year over year to  36 1 million in the quarter  The favorable impact of excellent sales in China  along with favorable pricing actions  was partially offset by escalating steel costs and selling and engineering expenses  Operating margin contracted 20 bps to 12 3  year over year A  O  Smith Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Share RepurchasesDuring the quarter  A O  Smith repurchased around 520 000 common shares for  33 million  At the end of the quarter  the company has approximately 1 9 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority Liquidity   Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Mar 31  2018  A O  Smith s cash and cash equivalents totaled  241 9 million compared with  293 4 million in the prior year quarter  Cash generated from operations during the year came in at  43 2 million  compared to cash used in operations of  11 5 million last year  as the quarter s cash flow benefited from higher adjusted net earnings and smaller increases in working capital At the end of the reported quarter  long term debt was  285 5 million compared with  402 9 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31  2017 Other DevelopmentsRecently  A  O  Smith announced that it was chosen as the primary supplier of water treatment products to all Lowe s home improvement stores in the United States  The company expects sales of roughly  15 million  along with start up and transition costs  from the new business in 2018 The new relationship is likely to accelerate growth of the company s North American water treatment product line GuidanceConcurrent with the first quarter results  the company raised guidance for 2018  A O  Smith expects adjusted earnings between  2 55 and  2 61  up from the previous range of  2 50  2 58  The mid point of the range reflects impressive year over year growth of 19  Additionally  the company expects to register revenue growth of 10 10 75  in 2018  supported by stable water heater replacement demand Our TakeA O  Smith started 2018 with good momentum  delivering strong sales growth driven by consistent demand for its consumer products in China and positive end markets for the company s water heaters and boilers in North America  The company s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight its underlying strength We believe that stellar prospects in China and the U S  end markets will continue to accelerate growth in the near future  Also  dominant foothold in the North American water heater market  along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets  is likely to stoke growth for the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company However  over the past few quarters  A O  Smith s SG A expenses in China  including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers  have been quite high  which is creating pressure on the company s operating margins Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top ranked stocks in the same space worth a look include Eaton Corporation  PLC   NYSE ETN    II VI Incorporated   NASDAQ IIVI   and Rexnord Corporation   NYSE RXN    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Eaton has a modest earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters  having beaten estimates twice for an average beat of 3  II VI has a decent earnings surprise history  with an average beat of 13 8  over the preceding four quarters  beating estimates thrice Rexnord boasts an impressive earnings surprise history  with an average beat of 12 6

151082,372598,ETN,Is Eaton  ETN  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Eaton Corporation  PLC   NYSE ETN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Eaton Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 8x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Eaton Corporation s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Eaton Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Eaton Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Eaton Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ETN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Eaton Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Eaton Corporation a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Eaton Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D  This gives ETN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched down by 0 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 1 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Haemonetics Corporation Price and Consensus     This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEaton Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 25  of more than 250 industries  instills investor confidence  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure

151085,372601,ETN,WRAPUP 1 U S  retail sales drop for fifth straight month,news,"  Retail sales drop 1 8 pct  down for 5th straight month
   Drop in gasoline prices behind record fall in gas sales
   Producer prices fall 2 2 percent as gasoline plunges
 By Glenn Somerville and Lucia Mutikani
 WASHINGTON  Dec 12  Reuters    Sales at U S  retailers fell
for a fifth straight month in November  the longest decline in
at least 16 years  as gasoline sales tumbled by a record
amount  according to government data on Friday 
 The Commerce Department said total retail sales fell 1 8
percent to a seasonally adjusted  355 66 billion last month
following a revised 2 9 percent plunge in October  Excluding
motor vehicles and parts  sales were down 1 6 percent in
November after a revised 2 4 percent October fall 
 Sales have fallen since July  the longest stretch since the
Commerce Department began collecting the data in 1992  The
decline was driven by a weakening economy and plummeting energy
prices  which was also reflected in a report on producer
prices 
 Wholesale prices dipped for a fourth month in a row in
November  with the Producer Price Index dropping 2 2 percent
after a record 2 8 drop in October 
 Wholesale energy prices fell 11 2 percent in November  a
fourth straight monthly decline  with gasoline prices plunging
by a record 25 7 percent 
  It just speaks to how weak the economy is  and it is
definitely impacting costs   said Robert Macintosh  chief
economist for Eaton Vance Corp  in Boston   I think this all
fits with the fact we are in a pretty deep recession  
 The November sales decline was slightly less than the drops
of 1 9 percent for total sales and 1 8 percent for sales
excluding motor vehicles that had been forecast by Wall Street
economists surveyed by Reuters  Sales of furniture  electronics
and clothing were up last month after decreasing in October 
 The period from Thanksgiving through Christmas is typically
the most robust one for U S  retail sales but analysts expect
consumers to pull back on the totals they spend this year 
  We re in a recession  sentiment is very bad and it is not
surprising to see sales continuing to fall   said Kim Rupert 
managing director for global fixed income analysis at Action
Economics LLC in San Francisco 
 Prices for U S  Treasury debt securities gave up some gains
just after the sales data was issued but still were higher 
U S  stock futures were sharply lower after a bid to provide
aid to U S  automakers failed in the Senate on Thursday night 
 Gasoline sales plummeted a record 14 7 percent in November
after falling 12 9 percent in October  Prices at the pump have
fallen significantly and that is reflected in the retail sales
report  which simply compiles total sales by gasoline
stations 
 Excluding gasoline  November retail sales were down 0 2
percent after a 1 6 percent slide in October 
 Sales of electronic goods climbed 2 8 percent in November 
the strongest monthly rise since the beginning of 2006 
Clothing sales rose a modest 0 8 percent after a 2 percent drop
in October 
 Sales by dealers of new cars and parts fell 2 8 percent
after declining 5 5 percent in October  New car sales have been
crumbling for months  in part because of an ongoing credit
crisis that makes it harder to get loans but also because
consumers have been cautious when jobs are being cut and the
economic outlook is weakening

151086,372602,ETN,NEWSMAKER Geithner  man at the center  wins new crisis role,news,"By David Lawder and Glenn Somerville
 WASHINGTON  Jan 26  Reuters    The crumbling U S  economy
put a premium on a unique quality that Timothy Geithner brought
to his candidacy for Treasury secretary    he has been involved
in every major action in the past year to try to prop it up 
 As banks queued up for bailout money  all Wall Street
investment banks were taken over or converted to commercial
banks and housing sank steadily  Geithner s job as president of
the New York Federal Reserve Bank put him at the forefront of
rescue bids that continue in full flood with no end in sight 
 Geithner was approved by a 60 34 vote by the U S  Senate
late on Monday  putting the 47 year old in charge of a Treasury
Department at the forefront of efforts to restore U S 
stability 
  It s a tough job and I think Geithner has been intimately
involved in every detail of the economic rescue effort   said
Robert MacIntosh of Eaton Vance Corp in Boston who expects the
U S  economy to contract throughout 2009 
 That  plus a feeling that time is of the essence in getting
the new administration s crisis team together  seemed to
overcome Republicans  criticisms that Geithner s failure to pay
some taxes in a timely fashion stained his record 
 Since the credit crisis burst into view in August 2007 
Geithner has played a large role in efforts by the Federal
Reserve and Treasury Department to settle financial markets 
 So far  however  policy makers have not restored confidence
in financial markets  though they are credited with warding off
a more severe outcome  and Geithner is seen as specially
well positioned to improve the response 
  He s been involved in this financial crisis as a
policy maker for a long time and it s hard to believe that he
hasn t gained experience that will be valuable and useful  
said Douglas Lee  president of Potomac  Maryland based firm
Economics from Washington 
 Geithner s New York Fed post made him the U S  central
bank s man on Wall Street and put him at Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke s side throughout the rapid fire creation of financing
mechanisms aimed at bucking up the financial system 
 He also worked in lock step with former Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson on gauging the problems and shaping the responses
to the woes surrounding firms from Lehman Brothers Holdings to
American International Group and Citicorp 
 In addition  as the head of the New York Fed  Geithner
served as vice chairman of the Fed s interest rate setting
panel  which has pushed benchmark overnight rates to virtually
zero in an effort to combat the deepening U S  recession 
  We have a long way to go yet   said MacIntosh of Eaton
Vance Corp   But there is some anecdotal evidence those
 efforts  are starting to have some traction in dealing with
the problems even though it s going to be a very frustrating
exercise  
 An issue already shaping up for Geithner is how to handle
relations with Asian export powerhouse China  which has
bristled over allegations by President Barack Obama while
campaigning that Beijing manipulated its currency s value 
 Geithner made a similar suggestion during a Senate hearing
last week that White House officials played down on Monday by
saying he was only repeating Obama s remarks 
 The issue of whether China keeps its yuan currency unfairly
low to gain a trade advantage was a constant nettle for the
former Bush administration and Congress still wants a tough
stance to try to protect American jobs where possible 
 One factor that helped Geithner win approval was that few
other top candidates emerged  especially after one time
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers was drafted for a top White
House economic advisory job that took him out of contention for
a second turn as Treasury chief 
 That left Geithner  blemishes and all  as nearly the last
man standing to soothe queasy financial market participants 
who noted that at least he should be able to track where
hundreds of billions of tax dollars have gone 
  He s the very best of a very short list of candidates to
become Treasury secretary  At this critical juncture  you want
somebody who has implemented a lot of these programs that
they ve come up with   said Chris Rupkey  chief financial
economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ in New York 
  He knows where all the money has been lent  works well
with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and still has the confidence of
the markets   Rupkey added 
 Geithner s has five years  experience heading the New York
Fed and comes to the Treasury with a very different background
from Paulson  a high flying former Goldman Sachs chief before
he took over the Treasury in 2006 
 Some analysts expressed misgiving about the Fed as a
training field for the more politically oriented Treasury 
  I think he s a good candidate  but I would be a little bit
cautious that with the ex president of the New York Fed now in
charge of the Treasury  the Fed may be gaining too much
control   said Tom Sowanick  chief investment officer for
Clearbrook Financial LLC in Princeton  New Jersey   I would
expect him to create more of a Fed imprint on the system

151112,372628,ETN,Is Eaton Corporation  ETN  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Eaton Corporation plc   NYSE ETN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Eaton Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Eaton Corporation s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Eaton Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Eaton Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Eaton Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 8  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Eaton Corporation currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Eaton Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Eaton Corporation is just 1 9  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 12 4  which is better than the industry average of 13 9  Clearly  ETN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Eaton Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of c and a Momentum Score of F  This gives ETN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen two upward and five downward revisions in the same time period This has had a slight negative impact on the consensus estimate  as the full year estimate has dipped 0 4  in the past two months  while the current quarter estimate has remained unchanged  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Eaton Corporation  PLC Price and Consensus    Given these trends  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEaton Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish Zacks Industry Rank  among Bottom 35  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act

151114,372630,ETN,My 2 Step Plan For 500  Dividend Growth And 444  Upside,opinion,"Let me show you 3 headlines I ran across last week 

 Tax Cuts and Confidence Drive Surge of Payouts   Barron s
 Global Dividends Break New Record in 2017  With More to Come for the Year Ahead   Institutional Asset Manager
 Trump s Tax Cuts in Hand  Companies Spend More on Themselves Than Wages   New York Times

What do they have in common 
They re all blaring out the fact that American companies have so much cash that they can t ship it out to investors fast enough  Funny thing is  the herd is completely ignoring this fact  Check this out 
The Black Sheep   
We re looking at the performance of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation  NYSE VIG   a good benchmark for stocks that consistently grow their dividend payouts  compared to the benchmark SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  as of March 1 
It may not seem like much of a gap on this chart  but SPY s gain was double that of VIG since January 1  Why  Because like a bird mesmerized by its own reflection  the masses can t look away from this 
  Meets the Belle of the Ball 
I m sure I don t have to tell you that interest rates have soared so far this year  with the yield on the 10 Year Treasury Note sitting just under 3  
Result  Some folks are pondering moving away from dividend growers and into these so called  safe  investments 
That s a huge mistake  Because they re forgetting the one thing people always overlook  inflation 
In January  it was running around 2 1   Chop that out of the so called  high  10 Year Treasury yield  and you re left with a pathetic 0 8   Suddenly that  safe  2 9  yield on the 10 Year doesn t look so safe anymore  does it 
Our Opportunity Arrives
Funny thing is  the crowd is heading for the exits just as the band is getting warmed up  according to asset management firm Janus Henderson  dividends surged 7 7  last year  to a record  1 3 trillion  with more gains ahead this year  thanks to  and  in the US 
The takeaway  it s only a matter of time before the herd realizes its mistake and piles back into stocks paying 5   dividends and or growing their payouts at double digit rates 
Let s beat them to the punch with the 3 names I ll show you below  All of them are doing two crucial things that  when taken together  set you up for a soaring income stream and quick triple digit share price gains 

Pay  accelerating  dividends  When your stocks drop ever growing dividend hikes every year  you won t have to worry about inflation  like our beleaguered fixed income investor does A bonus  A rising dividend puts a 100  predictable lift under share prices  as I ll show you with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd  NYSE RCL  below 
Buy back shares  With soaring earnings and an extra kick from tax reform  many companies  including the 3 below  are buying up their own stock  boosting earnings per share and share prices as they do 

So let s move on to our 3 buys  starting with 
IR  A  Boring  Stock With  Locked in  Double Digit Growth 
Ingersoll Rand  IR  is as unsexy a stock as you ll find  The 145 year old company makes air compressors  heating and cooling systems  pumps and golf carts 
The 2 1  dividend yield might also make your eyes glaze over  but don t be fooled  management has more than doubled the payout in just the past five years 
A Dividend Double 
There s a lot more where that came from  thanks to the company s surging revenue  up 10  in the fourth quarter  and adjusted earnings per share  EPS  up 21   
IR s ace in the hole is its dominant Trane and American Standard heating and air conditioning brands  All told  the company s HVAC segment chips in an outsized 76  of sales  and it s red hot  with revenue up 8  in Q4 
Surging construction across the globe is keeping IR s furnace factories humming  while more homeowners trade up to more efficient models  You can see that in IR s new bookings  which spiked 10  in Q4 
No wonder the Street sees a 15  EPS gain this year  That  plus IR s low payout ratio just 33  of free cash flow  FCF  and earnings has gone out as dividends in the last 12 months makes another big dividend hike a lock as soon as August 
Oh  and you can grab IR cheap  at just 16 5 times forward earnings  a five year low  That disconnect between IR s growth potential and sunken P E simply can t last 
RCL  Payout Growth Will Go On
Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines  RCL  is a perfect illustration of the price lifting power of a soaring dividend payout  Take a look at this chart the pattern is clear 
Dividend Fills RCL s Sails 
Ever since RCL started cranking up its dividend in earnest in early 2012  the share price has risen almost in lockstep 
That s no coincidence I ve seen this pattern in dozens of dividend stocks  In fact  the correlation is usually a lot closer  so the fact that the share price is  only  up 444  in that time  compared to a 500  jump in the dividend  tells me that we have a lot more upside to come 
RCL s management agrees  They ve been jumping on the cruise line s ridiculously cheap valuation  just 13 8 times forecast EPS  to snap up its stock since late 2014 
Management Buys Cheap 
Before I move on from dividends  here s what a 500  payout jump means to you  the stock yields just 1 9  as I write  but if you d bought back in February 2012 just six years ago you d be yielding an incredible 9 8  on your original buy today 
As with Ingersoll Rand  the ridiculous mismatch between Royal Caribbean s growth and current valuation is one reason why it should be on your list 
Here are two more 

More dividend growth ahead  RCL pays out a ridiculously low 18 9  of FCF as dividends and only 27  of earnings  That means it could double its payout tomorrow and still be at or below my roughly 50   safe zone  
Big profits in  18  Carnival  LON CCL  says it has more bookings on the slate for 2018 than it did last year  when bookings hit record highs  thanks to flush clients in the US and Europe  For 2018  it s calling for adjusted EPS of  8 55 to  8 75  with the midpoint up 15  from 2017 

Now let s move on to 
ETN  Catch the Street Napping
Eaton Corporation PLC  NYSE ETN  announced a mammoth 10  dividend hike on investors last week doubling the 5  increase the maker of engines  controls and hydraulic systems rolled out last year 
The rise was enough to push the stock s yield up from 2 9   based on the old quarterly payout  to 3 3  on a forward basis a 14  shift 
The Street s response  The stock dropped 1 5  on the day 
But that will change as the size of the hike sinks in and investors bite  driving the share price up and bringing the yield back toward the 3  it s averaged over the last five years  because you calculate yield by dividing the payout into the current share price  
 Stuck  Yield Masks Strong Payout Growth 
This phenomenon  by the way  is precisely why your favorite dividend paying stock always seems to yield the same  even after a string of payout hikes like Eaton has brought in  the payout s up 43  since 2013  
But the Street is sometimes a little slow to catch on  creating a nice if short buying opportunity 
Of course  that s not the only reason to like Eaton  the company also saw strong gains across its segments  electrical products  electrical systems and services  hydraulics  aerospace and vehicles  in Q4  driving a 7  rise in the top line and a 15  rise in adjusted EPS 
For 2018  ETN is calling for a 10  jump in EPS over 2017  That  plus its easily manageable payout ratio  56  of FCF and 27  of earnings  sets it up for another double digit payout hike a year from now 
7 More  Rising Rate Buys  to DOUBLE Your Money Fast 
Eaton  Ingersoll Rand PLC  NYSE IR  and Royal Caribbean are just the start I ve uncovered 7 more  hidden yield  stocks just like these poised to DOUBLE your money every six years  or less  while TRIPLING your retirement income 
Here s a glance at just 3 of the 7 dividend growth plays

151173,372689,ETN,Is Eaton Corporation A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Eaton Corporation plc    NYSE ETN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Eaton has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 4  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Eaton s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Manufacturing   Electronics industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Eaton has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Eaton stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Eaton has a P S ratio of about 1 7  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ETN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Eaton currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Eaton a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall Though Eaton might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives ETN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen eleven up and none down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 0 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 4 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Eaton Corporation  PLC Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEaton is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 29  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Manufacturing   Electronics industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug

Eaton s third quarter 2016 operating earnings per share of  1 15 were a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Also  reported earnings were within management s guidance range of  1 00 to  1 20 per share  Moreover  the bottom line surged 20  from the year ago quarter figure RevenuesIn the quarter under review  Eaton s total revenue came in at  4 99 billion  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 05 billion by 1 2  On a year over year basis  revenues were down nearly 4  due to lower Aerospace  2 9    Vehicle  12 4    Electrical Systems and Services  3 4    and Hydraulics  6 1   sales Unfavorable currency translation and a decline in organic sales were the primary reasons for the revenue decline  Sales took a 1  hit from currency translation  while the drop in organic sales accounted for 3  Quarterly HighlightsCost of products sold in the reported quarter was  3 371 million  down 6 3  from the prior year period Selling and administrative expenses decreased 5 9  to  853 million from  907 million a year ago In the third quarter of 2016  the company s research and development expenses were  146 million  down 6 4  from  156 million in the prior year quarter Interest expenses of  59 million remained unchanged from the prior year quarter figure Eaton is on track with its restructuring program  which is expected to deliver  200 million of incremental profit in 2016 over the 2015 levels Financial UpdateEaton s cash and short term investments were  494 million as of Sep 30  2016  compared with  268 million as of Dec 31  2015 As of Sep 30  2016  long term debt was  7 881 million compared with  7 746 million as of Dec 31  2015 Eaton repurchased shares worth  243 million during the third quarter GuidanceFourth quarter 2016 earnings per share are expected between  1 05 and  1 15 For 2016  Eaton still anticipates organic revenues to decline 4   reflecting persistently sluggish markets around the world  Currency translation is projected to have a roughly  225 million impact during the year Eaton narrowed its 2016 operating earnings guidance to the range of  4 15 to  4 25 per share from its prior expectation of  4 20  4 40 The company anticipates fourth quarter 2016 and 2017 bookings to continue being soft due to the company s cost control initiatives for 2017  which now targets savings of  180 million  up from its prior expectation of  130 million 
How have estimates been moving since then 
Following the release and in the last one month  investors have witnessed a downward trend for fresh estimates  There have been 10 revisions lower for the current quarter  The consensus estimate has shifted by  5 98   due to these changes 
VGM Scores
At this time  Eaton s stock has a nice Growth score of  B   though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a  D   However  the stock was allocated a grade of  B  on the value side  putting it in the top two quintiles for this investment strategy  Eaton has a good historical EPS growth level of about 14 29   From a momentum outlook  it is worth noting that the stock has weak earnings estimate momentum which includes falling estimates 
Zacks  style scores indicate that the company s stock is suitable for value and growth investors 
Outlook
While estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock  the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift  It s no surprise that shares of Eaton have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and we are expecting negative returns from ETN in the next few months 
We think the company is a sell right now  Eaton could be considered a decent choice for value investors  but the lack of growth on the earnings estimate expectation front is definitely concerning

151264,372780,ETN, Donaldson  DCI   Earnings   Revenues Beat In Q3  View Dull,opinion,Premium filtration products provider Donaldson Company  Inc    NYSE DCI   made a rebound with an earnings beat in the fiscal third quarter of 2016 after a rare miss in the preceding quarter  The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents for the quarter  which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents by 10 3  Moreover  adjusted earnings rose 16 2  from the prior year quarter figure of 37 cents The bottom line improvement can be largely attributable to robust operational efficiency gains resulting from restructuring and cost saving initiatives  Also  a decline in the cost of sales and operating expenses proved conducive to bottom line growth  However  currency fluctuations posed as a headwind  thwarting growth to some extent Inside the HeadlinesDonaldson reported total sales of  571 3 million  down 0 7  on a year over year basis  However  revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  551 million by 3 7   Poor performance of the Engine Products segment impacted the top line performance  Also  currency fluctuations caused a  5 5 million decline in the fiscal third quarter sales Revenues at the Engine Products segment declined 2 9  year over year to  357 3 million  Three of the four sub segments under Engine Products   Off Road  On Road and Aerospace   Defense   recorded declines  which led to the overall weak performance  Slowdown of class A truck production and softness in the U S  proved detrimental to the on road business  down 19 6    Also  weakness in global agricultural and mining markets proved to be a drag on the Off Road business  down 19   Revenues at the Industrial Product segment were up 3 1  year over year to  214 0 million  While unimpressive performance of the Special Applications  down 10 3   business proved to be a drag  this was more than offset by robust performance of the other two sub segments   Industrial Filtration Solutions  up 5 3   and Gas Turbine Systems  up 9 7    However  prolonged weakness in disk drives posed a significant headwind to this segment Donaldson s adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points  bps  year over year to 13 8   Also  the company s Earnings Before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation and Amortization   EBITDA   came in at  96 7 million versus  89 8 million recorded a year ago LiquidityDonaldson exited the quarter with cash and equivalents of  247 4 million versus  189 9 million as on Jul 31  2015  The company had long term debt of  391 8 million as on Apr 30  2016  compared with  389 2 million as on Jul 31  2015 Guidance CutBased on the current market scenario  Donaldson has narrowed its guidance and adjusted the estimates for fiscal 2016  The company now expects revenues at the mid point of the guided range of  2 2  2 25 billion   2 225 billion   This is also 6  below the last year level  Moreover  sales in local currencies are expected to decline approximately 3   compared with the prior guidance of a year over year decline in the range of 1  3   Currency translation is expected to impact sales by  80 million in full year fiscal 2016 The company also narrowed its adjusted EPS guidance to  1 53  1 59  from  1 51  1 61  The company continues to expect fiscal 2016 GAAP EPS at around 9 cents  lower than adjusted EPS on account of restructuring charges and investigation related costs For the segments  the company believes Engine Products sales will decline 6  year over year  largely led by the decline in heavy duty on road transportation business as well as sluggishness in the global agriculture  mining equipment and construction markets  Moreover  waning U S  defense spending and softness in the commercial aerospace are expected to hurt the top line of this segment Also  sales of the Industrial Products segment are expected to decline 6  from the year ago figure mainly on the back of dismal Gas Turbine Systems business  As a matter of fact  project deferrals and volatility in global demand are significantly undermining the performance of this segment  Moreover  the other two segments  namely  Industrial Filtration Solutions and Special Applications  are expected to fall low single digit and mid single digit  respectively  The pronounced decline of disk drive  membrane and semiconductor businesses is expected to pose a major drag on the Industrial Products business   To ConcludeDespite these weaknesses  we believe Donaldson s growth initiatives based on three core areas   expansion of core business through first fit program wins and aftermarket growth  continued geographic expansion  and fostering innovative technology to secure first fit program deals   will help it combat some of the weakness  Also  the company s restructuring initiatives to align operating and manufacturing cost structure with current and projected customer outlooks look encouraging  This apart  the growing presence in the Latin American market adds to its strength Donaldson currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Other favorably ranked stocks in the broader sector include ESCO Technologies Inc

151294,372810,ETN,This Power Management Play Is About To Glow,opinion,"Once headquartered in the U S   Eaton Corporation  N ETN  tax inverted itself to Ireland for tax advantages 
This power management company has taken it on the chin since May  But recent price action suggests it may be powering up for a drive higher  Take a look 

The chart above shows its fall from  74 in May to the low at  50 at the start of October  It saw a steady fall until early September  but then the price action morphed into more of a sideways consolidation  The late August and early September peaks at  57 50 acted at resistance and it swung lower 
It made it back to that resistance Wednesday but with a couple of candles with upper shadows    a possible topping formation  This looks to be resolving to the upside  though  with a bullish engulfing candle  which looks to be a precursor to more upside  A measured move off of the  53 base to here would target a run to  62 
That would be just above the August high  but more importantly would confirm a reversal from the downtrend  The momentum indicators are bullish as this happens  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising with the MACD rising  The Bollinger Bands  are also turning up and opening 
The stock went ex dividend Thursday so there are no games to be played between now and the earnings report at the start of February  Watch for a break above resistance to buy the stock for an upward move or use the January 2016 Expiry 57 5 Calls  offered at about  2 00  for a defined risk trade ",2015-11-05,Gregory W.

151296,372812,ETN,Emerson  EMR  Q2 Earnings Top Estimates  Sales Fall Y Y,opinion,"Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   reported second quarter fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents  increasing 1 5  from the year ago quarter tally 



	The healthy beat was attributable to restructuring benefits and an improved operational performance  in the face of all pervasive weakness and a dismal top line growth 

Inside the Headlines

	Net sales continued to show weakness  as they decreased 9  year over year to  4 928 million  but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 891 million  Underlying sales growth for the quarter was negative globally  except a flat Europe  and was down 5  in aggregate  Sustained challenging macroeconomic conditions and significant decline in spending by global customers in the oil   gas and industrial markets were the primary drivers of the dismal top line performance 

	Segment wise  Process Management s net sales fell about 11  in the quarter to  1 828 million  with underlying sales slipping 9   attributable to low order rates stemming from weak global spending in the oil and gas industry  The segment saw weakness across North America  Asia  Canada  Middle East and Latin America  with just Kuwait standing out as a bright spot 

Industrial Automation reported a 16  decline in year over year net sales to  870 million  with an underlying sales decrease of 10  due to persistent weakness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas markets  Geographically  this segment too saw an all round weakness  with sales in North America  Asia and Middle East Africa down quite significantly 

	Net sales in Network Power contracted 4  year over year to  1 018 million  with a decrease of 1  in underlying sales  The segment witnessed mixed performance geographically  but recent order trends for data center infrastructure and telecommunications investments suggest improving conditions 

Climate Technologies stood out as the only one with positive year over year sales growth  as its net sales edged up 1  year over year in the quarter to  995 million  with a 2  increase in underlying sales  The segment benefited from a robust demand in the U S  residential and commercial air conditioning market  North America  Latin America and Europe also charted a strong growth  while Asia declined quite a bit 

Commercial   Residential Solutions  net sales dipped 15  year over year to  394 million  driven largely by the divestiture of the commercial storage business  Underlying sales actually increased 2  year over year  Improving trends in the U S  construction market bode well for the segment s outlook in the coming quarters 

Liquidity   Cash Flow

	Exiting the quarter  the company had cash and cash equivalents of  3 3 billion with long term debt of  4 billion  Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter rose 29 8  over the prior year quarter to  1 206 million  driven by superior working capital management 

Outlook

	Emerson expects the unfavorable operating environment to continue  although it is seeing signs of stabilization in demand  coupled with improving order trends  Thus  the company reiterated that it expects net sales for fiscal 2016 to decline 5  to 8   Further  Emerson projects adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of  3 05 to  3 25 

	For the third quarter of fiscal 2016  the company expects adjusted earnings per share to come in at about 85 cents  while revenues are expected to decline around 2  year over year 

	Further  Emerson expects around  250 to  350 million in expenses related to the spinoff of Network Power and proposed divestitures of the Motors and Drives and Power Generation businesses The company also expects to incur restructuring expenses of around  70 to  80 million in 2016 

To Conclude

	Emerson s persisting problems continue to hurt its operations  The company expects the global market environment to remain challenging  with a strong U S  dollar  low industrial spending and weakness in emerging and mature economies among the major concerns  Further  Emerson foresees a decrease in profitability in the near term owing to the volume deleverage stemming from weakness in underlying sales and impact of restructuring initiatives 

	However  robust margins and remarkable cash flow improvement in the reported quarter were huge positives  Also  Emerson s cost cutting and restructuring initiatives are expected to benefit the company  going forward  Moreover  the company is seeing positive order trends  which will support sales in the coming quarters 

	Emerson currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Other stocks in the electrical machinery space include Franklin Electric Co   Inc    NASDAQ FELE    SPX FLOW  Inc    NYSE FLOW   and Eaton Corporation plc   NYSE ETN    each carrying the same rank as Emerson ",2016-05-02,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/emerson-(emr)-q2-earnings-top-estimates,-sales-fall-y-y-200127622",200127622

151327,372843,ETN,Eaton Corporation  4 2  Dividend Yield  32 Years Of Dividends,opinion,"Eaton Corporation PLC  NYSE ETN  looks cheap at first glance  The company has a price to earnings ratio of 11 5 and a dividend yield of 4 2   Even better  the company has given investors better total returns than the overall market over the last 15 years 

Source  
Is the company truly an undervalued gem  or is there serious trouble at Eaton 
This article takes a look at the investment merit of diversified manufacturer Eaton 
Eaton was founded in 1911  The company currently has a market cap of  24 7 billion  The company s shares have not done well over the last several months  The company s stock price is down about 24  in the last quarter alone 
The company s share price has fallen so far due to weakness in the industrial manufacturing industry 
Eaton operates in 2 large  sectors   electrical and industrial  The electrical sector generated 61  of the company s sales in 2014  while the industrial sector generated the remaining 39  of sale 
The electrical sector provides comprehensive solutions from power generation through to the end user  The sector is further broken down into 2 divisions 
Products  32  of total sales 
Systems   Services  29  of total sales 
The industrial sector operates in 3 divisions 
Hydraulics  13  of sales 
Aerospace  8  of sales 
Vehicle  18  of sales 
The  gives a visual breakdown of the company s sectors and divisions 


Weakness is a result of the beginnings of a global economic slowdown  Hydraulic revenue fell 18  percent in the company s   Revenue was down  though not as much  in all of the company s other divisions in the quarter 
There are a myriad of factors reducing sales for Eaton  Low agriculture prices are reducing hydraulic purchases from companies like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Low oil and gas prices are impacting global energy segment sales  and vehicle sales are being impacted by growth slowdowns in China and South America 
With declines in revenue across the board  you may think that Eaton saw its operating income plummet  but that is not the case  Eaton actually managed to grow operating income 3 4  versus the same quarter a year ago due to margin increases 
Recession Performance
Despite the company s operating income growth in the face of recent challenges  Eaton will likely not hold up well if the global economy continues to decline  
If the global economy does enter into a full blow recession  Eaton s earnings will very likely fall precipitously 
The company s earnings per share through the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 are shown below to illustrate this point 
2007 Earnings per share of  3 38
2008 Earnings per share of  3 42
2009 Earnings per share of  1 30  recession low 
2010 Earnings per share of  2 73  beginning of recovery 
As you can see  Eaton s earnings fell substantially during the last recession  The company s energy and industrial customers tend to hold off making purchases during recessions  which results in declining sales and earnings for Eaton 
With that said  the company did manage to remain profitable through the Great Recession   which is one of the worst global financial crises of the last century 
Dividend Analysis   Shareholder Friendliness
Eaton has paid steady or increasing dividends for 32 consecutive years  Management is very clearly committed to rewarding investors with steady or rising dividends 
Over the last decade  Eaton has compounded its dividend payments at a robust 13 6  a year  The company currently has a payout ratio of 44 7   Eaton s management is on record as saying that  dividends are targeted to grow in line with future earnings growth   I would not expect double digit dividend growth from Eaton going forward 
But  investors seeking current income won t need double digit dividend growth from Eaton because the company is currently yielding 4 2   
This is the highest dividend yield Eaton has had  excluding the period of the Great Recession in the last 20 years  The image below shows the company s 20 year dividend history 

Eaton may not increase its dividend rapidly over the next several years  but it will reward shareholders with share repurchases  The company plans to repurchase 1  to 2  of its shares outstanding each year  These repurchased combined with the company s current dividend yield gives investors an expected shareholder yield of between 5  and 6  a year at current prices 
Growth Prospects
Over the last decade  Eaton has compounded its earnings per share at 6 3  a year  This is by no means bad  but it is not stellar growth either 
Earnings growth should be slow  and possibly negative  over the next few years   especially if we enter into a global recession 
With that said  the long term growth prospects of Eaton remain bright  The company should manage to compound its earnings per share at between 5  and 7  a year over full economic cycles 
This growth  combined with the company s current 4   dividend yield gives investors an average expected total return of around 10  a year 
Final Thoughts
I agree with much of the conclusion reached by Stephen Simpson  CFA in a recent article he did on Eaton 

 It s getting scary out there in the industrial sector  Patient investors might be licking their chops at the prospect of picking up very good  if not great  companies at good long term prices  but that comes with the risk of seeing the global economy weaken even further and lead to some sizable paper losses in the meantime  If you re a patient investor who can live with short term underperformance  Eaton may hold some appeal  but I don t think investors need to be in a big hurry to buy these shares

151342,372858,ETN,Determining The Perfect Time To Buy Closed End Income Funds,opinion,Pick a stock  Any stock  And invariably  one investor will argue it s cheap while another will say it s expensive  Who s right  There s really no way to answer that question  until it s too late  But the same can t be said about closed end funds  A first grader with a good grasp of addition and subtraction can tell whether one is cheap or expensive  Since closed end funds issue a fixed number of shares  supply and demand determines market prices  That means it s possible for such funds to trade at a price that s greater than  a premium  or less than  a discount  the actual value of the securities in the portfolio  net asset value or  NAV    And currently  the average closed end fund is cheap  It s selling at about an 8 5  discount  more than double the historical average  based on the Herzfeld Closed End Average Index  What does that mean  Well  if the fund s manager sold all of the fund s holdings  investors would earn an instant 8 5  profit  Not bad  But during intense market selloffs  it s not uncommon for closed end funds to trade at much bigger discounts  That s precisely what happened at the end of 2012  When Congress couldn t come to any sort of an agreement over the  Fiscal Cliff   the average discounts hit double digits  Why  As we all know  when investors get scared  they sell indiscriminately  Companies with stellar earnings growth and fundamentals get tossed just as quickly as companies with terrible fundamentals  Yet very few investors understand the dynamics of closed end funds  so they sell out of them much more aggressively  Case in point  during the 2008 stock market swoon  almost 200 closed end funds traded at more than a 20  discount  And a couple dozen closed end funds traded at discounts of up to 30  to 40   When such steep double digit discounts to NAV materialize  we should be buyers  not sellers  Closed End Bargains Don t Last Forever Huge disparities between market price and NAV don t last forever  Savvy investors recognize the bargains and eventually swoop in to capitalize on them  That appears to be happening now  And you should look to be one of them  Practically speaking  I recommend monitoring the average premium discount to NAV on a weekly basis  Barron s makes it easy  Each week it publishes the Herzfeld Closed End Average Index  which tracks the average premium discount for 15 large closed end funds  I also recommend focusing on closed end income funds  ones that invest in bonds  And here are the two reasons why  First  they offer more downside protection because we re investing in bonds  Remember  unlike stocks  fixed income investments have a predetermined value at maturity  So despite any wild market swings  if we hold on long enough  bond valuations will recover as maturity draws near  Second  closed end income funds pay us to own them via dividends while we wait for the temporary discounts to NAV to disappear  Many even pay monthly dividends  That s why the last time closed end income funds sold off so sharply  I recommended that readers pick up shares of the Eaton Vance Senior Floating Rate Trust  EFR   Sure enough  they were sitting on a healthy double digit profit in no time  For investors who value solid income with the potential for double digit appreciation  too  I m convinced no better opportunity exists than buying closed end income funds during market selloffs  You can easily research specific funds  and   In fact  a recent screen turned up the following 10 income oriented funds that are trading at   or close to   double digit discounts to NAV Ellsworth Fund  ECF Bancroft Fund  BCV American Strategic Income II  BSP Nuveen Diversified Currency Opportunities  JGT Oxford Lane Capital Corp  OXLC Western Claymore Inflation Linked Securities   Income Fund  WIA NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund  NHF Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income  AGC Federated Enhanced Treasury  FTT American Select Portfolio  SLA Please note  I m not recommending any of the funds listed above  Instead  I m sharing them to prove the point that opportunities exist in the current market  Accordingly  the list should only serve as a starting point for further research  Bottom line  Closed end income funds are a great buy during market selloffs  I recommend you have a short list of funds you d like to own when the average discount to NAV hits double digits ,2013-02-05,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/determining-the-perfect-time-to-buy-closed-end-income-funds-153964,153964

Eaton CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 11 1  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of Eaton Corp  assuming an initial investment of  1 000

Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Eaton Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury

151352,372868,ETN,The Present And Future Of Actively Managed ETFs ,opinion,SEI  in collaboration with the financial advice website ETF Trends  has posted a new paper on actively managed exchange traded funds  The paper contends that  the rise of active management in the ETF space may well be the next step in its evolution    The Basics Passively managed ETFs hold a basket of securities based on an underlying index  The active side of the industry also involves a fund that holds a basket of securities  but its aim is to  achieve an investment objective such as outperforming a given segment of a market  or investing in a focused sector    The difference between the two sorts of ETF is  then  much the same as the difference between passive and actively managed mutual funds   Active ETFs share many traits with their passive cousins  They can both be traded on an exchange throughout the day  and taxable events are rarer in a conventional ETF structure than they are in the mutual fund setting  On the tax point  the SEI paper cites product sheets from both Invesco PowerShares and Fidelity   Of course through the process of trading on an exchange the price of an ETF will generally incorporate either a premium or a discount vis   vis the underlying net asset value  a fact that provides the Authorized Participants with an arbitrage opportunities  These APs  availing themselves of those opportunities  keep the value in proximity to the NAV   A Dilemma The creation redemption process in turn sets up the feature of ETFs and in particular of active ETFs that constitutes a potential competitive disadvantage vis   vis mutual funds  Given the portfolio transparency requirements  which for ETFs are daily but for mutual funds are only quarterly  the former are susceptible to front running  Investors or competitors can use the disclosed positions to construct their own portfolios  So  why should they participate in the ETF and pay the investment manager   Given this challenge  the paper observes that many ETF providers  are trying to find ways to work around the transparency rules and limit their disclosures of holdings   Navigate Fund Solutions  a subsidiary of Eaton Vance  is working on a product it calls an exchange traded managed fund  ETMF  In an ETMF  managers would not publicize their positions until trades were settled   Any such workaround  though  will have its own costs  It will impair the ability of the Aps to arbitrage  and thus would allow for larger premiums or discounts to the actual value of the holdings  So an actively managed ETF faces something of a dilemma  should it impair arbitrage by its friends in order to disable front running by its adversaries  or should it enable them both   Whatever the challenges  the trend is clear  Measured either by the number of actual products or by the total net assets wrapped therein  active ETFs have seen a burst of growth since the world financial crisis Restoring Derivatives to the MixUntil quite recently  the Securities and Exchange Commission prohibited the creation of actively managed ETFs that incorporated derivatives in their portfolios  This changed in December 2012 As a consequence of the change in policy  SEI says  newly created active ETFs can now represent in their filings that the board will periodically review and approve the use of derivative and of how the ETF s IA assesses and manages risk with regard to the use of derivatives  The use of derivatives must itself be disclosed in its offering documents and periodic reports This could help continue the ongoing increase in the number of active ETF launches  It allows for head to head competition between an ETF following a particular strategy and a mutual fund following the same strategy  For example  well known portfolio manager Bill Gross has expressed his desire to include derivatives in his PIMCO Total Return Bond ETF  as does the PIMCO Total Return Bond mutual fund Mutual fund providers are moving into this space  There are differing ways in which they can do so  On the one hand  they might create a new legal entity under the same brand umbrella  This  though  can be cumbersome  as it requires the approval of shareholders and the board of directors Another approach  associated especially with Vanguard  is the creation of a new share class for an existing mutual fund  Van Eck Global is considering ETF share classes for some of its existing funds  the report says   but it is unclear whether the proposal would use Vanguard s patent or challenge it  A third approach involves the creation of a master feeder structure Thus  we end where we began  ETF Trends and SEI conclude that as more attention is drawn to the ETF world from both managers and investors  more creative approaches to the active idea of that space will appear  and the resulting products will  eventually rival traditional active mutual funds for market share

151358,372874,ETN,Ted Dixon  3 Rules Of Thumb For Watching Insider Trading ,opinion,Data on trades made by company insiders key executives and directors demonstrates to Ted Dixon  co founder and CEO of INK Research  that most of them are contrarian in their approaches  Lately  Dixon finds that insider indicators in the gold and junior gold miner sectors are  off the charts   In this interview with The Gold Report  Dixon shares the names of frequent traders in recent months  along with insights into why  when and how insiders are trading  The Gold Report  Ted  INK Research monitors stock transactions made by key executives and directors inside their companies and uses that data to develop sentiment indicators for various indices and sectors  How does your system work  Ted Dixon  When we look at a market and a sector  we use insider activity buys and sells in the public market to get a sense of how those insiders feel  not just about their company  but about the overall market or sector  This led us to develop what we call a sentiment indicator  which is basically a daily poll of insiders  You could compare it to the polls you see during election campaigns  Every night  we take a poll of what insiders are doing within the market and the sector  We aggregate all of the buys and sells in the different companies in that sector to get a sense of the overall mood of insiders in that area  TGR  The sentiment indicators at the moment show almost twice as much insider buying among Toronto Stock Exchange listed stocks as selling  Yet  the opposite is happening in the American market  How do you explain that  TD  One of the rules of thumb when looking at insider activity is that insiders tend to be contrarian  They like to do the opposite of what other people are doing  In 2013 to date  the U S  market has had a nice run as the indices have been hitting new  all time highs  As everyone else is piling into the market and chasing momentum  insiders  being contrarians  are selling into that and are taking profits  We have not had quite the same ride here in Canada  different sectors have experienced different fortunes  Some sectors and stocks have been hit hard  Because they are contrarian  insiders will go shopping for bargains during periods of selloff  While everyone is hitting the sell button  insiders and select companies will pick up stocks that have been beaten down  The key element to keep in mind here is the time horizon  Insiders typically have a long time horizon  The fact that they may be buying does not mean they expect a 50  reversal over the next two or three months  It means that  over the long term  the risk reward ratio has improved enough for them to jump in  TGR  Among the TSX Venture Exchange listed stocks  insiders are buying almost eight times more than they are selling  What trends have emerged from insider buying on the Venture Exchange  TD  Before the Lehman Brothers collapse  insiders were a bit more opportunistic in their buying and selling  Since then  we have seen a long term  secular commitment to buy among junior miner insiders  This has been going on for quite a while  but as we go through bouts of selloff in the sector  insider activity within the junior miners tends to pick up  That is happening now  In fact  it would concern us if there were no increase in insider activity when junior miners sold off  That might indicate that insiders are giving up on the sector  We are not seeing that  TGR  Where is your Venture Exchange sentiment indicator on a 12 month horizon  TD  It is near all time highs  just as the Venture Exchange index works down toward new multiyear lows  We have been at elevated buying levels  driven primarily in the gold group  The spring saw a massive spike  TGR  Does a spike in insider buying in an underperforming sector generally predict medium  or long term equity performance  TD  It is important to remember that insider activity and the INK indicators are not a silver bullet to market timing  They are used in conjunction with the technical indicators that many of your readers follow and the fundamental research they do  The Gold Report  Ted  INK Research monitors

bullet to market timing  They are used in conjunction with the technical indicators that many of your readers follow and the fundamental research they do  TD  You are absolutely right about the importance for smaller companies  Brian  When Nejat Seyhun did his comprehensive study of insider activity in 1998   Investment Intelligence from Insider Trading   he found that top executives such as CEOs and CFOs of smaller firms outperform the market by about 8  a year  You get a better bang for your buck  on average  with smaller companies  I say on average  because in some cases insiders still suffer from wishful thinking and miscalculation  Most of the insider buying is in the junior and the small companies  We have an indicator list that tracks what we call key insider buying beneficial ownership buying where officers or directors directly own the interest in those stocks  they are not managing other people s money  Our users can also generate net buying lists  TGR  What are some of the smaller names on your 30 day activity list  meaning there has been insider trading in the last 30 days  TD  The smaller names would include Belo Sun Mining Corp   BSX TSX V  and Veris Gold Corp   VG TSX  YNGFF OTCBB   Remember  because these are small companies  some small gold miners may not be easy to invest in  as a matter of liquidity  Some may not trade much  Nor are these investment recommendations  They are companies on our list showing insider buying in the last month  TGR  Veris Gold insiders bought 555 000 shares  TD  As of June 10  it was 605 000 shares  TGR  In general  do you know who is making such purchases  TD  In the case of Belo Sun Mining  CEO Mark Eaton has been buying  He bought throughout the month of May  2 000 shares on May 30 and 425 500 on May 15 16  Another company executive bought nearly 230 000 shares on May 31 at  0 59 share after buying 11 500 shares earlier in the month  All my dollar and cents figures are in Canadian currency  On May 16  a third officer bought 100 000 shares  That makes three insiders buying in the public market during May  During that same period  there were no insider public market sales  That is a good example of the type of insider buying you want to see when there is market weakness in a stock  TGR  Have you ever done a study of share price performance versus buying  Is there a greater correlation with more executives buying than with just one buyer  TD  In general  the more  the better  You want to see situations where multiple insiders are buying and no one is selling  When the CFO is buying is another good signal  Always keep an eye on what the CFO is doing  I say that because  in general  they tend to be more conservative  TGR  What other small juniors are buying and selling  TD  Orvana Minerals Corp   ORV TSX  is another multiple insider buyer situation  CEO Michael Winship bought 60 000 shares at  0 53 share in May and was joined by a director  Audra Walsh  Together they spent  52 000 of their own money in buying in the public market  That seems to be good timing because the stock is now trading around the  0 60 share level  TGR  And they bought where  TD  It looks as if they bought between  0 50 and  0 53 share  TGR  Can you tell us about other companies where insiders are buying  TD  Angkor Gold Corp   ANK TSX V  is being bought by CEO Michael Weeks  Over the last 30 days  he has spent about  44 000 buying stock in that company  His purchases have been in a range of  0 38 and  0 42 share  Angkor Gold is a smaller company based in Cambodia  It is interesting to see its insider buying among the top 10 by dollar amount for over the past 30 days  Interestingly  in the gold group we are seeing not only a lot of insider buying  but buying with a very broad geographic reach  It is not just the names in Nevada  Mexico and Ontario  Centerra Gold Inc   CG TSX  CADGF OTCPK   based in the Kyrgyz Republic  has gone through quite a news cycle over the past few weeks  Mine production  I believe  is expected to be restarted after some political events there  But we see some insider activity in that company as well  Centerra is a high risk stock  What the insiders seem to be signaling there is that perhaps the stock price has overshot the risks  Even when insiders are buying  you still have to look at the stock s risk profile to see if it is something you want to get into  Just because insiders are buying does not mean the stock is not risky  It sends a signal related to the risk reward outlook on average  The risk level may still be quite elevated  TGR  Which companies are on the Top 5 list for officer and director buying on the 60 day list  TD  In that time period in terms of development companies  the top net buyer was Colossus Minerals Inc   CSI TSX  COLUF OTCQX   a development focused miner in Brazil  Orex Minerals Inc   REX TSX V  would be No  2  followed by Belo Sun and Veris Gold  Large cap Turquiose Hill Resources Ltd   formerly Ivanhoe Mines Ltd    TRQ TSX  TRQ NYSE   which also owns producing assets  would be the fifth one  Luna Gold Corp   LGC TSX V   another Latin American company that you would classify as a producer  also has seen a lot of insider buying  One name that is more of a pure gold play  junior nonproducer at this point is Giyani Gold Corp   WDG TSX V   It is in South Africa  Duane Parnham  who founded Forsys Metals Corp   FSX TSX  and UNX Energy Corp   has now turned his attention to Giyani Gold  He has been buying a fair amount lately  TGR  Are well known CEOs or executives buying the junior companies  people like Ross Beaty  TD  Ross Beaty s latest purchase was in the alternate energy area  Maybe that is a story for another day  And of course  we have talked about other CEOs who have been buying  TGR  Are there any mid cap names that stand out  TD  Centerra and Luna Gold would be in that category  We saw insider buying in both Colossus Minerals and Detour Gold Corp   DGC TSX  during the selloff in April  Subsequently  both companies have gone to the capital markets to raise some money  That shows that the gold sector is perhaps not as bad as everyone thinks  It is nice to see some emerging investor interest in the sector beyond the insiders  Lately  the news flow has been so negative that sometimes it sounds as if only insiders are interested in their companies  stocks  TGR  There also is activity in some of the gold sector s biggest names  Who is buying there  TD  Peter Munk  chairman of Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   has come back to the market  He bought 100 000 shares worth  2 1 million at  21 05 share on May 9  TGR  Are other Barrick Gold executives buying its shares  TD  In the last 60 days  Peter Munk is the only insider with public market buying at the firm  A few months ago Ian Telfer  chairman of Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE   bought his company s shares  Compensation schemes at larger companies are structured a little differently than smaller companies  At Goldcorp  insider holdings have been on the rise through a combination of net public market activity and compensation related acquisitions  It is nice to see insiders building their positions at these levels  Even though some of it is compensation related  that is what we would like to see and are seeing in Goldcorp  TGR  Are you seeing any other insider buying at the big gold names  TD  There has been some net buying at Kinross Gold Corp   K TSX  KGC NYSE  and there has been a fair amount of insider activity at IAMGOLD Corp   IMG TSX  IAG NYSE   It is in fourth place on our list of direct insider buying over the last month  Over the last 90 days  IAMGOLD insiders have spent  504 778 buying shares in the public market  Notably  both the CEO and CFO have been buying shares  That is a positive contrarian signal for longer term investors with the right risk tolerance  TGR  How do your subscribers use your research  TD  One of the most popular ways of using INK is to look at what insiders are doing with their options  both when they are being granted in some of the smaller companies and when they are exercised  Do they sell all their shares  Do they hang on to all or some of them  That is particularly important in some of the mid  to larger cap companies  We want to see if they are exercising options and not selling  That is why we are encouraged by what we see at Goldcorp  A lot of the Goldcorp activity is compensation related acquisitions  It is encouraging to see insiders building their positions  That said  sometimes insiders have to sell a portion of their compensation related awards to pay taxes and the exercise costs  depending on the plan  There is no real standard in how compensation plans are structured  It is important to dig down into the details  We like to see insiders paying their taxes or exercise costs and then hold on  TGR  What are the best ways to use the information INK provides  TD  Three rules of thumb  First  good things come in small packages  Small companies are where you will get the most bang for the buck following insider activity  Second  insiders usually go against the flow  They are contrarian  When a stock is falling  it is a good signal if insiders are buying  Third  sometimes insiders go with the flow  When they are selling when everyone else is selling  that typically is not good news  When they are buying when other people are buying  it is usually pretty good news  TGR  And four and five would be to follow the CFO and look for multiple executives buying  TD  Right  Multiple executives buying along with the CFO indicates a good situation  especially if it is real discretionary buying as opposed to stock awards  If we see the CFO and other executives buying during a selloff  we have more confidence in that signal than if it is a single insider  TGR  Investors in the gold space and the junior gold space have been beaten and battered  Can you leave them with something that might raise their spirits  TD  For contrarians  the best time  up until now  to buy junior gold miners was November and December 2008  However  in the wake of the recent pullback  our insider indicators are off the charts  The time to start looking for bargains is when everyone has left the room  not when your next door neighbor is talking about the latest gold stock he or she bought  TGR  Ted  thank you for your time and

151362,372878,ETN,3 Income Oriented ETFs That Will Hold If Rates Creep Higher,opinion,An overwhelming majority of commentators seem convinced that interest rates will remain elevated  Some have suggested that 2 72  on a 10 year yield is merely a pit stop on the way to a year end close of 3 25   I myself believe that global economic uncertainty coupled with disappointing corporate guidance will push the 10 year back down to 2 25  by year s end  For that matter  I believe the Fed will wait to slow their bond buying program until 2014   At the moment  I appear to be in the minority  Still  there are a great many individuals who require an income stream from their investments  whether rates fall  settle in at their current levels or creep higher  For that reason  I think it is important to identify income oriented ETFs that are less sensitive to spikes or long term changes in Treasury bond yields   The first income oriented possibility is PowerShares Senior Bank Loan  BKLN   In the bond swoon that has seen 10 years rise 100 basis points  BKLN has only forfeited 1 6  in price appreciation  The iShares 7 10 Year Tresury Bond ETF  IEF  is down 7 5   While losing 1 6  on price may not be desirable  one is picking up roughly 4 4  in annualized income  In fact  if you haven t purchased BKLN yet  even if the 10 year rose to 3 25  by year s end  the annualized income of the remaining months in the year could still wind up generating 1 5  in income over the 6 months  If the 10 year holds flat  one might expect 2 2  in the 6 months  If the 10 year reverts to 2 25  as I suspect  BKLN would likely garner 3  in total return over a half year  which is similar to the 6  annualized that many income seekers pursue   Senior bank loans are floating rate securities from below investment grade companies  Unlike  junk bonds   these debs have seniority over other creditors and the debts have been secured by collateral  e g  real estate  etc    Better yet  since the debt  floats  over short time periods  prices and yields can rise alongside interest rates  What makes BKLN particularly attractive include distributions that occur monthly as well as diversification across 135 holdings   The second income oriented ETF is actually an exchange traded note  ETN   UBS E TRACS Alerian MLP  MLPI   While it is widely assumed that energy pipeline partnerships are interest rate sensitive  and in truth  they often are   there are plenty of instances when these high yielders have stood their ground  For example  the folks at Credit Suisse pointed out that when rates had been rising and the Fed had been tightening between mid 2004 and mid 2007  MLPs managed to outperform aggregate bond indexes as well as the S P 500  Similarly  over the last 2 months of rapidly rising interest rates  Vanguard Total Bond Market  BND  logged  3 6  while the S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY  registered 1 2   Yet MLPI picked up 1 8    In truth  domestic demand for natural gas as well as other products pushed through pipelines in the U S  is growing  It follows that the dividends that pipeline partnerships have to pay out can go up over time  price appreciation does not necessarily kill a reliable yield  And while there may be a variety of Alerian pipeline partnership ETFs and ETNs to choose from  the one with the best relative strength today is UBS E TRACS Alerian MLP  MLPI  A third income oriented ETF with potential in the current environment is Guggenheim BulletShares 2018 High Yield Corporate  BSJI   While short term high yield may be a popular way to deal with rising rates  many worry about fund premiums and discounts in volatile markets  Perhaps the best solution for an ETF enthusiast is a fund that is diversified AND has an actual maturity date  Guggenheim BulletShares 2018 High Yield Corporate  BSJI  may be situated on the tail end of the 0 5 year horizon  but investors that purchased BSJI have less desire to trade than other ETF investors  they want to hold to maturity and this exchange traded tracker should succeed in representing a held to maturity portfolio  100  securities  with effective maturities in 2018 Disclosure  Gary Gordon  MS  CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial  Inc   a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC  Gary Gordon  Pacific Park Financial  Inc  and or its clients may hold positions in the ETFs  mutual funds  and or any investment asset mentioned above  The commentary does not constitute individualized investment advice  The opinions offered herein are not personalized recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities  At times  issuers of exchange traded products compensate Pacific Park Financial  Inc  or its subsidiaries for advertising at the ETF Expert web site  ETF Expert content is created independently of any advertising relationships ,2013-07-09,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-income-oriented-etfs-that-will-hold-if-rates-creep-higher-174589,174589

151396,372912,ETN,In Spite Of The Barclays Scandal  LIBOR Product Continues To Do Well ,opinion,Most corporate  institutional  loans are LIBOR based  Loans of the more leveraged  non investment grade  companies are actively traded and popular with investors  These loans pay LIBOR plus spread and these days usually have a LIBOR floor  The floor  which is typically 1 2   gives lenders investors some rate protection  to make sure they get something even if LIBOR goes to zero   Here is a recent example of such a transaction    WideOpenWest  the telecom company known to some as WOW   is acquiring cable TV and Internet provider Knology  To finance it  WOW is arranging a  1 92 billion loan from a group of banks  The loan will be sold at a discount  95  to make it appealing to investors and is paying LIBOR   5  with a 1 25  LIBOR floor  The banks will provide the initial financing and will then sell  syndicate  most of the loan to investors    Investors in this loan are exposed to LIBOR  yet there is no shortage of such investors   from CLOs to mutual funds  The asset class can be volatile because these firms tend to be non investment grade  WOW for example is single B rated   But in spite of the LIBOR scandal and market volatility  these LIBOR paying loans have performed well recently  as shown by the S P leveraged loan index below Demand for securitized LIBOR based product has also been strong  Blackstone just completed a half a billion dollar CLO  priced by Citigroup  with all the tranches  as well as the collateral  being LIBOR based  And Citi apparently had no trouble placing the LIBOR based tranches Even retail investors keep buying LIBOR product  As an example consider the Eaton Vance Floating Rate Fund  ticker symbol EABLX  that focuses on leveraged loans  The mutal fund  which is up 4 4  YTD  is over  7bn in assets and growing  Following Barclays  admission of misconduct  flows into such mutual funds have kept up  adding  357 million between June 28 and July 9  according to EPFR  in spite of the turmoil in Europe  According to LCD  managers for such funds as well as separately managed loan accounts have seen no letup in new cash  People want these products because they provide current income and protect against rising rates  If rates spike  LIBOR will go up  supposedly   increasing coupon payments on these loans With all the regulatory actions and pending lawsuits associated with LIBOR  investors just yawn and keep buying more LIBOR based product  The Barclays LIBOR scandal has so far not deterred investors from continuing to bet on LIBOR   an artificial index that is not based on actual transactions  The market still relies on a bunch of assistant bank treasurers  guessing  a daily number that they send out to the British Bankers Association  Old habits die hard ,2012-07-15,Sober Look,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/in-spite-of-the-barclays-scandal,-libor-product-continues-to-do-well-129613",129613
151398,372914,ETN,Structured Products For Nervous Investors ,opinion,Structured products for retail investors are back  For those who have some extra money  there are always structured CDs  like    And then we have exchange traded structured notes for everyone else  Like this note called eUnit  ticker symbol ETUA  from Eaton Vance    It is the eternal investor dilemma  How to invest in the stock market  without the risk   Eaton Vance Corp  thinks it has a solution  The Boston based company  with  192 billion in assets under management  earlier this year launched an unusual structured product with returns that are tied to the Standard   Poor s 500 stock index  Experts say it could be the first of similar products to follow   Called an eUnit Trust  the investment limits the amount of losses an investor can sustain  but also caps the earnings during the lifetime of the investment a period of two years How does Eaton Vance put one of these together  Actually it s quite simple  They take investors  money and do 4 things with it   1  Buy 2 year treasuries  2  Buy a 2 year in the money call on the S P500 index  3  To reduce the cost of the purchased call  they sell an out of the money call on the S P500  4  And of course charge 75bp per year  The timing is good because implied volatility is relatively cheap  Here is what the payout looks like Below is the performance so far  underperforming the S P500   Because of movements in implied volatility and the note trading at premium discount to assets  one needs to hold it to maturity in order to get the full benefit of the payout structure So far there isn t much liquidity in these notes  maybe 1 500 shares per day   The product can certainly be replicated in a brokerage account that permits buying and shorting options  But one would need to put on size to do better than 75bp per year  That s why if this works out for Eaton Vance  there will be more products like this in the market ,2012-07-25,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/structured-products-for-nervous-investors-130804,130804
151399,372915,ETN,Eaton Corp  Stock Research Analysis ,opinion,It s always to an investor s advantage to find a terrific company that they would like to invest in on sale  When you can buy a great business for less than it s worth  you simultaneously increase your long term return potential while lowering your risk  In other words  you are buying the company s growth at a better value  When you can find the additional benefit of an above average dividend yield  that s even better We believe Eaton Corp  ETN  currently represents such an opportunity  The company can be purchased at a discount to its earnings justified fair value  and offers a dividend yield of over 3 3   light blue hightlighting   We recommend doing your own due diligence  but Eaton Corp looks like a classic buy low today to sell later at a higher value with a nice yield to sweeten the pot    Eaton Corporation is a diversified power management company with more than 100 years of experience providing energy efficient solutions that help our customers effectively manage electrical  hydraulic and mechanical power  With 2011 sales of  16 0 billion  Eaton is a global technology leader in electrical components  systems and services for power quality  distribution and control  hydraulics components  systems and services for industrial and mobile equipment  aerospace fuel  hydraulics and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use  and truck and automotive drivetrain and powertrain systems for performance  fuel economy and safety  Eaton has approximately 73 000 employees and sells products to customers in more than 150 countries   Earnings Determine Market Price  The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings   Earnings And Price Correlated Fundamentals At A Glance A quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  on Eaton Corp shows a picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 14 6  and a current PE of 11  Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 12   and when you look at the forecasting graph below  the stock appears undervalued   it s outside of the value corridor of the five orange lines   based on future growth   Eaton Corp  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal PE Since 2003  Performance Table Eaton CorpThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 9 3  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of Eaton Corp  assuming an initial investment of  1 000  would have received an additional  390 66 in dividends  blue highlighting  that increased their total return from 9 3  to 11 1  per annum versus 5 2  in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 2003 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Eaton Corp is  97 which is historically normal  Looking To The FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 20 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Eaton Corp s long term earnings growth at 12   orange circle   Eaton Corp has medium long term debt at 31  of capital  red circle   Eaton Corp is currently trading at a P E of 11  which is below the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  orange arrow   If the earnings materialize as forecast  Eaton Corp s True Worth  valuation would be  112 67 at the end of 2017  brown circle on EYE Chart   which would be a 20 3  annual rate of return from the current price  yellow highlighting  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Eaton Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds  illustrates that Eaton Corp s expected earnings would be 8 7  purple circle  times that of the 10 year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component Summary And ConclusionsThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although  with

151421,372937,ETN,Eaton Vance Corp  Get Paid To Invest In A Long Tradition Of Investing Excellence ,opinion,Historically  the best time to invest in Eaton Vance Corp  EV  is when its price is aligned with its earnings justified valuation as it is now  The market has traditionally applied a premium valuation to Eaton Vance where the entry dividend yield has usually been below 2   However  at today s valuation  new investors have the opportunity to invest with the yield close to 3   Consequently  Eaton Vance appears to offer attractive capital appreciation and an above average and potentially growing dividend    This article looks at Eaton Vance Corp  a Dividend Champion  through the lens of the F A S T  Graphs  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool   Since a picture is worth a thousand words  the reader will be provided the  essential fundamentals at a glance  expressed vividly in pictures    In order to provide you the opportunity to research this company deeper and faster we are providing a link to a live  fully functioning earnings and price correlated set of graphs     Tip   Run your mouse over the various lines and watch the graphs come to life     A Dividend Champion is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 25 or more straight years  Eaton Vance Corp is a dividend champion that has raised its dividend every year for 31 consecutive years   The complete Dividend Champions list is compiled     Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Champions list      Eaton Vance Corp   NYSE  EV  is one of the oldest investment management firms in the United States  with a history dating to 1924  Eaton Vance and its affiliates offer individuals and institutions a broad array of investment strategies and wealth management solutions  The Company s long record of exemplary service  timely innovation and attractive returns through a variety of market conditions has made Eaton Vance the investment manager of choice for many of today s most discerning investors     Eaton Vance Corp  A Dividend Champion with 31 Consecutive Years of Dividend Increases   Learning from the Past   Looking at Earnings Only   Since dividends are paid out of earnings  a clear perspective of a company s historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor s prudent due diligence process  The following graph plots Eaton Vance Corp s earnings per share since 1998   A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Eaton Vance Corp has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 14 2   see purple circle on graph  per annum  Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income  The following earnings and price correlated  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income  The earnings growth rate line or True Worth   line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings    Since dividends are paid out of earnings  and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at  they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line  Therefore  a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed    1    The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide  2    The percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends  payout ratio     The value in this article is through carefully analyzing the earnings and price correlated fundamentally based graphs  Notice that one glance tells you how well the company has performed on an operating basis historically and how the market valued that historical performance  Therefore  the reader is free to discover whether or not current valuations make sense based on historical norms coupled with fundamental values  Instead of opinion  this article is designed to produce facts that can be analyzed to the readers investing benefit  Performance Table  Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Eaton Vance CorpThe associated performance results  with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return   Capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 12 8  capital appreciation  Closing Annualized ROR   long term shareholders of Eaton Vance Corp would have received an additional  103 522 92 in dividends that increased their total return from 12 8  to 14 1  per annum  Note  Since this is a Dividend Champion it  has raised its dividend every year for at least 25 years  therefore   negative dividend growth rates shown  if any  will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company s regularly reported dividend rate The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio  the dark blue line  correlated with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 1998 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio  The current price to sales ratio for Eaton Vance Corp is 2 45  which is historically normal Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns  and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore  forecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound  and profitable performance Therefore  it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  At its current price  which is attractively aligned with its True Worth  valuation  Eaton Vance Corp represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Champion at a reasonable price  The important factor is that Eaton Vance Corp has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price  This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 10 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Eaton Vance Corp long term earnings growth at 9   Eaton Vance Corp is currently trading at a P E of 14 1  which is inside the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  Eaton Vance Corp s True Worth valuation would be  44 89 at the end of 2017  which would be a 12 6  annual rate of return from the current price  including assumed dividends Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Eaton Vance Corp to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Eaton Vance Corp s expected earnings would be 5 8 times that of the 10 Year T Bond Interest   See EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component This report presents essential  fundamentals at a glance  on Dividend Champion Eaton Vance Corp  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot
