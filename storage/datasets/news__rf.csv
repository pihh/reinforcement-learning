106700,328215,RF,A Fed interest rate cut is in the bag  What then ,news,"By Ann Saphir SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    U S  central bankers are expected to lower borrowing costs this week for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis more than a decade ago  That s the easy part  Whether that inaugurates a series of quarter percentage point interest rate cuts that could stretch deep into next year  as financial markets are betting  or something more limited  is by far the harder decision facing Federal Reserve policymakers  One reason  No clear consensus from Fed officials about why they need to cut rates in the first place  particularly with the U S  unemployment rate near a 50 year low and the American economy puttering along as the best in class performer among developed nations  Is it a bit of insurance against risks posed by slowing global growth and trade tensions  A step to bolster sluggish inflation  A bid to lift labor markets further  An effort to right kinks in the bond market  Over the last several weeks  Fed policymakers have floated each of these ideas and others   New York Fed President John Williams  NYSE WMB  even briefly convinced markets the Fed planned to cut rates by half a percentage point this week  until the New York Fed issued a statement to explain that his remarks about  vaccinating  the economy against serious illness were academic in nature and not meant to signal near term policy decisions   Complicating matters is the Fed s desire to make clear that loosening monetary policy is not a reaction to months of pressure from U S  President Donald Trump to do just that   Investors should get some clarity when the Fed s rate setting committee releases its policy statement at 2 p m  EDT  1800 GMT  on Wednesday after the end of a two day meeting  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference shortly after  CROSSCURRENTS Economists and traders overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut its policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday  matching the size of each of the nine rate hikes the Fed delivered from 2015 to 2018  The big debate at the July 30 31 meeting will be about what comes next  and how to communicate it  Cornerstone Macro economist Roberto Perli said    I bet the statement will     leave the door open to more  to at least another 25  basis point cut  down the road   Perli said   But as for what economic threshold would trigger a further rate cut  he said   I don t think they have a clear idea    The federal funds rate is currently set in a range of 2 25  to 2 50   Traders of futures tied to the rate have priced in a full percentage point drop by the end of next year  But the economic picture now is quite different from the last few times the Fed has cut rates  Since the Fed s last rate setting meeting in mid June  economic data on retail sales and job creation have been stronger than expected  and durable goods orders  a proxy for business spending plans  jumped in June  At the same time  U S  home sales tumbled  manufacturing has been weak for months  and exports are down   A report on Friday showed robust consumer spending kept the U S  economy growing at a 2 1  pace in the second quarter  a smaller slowdown than expected  But it also underscored the weak business investment and inflation that has worried Powell  The competing threads are likely to feed a robust debate during the meeting over whether a rate cut is even needed  and may limit how much more easing could be signaled    I think it s a stretch to think this either is or should be the beginning of an easing cycle  it s simply not warranted   said Ward McCarthy  chief U S  economist at Jefferies   Some Fed policymakers  including Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren  may even go so far as to register their reservations over further easing with a formal dissent    MORE LEEWAY  Still  the Fed has a lot to contend with   Mounting signs of weakness in Europe and China and the prospect that new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make a messy exit from the European Union have raised the odds of rate cuts abroad  with the European Central Bank looking all but certain to ease policy come September   Some see rate reductions overseas as building the case for reducing U S  rates   Indeed that s been a core argument from Trump  who has accused foreign central bankers of using monetary policy to devalue their currencies  On Monday  Trump repeated those criticisms   The E U  and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems  making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product   he wrote on Twitter   In the meantime  and with very low inflation  our Fed does nothing   and probably will do very little by comparison  Too bad    In gauging the Fed s next step  investors will have no  dot plot  to consult  as they have after with every other policy move since the Fed began in 2012 to publish quarterly interest rate forecasts from individual policymakers  Because those forecasts have at times been at odds with the Fed s agreed upon policy message  their absence could actually make Powell s task easier   Not having the projections this month gives them a lot more leeway in sending a message of  we ll respond as warranted    said Richard Moody  chief economist at Regions Financial Corp  NYSE RF    The Fed could also put an early end to planned reductions to its  3 8 trillion balance sheet  built up during years of bond buying after the 2007 2009 Great Recession  The runoff  seen as tightening policy on the margins  is scheduled to end in September in any case   Ending it slightly early could defuse criticism that balance sheet policy is working at cross purposes with interest rate policy  And should the Fed disappoint markets by signaling further rate cuts are less than a sure thing  Moody said  a change to the balance sheet plan could be a  consolation prize

106701,328216,RF,Regions Financial  RF  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Regions Financial  RF  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 17  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This holding company for Regions Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 47 billion  up 2 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 7  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regions Financial 
For Regions Financial  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Regions Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Regions Financial would post earnings of  0 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering no surprise 
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Regions Financial doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/regions-financial-rf-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200498017,200498017

The bank s results are estimated to reflect year over year rise in both revenues and earnings This Birmingham  AL based company s third quarter 2019 earnings compared favorably with the prior year quarter s earnings  recording a 5 4  increase  Lower expenses and higher non interest income were the positives  However  lower net interest income  due to reduced market interest rates and elevated provisions  were major drags Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings has remained unchanged at 39 cents in the last seven days  This  however  suggests a year over year improvement of 5 4   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  1 47 billion indicates 2 1  growth from the prior year quarter s reported tally Notably  the company s share price has appreciated post third quarter earnings  For the three month period ended Dec 31  2019  the stock has gained around 11  Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions  stock  This depends largely on whether or not the firm is able to post a beat in the fourth quarter  Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlaySoft Loan Growth  Per the Fed s latest   rise in loans is likely to have been low on a sequential basis for the December end quarter  Particularly  weakness in revolving home equity loans and commercial and industrial  C I  are expected to have offset growth

Notably  management s anticipations of loan growth in 2019 will likely be reflected in the quarterly results  The bank projects adjusted average loans to display year over year growth in low single digits Net Interest Income  NII  Disappointing  A dismal lending scenario   mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial  and revolving home equity   during the fourth quarter might have adversely impacted net interest income  NII  Further  the Federal Reserve s accommodative monetary policy stance  with decline in interest rates  three rate cuts in July  September and October   and its impact on the yield curve are likely to have dampened net interest margin in the to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  109 6 billion for the quarter is almost stable  The consensus estimate of  941 million for NII reflects around 1  sequential decline Non Interest Income Improving  Rise in components of income is anticipated to have aided increase in non interest income in the fourth quarter  Fixed income trading revenues are likely to have increased owing to rise in client activity Further  consumer spending trend was stronger during the October December quarter  which is likely to have bolstered the bank s credit and debit card revenues  Additionally  mortgage banking performance is also projected to have improved  aided by lower mortgage rates  which drove refinancing activities during the quarter Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is  50 million  up 38 9  sequentially  while commercial credit fee income

OperatorGood morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation s quarterly earnings call  My name is Shelby and I will be your operator for today s call   Operator Instructions I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin Dana Nolan    Executive Vice President and Head of Investor RelationsThank you  Shelby  Welcome to Regions  fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call  John Turner will provide highlights of our financial performance  and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter  Earnings related documents  including forward looking statements  are available under the Investor Relations section of our website  These disclosures cover our presentation materials  prepared comments  as well as the Q A segment of today s call With that  I will now turn the call over to John John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Dana  and thank you all for joining our call day  Let me begin by saying that we re pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results  This morning  we reported strong full year earnings from continuing operations of  1 5 billion  resulting in a 10  year over year increase in diluted earnings per share This year  we also delivered the highest level of pre tax pre provision income in over a decade  while generating 4  positive operating leverage on a reported basis and 2  on an adjusted basis  Despite lower interest rates and significant market volatility  2019 was a solid year  and I m proud of all that we accomplished  We continue to make progress on our goal of generating consistent sustainable long term performance through all phases the economic cycle Although market uncertainty continues  the economy is still growing  Our customers are optimistic about their businesses and consumer confidence remains healthy  We re also encouraged by the progress made on the trade front  However  we will continue to monitor geopolitical tensions and the uncertainties they introduce  As we begin the New Year  we have solid momentum and feel good about how we re positioned We have a comprehensive hedging strategy in place to protect net interest income  so we don t have to stretch for loan growth  Our core businesses continue to produce good results generating growth in consumer checking accounts and households  credit cards and wealth assets under management  We re very pleased with the performance of our priority markets and investments in our businesses continue to pay off  We have a robust credit risk management framework and  while asset quality continues to normalize  overall it remains pretty benign And finally  although we ve made significant progress through Simplify and Grow  really one third complete with our current list of identified initiatives  there are a lot of process improvements and a revenue generating opportunities left  We continue to leverage digital across our omni channel platform to better meet customer needs and improve efficiency and effectiveness A few quick examples  Four year checking account and credit card production increased 17  and 65  respectively  Loan applications increased 54   and in mortgage approximately 60  of all applications are completed online  Mobile deposits increased 52  and now represent 13  of all deposits As we look forward  we re focused on the things we can t control  meet the needs of our customers with best in class service while leveraging technology and making banking easier for our associates and customers  We ll continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business generating positive operating leverage through discipline expense management and prudent investment decisions  Our priorities sit on soundness  profitability  and growth in that order Thank you for your time and attention this morning  Before I turn the call over to David  I want to thank the 19 000 plus associates here at Regions for their commitment and dedication throughout 2019  Because of this team  I m confident about 2020 and feel good about our plans which support delivering consistent  sustainable results through all phases of the economic cycle David David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  John  Let s start with balance sheet  Adjusted average total loans decreased less than 1   while ending total loans increased modestly  Adjusted average consumer loans increased 1   led by increases in indirect other  credit card  and mortgage  partially offset by declines in home equity  Average business loans decreased 1  and were impacted by our continued focus on client selectivity and overall relationship profitability  as well as lower line utilization and elevated paydown activity during the quarter We continue to focus on risk adjusted returns and are not interested in pursuing nominal loan growth for short term benefit  That said  we expect full year 2020 average loan balances to remain relatively stable on a reported basis and to grow in the low single digits on an adjusted basis  Similar to 2019  we expect 2020 loan growth to be led by business services lending  specifically C I loans with modest growth in owner occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate  Within consumer lending  we expect growth in residential mortgage  indirect other  card  and direct lending Turning to average deposits  Reflecting seasonal trends  average corporate segment deposits increased 4   average wealth segment deposits increased 1  while average consumer segment deposits remain relatively stable  Of note  total non interest bearing deposits grew 1 5  during the quarter  Deposit growth in the business segments was partially offset by a 51  decline in the other segment deposits  due primarily to reductions within wholesale corporate treasury deposit categories reflective of a lower need for wholesale borrowings So let s look at how that s impacted net interest income and margin  Net interest income declined 2  linked quarter and net interest margin declined 5 basis points to 3 39   Net interest margin and net interest income were negatively impacted by lower market interest rates  However  this was partially offset by declining deposit cost and a more favorable funding mix  Lower loan balances reduced net interest income but benefited net interest margin With respect to funding  we ve completed the cash tender offer during the quarter for approximately two thirds of our outstanding 3 2  parent company senior notes incurring  16 million in extinguishment costs  The estimated run rate benefit in 2020 is an increase to annual net interest income of approximately  15 million and a 1 to 2 basis point improvement in margin As expected  total deposit cost declined 8 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 41 basis points and interest bearing deposit cost declined 13 basis points to 64 basis points  The associated deposit beta was 28  this quarter  Regions continues to deliver industry leading performance in the space  exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise  Assuming a stable rate environment  we expect modest reductions of deposit cost moving forward Now that the majority of our forward starting hedges have begun  our balance sheet is largely insulated from movement in short term rates and additional hedging and securities repositioning have reduced roughly half of our sensitivity to longer term rates   4 5 billion of forward starting hedges were added during the quarter aimed at locking in a portion of 2020 fixed rate originations  Looking ahead  during the first quarter  we expect the margins to expand in the low 340s as the benefits of our hedging strategy begin Now let s take a look at fee revenue and expenses  Adjusted non interest income increased 1  compared to the third quarter  led by growth in capital markets  wealth management and service charges  Capital markets experienced a record quarter driven by growth across most categories  notably M A advisory  loan syndications  and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers Commercial swap income also benefited from favorable CVA adjustments during the quarter  Although mortgage income decreased compared to the prior quarter  results remained strong despite seasonally lower production as well as less favorable hedging and valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights  For the full year  mortgage was a significant contributor to non interest income growth increasing 19   Other non interest income declined this quarter  driven primarily by positive valuation adjustments to certain equity investments in the prior quarter that did not repeat at the same level Let s move on to the non interest expense  Adjusted non interest expenses remain well controlled  increasing slightly compared to the prior quarter  driven primarily by higher salaries and benefits  marketing and professional fees  Salaries and benefits increased modestly driven by higher production based incentives  The increase in marketing expense was driven primarily by additional campaigns targeting priority markets  while professional fees reflected the timing of legal and consulting costs The company s fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 58 1   and the effective tax rate was 20 3   As John mentioned  we continue to benefit from our continuous improvement process as we were only one third complete with our current list of identified initiatives  several of which are exceeding our initial expectations For example  at Investor Day  we committed to reducing our total square footage by 2 1 million square feet and our third party spend by  60 million to  65 million by 2021  We also disclosed plans to consolidate 100 branches during that same period Based on the progress we made in 2019  we re on track to exceed our targets related to square footage and third party spend reductions as well as branch consolidations  We re now targeting third party spend reductions in the  80 million to  85 million range  and we will continue to look for opportunities to pull forward or expand on initatives where we can For 2020  we recognize revenue growth will be challenging  However  we remain committed to achieving full year adjusted positive operating leverage  While our hedging strategy helps mitigate the risk from lower rates  full year growth and net interest income will be difficult  We have good momentum in growing non interest revenue  which we expect to continue  So while total revenue growth may be modest  we will continue to lean into the expenses and the opportunities identified through simplifying growth  all the while continuing to make prudent investments to drive revenue growth We ll again spend approximately  625 million on technology in 2020  We expect to open approximately 20 new branches and we will continue to hire talented bankers across our businesses  With respect to the effective tax rate  we expect the full year 2020 range to be 20  to 22  So let s shift to asset quality  Overall credit results remained in line with our risk expectations during the quarter  We saw improvement in several categories while experiencing some normalization in others  Net charge offs were 46 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year  in line with our expected range of 40 to 50 basis points for 2019 Provision equaled net charge offs  resulting in an allowance equal to 1 05  of total loans and 171  of total non accrual loans  Nonperforming loans increased 10   primarily attributable to single credit within the waste management industry  which we expect will be resolved over the next several quarters  Delinquencies and total debt restructured loans remain stable quarter over quarter while business services criticized loans decreased 3   For 2020  we expect full year net charge offs between 45 and 55 basis points Let me comment briefly on CECL  We continue to finalize our day one impact assumptions and expect the impact to be in the  500 million to  530 million range  So let s take a look at capital and liquidity  During the quarter  the company repurchased 7 8 million shares of common stock for  132 million and declared  149 million in common dividends  Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 9 6   in line with our target level of 9 5   The low deposit ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 85  The next slide reflects 2019 performance against our targets  and we ve also provided you with a summary of full year 2020 expectations  Wrapping things up  in light of the challenging and changing economic backdrop  we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial results  We have a solid strategic plan designed to deliver consistent and sustainable performance throughout any economic cycle With that  we re happy to take your questions but do ask that each caller ask only one question to allow for

Najarian of Bank of America Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  good morning John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Erika Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystSo we hear you loud and clear  and I think your investors appreciate your continued discipline in loan underwriting  I think you alluded to in previous calls  potential wholesale consumer strategies to offset some of the GreenSky runoff  I mean  I know you listed the categories  David  during your prepared remarks  but maybe dive a little bit into detail about some of the consumer strategy  And could there be a potential wholesale strategy  And again  I m not asking if you re buying a depository in terms of obtaining portfolios or accelerating partnerships to deploy your loan to deposit ratio of 85  David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Hello  Good morning  So  as we mentioned in the prepared comments  the growth will    we should experience actually be it more on the business services side  On the consumer side  we re going to continue to have our runoff of our indirect auto portfolio that will put pressure on total balances  We have made some shift in terms of our indirect other consumer  we saw that in the fourth quarter  That ll continue somewhat in the first part of the year  then we kind of get to our concentration limit after the first quarter or so So you shouldn t see that continue to grow at the same pace that you saw in the fourth quarter throughout the year  We are going to continue to grow residential mortgage  we are going to continue to grow our credit card books as well  Those will be the big drivers of consumer  but net net  total consumer will be relatively stable if you carve out the runoff portfolio  So the growth that we re trying to send the message really is going to come in the    primarily in the C I area John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerBut Erika  I would say  we are actively observing what s going on in the market  looking for opportunities  We re evaluating different opportunities that may come along  Clearly  we shifted our exposure from the GreenSky relationship to increasing our exposure through so far that is largely a result in fact that so far is originating loans directly to consumers versus indirectly  which was the GreenSky model  We like that better  We re learning more about so far and the portfolio we have  and I think you can expect us to continue to explore ways    other ways to grow consumer loans over the next year Erika Najarian    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  I ll go back into queue  Thank you OperatorYour next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystGood morning  You raised your net charge offs guidance slightly for 2020 versus  19  Just wondering kind of what s driving that  Is it more conservatism or are you seeing some underlying weakness in any certain portfolios  Thanks David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJennifer  this is David  So  we had 40 to 50 basis points last year  We ve raised that slightly about 45 to 55 basis points acknowledging a couple different things  One  if you look at last couple of quarters  we were at 44 to 46  We also see some normalization of credit  especially on the consumer side  We also  as Erika just mentioned  some shift in terms of consumer lending into other higher loss categories  We feel good about that because we re getting paid for the risk that we take  But if you re just looking at the charge off number in isolation  it will be up perhaps slightly  So  we didn t think that  That s really not signal signaling any broad deterioration in credit  whatsoever Jennifer Demba    SunTrust    AnalystThank you OperatorYour next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Thank you Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  Good morning  I was wondering if you can follow up the CECL discussion and help us understand how you re starting to think about the day two impacts  especially given some of the moving parts of your ins and outs on the consumer portfolio side and your already high 1 7  ish looks like pro forma reserve to loans ratio  Do you think you ll have to meaningfully build as you go forward and how do you start to help us understand that  Thank you David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think the best way  So  we need to see what everybody else comes up within CECL  Clearly  the type of lending that you have  your portfolio makes a big difference  Consumer  long dated assets  duration assets have a much higher seasonal reserve to that  As you think about CECL for day two  the first thing you ought to think about is  what s the charge off expectations  and Jennifer just brought that up  From that  then you look at loan growth we ve told you was on an absolute basis  our loans would be flat  On an adjusted basis  they would be up a bit  So  not a lot of change there Then you have to think through the mix  what are you growing versus what s running off  And so  we ll give you better clarity on that at a later date  So  we don t see a big change in CECL this particular year because we don t currently forecast a change in the economic outlook  And that s something that all of us need to be aware of as when you forecast the change in the economic outlook  they can cause a little bit of volatility in provisioning  So  those are really the key pieces that I think you should consider as you try to model the provision for next year Ken Usdin    Jefferies    AnalystAll right  Thank you  David OperatorYour next question is from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystGood morning John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Peter Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystYou guys had a good year on the core fee income growth  it s up about 6   Do you think mid single digit growth is going to be sustainable in 2020  And just if you could talk about some of the businesses where you see some of the better growth David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  Peter  we were very pleased with our growth in the year for non interest revenue  in particular in the fourth quarter  If you take our top three categories  those are really driven by continued growth in customers  So  growing customer checking account  growing operating accounts  growing customers from the wealth standpoint  those are all critically important to us and we feel good about that  We ve hired additional personnel during 2019 that will help us continue to grow customer accounts As you look at mortgage  mortgage had a really good year this year  It ll be hard to repeat that for all of 2020  but mortgage will be a big contributor to non interest revenue and we feel good about where we are there  Capital markets had a really strong fourth quarter  We ve mentioned to you before that that business has been about a  45 million to  55 million revenue per quarter business  We think that that number is really in the kind of  50 million to  60 million business for us now  So  we think relative to 2019 capital markets should have some nice growth  Get off to a pretty slow start in 2019  we think it s going to get off to a nice in 2020 based on the backlog of the business that we see  So  when you add all that up  we have pretty good confidence that we re going to have nice growth in non interest revenue  And frankly that is one of the key drivers of why we re committed to and believe we will generate positive operating leverage in a challenging rate environment for 2020 Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystThanks  And just one quick follow up  You guys have done also good job on controlling the deposit costs with higher rates and we ve seen deposit costs coming down already with the cutting rates  So I m just wondering  a total deposit cost of 41 basis points  is there much room left to lower deposit cost David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe    our beta for this past quarter was about 28   That s a little lower than our cumulative beta  and our cumulative beta is about 27  down cycle  That slightly below what we saw in the upright cycle  And as a result of that  we think there s    if we stay flat here  there s no movement  which we don t expect much movement from the Fed  we would continue to have deposit cost come down some more  It s probably not at the rate that you ve seen  but I think there s incremental continued benefit there  And again  that s part of our margin guidance that we ve given you too that we think margin can expand along with the hedging program that we have that margin would expand a bit in 2020 Peter Winter    Wedbush Securities    AnalystThat s great  Thanks  David OperatorYour next question comes from Matt O Connor of Deutsche Bank John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Matt Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystHi  So  look I know there s some kind of drag to loan growth in  call it  the near term here  and I think that the derisking  You guys have been very consistent and has been well received  I guess my question is like  if we look more medium term and think about the type of loan growth that you should have  the type of deposit growth that you should have  considering a market  it s like what s reasonable levels again beyond 2020  just thinking  And the reason I m asking is  I just    I feel like the balance sheet growth has been less than most of us would expect  given the economies  given your market  But I m also appreciative of the derisking and call it the focus on the profitability  which has helped them free up some capital  But maybe talk about the other medium term outlook for those two areas  Thank you David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  Matt  we have been extremely deliberate in allocating capital to those relationships that give us the appropriate risk adjusted return  Because at the end of the day  that s what we think really is what our investors want us to do with the capital and not just to grow  but to grow appropriately and grow with right return As just an example  this year  we recycled  2 billion worth of credit out of our core banking group that we could have had    we could add an additional  2 billion of loan growth  there would ve been a suboptimal return  These are customers that we seek to sell and offer more of our banking services  so we can have a full relationship with great returns  And when we can t get that  when it comes up for renewal  we let it go  And so  we re going to stick to that Now that being said  as you think about loan growth for us in the short and long term is  we should be GDP plus a little bit  Our expectation for GDP this coming year is slightly under 2   As a matter of fact  it s 1 8  in our estimate  So  we have low single digits of loan growth expectations for    on an adjusted basis for 2020  And it s because if we try to push too hard past GDP  we think you make a bad credit decision  So  we re going to be credibly disciplined  We realize we need to grow  We re all about that  growing earnings  growing revenues and returns  And so  it s all of the delicate balance of how we do that appropriately Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGot it  Just any guess on relative to kind of industry growth or kind of GDP growth  as you think about medium term  kind of loan to deposit growth rates John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I d say  that we ve said consistently that we    and David reiterated this  we want to grow with the economy plus a little  recognizing that while the markets we re in are good growth markets  there are also markets that historically have demonstrated a fair amount of volatility  And so  it s important to us that we stay disciplined  as David said  focused on appropriate allocation of capital and we think growing with the economy plus a little is the right place for us medium term and longer term Matt O Connor    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorYour next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Gerard  Gerard  you might be on mute OperatorGerard  your line is open David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Why don t we go to the next question  We lost Gerard OperatorCertainly  Your next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystHey  Hello  Good morning  guys John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Saul Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystGood morning  I guess  a follow up question on CECL  As Ken mentioned  your ACL ratio moves up with your day one impact to over 1 7   which seems pretty high given the risk profile of your loan book and the composition of your loan book  The only banks who    very few banks who ve given day one impacts are above that level unless they have much more consumer oriented exposure  And I know a lot of things go into it  I know you have more term loans in your C I book  for example I mean  I guess how conservative do you think that estimate is  And if I look forward to the day two impact  and you think about what you said David on mix  it would seem    how do I think about the lost content of what s coming on your books versus what s getting paid up  Because it would seem given your derisking that 1 7  reserve ratio could trend lower going forward or is that too aggressive of a comment or an expectation David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  yes  few questions with that  Let me see if I can break it down  So  the 1 70  relative to others  you really    the mix is hugely important  I suspect when we get to providing more granular disclosures by loan type and breaking that down so that you will have a better gauge as to what new production would cost and what benefit you might get for a run off of our loan portfolio  So  we don t    we tried to get this right  We ve tightened up the range quite a bit between  500 million and  530 million  That s akin to our 1 1  reserve today  which includes the reserve for unfunded commitments to 1 70  So  I think that you re going to need some incremental disclosures to help you on a go forward basis  We ll be providing that to you at a later point  but we think the reserve that we have for CECL is pretty appropriate  And we didn t do anything to be overly conservative or otherwise  We just did what we thought the standard called for  and we re moving forward  We will all learn a little bit from each other as we go through the year  and we ll be making decisions on how that might affect our business and production and pricing going forward Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystGot it  And I guess  just following up like in terms of how we should be thinking about provisions going forward  should we be thinking that 1 7  lifetime ratio is sort of appropriate  and we should be provisioning to maintain that level of reserve ratio going forward John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think  for the time being  as I was trying to get to that point earlier is  if you think about provisioning for 2020  the first thing you ought to think about is  what s your charge off expectation for us next year  Then  what is a loan growth    net loan growth expectation for us next year  we ve given you guidance that says our net loans will be flat  We ll grow on an adjusted basis  but we have our run off of our vehicle portfolio that will be working against balances there  And then  you third    and so  the third component would be  what are you growing  The mix makes a difference  And we ll give you some more granular data later to help you there  And then  what s your expectation of the economic outlook from quarter to quarter  and that could be    that could change  Now  we think the economy is going to be fairly stable this year  that s our going in thought  but that can change  And so  those are the roughly four pieces that you need to have in terms of projecting seasonal provisioning Saul Martinez    UBS    AnalystGot it  All right  That s helpful  Thanks a lot Operator Operator Instructions  Your next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  John John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystRegarding your expectation for positive operating leverage in 2020  can you help size up the magnitude or maybe give us just a little bit more color around it regarding the components  And then  also why not provide more detailed outlook around  20  You previously have given full year expense growth and full year revenue targets  What s different about this year that you re not giving that David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  let s see if I can help you there  So  let s take that big component  So  NII  which is two thirds of our revenue  will be very hard to grow that this year with the low single digit loan growth on an adjusted basis that we have given you  And that s just a mere rate play  the first half of  19 rates being up off the December  18 rate increase would be hard to replicate  And then  for the other third of our revenue NIR  we ve given you a little bit of guidance in terms of what you can model  We feel good about that growth From an expense standpoint  we said we d be relatively stable from an expense standpoint  And if you add all three of those up  we will generate positive operating leverage  So  I think we ve been reasonably explicit in terms of how we get there  so you can play with the numbers from that standpoint John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Thanks  David  And then I just want to confirm on what you just said that relatively stable expectation for 2020 expenses  That already factors in your IT investments and what you re doing on the core systems front David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAbsolutely John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would underscore the point  John  that includes our continued investments in talent  in markets and in technology  We re not adjusting our budgets at all  and we believe we can continue to deliver stable expenses year over year John Pancari    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Got it  All right  Thank you OperatorYour final question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan StanleyJohn M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Betsy Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHi  good morning  I m going to ask the capital question  I know I always do on this call  But I did want to understand how you re thinking about capital utilization  not only in your base case assumption where you ve got net loan growth flat in total  but in an environment where things    actually loan growth accelerates a little bit more  maybe you should give us a sense as to  do we just hold with this  what I would consider a little bit of excess capital or is the pipeline of bolt ons are robust enough to use some of this or do we anticipate a little bit more buyback this year  Thanks David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So it s always a good question on capital  Just to reiterate how we think about utilization of the capital we generated  So  first off  we re getting close to our target we laid out  9 6  common equity Tier 1 today  estimated on our current target of 9 5   As we ve mentioned before  that has 50 basis points of management buffer  Our quantitative calculations set would lead us to believe we need about 9  common equity Tier 1 As we think about  first and foremost  our capital is there for us to grow appropriately    organically in particular  And so  we have low single digit loan growth expectations and you can do some quick math and see we will use a little bit of capital from that standpoint We ve targeted that 35  to 45  of our earnings to go and be paid to our shareholders in the form of a dividend  So you have that piece  We have from time to time terms some bolt on acquisitions  Those use capital  hadn t been today  up time  but it s certainly something if we see opportunities  John just talked about  we look at different things from time to time  and if we can deploy that capital in a meaningful manner that helps grow our long term business  we will do so And then  frankly  the last thing we do is share repurchases  We aren t crazy about doing share repurchases  but we also don t want to continue to have excess capital  So  if we can t deploy it in a meaningful manner through organic loan growth  bolt on acquisitions  then we ll give that back to the shareholders in the form of share repurchases like we ve done this past several years  So I think those are the pieces that you need to have Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Is there anything on the bolt on front  I mean  you ve had a nice pace over the past year or so  And I know you mentioned the fee outlook several times  So is the fee outlook with the current footprint that you have or could the fee outlook be enhanced by incremental acquisitions  if you could speak a little bit to that John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean we continue to look at opportunities  whether it be investments in capital markets capabilities  wealth management  buying mortgage servicing rights  not a great time to do that today  but we re still looking  There are other capabilities potentially that we have some interest in  We look at loan portfolios from time to time  and those are things that we ll continue to do as we think about how we invest in the excess capital we have in other parts of our business that will help us grow over time Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    AnalystOkay  Thank you John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah OperatorYour next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Gerard Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  guys  I apologize  Can you guys share with us  you ve done a really good job over the last three years or so on being very conservative in your underwriting standards  And of course that s resulted in more modest loan growth than some of your peers  And I m not asking you to comment on your peers  underwriting standards  but can you just give us some color in commercial C I  that is in commercial real estate  what kind of underwriting  are you guys seeing that you re just not comfortable with that may be some of your peers are David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI ll ask Ronnie Smith  who heads a Corporate Banking Group to respond Gerard Ronald G  Smith    Senior Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Banking GroupHey  Gerard  Good morning  You may have heard this earlier  but we are really focused back in on the relationship side of things  Gerard  simply because we believe that when you have a broad and a deep relationship  you become more meaningful to that client  And it gives you the ability to weather through whatever storms might be out there when you are meaningful to them  have the opportunity to get in early and really client selectivity on the front side is so important  but understanding the complete flow of business that they have  the complete demand that they have of banking services is really where we try to be focused And I would also say that we look historically at how well companies have gone through the cycles  It really strongly leaned into the management  their capability  how they perform through the last cycle  and then of course use the standard underwritings that I won t go into the details around that today  But those are the high level pieces of how we try to look at the risk that we take on when we go through client selectivity David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe only thing I would add to that is that  specifically to your question  I think  what I most consistently hear from our bankers is loan to value  So  our willingness to provide as much capital as a customer may want tends to be the differentiator  As an example  we may want a loan of 60  loan to value on a project  then the customer can get 65  or 70  from someone else  So that s a function of a variety of factors  but that tends to be the most significant differentiator in today s marketplace Barbara Godin    Chief Credit Officer and Senior Executive Vice PresidentGerard  it s Barb Godin  I would also add that we stay very  very close to our customers  Our people in the field do an excellent job of that  and we are touching basis with them sometimes on a weekly basis but often monthly  certainly quarterly  and making sure that if there is any early warning signs or any risks that are out there that we re on top of it early  Because as you know  if you can get on top of a problem early  you ve got a lot more solutions you can give than when you have to wait until there is nothing left to do but to exit the relationship Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  And then  just as a follow up question  Obviously  you re one of the so called extended cycle banks  So you ll be going through a full CCAR this year  David  are you expecting any differences between this year and what you did last year  Last year  obviously you didn t go through it being an extended cycle bank  should we expect any differences David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGerard  we go through stress test all the time internally  It s just  this is one that we have to fill out form and go through the review process with our regulatory supervisors  We are awaiting the instructions for that  We re looking to see if there are any changes  There was an article  I think  this morning or yesterday  I can t remember in The Banker regarding expectations for some changes in CCAR for this year  things like if you re in stress  do you have to continue with anticipated share repurchases at the same pace in a stress environment  I mean  that s something we would not do  So we are hoping that that gets changed in the rules  or would we continue to grow the portfolio at the same pace that we are now if we re in a stressed environment  So  those are two pretty big important things that we re hoping might get changed in the rules  but other than that understanding what losses are  I mean  this is a good exercise for the industry  for us individually and for our regulatory supervisors  And so  we re ready to go and we ll be submitting that plan in first part of April Gerard Cassidy    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thank you as always John M  Turner    President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorThere are no further questions at this time  I will turn the call back over to John Turner for closing remarks David J  Turner    Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  Well  I ll close by again thanking our 19 000 plus associates for all their efforts in 2019 on behalf of our customers  Thank you all who participated in the

106710,328225,RF,Northern Trust  NTRS  Q4 Earnings Disappoint  Costs Escalate,opinion,Northern Trust Corporation   NASDAQ NTRS   reported a negative earnings surprise of 4  in fourth quarter 2019  Earnings per share of  1 70 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 77  Moreover  the reported figure declined 5 6  year over year  Results included certain one time items     Escalating operating expenses was on the downside during the quarter  However  higher revenues  aided by rise in fee income  were a driving factor  Also  net interest margin escalated  Moreover  most credit metrics marked significant improvements Net income came in at  371 1 million  down 9  year over year For full year 2019  net income was  1 5 billion or  6 63 per share compared with the prior year s  1 6 billion or  6 64 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pinned at  7 29 Margins   Revenues Improve  Costs EscalateFor full year 2019  revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis  were  6 1 billion  up 1 7  from the  6 billion reported in 2018  However  the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 3 billion Total revenues of  1 56 billion improved 3  year over year in the quarter  Further  the revenue figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 54 billion On a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income of  430 5 million was almost stable year on year Net interest margin  NIM  was 1 59   up 7 basis points from the prior year quarter  The upside chiefly reflects the impact of reduced foreign exchange swap volume and a balance sheet mix shift  partly mitigated by lower short term interest rates Consolidated Trust  Investment and Other Servicing Fees summed  992 2 million  up 6  year over year Non interest income escalated 4  from the year ago quarter to  1 12 billion  Rise in trust  investment and other servicing fees  along with security commissions and trading income  led to this upsurge  These increases were partly offset by lower foreign exchange trading income  treasury management fees and other operating income Non interest expenses flared up 5  year over year to  1 07 billion during the October December period  This upswing mainly resulted

204214,425730,RF,Should Value Investors Pick Regions Financial  RF  Stock ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Regions Financial Corporation   NYSE RF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Regions Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 80  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 17  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level Regions Financial puts current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 13 35  over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 63  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Regions Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 90  so it is fair to expect an increase in the stock s price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Regions Financial has a P S ratio of about 2 42  This is slightly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 34 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Regions Financial currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes RF a solid choice for value investors and some of its other metrics make it clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 50  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 11 91  Clearly  RF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall 
Though Regions Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives RF a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen nine estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to two higher  while current year estimate has seen 11 downward and four upward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 2 5  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has dipped 0 6   in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below  Regions Financial Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRegions Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 35  out of more than 250 industries  and Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating strategies  From 2017 through 2018  while the S P 500 gained  15 8   five of our screens returned  38 0    61 3    61 6    68 1   and  98 3   This outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  From 2000   2018  while the S P averaged  4 8  per year  our top strategies averaged up to  56 2  per year ",2019-11-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-regions-financial-rf-stock-200485285,200485285

million  Higher mortgage income  service charges on deposit account  card   ATM fees  commercial credit fee income  wealth management income and other income primarily resulted in this upside  However  the positives were partly offset by lower capital markets income Non interest expenses dropped 5 5  year over year to  871 million  mainly due to fall in net occupancy  professional  legal and

What s Next for Regions Financial

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Regions Financial was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

204229,425745,RF,Will Weak Housing And Manufacturing Sectors Lead To Recession ,opinion,"This year s slowdown in US economic growth has been accompanied by stronger headwinds in manufacturing and housing  History suggests these are clear signs that recession risk is elevated and it s merely a matter of time before the business cycle succumbs  But optimists say that consumer spending  supported by what s expected to be a new round of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve  will save the day and keep growth alive  The next several weeks of data releases  starting with next week s employment report  may tell us which outlook is correct 
Let s take a closer look at the numbers for some perspective on what may be coming  starting with manufacturing  Survey data for July shows that growth has come to a standstill  The IHS Markit Flash US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index edged down to 50  a neutral reading that s the lowest in a decade and reflects a sector on the cusp of recession if it slips below that mark  IHS Markit  which publishes the PMI data  notes 
The negative influences on the headline PMI were lower production volumes  a fall in employment and reduced stocks of purchases  Production levels dropped only slightly  but the rate of decline was the greatest since August 2009  Moreover  the marginal decrease in staffing levels ended a six year period of sustained job creation across the manufacturing sector 
The housing sector is having troubles of its own  The long running trend in existing sales for homes remains negative  with red ink persisting for the year over year change for the 16th straight month in June  New home sales offered a bit of upbeat news yesterday  but the chief economist at RDQ Economics  John Ryding  says  there is no evidence here to change the narrative that the response of the housing market to lower mortgage rates has been underwhelming  
Construction activity in the housing sector also reflects a conspicuous weakening in recent history  The one year changes for housing starts and building permits indicate a clear downshift over the past year or so 

The main source of optimism that the US expansion will endure  consumer spending  Consider the one year trend for retail sales  For June  spending ticked up to a modest 3 4  pace  That s a middling gain compared with recent history  although it s up from December s stall speed 1 4  advance  which suggests that it s premature to pull the plug on the notion that Main Street will continue to support economic momentum for the near term 

The fourth straight month of gains for retail spending in June prompted one economist to quip that  US consumers continued to do what they do best  i e   spend   Richard Moody  chief economist at Regions Financial  NYSE RF  
Reflecting on the second quarter GDP report that s due tomorrow  July 26   analysts at the National Bank of Canada advised last week that  strong  US  household demand should help compensate for expected weakness in manufacturing and trade in the quarter and help GDP grow at a pace close to 1 5  annualized  
In fact  the crowd is looking for a slightly better result in Q2 activity  Econoday com s consensus point forecast calls for GDP growth to rise 1 9  in the government s preliminary Q2 report that s scheduled for Friday  That s well below Q1 s strong 3 1  increase  but if the forecast is accurate the data will offer a degree of support for thinking that the US economy can avoid a recession in the near term  By contrast  a significant downside surprise in the GDP release would reshuffle expectations 
For now  there s still no sign that an NBER defined contraction has started or is imminent  as detailed in last week s business cycle profile  But slower growth leaves the economy vulnerable to future shocks 
The bottom line  the next round of data could tell us if recession risk has risen to a critical level  The rear view mirror suggests otherwise  based on numbers published to date 
The three month average of the Chicago Fed s National Activity Index for June  for instance  continues to indicate below trend growth  but at a pace that s still comfortably above the tipping point that indicates recession 

The mystery  as always  is the near term future  On that front  next week s data will be revealing  In particular  the employment numbers for July will offer valuable insight on the third quarter s kickoff  Recent history  however  tells us to be wary  The one year trend for private employment has been weakening this year  slipping to a 1 7  increase in June the lowest in a year and a half  If this gives way in July  the outlook will darken 

Optimists are quick to note that jobless claims  a leading indicator for the labor market and the economy  remain close to a 50 year low  which implies that the labor market will continue to expand at a healthy pace in the upcoming July report   Claims remain low  consistent with a still healthy labor market   says Jim O Sullivan  chief US economist of High Frequency Economics

interest expense dropped 5 5  year over year to  861 million  On an adjusted basis  non interest expenses slipped 2 2  to  857 million  The decline was mainly due to fall in almost all components of

204242,425758,RF,Why Regions Financial  RF  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Regions Financial in Focus
Regions Financial  RF  is headquartered in Birmingham  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 8 67  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 14 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 85   In comparison  the Banks   Southeast industry s yield is 1 74   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 96  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  0 56 is up 21 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Regions Financial has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 24 13   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Regions Financial s payout ratio is 40   which means it paid out 40  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for RF for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  1 57 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 15 44  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  RF is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-regions-financial-rf-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200421651,200421651

204244,425760,RF,Is Regions Financial  RF  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Regions Financial Corporation   NYSE RF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Regions Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 14  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 58  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Regions Financial s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 13 39  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 07  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Regions Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 03  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Regions Financial s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Regions Financial has a P S ratio of about 2 23  This is noticeably lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Regions Financial currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes RF a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Preferred Bank is just 1 10  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 28  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 7 23  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 11 34  Clearly  RF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Regions Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C  This gives RF a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen 14 estimates go lower in the past sixty days and five higher  while the full year 2019 estimate has seen 15 downward and one upward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 0 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has slipped 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Regions Financial Corporation Price and Consensus    This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRegions Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 44  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling

While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This holding company for Regions Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 48 billion  up 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 85  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regions Financial 
For Regions Financial  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 27  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Regions Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Regions Financial would post earnings of  0 37 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 37  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Regions Financial doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/regions-financial-rf-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200439316,200439316

Of these  perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing  which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments  Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued  leaving room for profits 
Luckily  Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits  Value investors will be interested in the system s  Value  category  Stocks with both  A  grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now

Value investors also love the P S ratio  which is calculated by simply dividing a stock s price with the company s sales  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  RF has a P S ratio of 2 19  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 89

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regions Financial 
For Regions Financial  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 50  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Regions Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Regions Financial would post earnings of  0 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 32  delivering a surprise of  11 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Regions Financial has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while First Bancorp has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that RF is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
RF currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 70  while FBNC has a forward P E of 12 60  We also note that RF has a PEG ratio of 0 94  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  FBNC currently has a PEG ratio of 1 07 
Another notable valuation metric for RF is its P B ratio of 1 34  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  FBNC has a P B of 1 53 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to RF s Value grade of B and FBNC s Value grade of C 
RF has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than FBNC  so it seems like value investors will conclude that RF is the superior option right now ",2018-11-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/rf-or-fbnc-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200358689,200358689

of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Cheap Breakout Stocks for Explosive ReturnsOne of the most popular methods utilized by active investors is to select breakout stocks  The technique seeks to identify stocks whose prices are fluctuating within a specific band  In case a stock falls below the floor of this band  it may be time to offload it from your portfolio  However  a stock breaking above this channel carries the promise of delivering strong gains Picking Prospective CandidatesIn order to identify breakout stocks  you must first determine their resistance and support levels  A resistance level is the barrier which must be broken so as to be identified as a breakout stock  Meanwhile  a support level is the floor for the stock s movement At the breakout level  demand for a stock has peaked  making it a natural choice for traders  On the other hand  when a stock hits the support floor  traders are eager to offload it  In order to spot breakout stocks  you would have to see which of these are on the brink of breaking the resistance barrier or those that have just breached this level Has a Genuine Breakout Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a bona fide breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading

S P 500 Futures  Government Shutdown Looms

Yesterday  the Asian markets closed firm  and the Stoxx 600 was flat  In the U S   the e mini S P 500 futures  ESU17 CME  traded up to 2807 50 on Globex  and ended up opening at at 2802 50 on the 8 30 CT futures open  The days early trade was earmarked by several lower highs and lower lows  The early high of 2806 50 was around 8 45 am  and the low at 2793 50 came in at 11 00 am  The sell programs were all part of the news wire algos reacting to all the headlines concerning who would be blamed if the government could not agree on a one month spending bill that would keep the government funded through Feb  16 
The ES trade was the exact opposite of Wednesdays trade  where the ES made several early higher lows before rallying  Yesterday it was all about the lower highs and the selloff that followed  After rallying up to the vwap at the 2801 00 area and doing some  back and fill   the MiM started to show  700 million to buy  and the ES got hit by a big program that pushed the futures all the way up to the 2808 00 area just before 2 00 pm  From there  it dropped all the way back down to the 2797 00 area just before the 2 45 cash imbalance  completing a MrTopStep 10 handle rule  The final move was back up to the 2802 00 area  and on the 2 45 cash close the MiM flipped to sell  485 million  A late headline came out saying Senate Democrats have enough votes to block the government funding bill  and the ES sold off down to 2795 75 on the 3 15 close 
In the end  the S P did have a few good rallies  but ended the day closing on a big down tick as the headline news ruled the day  Total volume ended up over 1 2 million contracts traded 
The  MiM  MrTopStep Imbalance Meter
Yesterday s MiM started off so strong  showing us a  1B buy imbalance right out of the chute  but that didn t last long  and it soon faded toward the sell side  where it finally settled at a small sell  The reveal  at 3 45 pm ET when the MOCs are locked in  showed a list minute input of sell orders that pushed us down to almost  500M  Those last minute sell MOCs have been the pattern for the last week 
Today is OPEX  and we should see come considerable numbers on the MIM  Remember  those numbers are expected  and the liquidity to close the markets is already in the works  Only something extremely unusual will drive a turbulent close

204334,425850,RF,Is Regions Financial A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Regions Financial Corporation   NYSE RF   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Regions Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 36  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 18  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Regions Financials  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Banks   Southeast industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 18  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Regions Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 67  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Regions Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Regions Financial has a P S ratio of about 2 32  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 65 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Regions Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Regions Financial a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for Regions Financial is just 1 32  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 49  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  RF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Regions Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  A   This gives RF a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The full year estimate has seen four upward and not downward in the last 60 days This has had a noticeable on the consensus estimate as the full year estimate has moved up 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Regions Financial Corporation Price and Consensus    Even though Regions Financial has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term   Bottom LineRegions Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 20  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past two year  the Zacks Banks   Southeast industry has outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick

5 Bargain Stocks with Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios

	The price to earnings  P E  ratio enjoys great popularity in the value investing world and is preferred by many investors while uncovering bargain stocks  However  even this straightforward  easy to compute multiple has a few downsides 

EV EBITDA is a Better Option  But Why 

	While P E is widely considered as a useful tool to work out the fair value of a stock  a more complicated and less used metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative as it offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also referred to as enterprise multiple  has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines a firm s total value  P E  on the other hand  considers only its equity portion 
	EV EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Essentially  it is the entire value of a company 
	The other component of the ratio  EBITDA gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it removes the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows 
	Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more alluring it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could indicate that a stock is potentially undervalued 
	Unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  EV EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Stocks sporting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates 
	Another downside of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the contrary  EV EBITDA is less susceptible to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are EBITDA positive 
	EV EBITDA is also a useful tool in evaluating the value of companies with high balance sheet leverage and considerable depreciation and amortization expenses  It also can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt 
	However  EV EBITDA is too not devoid of drawbacks  It varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements 
	As such  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired outcome Screening Criteria
	Here are the parameters to screen for bargain stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median   A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median   This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median   A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median   The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median   This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000   The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5   This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2   No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B   Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 

	Here are five of the 11 stocks that passed the screen

204365,425881,RF,Regions Financial To Pay  52 4M In A Settlement With DOJ,opinion,Regions Bank  a subsidiary of Regions Financial Corporation   NYSE RF    announced that it has agreed to pay  52 4 million to the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to resolve the allegations of violating the False Claims Act  The company was accused of falsely certifying that mortgage loans  insured by the Federal Housing Administration  FHA   were underwritten according to and complied with the requirements of the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  As part of the settlement  Regions Bank acknowledged that between Jan 1  2006 to Dec 31  2011  it certified certain mortgages for FHA insurance that did not meet the HUD s underwriting requirements  However  the bank did not admit liability  in order to avoid potential future litigation AllegationsSince Jan 2006  Regions Bank has been a direct endorsement lender  DEL  in the FHA s insurance program   Under the program  if a DEL approves a mortgage loan for FHA insurance and the loan later defaults  the holder of the loan may submit an insurance claim to the HUD for any losses resulting from the default  However  for a mortgage loan to qualify for FHA insurance  it must be underwritten according to certain guidelines issued by HUD   The FHA does not review the loan for compliance  but instead relies on the DEL to certify compliance In this case  the HUD insured hundreds of loans approved by the bank and had to suffer substantial losses when it paid insurance claims due to the bank s faulty underwriting process  Furthermore  Regions Bank failed to follow the rules to make sure that the borrowers met the required standards  as part of its quality control process In addition  the bank allegedly did not take appropriate steps to deal with the loans which were found to be deficient  either in the underwriting process or when they became due  Further  the bank did not follow the appropriate self reporting requirements in finding fraud  serious violations or other deficiencies with its loans Financial ImpactAt the end of the second quarter of 2016  Regions Bank established and disclosed reserves for the entire settlement amount  Therefore  this agreement will not have a material impact on the bank s financial condition or results of operations  Further  the bank s insurers have agreed to reimburse approximately  47 million of the settlement amount  The insurance recovery will be recognized in the third quarter of 2016 ConclusionFHA insurance and various other federally funded programs exist to make home ownership more affordable and available to lower income borrowers  and borrowers suffering from financial hardship   These programs incentivize lenders to giveloans to potentially riskier borrowers because the federal government essentially guarantees the loan and will reimburse the owner for losses associated with default  HUD and FHA have issued regulations and guidance that lenders are required to follow to protect the government   Unfortunately  in Feb 2016  Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   agreed to pay  1 2 billion to the DOJ  in a settlement over similar claims However  in the current regulatory scenario  banks should now start being more cautious about its activities and abide by the regulations as far as possible  Further  as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C  Mizer  head of the Justice Department s Civil Division  said   Mortgage lenders that participate in the FHA insurance program must follow the requirements intended to safeguard its integrity and to protect homeowners  We will continue to hold responsible lenders that knowingly violate these important requirements  Currently  Regions Financialcarries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Stocks that Warrant a LookA couple of better ranked Southeast bank stocks include Hancock Holding Company   NASDAQ HBHC   and Southern National Bancorp of Virginia Inc    NASDAQ SONA    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-09-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/regions-financial-to-pay-$52.4m-in-a-settlement-with-doj-200153514,200153514

204395,425911,RF,Dangerous Yield  Canadian Banks,opinion,"On Monday  the Bloomberg Commodity Index fell to a 12 year low 
This is bad news for economies dependent on commodity exports  particularly Canada and Australia 
In fact  the Australian banking system is as unsafe as ever due to the global commodities rout and an overpriced housing market 
In March 2014  I listed   including Westpac Banking Corporation  NYSE WBK   one of Australia s largest banks 
However  this edition of  dangerous yield  focuses on our neighbors to the north  who are in serious trouble 
According to an analysis of global housing markets conducted by Deutsche Bank AG NA O N   NYSE DB   Canada s housing market may be the most overpriced in the entire world relative to historical averages of home price rent and home price income 
DB s Chief International Economist  Torsten Slok  and his team warn that Canada s household debt as a percentage of household income is higher than it s ever been   higher even than U S  household debt to income at the apex of the U S  housing bubble 
Thus  the collapse in the price of oil   which is by far Canada s top export   couldn t come at a worse time for the country s economy and financial institutions 
And as we know  a housing bust induced recession can be particularly hard on a banking system 
That s why it s very troubling that the Canadian banks have relatively low tangible common equity  TCE  ratios  which measure leverage and capital adequacy 

As you can see in the above table  Royal Bank Of Canada  TO RY   Toronto Dominion Bank  The   NYSE TD   Bank of Nova Scotia  The   NYSE BNS  and Bank of Montreal  NYSE BMO  all have TCE ratios below 5  
To put that into context  KeyCorp  Regions Financial Corporation  NYSE RF  and Wells Fargo   Company  NYSE WFC  have TCE ratios of 10 2   9 8   and 7 6   respectively  In other words  these U S  banks are less leveraged and better capitalized than their Canadian counterparts 
If a Canadian recession ushers in a default cycle  the aforementioned Canadian banks may not be able to absorb steep losses in their loan portfolios  To me  the Canadian banks seem uninvestable at this point 
Bottom line  When your housing market is egregiously overpriced  household debt levels are in the stratosphere  the prices for your primary exports are plunging to multi year lows  and your banks aren t prepared for the fallout  then you could have a massive problem on your hands 
Speculators who believe the situation in Canada is going to get ugly may even consider buying put spreads on the iShares MSCI Canada  NYSE EWC  
For example  buying the June 2015 25 strike put option contract and selling the June 2015 20 contract would cost  0 85  net debit   and have a maximum profit of  4 15 
Safe  and high yield  investing
