123840,345355,CHKP,New Crypto Mining Malware Seen to  Evolve   Say Researchers,news,"Researchers at Israel based cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP  say that a relatively new form of crypto mining malware  dubbed KingMiner  is  evolving  
In a research note on Thursday  the firm s Ido Solomon and Adi Ikan said that KingMiner  a monero mining malware that first appeared about six months ago  is changing through time to avoid detection   even replacing older versions of itself that it encounters on host machines 
The researchers said 
 The malware continuously adds new features and bypass methods to avoid emulation  Mainly  it manipulates the needed files and creates a dependency which is critical during emulation  
As a result of these tactics  the malware is also being detected by security systems at  significantly  reduced rates ",2018-11-30,CoinDesk,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/new-crypto-mining-malware-seen-to-evolve-say-researchers-1706489,1706489
123843,345358,CHKP, Researchers Discover Next Gen Cryptojacking Malware ,news,"Malware used to mine Monero on infected Windows Servers has evaded detection by relying on a complicated self improvement algorithm  In a paper published this week  researchers at the Israeli cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP  have identified the  and warned that it would likely continue to see updates  making it even harder to detect 
KingMiner  which mainly targets SQL Server and Internet Information Services  IIS  servers  relies on brute force methods to guess the password of the users and compromise the machine during the initial phase of the attack  The malware was initially discovered in mid June 2018  with two improved versions being released shortly after  The Israeli researchers expect the number of KingMiner attacks to increase 

 The attacker employs various evasion techniques to bypass emulation and detection methods  and  as a result  several detection engines have noted significantly reduced detection rates  Based on our analysis of sensor logs  there is a steady rise in the number of KingMiner attack attempts

123855,345370,CHKP,Check Point Software  CHKP  Surpasses Q4 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Check Point Software  CHKP  came out with quarterly earnings of  2 02 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 99 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 68 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 51   A quarter ago  it was expected that this data security company would post earnings of  1 40 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 44  delivering a surprise of 2 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Check Point  which belongs to the Zacks Security industry  posted revenues of  543 80 million for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 03   This compares to year ago revenues of  525 56 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Check Point shares have added about 3  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s decline of  0 2  
What s Next for Check Point 
While Check Point has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Check Point was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating OfficerThank you  Kip  Good morning and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today  I m pleased to begin the review of the fourth quarter and the full year Revenues for the fourth quarter increased by 3  year over year  to 544 million and our non GAAP EPS grew by 21  to  2 02  both above the midpoint of our guidance  Before I proceed further into the numbers  let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stock based compensation charges  amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related expenses  as well as the related tax effects  Keep in mind that as applicable  non GAAP information is presented excluding these items Now let s take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter  revenues reached  544 million   2 million above the midpoint of our guidance  Product and security subscription revenues were  322 million  Our security subscription revenues continue to be healthy with 12  growth year over year  reaching  164 million  Our software update and maintenance revenues increased to  222 million  representing 2  growth year over year  Products are transitioning partly to the cloud solution  which are included in the subscription line  The reduction in product line is naturally driving lower support levels  The growth in our subscription revenues is driven mainly by our CloudGuard business and Infinity deals  we generated double digit and triple digit revenue growth respectively Deferred revenues  As of December 31 reached  1 387 billion  a growth of  49 million year over year  Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows  44  of revenues came from the Americas  45  of revenues came from Europe  Middle East and Africa regions  The remaining 11  came from Asia Pacific  Since the beginning of 2019  Middle East and Africa region are part of Europe  Middle East and Africa  which before it was part of Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa region  The revenue distribution by geography for Q4 last year  after the reclassification  would have been 45  of revenues came from Americas  44  of revenues came from Europe  Middle East and Africa region  and the remaining 11  came from Asia Pacific Non GAAP operating margin for the quarter were 51   During the quarter the dollar weakened against some currencies mainly the Israeli shekel  creating a headwind of  4 million or  0 03 year over year  Our financial income for the quarter was  20 million  compared to  21 million last quarter  and  17 million last year  During the year  we saw a change in trend  with a decrease in our portfolio yield  as a result of the lower interest rate in the U S  As a result of this decrease and the continued buyback program  our financial income for next year is expected to be around  19 million in the beginning of the year  moving down to  17 million in the quarter by the end of the year Effective non GAAP tax rates for this quarter was zero as expected  This quarter similar to last year  our tax expenses included tax benefit from lapse of statute limitation of certain provisions  GAAP net income was  272 million or  1 84 per diluted share  an increase of 21  from fourth quarter of 2018  Non GAAP net income for the quarter was  299 million or  2 02 per diluted share  an increase of 21  from the fourth quarter of 2018  EPS was  0 03 above the mid of our guidance Our cash balances were  3 991 billion as of year end  Operating cash flow continued to be strong  with  246 million  compared to  249 million in the fourth quarter of 2018  Collection from customers are strong  Our cash payments increased  in line with our continued investment in sales and marketing  During the quarter  we acquired Protego and Cymplify  both have minimal effect on our profit for the quarter During the quarter  we utilized the maximum quarterly buyback authorized and purchased 2 9 million shares for  325 million  at an average price of  113 per share Now let s take a look into the full 2019  revenues for the year were  1 995 billion  an increase of 4  from last year  During the year  subscription continued to be the main growth driver  The subscription revenues include majority of our new products and services  including Cloud Infinity solution and mobile  On the Infinity front  we have seen an increase of tens to hundreds of percentage in the annual run rate of business  with customers that adopt in the full Infinity threat protection solution  This is great news  The product portion reduced  since the allocation to subscription is quite large During the year  we have increased cloud market penetration  with over 2 500 customers  During 2019 and the beginning of 2020  we introduced the new appliance family  It is hard to predict the mix between the old and the new products and between the different types of appliances that the customers will end up choosing  As you know  our goal is to provide higher throughput across the line for the benefit of our customers  understanding that there is some risk of some customers buying lower priced appliances  with higher throughput  Hence  it is quite hard to predict the effect of our new appliances on the average sales price in 2020  We also plan to bundle more services as part of our appliances next year  which will continue the transition that we are experiencing between products to subscription Non GAAP operating margin for the year was with 50   as we anticipated in the beginning of the year  We continue to invest in our workforce and marketing efforts  As discussed during the year  the dollar weakened against some currencies  mainly the Israeli shekel  and created a headwind for the full year of  5 million or  0 04  This headwind is expected to continue and to be  10 million or  0 06 in 2020  based on the current exchange rates  The acquisition we made during the year are expected to have an effect of  0 03   0 04 on non GAAP EPS and  0 07   0 08 on GAAP EPS  As a result of the continued investment  currency effect  and the acquisition we expect annual margin next year to be around 48   with lower points in Q1  and with the highest point at Q4 next year Effective non GAAP tax rate for the year was 14   For 2020  we expect the tax rate to be for the year around 12   going down 2   as a result of the change in regulation  structure and tax  Indecipherable   Quarterly taxes are expected to be around 17  in Q1  Q2 and Q3 and around zero in Q4  as the lapse of statute limitation expected to occur in the fourth quarter  as we ve seen in the last two years GAAP net income for the year was  826 million or  5 43 per diluted share  GAAP earnings per share grew by 5   Non GAAP net income for the year was  933 million or  6 13 per diluted share  reflecting an increase of 7   For the year  cash flow from operation was  1 102 billion compared to  1 130 billion  quite similar  During the year  the company repurchased approximately 11 2 million shares  at a total cost of approximately  1 278 billion at an average price of  114 per share We believe that our market leadership and long term growth prospects  makes it is an effective time to further utilize our cash to increase shareholder value  As such  we have announced today an increase of  2 billion to our buyback program  with the quarterly repurchase of up to  325 million a quarter  consistent with our previous plan  The total amount available as of year end from the old program was  382 million Based on the above plan  we expect our average diluted number of shares for 2020 to be on average   144 million  starting at  147 million and moving down  141 million in Q4 of 2020 Now let s turn the call over to Gil for his comments Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Tal  and hello to everyone joining us today  Tal spoke about fourth quarter business results were in line with our projections  Our CloudGuard family of products  mobility and advanced threat prevention solutions continue to demonstrate solid growth throughout the year  These are all subscription based solution and where continued success shifts our business into more of an annuity model  Overall  we had a strong finish for the quarter  and tallied the nice number of wins with our new technologies We are placing a lot of emphasis on driving the future of cyber security  with the launch of our Infinity NEXT architecture  But before we dive into the future of cyber security  a little summary of the technologies we launched in 2019  We started revamping our clients models with the 16000 and 26000 series of appliances for the high end datacenter  But unlike most industry  we made a real breakthrough network security architecture  with the launch of the Maestro Orchestrator  Maestro delivers cloud like elasticity and reliability to datacenters  Normal gateway architectures work on the premise with 1   the 10 10 10  For example  traditionally  you buy two 10 gigabit appliances to work in a high availability mode  So if one fails  the other takes over  And if you run out of bandwidth  again  10 gigabits  you need to upgrade the whole installation Maestro changes this architecture  you can have two  three or up to 52 security appliances  and they will work in parallel  delivering a multiple of the performance  providing N 1 redundancy not only that  it is completely elastic architecture  you can add more and more capacity as demand increases  We are starting to see good adoption of the Maestro based solution with enterprises of all sizes We have also complemented our network security architecture with the 1500 security appliance series  This series brings enterprise grade capabilities to the entry level of the marketplace  It is favored by managed security providers  and telcos who wants to provide the highest level of security to many small businesses in an effective manner  But beyond the network security development  Phonetic  in 2019  we made a lot of headway in the cloud space  We ve extended the CloudGuard family with cloud delivered network security  CloudGuard Connect and with the integration into SD1 systems  we ve made a bigger evolution with the acquisition of Dome9 and are now delivering CloudGuard Dome9 multi cloud security management  and toward the end of the year  we completed another acquisition in the cloud space for server less security  adding what is called workloads to the CloudGuard family  covering Amazon Lambda function in traditional serverless workloads in the future Given everything we ve done on the cloud space  we believe that we have a very good foundation for cloud security with the CloudGuard family  CloudGuard IaaS  CloudGuard SaaS  CloudGuard Dome9  CloudGuard Connect and CloudGuard Workload  Overall  our cloud business now reaches over 2 500 customers  up significantly from last year Another acquisition we completed in December was in the field of IoT security  This one is quite revolutionary technology  Most IoT security companies provide discovery and mapping of IoT devices  The smelting device on its own doesn t elevate the security level  The real challenge in IoT devices is even if you know which devices you have  you don t know their security posture  These are cloud devices the don t let you manage your application or operating system environments  usually old invariable operating system  and therefore creating huge security vulnerability  Our new IoT security technology will change that  It can analyze the firmware of each IoT device  and provide the report on the level of security and vulnerabilities in the device  But that s just where the story begins  we can automatically create a modified binary  that fixes these security vulnerabilities and  Indecipherable  part 3 the IoT device framework  So when an organization deploys IoT devices  they can check for security level  and ask the vendor to harden  Phonetic  their device s security posture  using our technology This is what we refer to as nano security architecture  which leads me to the future of cyber security  where we re going to focus in 2020  But before I dive into the future of cyber security and the Infinity NEXT architecture  let s take a quick look at the industry  Enterprises of any size  whether it s 400 or 400 000 employees  all face similar challenges  they have a host of platforms  endpoints  mobile  networks  IoT and huge number of cloud platforms  virtual servers  container  web services and more  Many of these don t follow the traditional computer models  and present a real security challenge The attacks are becoming more sophisticated  We re now with the fifth generation of cyber attacks  moving into the sixth generation  These attacks are fully amorphic  making them very hard to detect  multi vector  an attack can start with the credential from a mobile device and use that to penetrate the cloud in the network  until it starts downloading and activating it s malicious workloads  So a typical enterprise can find itself with 30 to 40 computing platform  or as we call assets  and dozens of security technologies that are needed to protect them No enterprise can pull it altogether  Many platform or assets will remain insufficiently secure  Many technologies that are needed once being deployed  which is what we see every day  with the vast majority of the market customers  are Gen 3 security rather than Gen 5  where we should be  The technologies that are being implemented today  don t work together probably  and don t deliver the desired level of security for the entire enterprise Check Point Infinity and Infinity NEXT are uniquely positioned to change that reality  In the first few weeks  we started launching the Infinity NEXT  the technology that can solve the security challenge  Infinity next provide a unified architecture  It consists of a security brain  that covers over 60 secured technologies with a range of field  known attacks  unknown threats  zero trust access  hardening in compliance  and coordinate the i Security  This range provides capabilities to cloud service to all the platforms  asset types and workloads  Our aim is to get over 50 platform or asset types in 2020  For each platform  there is a unique nano agent that s plugged into web system and connected to the security  Indecipherable  This includes the long list of asset types from serverless function  a web service or IoT devices  They will all consume the services from the cloud  no need for upgrades  updates  complicated installation  delivery of security can be embedded into devops services in an automated manner and provide the highest level of security posture constantly Infinity NEXT is the only architecture  that combines over 60 security services  multiplied by 50 platforms to deliver unmatched security  We launched the Infinity NEXT technology at our CPX conferences over the past few weeks  We were received by our customers and partners with great enthusiasm  We received the highest ratings from customers based on our vision and relevance to release  We are starting to deliver these solutions now  and 2020 will be an important year for the new architecture From an execution standpoint  we continue to make many changes in our field operation in 2019  and will continue in 2020  Evolving our business and consumer relationship is an evolutionary time  We re continuing to target cloud buyers  C level CIOs and CSOs that are involved with the larger cyber security landscape  We have recruited many new leaders  especially in the channel management areas  We ve put new sales structures in places  and we continue to support and grow the traditional network security business  while leveraging our customer relationships  to expand our footprint into new field of security Some areas showed good progress  in particular our cloud sales are growing nicely  as well as our Infinity Total Protection platform  In 2019  annuity sales amounted to almost 75  of our revenues  and security subscriptions surpassed the sale of traditional product This is a great achievement  Over the past decade  we ve built an advanced security annuity business  that is now over  600 million in revenues annually  In the short term  we will aim to grow both products and subscription lines  as the new product sales continue to provide an important platform for subscription Over the next year  we will continue to focus on the same key areas  Our Infinity NEXT platform will take the front stage for innovation and fast forward that into the future of security  We will continue to move services to the cloud  like for security management as a service model  and we will continue to drive innovation in the network security core business  with our  Indecipherable  software platform  our new Quantum appliances that were launched last week  and the Maestro platform  that continues to generate significant business and provide leading technologies in the core network security market From a technology perspective  I believe we are gaining traction with our cyber security leadership  From a business perspective  clearly  we should generate higher growth rates  and we are fully committed to achieve that success This is a good transition to our 2020 projection  As you know  my regular caveat  it is hard to predict the future  especially with all the changes we are implementing to our technology and business  So I will remain relatively conservative with my projection  Of course  there are many opportunities for upside  and also some risks to these projections  In particular  most of our new initiative revolves around new cloud and annuity business model  which means  that when we win a large project  most of the revenues will be deferred for the duration of the contract  and not flow right into the P L With that said  revenues for 2020 are expected to be in the range of  2 billion to  2 1 billion  Non GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of  6 25 to  6 65  GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately  0 85 lower For the first quarter  we expect revenues in the range of  475 million to  495 million  and non GAAP EPS in the range of  1 37 to  1 43  GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately  0 21 less With that  I d love to open the call for your questions  Looking forward to hear your thoughts and questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions   Our first question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse  Please proceed Brad Zelnick    Credit Suisse    AnalystExcellent  Thank you so much  Gil  I wanted to drill in a little bit on the go to market changes  and I appreciate all the color in your prepared remarks  Last week we noticed the new stars global partner program you announced  building on the Engage program that you also I think announced last May  and it seems though  that when we talk to partners  it s still tough getting them to lead with Check Point in net new opportunities  landing new logos  Can you talk specifically about the progress that you made last year  How the new program incentivizes new business  And any metrics or leading indicators that you feel that you maybe    you ve gotten it right now  as we head into 2020 Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerI think first  it s important to understand  last year  we grew the number of new customers and we grew the number of partners  and we had some nice successes  I think the new programs that we have are all tailored to have some effects on that  and to create the programmatic effect  But to be honest with you  the main job is not the programs  and not the formalities  it s the joint work that our people are doing and will do in the marketplace  To that end again  we ve put some new leadership in the channel areas  both on the global basis and especially in the U S   and I think one of the important elements is to kind of reiterate that matter to our people  go work with our partners  If we we create more successes together we will    they will be replicated by the partners Now keep in mind  we are the only vendor that does a 100  of business with partners and through partners  But I think what s changed in the last few years in the last    again  it s not the last few years  changed many years ago  is that we ended up driving more business and just fulfilling it through the channel  I think what we need to do  is drive the business all the way with the partners  I am encouraged with some of the things I ve seen  but again  we have a long way until we reestablish their trust  By the way  it goes both ways  partners working with us  as we re working with and I think in CPXs  we got good feedback from them  We have a very  very successful CPXs  We had two of them  one in Bangkok three weeks ago  one in New Orleans  in the U S  last week  The biggest one  by the way  by far is going to be our European one  that s going to start tomorrow in Vienna  And again  from what I ve seen in the U S  in particular  we ve seen some good traction in getting partners more and more involved Brad Zelnick    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you  Gil  If I could just follow up for one    from Tal  Tal  I think most of us appreciate the transitions that Check Point and the overall industry is going through and the impact it has in your business model  as more revenue shifts to subscription  But if I look at current deferred revenue  for the full year last year  you added  32 million  compares to the prior year at  100 million and the year before that  its  64 million  and this is with strength and things like CloudGuard and Infinity and and as Gil talks about  strength in your annuity business  So with this transition and we would    we would expect it to have an impact on product revenue  Why are we seeing it more build in deferred and any kind of acceleration on the subscription lines  Thanks Tal Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating OfficerSo you are right  the effect should be reflected in the deferred revenues  The only thing I will say that  two things  one Infinity deals  the majority of the dollars are not coming through deferred  because it s annually invoiced  So you see a phenomena of annual invoice business  And second  I remind you that we talked about it throughout the year  that last year we had a few  call it abnormal huge transaction growth in Q2  and in Q3 and some some in Q4  which was very hard to match  Last year we had the few very very large deals which were partially part of the deferred revenues  and therefore we don t see it as part of the growth this year Brad Zelnick    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Thank you OperatorOur next question is from Michael Turits with Raymond James  Please proceed Michael Turits    Raymond James    AnalystHey guys  Good morning  good afternoon  So I think I ll start with Tal  Tal  the two points of margin decline this year  can you just make sure we parsed that correctly  to understand what s coming from acquisitions or from the shekel  and what s coming from incremental investments  and where those investments are and the follow on question is that  another two points down this year with margins  What the prospects are  Are we bottoming at this point or how do you think about margins longer term Tal Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So I mentioned three things  there s a lot of details behind it  but the three main thing was one we talked about the headwind from the dollar  The main drop against the shekel happened in Q4  It s already now ILS3 4  We started last year  if I recall  around ILS3 8  but most of the jump happened in the last quarter or two  So the full effect you see in next year  which as I told you  I think based on today s rate at around  10 million  Okay  So that probably explains about half a percent  slightly more Second  we had the acquisition at    in cents  its about  0 07 to  0 08 annually  You can calculate how much is in dollars  I think it comes to about also  10 million or so  We had three acquisitions this year if you recall  one in the beginning of the year and during Q4  So it s not a big effect  but it is affecting  All of them have no revenue  just expenses  but it s a good  we bought an amazing technology  that is just part of the expenses for next year And third  I mentioned  remember that when you recruit people and you are having salary increases  even if we don t recruit people  if you grow the revenues up 3   4     then naturally  the growth in your headcount plus the growth in the increases in salary  brings higher growth  and that s the third big explanation for the two point drop from 50  to 48   And that s the average  remember that Q1 starts much lower  because obviously peak season in Q1  So Q1 starts maybe 2  lower  and then the year end with 2  higher  So the average comes to the 48  Michael Turits    Raymond James    AnalystAnd then just my longer term question  as I said  it has been a couple of years of continuing declining margins  How should we think about your strategy  relative to margins over the next couple of years Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerI think first  I mean I ve been saying that we are public now for like almost 24 years  I ve been very very consistent about that from the day we went public in  96  Our focus is not about the margin  our focus is on building a healthy  growing business  and that s what we are doing  By the way over that period of time  we ve actually expanded our margin  not lowered our margin  over the long period of time  and our margins are very  very high  around    again  whether it s 48  or 52  of operating margin  it s very high  The main strategy is what we do and how we do it effectively  There are many opportunities in the marketplace  We do want to conquer new markets  We do want to take good care of our people  which is also important  We do want to provide good incentive for our partners  The fact that we are able to do all of that and still maintain the high margin  I think speaks for speaks for itself and I think once we see some of it flowing    some of the growth coming and flowing into our top line  it will flow down to the bottom line as well OperatorOur next question is from Fatima Boolani with UBS  Please proceed Fatima Boolani    UBS    AnalystGood morning  good afternoon  Thank you for taking the questions  I had one for Gil and one for Tal  Gil  you were super helpful in outlining the initiatives for calendar  20    in the focus areas for calendar  20  But I did note the emphasis is still on reenergizing if you will  your network security  your product business  So can you help us think about what sort of sales compensation or sales incentive structures you re going to bring into place  that both incentivize adoption of some of your newer solutions  like the CloudGuard family  as well as the traditional network security in the Gateway portfolio Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerFirst  that the product and the network security portfolio is still the majority of the of the revenues and the activities  So clearly  the salespeople are focused to bring those numbers  Actually  we need to incentivize them to invest in the new areas  where we believe it s very very important for strategically    and with the mind share and for building the future revenue streams  and yet they account only for a small portion today of the total revenues  and even    and I think that s where it comes to play So I think we do build the incentive programs and we have incentive programs to help invest  As I mentioned earlier for an earlier question  the main job is not about the the commission plans or the incentive programs  the main one is management every day that every salesperson and every sales engineer and every manager in the field should know how to balance their act between supporting and growing the network security business  and creating new business on the total security platform  We re finishing a decade now and I didn t talk much about that  But if you remember where we started the decade  we started the decade with gateway platforms that were    I wouldn t say basically  we are very rich for that era  for a decade ago  but we started with a Software Blade platform  and what we aim to do is consolidate many technologies into the gateway and make the gateway a much bigger security platform and support that with the new business model  that was the Software Blades model 10 years later  you can see that we ve actually achieved that  I mean in the network security business  the gateways are unified  The gateway is a big platform  Our software blades business  or what we call it now the subscription business  already surpassed the new product business  So that s a huge achievement from that point  We built them business with more than  600 million in revenues  Big part of it is the additional security services on top of it  and we really created a consolidation on the gateway I am really glad  because when we look into the next decade  I think what we are trying to build now with Infinity  is the next platform that will go beyond the gateway and will bring something with the same principles to the entire network security landscape  having the cloud as the first priority  but also the IoT and other spaces in that space  I really like to hope if we look forward 10 years from now  we will see Check Point building such a platform beyond just the network security field  and extending it to the bigger  bigger cyber security landscape  providing the same kind of consolidation and unification OperatorOur next question is from Daniel Ives with Wedbush Securities  Please proceed Daniel Ives    Wedbush Securities    AnalystYeah  thanks  So as you think about the cloud transition  when you look at your current product portfolio versus let s just say  potential acquisition  just how are you thinking about it buy versus build  in terms of just cloud and going after the 2020 opportunity there Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerI think  first  we have today a very very rich cloud platform  including all the key elements  The cloud virtual servers  the multicloud management  private cloud  public cloud  cloud workload  cloud SaaS security as a service or security for software as a service  actually multiple Ss there  A cloud provided security  like the CloudGuard Connect and the SD WAN solution that s included with that  So I think we ve built a very strong platform  I think the core of the platform is built by us  it s based on our threat cloud  and now in Infinity NEXT  which is brand new technology platform for delivering security  from what we call a cloud brain Inside that  we have a lot of technologies and the lot of places  where we can augment it with acquisition  And I think just this year  we made three acquisitions or just in 2019  we completed three acquisitions in the cloud space for serverless functions  for a    web services on the cloud  which is very important  at the beginning of the year  And IoT which is    while it s not cloud  the security is delivered from the cloud  and using that cloud to deliver security  And that s on top of what we ve done in 2018 for the cloud management with Dome9 So I think we will continue to look for more opportunities we will  I think as I mentioned before  we are    we want to secure now at least 50 type of assets  many of them    more than 20 types of these assets are workloads on the cloud  and the nano agent that we will put into them is sometimes made by us  sometimes it s a combination of something made by Check Point and new technologies that are being acquired  and we will continue to look in all those spaces  Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies  Please proceed Brent Thill    Jefferies    AnalystThanks  Tal  billings that missed consensus numbers  I m just curious for this year  how we should be thinking about billings  Is it something you pay attention to you  or how we should think about that  As that remains a key metric that many investors are focused on Tal Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating OfficerWe don t report billing  The reason is  that it can fluctuate easily as you ve seen this year  very clearly  or between some quarters  because billing has two effects  If you invoice multi year  you will have an upside on the billing  and if you had a great deal  but you re invoiced monthly or annually  then you won t see feel it  So we re very careful on that  well we look at it as a run rate Now rightfully  you re right  the P L reflects the run rate and the right way with a single digit  and we aspire to increase it significantly  But the guidance is aiming for single digit as well at this point  because of the transition between the products and the cloud products into subscription and the Infinity  which is annual versus multiyear and so on  So the guidance remains in this level  and like you will say it can have upside or downside  but that s where we are at this point of time OperatorOur next question is from Gregg Moskowitz  Mizuho  Please proceed Gregg Moskowitz    Mizuho    AnalystThank you very much  First just a high level question for Gil  how would you characterize  Technical Issues  Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerCould you repeat that  because you were sounding very weak  the sound Gregg Moskowitz    Mizuho    AnalystHi  Gil  Just any better Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerYes  much better  Much betterGregg Moskowitz    Mizuho    AnalystTerrific  Sorry  about that  So just a high level question  I was wondering how you would characterize demand for physical firewalls as well as the virtual today versus six to 12 months ago Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerIt s hard for me to say  Some of the shift in attention in every organization does go to new platforms  By the way  I was surprised last week when I surveyed partners to some of their priorities for 2020  I was expecting to hear  all have cloud on their agenda  but I was expecting to hear more cloud and I heard more about IoT and SD WAN connectivity  So there are multiple levels of interest  not just cloud  I think the demand for gateway and physical network security remains pretty stable  I m not sure if it means the small increases  small decreases  but stable  Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed Karl Keirstead    Deutsche Bank    AnalystThanks  Gil And Tal  I d just like to press a little bit on the Q1 in 2020 revenue growth guidance of 3   Gil  you described it as conservative  but throughout this call you and Tal have mentioned on a few occasions  this mix shift from product to subscription  which should put a little bit of pressure on growth  Tal  you mentioned not assuming some of the chunky deals that you closed in the middle of last year  So given those comments I would have expected your revenue guidance to be a little bit lower  So 3  is about what it has been frankly in the last several quarters  So there must be some positive offset to these sources of revenue growth pressure  Maybe you could outline what one or two of those that might be  Thank you Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerFirst  my aim is to much higher growth rate  I think the combination in for    is again  some of what s happening in the marketplace  some is the shift in the businesses  some of the investment in new areas  that are still fairly small  I think at the end of the day  we take all the data that we have  We balance it  and the and we got to the numbers that we got  My goal and the sales goal is to try and create business again  no matter how you measure it  If you measure it on the revenue side or you measure on other amounts that will generate at least that with amount of growth  Tal Tal Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating OfficerAgain I will do my part in the sense of the balancing  So first  you re right  I m seeing like the last few quarters  I see the 3   You re right  when the products are negative  the support is under pressure  therefore it s is going down as well  But we see the outlook for you on the CPX and the salespeople what they feel about next year  and the partners that we met in the CPX  So I think when you look at the full year  then we expect to see some changes already in the second half of the year  I don t see it tomorrow  You re right  It will take some time  But this is like balance do you can be    if the product transition to the cloud will be faster  then you right  there will be much more pressure than you thought of the guidance  But if you will see  products is picking up because of the execution of the partners and the field in the network area  then you might see an upside  And that s why we have a range OperatorOur next question is from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed Brian Essex    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi good morning and thank you for taking the question  Tal  I was wondering if I could ask you a little bit more about last quarter  I believe you noted that sales cycles are lengthening  particularly as you transition from more product to annuity type revenue  How are you seeing the backlog evolving  And maybe a Part B of that question  sales and marketing  it continues to accelerate maybe faster than revenue growth  Is there a point where you see maybe an inflection point in the backlog  where you might get more sales and marketing leverage  And how are you measuring incremental dollars of sales and marketing spend in that light Tal Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating OfficerI think Gil can say his part  The way I look at it is  it s not yet in this level  First  we would like to see  the pipeline is growing and the execution is improving and to see that booking increasing and then translating into the P L  Once you get there and you see the pipeline is growing  you will see the measurement per salesperson are improving and then you can talk about leveraging But two things are clear  the opportunities out there  The cloud opportunity is opening  We see our cloud numbers are increasing significantly  We see our Infinity and number of deals are increasing significantly  We see when we close an Infinity deal  the annual value is increasing between tens of percentage to hundreds of percentage  So the opportunities are there  Well  we need to start seeing it  building into a significant amount in order to to balance the reduction that you see in the product  And that s what we are looking for on the next year  specifically in Americas Brian Essex    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Very helpful  Maybe I could just do a quick follow up on M A activity  Is your pipeline building  Are you looking at more activity out there  or are things just    valuation expectations just too inflated at this point Tal Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating OfficerWe always look at many many opportunities  You see  this is actually    the conversion rate was high  because we converted three opportunities into acquisitions  So that I think is the most we purchased actually in one year  or if you look at 12 months from December to December  we actually had four  because last year it was in December as well  if I remember the deal  So  we see more acquisition  and then it depends on what we see  If we see good opportunity  we will seize it  definitely OperatorOur next question is from Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer  Please proceed Shaul Eyal    Oppenheimer    AnalystThank you  Hi  Good afternoon guys  Gil  I know that in prior quarters  and probably throughout 2019  the main focus from a hiring perspective was senior personnel  mostly in the US  But I wonder what the status of sales leadership is in Europe and other any changes or planned additions Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerI don t want to give too much from a competitive standpoint to all the searches and all the position we are looking  But we re looking for good people all over the world  By the way we are looking for good people also at all levels  at every level  it s important  And we do have several    and by the way  when you look at the sales in the world  I mean  we look at the total results and what the total percentage  This varies a lot we have regions within the U S   that demonstrated very nice success and very high growth rates  We have region within or countries within Europe and Asia and Latin America that demonstrated their very nice growth rate  and we have the opposite example  So I mean it s not uniform  The percentage which looking for is far from representing the run rate of every every single geography that we have So yes  we have several countries and several geographies that we are looking to strengthen our leadership  in particularly specific areas  And we re looking for good personnel  especially in the field and in sales all over the world and always OperatorOur next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi  Please proceed Walter Pritchard    Citigroup    AnalystHi  A question I guess split for Gil and Tal here  On the new appliances  you ve gone through these releases a number of times and even gone through the process of deferring more of the revenue into subscription  So I m wondering  Gil  as you look at the new appliance releases and how customers may adopt them  there is always this potential trade off of of buying cheaper boxes that have better throughput  How would you compare this release to priors  And then Tal  could you help us understand  just from a mechanical perspective  what the increased deferral rates are on the new appliances  with the subscription attach Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerSo the general direction I m looking for and we yet again don t want to pre launch anything  is to give more security value with each appliance we have  I think we need to spend for the best security  We tried last week the models when we sold the basic boxes and multiple options for different level of security  To tell you the truth  I don t think that s necessarily the right approach  Our approach should be to stand for the highest level of security  to always protect against Gen 5 security  to deliver to our customers  what we believe is right  which is the highest level of security  then we can choose to activate it  renew it  and so on  But my approach would be to give more and more security services inside the gateway that we provide  It has    again  accounting implications from calculating deferred value of the appliance and the subscription service  I think its a little bit too early to say what they are  because there is a lot of moving parts in that  like what will be the ongoing cost of the subscription after that and so on  But my aim is to provide the highest level of subscription  the highest level of security  and then to provide very competitive subscription rates for future years OperatorOur next question is from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan  Please proceed Sterling Auty    JP Morgan    AnalystYeah  thanks  Hi guys  Just wondering with the investments that you made  can you give us a sense of what the total sales and marketing headcount finished 2019 versus where it finished 2018 Tal Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating OfficerIn general  its increasing a few percentage  Average versus average  it was 7  or 8   The actual number we didn t provide  we will provide it as part of the  Indecipherable  Gil Shwed    Founder and Chief Executive OfficerAnd by the way  most of the change wasn t year end to year end  but was throughout the year  Because last year we have actually  in the end of Q4  we accelerated hiring Tal Payne    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating

123869,345384,CHKP,Try Rising P E Investing With 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"One of the most common forms of investing techniques is running after stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  That s because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for  1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 
But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why 
How Does Increasing P E Theory Work 
The concept is that as earnings rise  the price of a stock goes up  As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher  strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices 
A stock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings  So  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and believe that more positives are to come out of it 
Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero
 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said time frames  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few factors narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 42 
Here are five of 42 stocks that passed the screen 
Avinger Inc    NASDAQ AVGR    This company is engaged in designing  manufacturing and selling image guided  catheter based systems to treat peripheral arterial disease  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 23   and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

123873,345388,CHKP,Why Check Point  CHKP  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Check Point Software  CHKP   This company  which is in the Zacks Security industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This data security company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1 79  
For the last reported quarter  Check Point came out with earnings of  1 44 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 40 per share  representing a surprise of 2 86   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  1 37 per share and it actually produced earnings of  1 38 per share  delivering a surprise of 0 73  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Check Point  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Check Point has an Earnings ESP of  0 90  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 3  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-check-point-chkp-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200497699,200497699
123877,345392,CHKP,3 Cybersecurity Stocks To Watch As Ransomware Menace Spreads ,opinion,Organizations have been grappling with the issue of cybersecurity for a long time  Cyberattacks are responsible for massive losses  In fact  per Absolute Markets Insights   cyberattacks can cost companies almost  5 2 trillion every year In fact  foreign exchange company Travelex revealed that it is the most recent victim of the Sodinokibi ransomware  for which  it might have to pay a ransom of  6 million BBC said that the attackers hacked into the company s computer systems around mid 2019 and downloaded 5GB of sensitive customer data like date of birth  credit card information and national insurance numbers Cyberattacks are not only affecting companies but also threatening the national security of some countries  The U S  Iran proxy may now turn into a direct one in the digital arena  U S  cybersecurity firms working with the Trump administration are reporting multiple evidences of spear phishing emails from Iranian hackers In the past few weeks  representatives from CrowdStrike   NASDAQ CRWD   and FireEye   NASDAQ FEYE    who track hacking activities for the U S  government  reported that hackers are working for the Iranian government  Iranian government aided hackers are sending waves of spear phishing emails  targeting U S  government agencies and major sectors like oil and gas Notably  Iran s cyber attack threats have increased in the past month after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on the Iranian petrochemical sector Cybercriminals Banking on RansomwareNotably  ransomware is the most profitable malware  It infects a computer to encrypt files or systems  Typically  the victim has to cough up a ransom amount for data retrieval Notably  per Coveware  ransomware is to have caused global damage worth  11 5 billion to organizations in 2019 In late 2018  a research carried out by Check Point   NASDAQ CHKP   revealed that the GandCrab ransomware had spread across Japan  Germany  Canada and Australia  among others  in just two months  including an advanced version of the ransomware We are also aware of how organizations were affected in 2017 by the two back to back ransomware attacks   WannaCry in May and Petya in June  Cybersecurity stocks rallied throughout the year  driven by these attacks The Advent of RaaSThe unpopularity and profitability of ransomware have led malicious software developers to come up with an unusual type of software as a service   Ransomware as a service  RaaS  This is essentially a platform used by cybercriminals to attack IT systems  A malicious vendor offers hackers a platform to store computer files  information or systems seized from victims  A group of individuals maintain the codes and another group  called affiliates  spread the ransomware Notably  Sodinokibi is also a RaaS  Per   Sodinokibi has more than 40 active affiliates and its creators get between  700 and  1 500 from every payment  usually in bitcoins Why Ransomware Protection is ImportantAn antivirus alone cannot provide protection from a zero day ransomware attack  Due to the growing incidences of ransomware attacks  vendors now are offering defense approaches and decryption tools to help ransomware victims Firms primarily need to focus on protecting their business from insider threats  phishing scams and exposed databases This provides ample growth opportunities for cybersecurity firms  Here  we have shortlisted two companies with strong malware protection capabilities that are worth adding to your portfolio in the current scenario Fortinet   NASDAQ FTNT   provides broad  integrated and automated cybersecurity solutions  globally  The company offers security and networking functions that include firewall  intrusion prevention  anti malware  a virtual private network and much more  For instance  Fortinet s Security Fabric elements like FortiMail  FortiGate  FortiClient  FortiSandbox and FortiAnalyzer have capabilities to detect  prevent and mitigate damages caused by the WannaCry ransomware Fortinet carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see Moreover  Trend Micro   OTC TMICY   develops security solutions that protect against a wide range of insidious threats and combined attacks  including viruses  spam  phishing  spyware  botnets  and other Web attacks  like data stealing malware  For instance  its tools like RansomwareFileDecryptor and TeslacryptDecryptor can decrypt ransomware like Crypt variants  TeslaCrypt  AutoLocky  BadBlock and more  This stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Apart from the aforementioned stocks  CyberArk   NASDAQ CYBR   is a cybersecurity stock with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  worth considering CyberArk offers services  which protect organizational privileged accounts from cyberattacks   Recently  the company tested the prevention tactics on the Sodin ransomware and found that the CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager is effective in limiting privilege on endpoints and application greylisting control and preventing Sodin from encrypting files even with the highest privileges Bottom LineThe demand for cybersecurity solutions is expected to remain healthy owing to the increasing frequency and the technologically advanced nature of cyberattacks Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming

123906,345421,CHKP,5 Security Stocks In Focus As Zero Trust Approach Evolves,opinion,In the current security scenario  where enterprises are transitioning their workloads and data to the cloud  every point on the network is vulnerable to security breaches   With growing migration of workloads to the cloud  sensitive business data is constantly transferred between SaaS applications  IaaS  data centers  remote users  IoT devices  and like  giving cyber criminals access to wider attack surfaces and more points of entry Understanding the Prospects of Zero Trust ModelNotably  per a ResearchAndMarkets report  the Global Cloud Security is expected to hit  241 1 billion by 2025  at a CAGR of 11  from 2019 to 2025 However  the firm notes that lack of awareness about cloud security the small and medium organizations and fear of losing confidentiality are some factors restraining market growth Per IHS Markit survey authorized by Fortinet   NASDAQ FTNT    74  of respondents have moved their applications back to private infrastructure from the cloud due to security concerns Year To Date Price PerformanceTraditional security models operate under the view that everything within an organization s network can be trusted  However  with technology such as AI and ML being increasingly adopted and integrated into various phases of business process  cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated Moreover  inside attacks on sensitive data are increasing at a rapid pace than standard security controls can keep up  Per Verizon  NYSE VZ  2019  34  of cyber attacks were committed by insiders Thus  adopting new security practices that can stop threats from spreading once within an organization s network is the need of the hour In the Zero Trust approach to cybersecurity  the network and the vulnerabilities are assumed to be constantly evolving and indiscernible  This means that perimeter security is no longer enough to protect the organization  A core tenet of Zero Trust is to keep a lookout for malicious activities in all internal and external traffic  and identify the areas of improvement  Summing up  the model follows one rule    Never Trust  Always Verify  Usually  when a company inks a deal with a cloud vendor  it often thinks that the security aspect will also be taken care of by the vendor  which is not the case  This is where companies need to invest in deals with separate security vendors 5 Security Stocks to Gain From Zero Trust ModelSecurity vendors are constantly upping their efforts to tap the aforesaid areas of concern and cash in on the lucrative opportunities  They are increasingly trying to enhance the performance of organizations in a hybrid cloud environment  while maintaining their ability to manage risks Let s take a look at the five cyber security stocks that are actively working in tandem with the Zero Trust model to secure the cloud better Fortinet is benefiting from growing demand for its Security Fabric architecture and a broad range of hybrid and multi cloud deployments  Notably  the Security Fabric suit is based on the Zero Trust policy Recently  the company announced that FortiGate VM  which is powered by the

123907,345422,CHKP,Check Point Software  CHKP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Check Point Software  CHKP  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This data security company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 40 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 5  
Revenues are expected to be  490 85 million  up 4 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 05  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Check Point 
For Check Point  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 05  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Check Point will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Check Point would post earnings of  1 37 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 38  delivering a surprise of  0 73  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Check Point doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/check-point-software-chkp-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200475788,200475788

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Check Point shares have added about 5 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 6  
What s Next for Check Point 
While Check Point has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Check Point was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

123932,345447,CHKP,CHKP Stock Can Ruin A Buy The Dip Strategy,opinion,"Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP  is among the global leaders in the field of cybersecurity  The company was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Tel Aviv  Israel  but CHKP stock has traded on the NASDAQ since 1996 
CHKP went through the dot com bubble and burst in 1999 2002  Its stock price didn t fully recover from it before the year 2017  Last week  it closed at  113 32 a share  meaning buy and hold investors from 20 years ago are still at the break even point  On the other hand  those who were buying the dips in CHKP stock since 2002 have been rewarded very generously 

As the chart above depicts  the buy the dip strategy led to profits every single time since 2002  Usually  when something so simple has been working so well for so long  investors start believing it will never stop working 
Unfortunately  no trend lasts forever and therefore no strategy works forever  Market conditions eventually change  bringing losses to the careless and unprepared  Check Point is a great company  but in our opinion  the current pullback from  132 75 is not a buying opportunity  At least not yet 
No More Easy Money to Make in CHKP Stock
The reason for our pessimism is not buried in the company s fundamentals  but in the structure of the bull market since 2002  It can be seen as a textbook five wave impulse  labeled  I   II   III   IV   V   The sub waves of waves  III  and  V  are clearly visible  as well 
This pattern indicates CHKP stock is in a long term uptrend  The problem  according to the Elliott Wave theory  is that a three wave correction in the opposite direction should follow first  
The corrective phase of the cycle usually erases all of the fifth wave s progress  For CHKP  this translates into a decline to the support area of wave  IV  near  65    70 a share  There is also a bearish RSI divergence between the last three highs  which reinforces the negative outlook 
If this analysis is correct  the current dip is going to be a lot bigger than the last several ones  A much better buying opportunity should occur once CHKP stock enters the support area near  70

123933,345448,CHKP,Check Point Software  CHKP  Reports Next Week  What Awaits ,opinion,"The market expects Check Point Software  CHKP  to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This data security company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  487 56 million  up 4 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Check Point 
For Check Point  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Check Point will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Check Point would post earnings of  1 31 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 32  delivering a surprise of  0 76  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Check Point doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/check-point-software-chkp-reports-next-week-what-awaits-200440781,200440781

Let s see how things are shaping up for this upcoming announcement 
Factors at Play
Check Point s second quarter results are likely to benefit from increasing security subscription backed by strong demand for its cloud  mobile and zero day advanced threat prevention technologies 
Moreover  the company completed the ForceNock acquisition in the last reported quarter  which is a positive  The addition of machine learning to Check Point s offerings is likely to have strengthened the demand for its portfolio among customers 
The company is winning new customer accounts  which is driving revenues  In the first quarter  the number of customers who signed deals worth  1 million or more was 47  up year over year from 44 customers  This uptrend is likely to have continued in the second quarter  given the bright prospects of the cybersecurity market 
A solid product portfolio is aiding the company s growth  Notably  the Check Point Maestro Hyperscale and the 6000 Series Getaways had already attracted a few deals immediately after its launch in the first quarter  This is expected to have added significant customers in the to be  reported quarter as well 
However  increased investments in sales and marketing efforts by the company will hurt margins 
Moreover  severe competition from the likes of Palo Alto   NYSE PANW    Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO    Fortinet   NASDAQ FTNT   is expected to weigh on the company s results

by which the acquirer will buy shares of Mellanox for  125 per share in cash  indicating a total enterprise value of around  6 9 billion Mellanox refrained from issuing second quarter guidance owing to the pending acquisition of NVIDIA  The buyout is expected to close by the end of calendar year 2019 The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter earnings is pegged at  1 53  declining 1 3  in

 Mellanox announced integration with Check Point   NASDAQ CHKP    a notable cybersecurity solutions provider  with an aim to bolster adoption of its Ethernet switches  Integration of Check Point s

123941,345456,CHKP,Hacks  leaks  fake news  German fears before September vote,news,"By Andrea Shalal BERLIN  Reuters    After election hacks in the United States and France  Germany is worried it will be next  Four months before an election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes to win another term  Germany s national cyber security agency BSI warned political parties to shore up their computer defenses  The head of Germany s domestic intelligence agency last week accused Moscow of gathering a large amount of political data in cyber attacks  and said it would be up to the Kremlin whether to meddle in the Sept  24 elections  The German government has boosted funding to the BSI and will add 180 jobs to the agency this year  It is also expanding a cyber defense center and has stepped up data sharing with private sector firms  The government is even studying legislative changes to allow it to strike back   by destroying an enemy s servers  say   in the event of a major cyber attack   Despite the extra vigilance  over a dozen cyber experts  German lawmakers and government officials interviewed by Reuters say the leaders of Europe s most powerful nation face a huge challenge if they come under attacks like those on U S  presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and France s incoming president  Emmanuel Macron  whose emails were hacked   Security researchers and U S  officials believe Russian hackers were behind the U S  attack  and have warned Berlin that Moscow now has its sights on Germany  The origin of the hack of Macron s emails last week is still under investigation  In particular  German authorities worry that emails obtained by hackers in a 2015 cyber attack on the German parliament will be leaked before the Sept  24 election  Two sources familiar with the matter said one of the dozen or so accounts hit was Merkel s parliamentary account  though her primary work account was not touched  One of the sources said Peter Tauber  the CDU secretary general  was later hit by a ransomware attack  in which viruses are used to lock up a computer s data  forcing users to pay off attackers in order to regain use of their machines    Digitization has overwhelmed us  Let s not fool ourselves  Despite all the assurances about bolstering security  Germany is not really prepared for what is coming   said Dirk Arendt  a German based employee at Israeli cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP   SISYPHUS  Government and party officials declined to comment on whose accounts were hit in 2015   The BSI believes Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats  CDU  are being particularly targeted by APT 28  a Russian group U S  officials have blamed for the hacking of Clinton s emails  The BSI said APT 28  also known as  Pawn Storm  or  Fancy Bear   was behind the 2015 attack on Germany s parliament as well as two attacks on the CDU last year   Security firm Trend Micro say the group struck the think tanks of both the CDU and the Social Democrats  junior partners in Merkel s coalition government  in March and April  Trend Micro said the group also targeted Macron  Russia denies involvement in the attacks  saying it never interferes in the internal political affairs of other countries  A Kremlin spokesman said he had no idea who was behind APT 28   We do not know who these people are and have no relation to them   But U S  and German officials say the connections are clear  The head of Germany s BfV domestic intelligence agency  Hans Georg Maassen  last week said Russia is orchestrating cyber attacks and influence operations to destabilize German society  And while Germany has strengthened its defenses  gaps were inevitable  he said    I m reminded of Sisyphus continually rolling a boulder to the mountaintop only to be overtaken by his inevitable fate   he said  referring to the Greek myth symbolizing a futile act  At a meeting with Merkel in Russia this week  President Vladimir Putin described allegations of Russian attacks related to the U S  presidential election as rumors  But U S  and European officials say Moscow wants to erode confidence in Western democracies and undermine European unity    Putin s short term goal is to weaken the European consensus on sanctions against Russia   said Hans Peter Uhl  legal adviser for Merkel s conservative bloc in parliament    The long term objective is to divide the EU and secure the victory of Russian values in the battle against the West   he wrote in the group s latest magazine  The Kremlin representative called the accusations  a bald faced lie    ACTION ON MULTIPLE FRONTS Germany s parliament bolstered security after 2015  bringing in Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  to rework its software systems and providing cyber security training for its 3 000 administrative staff  said Bundestag spokesman Ernst Hebeker  But private firm secunet told lawmakers in an independent confidential assessment in February that numerous weaknesses remained  including  uncontrolled use  by lawmakers of mobile phones and tablets that are not centrally monitored  according to several sources familiar with the report  There is no ban on USB sticks  which could be infected with malicious software  they quoted the report as saying   We don t have sufficient protections for the Bundestag servers where confidential documents are stored   said August Hanning  former head of the BND foreign intelligence agency  The BSI now provides cyber training to state and federal lawmakers  political parties and their think tanks  But Germany s strict separation of powers mean it can only advise parliament and not force it to act   It s like teaching traffic safety  We say   Please don t cross the street when the light is red   But it s up to people themselves if they actually listen   BSI president Arne Schoenbohm told Reuters  Berlin is also taking steps to crack down on so called fake news  It is targeting the 3 million or so Germans with roots in Russia whom officials fear may be vulnerable to pro Russian propaganda  Those concerns were triggered by spontaneous protests in January 2016 after a bogus report about the alleged rape of a 13 year Russian German girl by a migrant  Thomas Krueger  who heads Germany s BpB agency for civic education  hosted a meeting in March for 250 leaders in the community to encourage better awareness   We just have to be open about this problem and ensure that as many people as possible develop critical thinking skills   he said  Russia is known for holding onto damaging material until a critical moment  says Jim Lewis  senior vice president at the Washington based Center for Strategic and International Studies   The wild card is   did the Russians get something in 2015 that they can detonate when the election gets closer    he said

123968,345483,CHKP,Companies look beyond firewalls in cyber battle with hackers,news,"By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV  Reuters    With firewalls no longer seen as enough of a defense against security breaches  companies are looking at new tools to foil hackers trying to enter a computer network  U S  and Israeli startups are leading the way  with new approaches such as  honeytraps  that lure a hacker to fake data or  polymorphic  technology that constantly changes the structure of applications running on a computer  Some of the technology is still in the early stages and it remains to be seen whether it will be good enough to outfox the hackers   But with corporate giants such as Sony and Twitter  N TWTR  Inc facing high profile hacks in recent years  companies are desperate for new ideas to make sure financial  personal and corporate data stays safe   We view this  deception technologies  as a  3 billion market over the next three years  with Israel and Silicon Valley being the epicenter of this innovation wave   said Daniel Ives  a senior technology analyst at FBR Capital Markets   TopSpin Security  Illusive Networks  Cymmetria and GuardiCore in Israel  California based TrapX and Attivo Networks are among a handful of start ups forging ahead with deception technology  Israel s Morphisec and U S  Shape Security are developing  polymorphic  systems  Many of those companies use techniques partly developed in the U S  and Israeli military that were taken to startups by veterans such as Gadi Evron  the head of Cymmetria and of Israel s Computer Emergency Response Team  TrapX Security offers DeceptionGrid  a technology using fake information that triggers a security alert   TrapX clients include Israel s central bank  U S  hospital chain HCA  Bezeq  Israel s largest telecoms group  and Union Bank of Israel  according to Asaf Aviram  sales director for Israel and emergent markets at TrapX  TopSpin Chief Executive Doron Kolton said his clients include one of Israel s top five banks  a large U S  hospital and a mobility technology company  The product is resold by Optiv Security in the United States and Benefit in Israel  EARLY DAYS  While still a fraction of the overall cybersecurity market  Gartner  a leading technology consultancy  sees 10 percent of businesses using deception tactics by 2018   But Gartner analyst Laurence Pingree noted that they  have so far had only nascent adoption  as many of the companies don t yet understand the technology    Educating security buyers on its usefulness will be crucial   he said  Some in the industry note that several companies including FireEye and CrowdStrike tried to launch similar products three or four years ago before pulling back although analysts say the technologies have improved greatly in the past two years    A lot of companies are looking at it but it s still early days   said a security executive with a Fortune 500 company  He said deployments were quite limited  with most trials where business test the product on a limited basis at no cost  Others said hackers may quickly be able to detect the traps   They will be challenged by the fact that  some  hackers are so sophisticated they might detect decoy servers or fake data   said Ziv Mador  head of research at Chicago based cybersecurity firm Trustwave  The technology could offer a second layer of defense to firewalls  which cannot always block malicious attempts  he said  and did not rule out Trustwave offering deception tools in the future  TopSpin s Kolton also noted that deception would be  part of a bigger solution  and to  be combined with other things    TRAIL OF BREADCRUMBS The system developed by TopSpin  whose investors include Check Point Software Technologies  O CHKP  co founder Shlomo Kramer  engages attackers once they have penetrated the network  It leads hackers to decoys by sprinkling  breadcrumbs   such as fake credentials  While the idea of a honeypot is not new  in the past they were used to alert IT administrators that there was a hacker in the system   With more advanced technology they slow the hacker and set off tools to stop them getting further into the system  If they follow the trail to the trap  the company knows they are a hacker   When someone hits a honeypot it s malicious activity   Kolton said   Attivo s website says their system lures attackers into revealing themselves when they start to look for  high value assets   It also promises no false alarms  a problem with traditional detection systems   Other tools are being developed that would prevent hackers from penetrating a network entirely  Morphisec  backed by Jerusalem Venture Partners  Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  and GE Ventures  has developed technology that randomly changes the structure of applications running on the computer   When an attack seeks its target it expects to find a certain memory structure  With Morphisec it finds something different   Morphisec CEO Ronen Yehoshua said  Shape Security of California also uses such  polymorphic  technology  While these new ideas have mainly been generated by start up companies  investors say bigger  more established security players are interested

123976,345491,CHKP,Check Point  CHKP  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Check Point Software  CHKP  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Check Point is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Check Point imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Check Point
This data security company is expected to earn  6 05 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Check Point  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Check Point to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-04-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/check-point-chkp-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200408753,200408753

123995,345510,CHKP,Israeli military networks breached by hackers  researchers,news,"By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Hackers have managed to penetrate computer networks associated with the Israeli military in an espionage campaign that skillfully packages existing attack software with trick emails  according to security researchers at Blue Coat Systems Inc  The four month old effort  most likely by Arabic speaking programmers  shows how the Middle East continues to be a hotbed for cyber espionage and how widely the ability to carry off such attacks has spread  the researchers said  Waylon Grange  a researcher with the Blue Coat  PRJCBB UL  who discovered the campaign  said the vast majority of the hackers  software was cobbled together from widely available tools  such as the remote access Trojan called Poison Ivy   The hackers were likely working on a budget and had no need to spend much on tailored code  Grange said  adding that most of their work appeared to have gone into so called social engineering  or human trickery  The hackers sent emails to various military addresses that purported to show breaking military news  or  in some cases  a clip featuring  Girls of the Israel Defense Forces   Some of the emails included attachments that established  back doors  for future access by the hackers and modules that could download and run additional programs  according to Blue Coat  Using standard obfuscation techniques  the software was able to avoid detection by most antivirus engines  Blue Coat said  At least some software lodged inside government computers  because Blue Coat detected it  beaconing   or sending signals to the hackers that it was in place  An Israei defense ministry spokeswoman referred questions to the military  Military officials said they were  not aware of hacking on IDF operational networks    Blue Coat provided Reuters with an advance look at its findings and intends to publish a paper later  The security firm  based in Sunnyvale  California  is set to be acquired by private equity firm Bain Capital LLC  Citing confidentiality agreements with clients  Blue Coat declined to say exactly where the campaign worked  and Grange said he did not know if any vital data had been stolen  Blue Coat surmised that the attackers spoke Arabic because some of the data recovered in the investigation showed that was the default language setting in one of the programming tools   Not all targeted attackers need advanced tools   Blue Coat wrote in a draft paper   As regional conflicts continue  cyber threats from groups of various skill levels will also accompany the conventional armed conflicts   Last month  Israeli security firm Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP  said it had found spying programs in 10 countries that probably originated with a governmental or political group in Lebanon that deployed them over three years

revenues and improved gross profit due to sales mix shift to higher margin subscription services  which were partially offset by elevated operating expenses  particularly sales and marketing  S M  Quarter in DetailFortinet reported first quarter revenues of  399 million  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  390 million  The reported figure also came in 17 1  higher than the year ago tally  Revenues also came ahead of management s guided range of  387  393 million  A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the reported quarter proved conducive to top line growth Segment wise  Product revenues increased approximately 6  year over year to  143 million  while Services revenues jumped 25  to  256 million During the quarter  the company witnessed 21  year over year growth in the number of deals worth more than  100 000  while the number of deals  worth more than  50 000  climbed 20  Billings were up 15  on a year over year basis to  463 2 million Non GAAP gross profit jumped 20 6  from the year ago quarter to  301 8 million  Moreover  gross margin expanded 220 basis points  bps  to 76 4   It also came above management s expectation of 75 76   The robust gross margin performance was mainly driven by aforementioned shift in sales mix to higher margin subscription services Furthermore  non GAAP operating expenses jumped 11 5  year over year to  234 million  The figure includes a benefit of  11 7 million from adoption of new accounting standards which resulted in lower commission  Excluding the same  operating expenses flared up 17  to  247 million Management noted that the increase was mainly due to an impact of  7 million from unfavorable currency exchange rates and a 16 8  increase in S M expenses  Hiring was the main factor that resulted in higher S M costs  The company revealed that since last September head counts in S M department has increased 12  Non GAAP operating profit surged 65 6  to  70 7 million from approximately  42 7 million in the year ago quarter  Non GAAP operating profit margin expanded 520 bps to 17 7   The figure includes a 390 bps benefit from the aforementioned accounting standard adoption  Excluding the same  operating income improved 130 bps to 13 8   which came above management s guided range of 12 13   Increase in operating margin mainly attributed to higher gross margin Fortinet  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Balance Sheet   Cash FlowFortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of approximately  1 30 billion  down from  1 25 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter  Accounts receivable were  313 1 million compared with  348 2 million recorded at the end of fourth quarter 2017 During the first quarter  the company generated operating cash flow of  139 7 million  Free cash flow came in at  128 1 million  Fortinet bought back 2 5 million shares for  115 5 million during the quarter GuidanceBuoyed by overwhelming first quarter results  Fortinet raised guidance for full year 2018 For 2018  management now projects revenues at  1 715  1 735 billion  mid point   1 725 billion   up from the previous range of  1 695  1 715 billion  mid point   1 705 billion   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at  1 71 billion  Billings range has also been raised to  2 040  2 065 billion from  2 030  2 050 billion forecasted previously However  non GAAP gross margin remained unchanged at 75 76   Non GAAP operating margin projections have been raised to 20 2 20 7  from the previous range of 17 7 18   Non GAAP operating margin include a 250 bps benefit related to the adoption of new accounting standards Non GAAP earnings per share are now estimated between  1 51 and  1 55  mid point  1 53   up from earlier forecast of  1 30  1 32  mid point  1 31   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 42 per share  The updated range includes a 19 cent benefit from new accounting rules adoption The company initiated outlook for the second quarter The company s forecasts for the second quarter are impressive  Management expects revenues of  420  430 million  mid point   425 million   which is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  415 3 million  Billings are estimated in the range of  485  495 million Non GAAP earnings per share are anticipated in the band of 34 36 cents  mid point  35 cents   The guidance range is higher than the Consensus Estimate of 33 cents  but represents a year over year increase of 27 33   Non GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 75 76   whereas non GAAP operating margin is anticipated between 18 5  and 19  Our TakeFortinet s network security solutions include firewall  VPN  application control  antivirus  intrusion prevention  web filtering  anti spam and WAN acceleration  The company started 2018 on a strong note  reporting solid results for the first quarter  and provided an impressive outlook for the upcoming quarter as well as full year We believe Fortinet s initiative to change its business model to subscription based service provider is paying off as evident from improving margins  Subscription based service is a high gross margin business  approximately 80   compared with the hardware centric model Notably  the company generates more than 50  of the total revenues from these services  which helped it generate a 70 bps gross margin expansion in 2017 and 220 bps in the first quarter of this year  We anticipated this strategy will continue to improve the company s bottom line performances as well Nonetheless  we are slightly concerned over the company s slowing revenue growth rate  Notably  over the last seven quarters  the company s revenue growth rate has been around 20   significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30   Additionally  Fortinet s second quarter revenue growth rate guidance range of 15 5 18 3  is also under 20  In addition to this  competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Check Point   NASDAQ CHKP    Juniper Networks   NYSE JNPR   and Palo Alto Networks  remains a concern Currently  Fortinet has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

Israel has more than 90 companies listed on the Nasdaq  Big tech giants have many R D centers located in the country  In particular  Israeli companies are leaders in cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles technologies 
Steven explained how such a small country with a population of about 9 million  became a high tech hub  
Given Israel s location  geopolitical risks remain high  We discussed how Israeli companies continue to thrive despite challenges 
We then talked about the index  which includes tech companies listed in Israel as well as globally   Steven described how companies are selected and weighted in the index 
The ETF holds some well known companies like Check Point   NASDAQ CHKP    Amdocs   NASDAQ DOX    Nice   NASDAQ NICE    and CyberArk   NASDAQ CYBR    These companies are very global in their operations and there are some that are focused on the domestic market 
Many US investors have a lot of exposure to US tech and the sector has delivered excellent performance over the past few years  But now there are concerns about increased regulatory oversight and stretched valuations 
Steven explained why investors should take a look at this ETF given very low representation of Israeli tech stocks in broader tech indexes 
We also talked about BlueStar s indexes in Israel that are increasingly being used by domestic investors  and why that is relevant for ITEQ

124005,345520,CHKP,Check Point Software  CHKP  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Check Point Software  CHKP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This data security company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 63 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 2  
Revenues are expected to be  516 13 million  up 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Check Point 
For Check Point  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Check Point will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Check Point would post earnings of  1 36 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 38  delivering a surprise of  1 47  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

124031,345546,CHKP,Check Point  CHKP  Q4 Earnings Top  Revenues Miss Estimates,opinion,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd    NASDAQ CHKP   reported mixed results for fourth quarter 2017 wherein earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues fell short of the same  However  on a year over year basis  the company registered growth on both counts Check Point s non GAAP earnings per share  excluding stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets  of  1 58 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 51 and came in above its guidance range of  1 45  1 55  Non GAAP earnings also climbed approximately 8  on a year over year basis  driven mainly by elevated revenues  efficient cost management and a lower share count RevenuesFourth quarter revenues came in at  506 million  up 4  year over year and marginally came in above the mid point of the company s guidance of  485  525 million  mid point  505 million   However  the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  509 million Quarterly revenues were mainly driven by strong adoption of the company s products  particularly its Infinity platform  which was launched in the third quarter  The company  during the fourth quarter earnings conference call  hinted that its revenues have been affected due to significant changes made in the U S  sales force which has not yet reached full potential  Notably  the company generates approximately 45  of its total revenues from the Americas However  dismal performance in the Americas was more than offset by strong performance across the Europe and Asia Pacific  Japan  Middle East and Africa regions  Europe accounted for 39  of total revenues  while the Asia Pacific  Japan  and the Middle East and Africa added the remaining 16  Segment wise  the company witnessed sales growth of 2 8  in Product and Security Subscriptions  and 5 6  in Software Updates and Maintenance  The company also reported 18  surge in subscription revenues at Software Blades Talking about deal size  the number of new customers   who signed deals worth  1 million or more  totaled 110  up 11  from year ago quarter  Also  customers  who signed deals worth  50 000 and more  contributed 75  to the total order value  which is equal to the fourth quarter 2016 tally Operating ResultsOn a year over year basis  non GAAP gross profit climbed 4 6  to  448 8 million  As a percentage of revenues  gross profit expanded 50 basis points  bps  to 88 7  Non GAAP operating expenses decreased 3 7  year over year to  156 7 million  As a percentage of revenues  operating expenses contracted 200 bps mainly due to efficient cost management Non GAAP operating income came in at  292 1 million  up nearly 9 7  year over year  In addition  margins advanced 300 bps to 57 7  primarily due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues Non GAAP net income was  259 2 million or  1 58 per share  up from  247 2 million or  1 46 reported in the year earlier quarter Check Point Software Technologies Ltd  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Balance Sheet   Cash FlowCheck Point exited the fourth quarter with cash balances of approximately  3 848 billion  slightly down from  3 865 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter  During 2017  the company generated operating cash flow of  1 09 billion In addition to this  during the reported quarter  the company generated cash worth  248 1 million from operational activities   marking a 36  year over year improvement  The robust growth in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to strong collections from customers and a reduction in the tax advances paid to the authorities in Israel Additionally  Check Point repurchased about 9 6 million shares for a total cost of  995 3 million in 2017 OutlookTaking into account the ongoing challenges related with the U S  sales force  the company provided outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018  However  Check Point s revenues and earnings guidance for both periods remained below our expectations For the first quarter  the company expects to generate revenues between  440 million and  460 million  mid point  450 million   The mid point of the guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  460 7 million  Non GAAP earnings are projected in the range of  1 25  1 35 per share  GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be 14 cents lesser than the non GAAP figure  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 33 For the current year  Check Point anticipates generating revenues between  1 9 billion and  2 0 billion  mid point  1 95 billion   The mid point of the guided range is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 98 billion  Non GAAP earnings are projected in the band of  5 50  5 90 per share  mid point  5 70   GAAP earnings per share are projected to be 62 cents lesser than the non GAAP figure  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  5 74 Stock PerformanceShares of Check Point remained highly volatile during yesterday s trade  Following the earnings announcement  the stock opened its trade at a price 2 3  lower than the closing price on Jan 30  However  by the end of the day  it recovered much of this loss and eventually closed trade below 1  Notably  the stock has underperformed the  to which it belongs to over the past year  The industry has recorded growth of 12 4  during the period  while Check Point has gained a meager 5 6  
 Our TakeCheck Point s ongoing issues related with the changes it made in its U S  sales force makes us skeptical about the company s near term performance  It looks like the recently joined people are taking more than expected time for reaching their full potential  The same is reflected in the company s outlook too  Although the issue is temporary  it is wise to stay away from investing in this stock right now until we get some clear visibility on its sales force execution in the United States The stock carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Some better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Mellanox Technologies  Ltd    NASDAQ MLNX    Advanced Micro Devices  Inc    NASDAQ AMD   and SMART Global Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ SGH    While Mellanox Technologies sports a Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy   Advanced Micro Devices and SMART Global Holdings carry a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   You can see  Mellanox Technologies  Advanced Micro Devices and SMART Global Holdings have expected long term EPS growth rates of 15 5   7 8  and 15   respectively Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ",2018-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/check-point-chkp-q4-earnings-top-revenues-miss-estimates-200285911,200285911

124061,345576,CHKP,Can Check Point Software Maintain Its Performance In 2018 ,opinion,Check Point Software Technologies Ltd    NASDAQ CHKP   is one of those cybersecurity companies that have demonstrated remarkable share price performance in the year so far  The stock has rallied 23 5  in the year so far  outperforming the ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF s  return of 18 8  It is worth mentioning that the stock has managed to register this gain despite witnessing a significant plunge in the last two months  Notably  Check Point Software has lost about 12  of its value since last earnings  reported on Oct 31  as the revenue guidance for fourth quarter 2017 fell short of street expectations The company  during its last earnings conference call  hinted that the fourth quarter revenues might be hit slightly due to significant changes made in the U S  sales force which may take some time to reach its full potential However  we believe this is a temporary issue and the newly joined sales forces will reach their full potential in the next quarter  and will once again display good revenue growth  Therefore  investors need not to worry about its growth prospects  It is not Check Point Software s earnings results  but its approach of doing business makes us confident about the company s growth prospects  Let s check out management s approach and consider why the company will continue its momentum in the next year as well  Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018  Be among the first to see our   Transitioning to Subscription based Business ModelIt is not a secret that Check Point Software intends to drive more revenues by selling subscription based solutions and services  In the first nine months of 2017  Software Blades subscription revenues have jumped approximately 25  year over year Although  the company s subscription based Software Blades constitute only approximately 26  of the total revenues currently  looking at its fast growth rate  its contribution to total revenues is likely to increase significantly in the next few years It should be noted that this business model has very unique features   it generates stable recurring revenues with high gross margin  Therefore  the more the company sells subscription based solutions and services  the more it will able to generate steady revenues   the benefit of which will pass onto the bottom line performance Better Expense ManagementWe consider that Check Point Software management s approach of not growing at the cost of margins and earnings keep it ahead of its peers like Palo Alto Networks   NYSE PANW    Fortinet   NASDAQ FTNT   and Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   This approach has remained a controversial point for the company as many believe this might somewhat impede its top line growth  However  a better control on spending has kept Check Point Software consistently profitable unlike its aforementioned peers which are struggling with escalating overhead costs Notably  Check Point Software spends only a quarter of its revenues toward sales and marketing  while its peers spend about 40 60  of revenues  This makes a huge difference  as with just a 6  rise in revenues  Check Point Software s non GAAP EPS grew 15  in the last quarter Huge Cash Pile Provides Opportunities for GrowthThe company s debt free balance sheet  along with a huge cash balance of approximately  3 865 billion as of Sep 30  makes easier to fund its growth initiatives  such as investments in research and developments  sales and marketing as well as acquisitions Also  its ability to generate substantial operating and free cash flow every quarter helps it enhance shareholders  value through share repurchases Stay InvestedWe consider that Check Point Software could be a good long term safe bet for risk averse investors  given its steady revenue growth  increasing subscription based revenues contribution  continued focus on cost minimization and a huge available cash balances to fund its growth opportunities On the valuation front too  the company looks very attractive  The stock currently trades at forward earnings multiple of 19 6x  which is way lower than the peer group average of 43 28x Also  Check Point Software has a  of B  Notably  the VGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles  helping to identify those with the most attractive value  best growth  and most promising momentum  across the board  This assures our point that the stock has still plenty of upside potential left The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana       Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2017-12-21,Zacks Investment

RevenuesFortinet reported third quarter revenues of  374 2 million  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  371 million and up 18 2  year over year  Segment wise  Product revenues increased 7  year over year to  137 1 million  while Services revenues jumped 26  to  237 1 million The year over year improvement was primarily aided by growth in sales productivity and success in selling multiple product deployments  A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the reported quarter also proved conducive to top line growth During the third quarter  the company witnessed 18  year over year growth in the number of deals worth over  100 000  while the number of deals worth more than  250 000 and  500 000 climbed 26  and 50   respectively Billings were up 24  on a year over year basis to  431 7 million Operating ResultsNon GAAP  excluding stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets  gross profit jumped 20 8  from the year ago quarter to  283 4 million  Moreover  gross margin expanded 170 basis points  bps  to 75 7   primarily backed by sales of higher value subscription bundles  It also came ahead of management s expectation of 75  Furthermore  the company efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter  As a percentage of revenues  non GAAP operating expenses contracted 250 bps year over year to 57   In dollar terms  however  the figure advanced 13 1  to  213 2 million Non GAAP operating profit surged 52 5  to  70 million from approximately  45 9 million in the year ago quarter  Non GAAP operating profit margin expanded 420 bps to 18 7   mainly attributed to improved gross margin and efficient cost management  Operating margin also surpassed the company s guidance range of 16 17  Fortinet s non GAAP earnings per share of 28 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents  Also  earnings came in higher than management s guidance range of 22 23 cents and marked a solid improvement over the year ago quarter s earnings of 18 cents  driven mainly by higher revenues and efficient cost management Balance Sheet   Cash FlowFortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of approximately  1 28 billion  up from  1 21 billion recorded at the end of the second quarter  Accounts receivable were  258 million compared with  271 1 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter During the first three quarters of 2017  the company generated operating cash flow of  436 9 million  Free cash flow for the first nine months of the year came in at  315 2 million  Fortinet bought back 3 25 million shares for  124 million during the first three quarters of 2017 This month management also announced an increase of  400 million in share repurchase authorization  bringing the total authorization amount to  1 billion GuidanceDespite reporting impressive third quarter results  Fortinet lowered its revenue and billings guidance for the full year  and provided a disappointing outlook for the current quarter For 2017  management now projects revenues in the range of  1 482  1 490 billion  mid point   1 486 billion   down from the earlier guidance of  1 487  1 495 billion  mid point   1 491 billion   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at  1 49 billion  Billings forecast has also been trimmed to  1 772  1 787 billion from  1 775  1 795 billion Nevertheless  the company anticipates that its cost management initiatives to drive its margins and earnings per share  Therefore  it raised its non GAAP gross and operating margin projections to 75  and 17   respectively  Earlier guidance ranges for gross and operating margin were 74 5 75  and 16 2   respectively Similarly  non GAAP earnings per share are now estimated to come between  1 00 and  1 02  mid point  1 01   up from the range of 94 96 cents  mid point  95 cents  predicted earlier The company s forecasts for the fourth quarter are slightly lackluster  Management expects revenues in the range of  404  412 million  mid point   408 million   which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  416 59 million at mid point  Billings are estimated in the range of  510  525 million Non GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to come in the band of 28 30 cents  mid point  29 cents   Although  it is a penny higher than the Consensus Estimate  but represents a year over year decline of 3 3   Non GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the range of 75 76   whereas non GAAP operating margin is anticipated to be between 18  and 19  Our TakeFortinet s network security solutions include firewall  VPN  application control  antivirus  intrusion prevention  web filtering  anti spam and WAN acceleration  The company reported better than expected third quarter results  Despite persistent macro uncertainties  management seems to be optimistic on the back of a healthy network security market  solid product line up and investment plans Despite all these  shares of Fortinet dropped approximately 8  during yesterday s after hour trade  as investors seemed concerned over the company s slowing revenue growth rate  Notably  over the last five quarters  the company s revenue growth rate has been around 20   significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30   Additionally  Fortinet s third quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 11 3 13 6  In addition to this  competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Check Point   NASDAQ CHKP    Juniper Networks   NYSE JNPR   and Palo Alto Networks  remains a concern Nonetheless  we believe Fortinet s initiative to change its business model to subscription based service provider will continue to drive the company s bottom line results  Subscription based service is a high gross margin business  approximately 80   compared with the hardware centric model Notably  the company generates over 50  of the total revenues from these services  which helped it generate a 170 bps gross margin expansion in the third quarter  We anticipated this strategy will continue to improve the company s bottom line performances as well Fortinet has outperformed the  to which it belongs to in the year to date period  The stock has returned 33 1   while the industry registered growth of 26 3  during the same time frame  Currently  Fortinet has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments

year over year to  142 7 million  while Services revenues jumped 26  to  220 8 million The year over year improvement was primarily aided by growth in sales productivity and success in selling multiple product deployments  A large number of deal wins and customer additions during the quarter also proved conducive to top line growth During the quarter  Fortinet added over 10 000 customers  bringing the total count to over 320 000 The company witnessed 21  year over year growth in the number of deals worth over  100 000  while the number of deals worth over  250 000 and  500 000

gross margin expanded 80 basis points  bps  to 73 7   primarily backed by sales of higher value subscription bundles Furthermore  the company efficiently managed its operating expenses this quarter  As a percentage of revenues  non GAAP operating expenses contracted 570 bps year over year to 55 6   In dollar terms  however  the figure advanced 5 9  to  202 1 million Non GAAP operating profit jumped 82 7  to  65 7 million from approximately  36 million in the year ago quarter  Non GAAP operating profit margin expanded 650 bps to 18 1   mainly attributed to improved gross margin and efficient cost management Balance Sheet   Cash FlowFortinet exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of approximately  1 21 billion  almost flat with  1 20 billion recorded at the end of the first quarter  Accounts receivable were  271 1million compared with  271 1 million recorded at the end of the previous quarter During the first half of 2017  the company generated operating cash flow of  274 5 million  Free cash flow for the first two quarters came in at  174 6 million  Fortinet bought back 849 000 shares for  33 2 million during the first half of 2017 GuidanceBuoyed by a better than expected second quarter performance  Fortinet raised its outlook for full year 2017  For 2017  management now expects revenues in the range of  1 487  1 495 billion  mid point   1 491 billion   up from the earlier guidance of  1 485  1 495 billion  mid point   1 490 billion   Billings forecast has also been raised to  1 775  1 795 billion from  1 770  1 792 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at  1 49 billion Similarly  non GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between 94 cents and 96 cents  mid point 95 cents   up from of 89 91 cents  mid point  90 cents  predicted earlier Non GAAP gross margin is now anticipated to come between 74 5  and 75  compared with the earlier forecasted range of 74  75   Non GAAP operating margin is projected to come at 16 2  However  the company s revenue forecast for the third quarter is slightly disappointing  Management expects revenues in the range of  367  373 million  mid point   370 million   which is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  371 45 million at mid point  Billings are estimated in the range of  417  427 million Non GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to come in the band of 22 23 cents  mid point  22 5 cents   Non GAAP gross margin is expected to be 75   whereas non GAAP operating margin is anticipated to be between 16  and 17  Our TakeFortinet s network security solutions include firewall  VPN  application control  antivirus  intrusion prevention  web filtering  anti spam and WAN acceleration  The company reported better than expected second quarter results  Despite persistent macro uncertainties  management seems to be optimistic on the back of a healthy network security market  solid product line up and investment plans  Furthermore  the company s upbeat guidance for full year 2017 is encouraging Despite all these  shares of Fortinet dropped over 4  in yesterday s after hour trade  as investors seemed concerned over the company s slowing revenue growth rate  Notably  over the last four quarters  the company s revenue growth rates have been around 20   significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30   Additionally  Fortinet s second quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 15 9 17 8  Moreover  competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    Check Point   NASDAQ CHKP    Juniper Networks   NYSE JNPR   and Palo Alto Networks  remains a concern Nonetheless  we opine that Fortinet s initiative to change its business model to subscription based service provider will continue to drive the company s bottom line results  Subscription based service is a high gross margin business  approximately 80   compared with the hardware centric model Notably  the company generates over 50  of the total revenue from these services  which helped it generate a 80 basis points gross margin expansion in the second quarter  We believe that this strategy will continue to improve the company s bottom line performances as well Notably  the stock has returned 34 7  in the year to date period compared with the  s gain of 20 6  in the same time frame

124104,345619,CHKP,Here s Why Cybersecurity Stocks  PANW  FEYE  FTNT  Gained Today,opinion,"Shares of cybersecurity stocks and related ETFs are up almost across the board on Wednesday after Gartner   NYSE IT   released a report that pointed to the sector s growth potential in 2017 and beyond 
Cybersecurity is in vogue  but based on the increasing amount of incidents  attacks  and multiple reports on its growth potential  including Gartner s recent projections  cybersecurity will be an economic necessity and an even bigger business from now on 
The firm points to an array of factors that will contribute to the sector s rise  one of which is the vast amount of growth potential for IT security startups  especially in the business to business sector 
Gartner Report 
Gartner  which claims to have the  largest base of IT research analysts and consultants in the world   projects global cybersecurity spending to grow by 7  in 2017 to reach  86 4 billion  The firm pointed to data breaches and an increased demand for app security testing as part of the reason for the growth  as first reported by  
The report also suggests that spending on emerging application security testing tools will help lead to growth through 2021  Gartner sees interactive application security testing increasing in the ever growing mobile world where apps rule  The idea is that companies and small startups  which count on their apps in order to grow and maintain their business  will need to run security tests and equip their apps with advanced cybersecurity software 
 Rising awareness among CEOs and boards of directors about the business impact of security incidents and an evolving regulatory landscape have led to continued spending on security products and services   principal research analyst Sid Deshpande  
While the report notes that IT security spending will go up dramatically  Gartner notes that physical hardware support services will decline due to the rise of cloud computing and non hardware based IT services 
Gartner also cites the European Union s    as a major growth catalyst because it will force companies to spend money on cybersecurity  The EU regulatory body will begin to enforce the new law  which requires companies and other entities to meet certain cybersecurity thresholds or face heavy fines  on May 25  2018 
Cybersecurity 
Other firms have been even more optimistic than Gartner in terms of cybersecurity s growth potential 
  the worldwide cybersecurity market will soar to  137 85 billion in 2017 and skyrocket to  231 94 billion by 2022  Markets and Markets points to  strict data protection directives and cyber terrorism   and the proliferations of internet connected devices as major reasons for the firm s massive growth projections 
On Tuesday  Los Angeles city officials announced a plan to have the city and companies share information about cybersecurity threats  The hope is to help businesses in the greater LA area become better protected by sharing their knowledge and experiences with cybersecurity threats and breaches 
 We need to leave behind the concern about how we will be judged by others and realize it happens to everyone   Riot Games  director of security  Christopher Hymes  who is an early partner in the initiative     If all participating companies come to the table with that attitude and share their experiences  it will be successful

guidance range of  420  440 million  mid point  430 million   Transition of customers to the company s higher valued packages and shift of revenues from products to subscriptions as a result of bundling of new appliances mainly contributed to Check Point s overall revenue growth Another factor contributing to overall growth was the increased number of large deal signings  The number of new customers who signed deals worth  1 million or more was 50  a 16  increase from the year ago quarter s tally of 43  Moreover  customers  who signed deals worth  50 000 and more  contributed 70  to the

the second quarter Moving ahead  rapid adoption of Check Point s data center appliances and continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide ample top line support  The company s focus on enhancing mobile capabilities will aid it to tap greater larger opportunities  Furthermore  Check Point s strategy of growing through acquisitions is praiseworthy Additionally  we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions  Note that the financial well being  brand image and reputation of enterprises  and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats  Consequently  cybersecurity has become a mission critical  high profile requirement Nonetheless  changing customer spending behavior

124168,345683,CHKP,FireEye  FEYE  Soars On Narrower Q1 Loss   Solid Outlook,opinion,"It seems that FireEye Inc  s   NASDAQ FEYE   turnaround efforts such as product refreshes  acquisitions and cost optimization are paying off  as reflected from the company s splendid first quarter results  along with the overwhelming second quarter and 2017 outlook  which were released yesterday  The cyber security solution provider s first quarter results not only fared better than our estimates  but also marked a significant year over year improvement Although  FireEye continued to report loss by posting adjusted loss  excluding one time items but including stock based compensation  of 34 cents per share in the first quarter  the figure was significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 57 cents and the year ago quarter s loss of 83 cents On a GAAP and non GAAP basis as well  the year over year comparisons were favorable  On a GAAP basis  the company reported loss of 48 cents per share  while it had reported a loss of 98 cents in the year ago period On a non GAAP basis  FireEye posted loss per share of 9 cents compared with a loss of 47 cents in first quarter 2016  The quarter s non GAAP loss per share was also significantly narrower than management s loss guidance of 26 28 cents  mid point  27 cents   Notably  this was the third consecutive quarter of better than expected results for the bottom line and year over year improvement FireEye  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    A better than expected quarterly result  along with solid outlook  boosted the confidence of investors  thereby sending the company s shares up nearly 15  in yesterday s after hour trade Notably  for the past couple of years  the stock has not been doing well and lost over 80  of value from its pick  In the last one year period  FireEye underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  The stock lost nearly 17 3  in the said period comparing unfavorably with the industry s gain of 18 5  RevenuesFireEye s top line performance was encouraging too  The company s first quarter revenues of  173 7 million not only registered a year over year increase of 3 4   but also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  164 million as well as its own guidance of  160  166 million  mid point   163 million  The company revealed that a more strengthened leadership team  improved sales execution  enhanced relationship with channel partners and product launches  including Helix and HX  were the main reasons behind this splendid top line performance Further  though billings decreased 18  to  152 4 million  but the figure was well above management s guidance of  130  150 million  mainly attributed to all the factors mentioned above Segment wise  Product revenues plunged 29 6  year over year to  23 7 million  FireEye s strategy of transitioning its business to subscription and cloud based offerings from hardware offerings was the main reason for the decline in product revenues  Subscription and Services revenues  on the other hand  rose 11 7  to approximately  150 million Furthermore  FireEye continues to win large deals  Notably  the company closed 29 transactions with an individual value of over  1 million  The company also added 237 customers in the quarter Operating ResultsAdjusted gross profit increased 11 1  from the year ago quarter to  119 3 million  Gross margin expanded 480 basis points  bps  to 68 7  Adjusted operating expenses decreased 27 9  to  176 2 million  FireEye mentioned that it managed to bring down its non GAAP operating expenses on a year over year and sequential basis  supported by its consistent focus on cost optimization and productivity The company posted adjusted operating loss of  56 9 million  58 5  narrower than the year ago loss of  137 2 million  Moreover  FireEye noted that its non GAAP operating margin was  7  compared with  44  in first quarter 2016  The company stated that the quarter marked a  60 million improvement in operating loss on the back of increased operational efficiency and sales productivity Adjusted net loss for the first quarter was approximately  59 million compared with the year ago net loss of  130 5 million  On a non GAAP basis  the company reported net loss of  15 1 million compared with the prior year quarter s loss of  75 1 million Balance Sheet   Cash FlowFireEye exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of approximately  875 million  down from  935 7 million at the end of the previous quarter  Accounts receivable were  105 1 million compared with  121 2 million at the end of fourth quarter 2016  During the quarter  the company used nearly  17 million of cash for operating activities GuidanceBuoyed by impressive first quarter results  improved operational efficiency and sales productivity  as well as healthy demand for intelligence led security products  FireEye issued a strong outlook for the second quarter and full year 2017 For the second quarter  the company anticipates revenues in the range of  173  179 million  mid point   176 million   above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  172 53 million  Billings are expected in the range of  155  175 million  Non GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be approximately 72   while non GAAP operating margin is projected to remain in the band of  9  to  10  of revenues  The company projects non GAAP loss per share of 10 14 cents  mid point  12 cents   Operating cash flow is likely to remain in the range of negative  17 million to negative  27 million Notably  during the fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call  FireEye had provided only qualitative guidance for 2017  At that time  FireEye was expecting billings and revenues to improve throughout the year  mainly in the second half  It had further anticipated positive operating cash flow for the first time ever in 2017 As the latest quarterly results have now provided more insight about its future prospects  the company issued a quantitative guidance for 2017  FireEye estimates revenues in the range of  724  736 million  mid point   730 million   significantly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  718 88 million  Billings are expected in the range of  745  775 million Interestingly  the company forecasts to report its first ever positive non GAAP operating margin in 2017  However  FireEye continues to expect reporting net loss on non GAAP basis  It projects non GAAP loss per share of 26 36 cents  mid point  31 cents  As projected earlier  the company is expecting to generate operating cash flow for the first time ever in 2017 in the range of  1  10 million  Capital expenditure is projected to be within  40 million and  50 million Our TakeNotably  for the past several quarters  the company has been losing business to its rivals  FireEye faces stiff competition from other well established players such as Check Point Software   NASDAQ CHKP   and Fortinet   NASDAQ FTNT   in the cyber security space  In addition  the company s top line growth has also been affected due to its futuristic approach toward transitioning itself to cloud and shifting its business model from hardware centric to subscription based services  It should be noted that the company generates higher initial sales from hardware than the subscriptions Due to the aforementioned factors  the company s top line growth rates have been slowing down as evident from the last quarterly results Nonetheless  FireEye s management has been striving to turn the business around through a string of initiatives  which includes product launches  acquisition and cost optimization  We consider that FireEye s turnaround strategies are paying off as reflected from its latest sterling first quarter results  and solid outlook for the second quarter and full year Also  in our opinion  the company has resolved its internal challenges like filing of sales personnel vacancies and sales executions  which helped it in reporting strong quarterly results Currently  FireEye carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  A better ranked stock in the Internet Software space is 2U  Inc    NASDAQ TWOU    carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  The stock has an expected long term EPS growth rate

124183,345698,CHKP,These 5 Stocks Protect Will Protect You This Earnings Season,opinion,"Digital attacks are quickly becoming the greatest threat to our national security  Hillary Clinton has addressed the matter on multiple occasions over the course of her campaign and insists on taking an aggressive stance if she is elected president  Regardless of who wins the election  cybersecurity will have a growing importance within the United States 
We have already seen several companies embark on tackling this growing menace including large names like Cisco Systems  But the majority of the space is occupied by smaller cap companies such as  Fortinet  Check Point and Palo Alto Networks  These names along with a handful of others encompass the growing cyber security space which is seeing earnings and share prices skyrocket 
Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  Information Technology   Communications Equipment
Cisco    is the largest player in the cyber security space but its priorities go beyond just security  They continue to be a leader in data center switching  IoT and other next generation technologies  Cisco s positions in all these high growth markets have helped boost earnings in recent quarters  Both earnings and revenue have consistently outperformed expectations while growth rates remain modest 
Shares are now up 12  year to date and over 8  in the past 12 months  Given Cisco s participation in pretty much every fast growing business  it won t be surprising if they extend their winning streak with this upcoming report  Analysts at Estimize are calling for a 2  increase in EPS to 60 cents on a 1  decline in revenue to  12 44 billion for Cisco s fiscal first quarter 
FireEye Inc  NASDAQ FEYE  Information Technology   Software
Investors have hammered FireEye    this year as growth hits a wall and both earnings and revenue continue to fall short of analyst s expectations  The cybersecurity company has missed on the top line in the past two quarters while its losses remain relatively high  Shares are now down 37  year to date and 59  in the past 12 months  It isn t all that bad though 
Fireeye continues to show strong subscription revenue growth which jumped 37  last quarter  Additionally the recent chatter surrounding the Yahoo hacks or Russia are pushing companies to implement additional security measures  Investors still shouldn t have their hopes set too high for this upcoming quarterly report  The Estimize consensus has dropped significantly in the past 3 months and is now calling for a 30 cent loss on  182 40 million in revenue 
Fortinet Inc  NASDAQ FTNT  Information Technology   Software
Fortinet     like some of the other names on this list  is seeing a marked slowdown on both the top and bottom line  Shares are down over 10  today after releasing weak preliminary third quarter results  The company now expects revenue  311 and  316 million  well below analysts expectations  Early indications from management suggest the drop off it s related to a drop in urgency from consumers 
The period of frenzied spending on data protection is likely over as we now have a better picture of the landscape of cyber security  Fortinet has the market share to remain resilient but it won t be surprising if we see a broader pullback from this high growth sector  Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of 18 cents on  323 55 million in revenue  reflecting a significant increase on both the top and bottom line 
Check Point Software Technologies Ltd  NASDAQ CHKP  Information Technology   Software
Check Point    is in a similar position as FireEye where weak earnings growth have caused shares to take a tailspin  Check Point s most recent quarter featured a 10  gain on the bottom line and 7  on the top  both significantly slower than prior reports  A large portion of its revenue gains were driven by a double digit increase in subscription  software and licensing fees  Stringent cost controls from management have held them back from igniting growth  While this can often be a good thing  investors have reacted negatively to these actions 
Shares are down about 5  year to date and are historically flat immediately following an earnings report  The Estimize community has followed investors  lead  ratcheting down estimates for the upcoming quarter  Analysts are looking for earnings per share of  1 09 on  423 74 million  consistent with the ongoing downward trend 
Palo Alto Networks Inc  NYSE PANW  Information Technology   Software
Shares of Palo Alto Networks    are up over 20  in the past 3 months thanks to significant gains on both the top and bottom line  The cyber security company has deliver consistent improvements in each quarter for over 2 years  A large portion of this can be credited to the ongoing transition toward its subscription based recurring revenue initiative  In 2016  the product unit generated 48  of its total revenue with the remaining piece coming from service sales  This is a significant improvement from 2015 which has helped inspire investors to purchase the stock

Regardless of who wins the election  cyber security will have a growing importance within the United States  We have already seen several companies embark on tackling this growing menace including large names like Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   But the majority of the space is occupied by smaller cap companies such as  Fortinet  NASDAQ FTNT   Check Point  NASDAQ CHKP  and Palo Alto Networks  NYSE PANW   These names  along with a handful of others  encompass the growing cyber security space which is seeing earnings and share prices skyrocket 

Cisco Systems
Information Technology   Communications Equipment
 is the largest player in the cyber security space but its priorities go beyond just security  They continue to be a leader in data center switching  IoT and other next generation technologies  Cisco s positions in all these high growth markets have helped boost earnings in recent quarters  Both earnings and revenue have consistently outperformed expectations while growth rates remain modest  Shares are now up 12  year to date and over 8  in the past 12 months  Given Cisco s participation in pretty much every fast growing business  it won t be surprising if they extend their winning streak with this upcoming report  Analysts at Estimize are calling for a 2  increase in EPS to 60 cents on a 1  decline in revenue to  12 44 billion for Cisco s fiscal first quarter   
FireEye  NASDAQ FEYE 
Information Technology   Software
Investors have hammered  this year as growth hits a wall and both earnings and revenue continue to fall short of analyst s expectations  The cybersecurity company has missed on the top line in the past two quarters while its losses remain relatively high  Shares are now down 37  year to date and 59  in the past 12 months  It isn t all that bad though  FireEye continues to show strong subscription revenue growth which jumped 37  last quarter  Additionally the recent chatter surrounding the Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  hacks being from Russia are pushing companies to implement additional security measures  Investors still shouldn t have their hopes set too high for this upcoming quarterly report  The Estimize consensus has dropped significantly in the past 3 months and is now calling for a 29 cent loss on  184 63 million in revenue 
Fortinet 
Information Technology   Software
  like some of the other names on this list  is seeing a marked slowdown on both the top and bottom line  As a result  shares are down about 40  year to date and will continue to drop for the remainder of the year  Earlier this month  management incited a massive sell off after releasing weak preliminary third quarter results  The company reported revenue of  311 and  316 million  well below analysts expectations  Early indications from management suggest the drop off is related to a drop in urgency from consumers  The period of frenzied spending on data protection is likely over  as we now have a better picture of the landscape of cyber security  Fortinet has the market share to remain resilient but it won t be surprising if we see a broader pullback from this high growth sector  Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of 17 cents on  317 42 million in revenue  reflecting a significant increase on both the top and bottom line 
Check Point Software 
Information Technology   Software
 is in a similar position to FireEye  where weak earnings growth have caused shares to take a tailspin  Check Point s most recent quarter featured a 10  gain on the bottom line and 7  on the top  both significantly slower than prior reports  A large portion of its revenue gains were driven by a double digit increase in subscription  software and licensing fees  Stringent cost controls from management have held them back from igniting growth  While this can often be a good thing  investors have reacted negatively to these actions  Shares are down about 15  year to date and are historically flat immediately following an earnings report  The Estimize community has followed investors  lead  ratcheting down estimates for the upcoming quarter  Analysts are looking for earnings per share of  1 10 on  424 56 million  consistent with the ongoing downward trend 
Palo Alto Networks
Information Technology   Software
Shares of  are up over 20  in the past 3 months thanks to significant gains on both the top and bottom line  The cyber security company has deliver consistent improvements in each quarter for over 2 years  A large portion of this can be credited to the ongoing transition toward its subscription based recurring revenue initiative  In 2016  the product unit generated 48  of its total revenue with the remaining piece coming from service sales  This is a significant improvement from 2015 which has helped inspire investors to purchase the stock  Unfortunately  Palo Alto has a few significant roadblocks causing near term headwinds including slowing growth  increasing competition  and soaring expenses  It wouldn t be shocking if any of these factors held back growth this quarter or in the future  Expectations have been set relatively low to reflect this ongoing uncertainty  The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 56 cents per share on  401 76 million in revenue  reflecting a 56  increase on the bottom line and 35  on the top ",2016-10-19,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-it-time-to-short-cyber-security-stocks-200159389,200159389

5 Top Ranked Stocks with Rising P E for Blowout Gains

	One of the most common value investing patterns is to hunt for stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  That s because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for  1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation  The logic is simple   a stock s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside 

	But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P E can also be worth buying  We ll tell you why 

Inside the Concept of Increasing P E

	The concept is that as earnings rise  so should the price of the stock  As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher  strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices  After all  astock s P E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings 

	Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P E ratio of 30  This means that he is willing to shell out  30 for only  1 worth of earnings as he expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals 

	So  if the P E of a stock is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and believe that more positives are to come out of it 

	Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump over 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 

EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth

Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero

	 These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years  

Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeks

Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks

	 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  

Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 

Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500 

	 Here  the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  

Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100  

	 A 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal  

	In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 

Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through  You can see     

Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000    High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 

	Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 18 

	Here are five out of the 18 stocks 

Galena Biopharma Inc     NASDAQ         This is a biopharmaceutical company with a Zacks Industry Rank in the top 39   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 

Check Point Software Technologies Ltd     NASDAQ         It is a provider of policy based enterprise security and traffic management solutions  The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 39   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2

124188,345703,CHKP,Check Point Software  CHKP  Q3 Earnings  Will It Surprise ,opinion,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd    NASDAQ CHKP   is set to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 31  Last quarter  the company posted in line earnings  Notably  Check Point Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice while it has matched the same once in the trailing four quarters and has an average positive earnings surprise of 4 22  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
The heightened worries over increasing price competition in the cybersecurity space due to Fortinet Inc  s   NASDAQ FTNT   recent guidance cut have been swept away by better than expected results delivered by Proofpoint last week  This signifies that the challenges raised by Fortinet were company specific and are unlikely to impact the industry 
Therefore  we believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit through strong demand for cybersecurity solutions  Note that the financial well being  brand image and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats  Consequently  cybersecurity has become a mission critical  high profile requirement 
With rapid technological advancement  organizations are increasingly adopting the  bring your own device   BYOD  policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime anywhere access  This trend  in turn  calls for stricter data security measures 
Moreover  various independent research firms forecast strong demand ahead  According to a Markets and Markets report  worldwide cyber security spending will reach  101 billion in 2018 and  170 billion by 2020  Gartner had earlier revealed that IT security spending peaked to  75 billion in 2015 
We believe that Check Point Software is well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity and this may reflect in the company s to be reported quarterly results 
Furthermore  the rapid adoption of Check Point s data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth  Additionally  the company s continuous share buybacks bode well for investors 
However  competition from Cisco  Juniper Networks  NYSE JNPR  and Fortinet  an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds remain concerns CHECK PT SOFTW Price and EPS Surprise

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point Software will beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 97 cents  Hence  the difference is 0 00  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
Zacks Rank  Check Point Software carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Though Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of companies which  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Boyd Gaming Corp    NYSE BYD    with an Earnings ESP of  16 67  and a Zacks Rank  2 You can see  
NVIDIA Corp    NASDAQ NVDA    with an Earnings ESP of  8 93  and a Zacks Rank  3

124217,345732,CHKP,Check Point Software Technologies  CHKP   Moving Average Crossover Alert,opinion,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd    NASDAQ CHKP   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for CHKP broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 4 4  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CHKP stock 
If that wasn t enough Check Point Software Technologies isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  4 estimates have been reduced  while none have moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CHKP ",2016-08-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/check-point-software-technologies-(chkp):-moving-average-crossover-alert-200145901,200145901

124226,345741,CHKP,Earnings Watch  5 Cybersecurity Stocks Worth A Look,opinion,"Digital attacks are quickly becoming the greatest threat to our national security  Hillary Clinton has addressed the matter on multiple occasions over the course of her campaign and insists on taking an aggressive stance if she is elected president  Regardless of who wins the election  cybersecurity will have a growing importance within the United States  We have already seen several companies embark on tackling this growing menace  including large names like Cisco Systems  But the majority of the space is occupied by smaller cap companies like FireEye  Fortinet  Check Point and Palo Alto Networks  These names  along with a handful of others  encompass the growing cyber security space  which is seeing earnings and share prices skyrocket 
Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  Information Technology   Communications Equipment
Cisco is the largest player in the cyber security space but its priorities go beyond just security  It continues to be a leader in data center switching  the Internet of Things and other next generation technologies  Cisco s positions in all these high growth markets have helped boost earnings in recent quarters  Both earnings and revenue have consistently outperformed expectations while growth rates remain modest  Shares are now up 15  year to date and over 20  in the past 12 months  Given Cisco s participation in pretty much every fast growing business  it won t be surprising if it extends its winning streak with this upcoming report  Analysts at Estimize are calling for a 2  increase in EPS to 60 cents on a 1  decline in revenue to  12 44 billion for Cisco s fiscal first quarter 
FireEye  NASDAQ FEYE  Information Technology   Software
Investors have hammered FireEye this year as growth hits a wall and both earnings and revenue continue to fall short of analyst s expectations  The cybersecurity company has missed on the top line in the past two quarters while its losses remain relatively high  Shares are now down 30  year to date and 56  in the past 12 months  It isn t all that bad  though  FireEye continues to show strong subscription revenue growth  which jumped 37  last quarter  Additionally  the recent chatter surrounding the Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO  hack and Russia are pushing companies to implement additional security measures  Investors still shouldn t have their hopes set too high for this upcoming quarterly report  The Estimize consensus has dropped significantly in the past 3 months and is now calling for a 30 cent loss on  182 40 million in revenue 
Fortinet  NASDAQ FTNT  Information Technology   Software
Fortinet  like some of the other names on this list  is seeing a marked slowdown on both the top and bottom line  but that has not impacted the stock  Shares are up nearly 20  this year despite its struggles over the past 12 months  The reason Fortinet has remained resilient is because billings growth and net margins have outpaced the competition  Last quarter  both figures grew 26  and 73   respectively  compared to paltry numbers from its peers  Fortinet has the market share and sales growth to keep growing and improving its security platform moving forward  It won t be surprising if we see a significant beat this quarter driven by solid fundamentals  Analysts at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of 18 cents on  323 55 million in revenue  reflecting a significant increase on both the top and bottom line 
Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP  Information Technology   Software
Check Point is in a similar position as FireEye  where weak earnings growth has caused shares to take a tailspin  Check Point s most recent quarter featured a 10  gain on the bottom line and 7  on the top  both significantly slower than prior reports  A large portion of its revenue gains were driven by a double digit increase in subscription  software and licensing fees  Stringent cost controls from management have held it back from igniting growth  While this can often be a good thing  investors have reacted negatively to these actions  Shares are down about 4  year to date and are historically flat immediately following an earnings report  The Estimize community has followed investors  lead  ratcheting down estimates for the upcoming quarter  Analysts are looking for earnings per share of  1 09 on  423 74 million  consistent with the ongoing downward trend 
Palo Alto Networks  NYSE PANW  Information Technology   Software
Shares of Palo Alto Networks are up over 30  in the past 3 months thanks to significant gains on both the top and bottom line  The cyber security company has delivered consistent improvements in each quarter for over 2 years  A large portion of this can be credited to the ongoing transition toward its subscription based recurring revenue initiative  In 2016  the product unit generated 48  of its total revenue with the remaining piece coming from service sales  This is a significant improvement from 2015  which has helped inspire investors to purchase the stock  Unfortunately  Palo Alto has a few significant roadblocks causing near term headwinds including slowing growth  increased competition and soaring expenses  It wouldn t be shocking if any of these factors held back growth this quarter or in the future  Expectations have been set relatively low to reflect this ongoing uncertainty  The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 54 cents per share on  402 56 million in revenue  reflecting a 54  increase on the bottom line and 35  on the top

Our Most Dangerous Stocks   0 2   underperformed the S P 500   2 4   last month  Most Dangerous Large Cap stock Groupon Inc   NASDAQ GRPN  fell by 18  and Most Dangerous Small Cap Stock A H  Belo Corp  NYSE AHC  fell by 5   Overall  13 out of the 40 Most Dangerous stocks outperformed the S P 500 in June 
The successes of the Most Attractive and Most Dangerous stocks highlight the value of our forensic accounting  Being a true value investor is an increasingly difficult  if not impossible  task considering the amount of data contained in the ever longer annual reports  By analyzing key details in these SEC filings  our research protects investors  portfolios and allows our clients to execute value investing strategies with more confidence and integrity 
8 new stocks make our Most Attractive list this month and 8 new stocks fall onto the Most Dangerous list this month  July s Most Attractive and Most Dangerous stocks were made available to members on July 2 
Our Most Attractive stocks have high and rising return on invested capital  ROIC  and low price to economic book value ratios  Most Dangerous stocks have misleading earnings and long growth appreciation periods implied by their market valuations 
Most Attractive Stock Feature for July  Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP   80 share 
Check Point Software Technologies  a worldwide leader in firewall equipment  is one of the additions to our Most Attractive stocks for July and was our 
Check Point s leading position in the firewall market has allowed it to build a highly profitable SaaS business  Over the past decade  after tax profit  NOPAT  has grown by 14  compounded annually  Business strength has remained solid with NOPAT margins upwards of 40  every year since 2010 
Check Point earns an ROIC of 180   up from 37  in 2008  and the company has generated over  2 billion in free cash flow since 2011  This high return provides a great advantage over competitors who generate much lower ROICs  With more profitability  Check Point enjoys better pricing power and the flexibility to invest in new products and solutions 
CHKP is only up 2  on the year as many investors fear that new entrants threaten Check Point s foothold within the industry  These fears are unwarranted as Check Point is leveraging its superior cash flow to strengthen its existing offerings and find new services that could drive future profit growth  The good news for investors is that this pessimism has left CHKP undervalued  At its current price of  80 share  Check Point has a price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio of 1 3 
This ratio implies the market expects Check Point to only grow NOPAT by 30  over the remaining life of the company  30  profit growth is no small task  but after a decade of growing profits by 14  compounded annually Check Point is well positioned to exceed such low market expectations 
If Check Point can grow NOPAT by 9  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  110 share today   a 38  upside 
Most Dangerous Stock Feature for July  Tyco International Ltd   TYC    38 share 
Tyco International Ltd   NYSE TYC   a provider of security solutions and fire protection  is one of the additions to our Most Dangerous Stocks for July  The stock s valuation has reached dangerous heights when taking into account the business  declining fundamentals 
For fiscal years 2011 2014  the company s NOPAT fell by 19  compounded annually  The decline continues for 2015 s 1Q and 2Q results as trailing twelve month  TTM  NOPAT fell to  600 million from  900 million in fiscal year 2014 
Figure 1  Profits on the Decline
 
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The company earns a bottom quintile ROIC of 2   half of the 4  earned in 2011 and well below the 10  generated in the early 2000 s  In addition  for every year since 1999 Tyco has generated negative economic earnings  which highlights management s inability to create true shareholder value 
Forensic Accounting Reveals Overstated EPS
TYC  down 13  YTD  would be even lower if it weren t for Tyco s earnings misleading investors  There were 28 adjustments made to Tyco s 2014 income statement for a net impact of  937 million  The largest adjustment is the removal of  1 billion  57  of net income  in income from discontinued operations  After removal of these items we have found that NOPAT is  901 million  only half of the reported GAAP net income of  1 8 billion  Without forensic accounting to find and make these crucial corrections  many investors risk pouring money into companies whose profits cannot justify the valuation of their stock 
Overvalued and Very Dangerous 
Tyco earns our Very Dangerous rating not only because of its misleading earnings but also due to its lofty valuation  To justify its current price of   38 share  Tyco must grow NOPAT by 9  compounded annually for the next 14 years  This optimistic expectation contrasts strongly with the decline in NOPAT over the past four years  With better investment alternatives  such as CHKP detailed above  investors would be wise to avoid TYC

Juno Therapeutics Inc   NASDAQ JUNO  was put out as a swing trade on Wednesday  Just a gut feeling that if the market gets going  and the biotechs are starting to firm again  this stock will do well  It came across and jumped 1 67 to 51 77  on 1 8 million shares and needs to break through  If it does  it will get a quick test of the mid 50 s  and then a test of the spike highs at 59 1 2 
Nuance Communications  Inc   NASDAQ NUAN  did well on Wednesday  as it snapped back before gapping  It closed up 1 01 to 18 00  or 6 5   on a solid 5 7 million shares  However  resistance up in the 18 30 area broke and could lead to something just under 20  Then we ll see if there s any further upside  Resistance from the June 2014 was up around the 19 1 2 area  This is the immediate target  Then we re looking for something at 23 
Solar3D  Inc   NASDAQ SLTD  had the biggest day in its history on Wednesday  up 70 cents to 1 77  or 22 8   or almost 6 2 million shares  It broke through the declining topsline  went through three moving averages  backed off a bit  and closed above the resistance zone  I want to see some consolidation here that sets it up for the next move at about 4 3 4  5 1 2  and then 8 potentially  That depends on follow through and the kind of volume it gets 
Intrexon Corporation  NYSE XON  has been in a nice little consolidation for three days  and on Wednesday it popped 2 12 to 58 89  or 4   on 1 3 million shares  Volume needs to be a little better  but it looks like it s going to run up to the mid channel line at 65 6  and ultimately  there may be a big move in store for this one

124243,345758,CHKP,Stocks And Bonds Will Not Crash Soon,opinion," Always do what you are afraid to do  

 Ralph Waldo Emerson
We are listing excerpts from past market updates to illustrate how the mass mindset is always wrong  Even big shots like Bill Gross are not exempt from being sucked into this black hole  otherwise known as the mass mindset  Herd psychology clearly indicates that the only time a market is going to crash is when emotions have hit a boiling point  In other words  the crowd is foaming with joy  However  regarding bonds  there is one more factor that needs to be considered  The element of control and that element has a name  it is called the Fed  They are the ones that are going to determine when rates rise  as they are holding it down for an unusually long period  The simple question that comes to one s mind is why  The answer is equally simple  The current economic recovery is nothing but smoke and mirrors  the Fed understands that the Crowd is aware of this phenomenon  but if the markets are driven up  then a glimmer of hope emerges  Hope springs eternal and even though the masses know that all is not well  this ray of hope that things will get better because the markets are soaring higher is what keeps them trudging along  Lost to them is the fact that the markets are trending higher only because rates are being artificially kept lower  so this hope sets off a chain reaction  More hot money is needed to fuel the illusion that all is well  The only way to pull this off is to keep rates down at extremely low levels  Low rates create an environment that fosters speculation  In this environment  speculators are rewarded  and savers are punished  Unfair  Damn right but that is life  So before you jump on the bandwagon of doom  understand that most of those naysayers are like broken clocks  Even a broken clock is right twice a day  What you should strive to understand is that every disaster is nothing but opportunity dying to plant a big fat kiss on your cheeks  Embrace the bugger  instead of kicking him to the curb as most do  See the world for what it is and not what others  so called  experts force you to see  March to your drumbeat and not to the drumbeat of the talking heads  whose sole function is to add make a simple development appear to be scary and frightening  If you bought the nonsense the world was going to end  the markets were supposed to crash  blah  blah  You would have lost your shirt  your pant and your knickers in the process  Do not give credibility to people who only employ the tool of fear to sell you a bag of magic bones 
The excerpts listed below together with this chart will illustrate how dangerous it is to follow the doctors of doom  
Bill Gross has been predicting a collapse in the bond markets for quite some time and one day most likely he will get it right  Rates have to be allowed to move a little otherwise it will appear that the Feds are completely controlling everything  even though this is true  the masses do not believe this  so appearances must be maintained  Higher rates mean higher debt payments and higher costs to business and this must be avoided at all costs  Business are always given the best deal  America is bought and paid for by the corporate world

Since we made these comments  bonds have rallied nicely  but we feel that they should  key word should  retest their lows before moving higher and testing their old highs  The trend has not turned negative and the reason bonds sold off is because too many fools had over leveraged themselves in the futures markets  When there was talk from the Feds that rate hikes would be inevitable  markets pulled back and some of these long positions were so leveraged that some players were forced to liquidate their positions  this turned what would have been an orderly pullback into a short term blood bath  This pullback allowed the Feds to give the impression that they are not manipulating the markets  some stupid fat greedy bulls were slaughtered  the bears were pushed into opening new shorts  so everything has been set up for a rebound  At this point of the game  bonds are still expected to reverse course and trade higher 
Market Update May 31  2015
Bonds pulled back strongly and not only did they test their lows  they dropped to new lows  fulfilling the illusion the Feds wanted to create that the markets are free  What most have failed to note is that bonds have sold off several times during this bull market that started in 2008  In every instance  bonds recouped their losses  One day  this pattern will stop  and the trend indicator will inform us of this in advance  Until then  let the good Samaritans try to help everyone  and the naysayers sing their infamous song of impending doom  This up and down process will further cement the view that the Fed is impartial  It is the classic story  strong correction  then consolidation  lots of up and down movement  and then a new breakout that leads to new highs  
Market Update  June 19  2015
 As the trend has not turned negative  we have to view the current correction  regardless of how strong it might or might not be  as a normal cyclical move  in an otherwise healthy market 
Market Update June 30  2015 
After letting out some steam  bonds rallied as expected and by the middle of July  they had recouped almost all losses that incurred  confirming that the naysayers were wrong once again  One day bonds will correct strongly  and in our opinion  bonds are more likely to experience a stronger correction than the Stock market  Stocks are far from overvalued  and the sentiment is not euphoric yet  As long as the trend indicator is bullish or neutral  we will view all strong corrections as buying opportunities  Additionally  the Fed is not in a rush to raise rates  and they could play this game of cat and mouse forever  Ultimately as this economic recovery is nothing but illusory in nature  and the Fed will be forced to come out with another QE program  So  while many well educated  but not savvy market penguins stated that bonds were going to plunge even more  they recovered as expected  They traded past 152 153 ranges and are now on the way to test the 156 ranges  If they close above 156 on a weekly basis  then they will challenge the old highs or at the very least test them  The weekly trend is up  therefore  all pull backs have to be viewed as buying opportunities  
Market Update July 31  2015
Bonds traded as high as 159 28 before pulling back  setting up the path for a possible test of the old highs  The weekly trend is still up  so all pullbacks have to be viewed as buying opportunities  We could recite more nonsense  but that would mean wasting good time on a senseless endeavor  so we will respectively decline the offer  Bonds will crash one day  however  we would rather not fixate on one day  We prefer to look at today  and today is not the day they are going to crash  The move by China to devalue its Currency last week could very well be the excuse the Fed needed to leave interest rates untouched  and then slowly build the notion that some sort of stimulus is needed  
Market update August 19  2015 
Bonds rallied but failed to trade to new highs yet  as the trend is still up  one can expect bonds to attempt to test their highs again  As equity markets and bonds are diverging  a move to new highs by bonds  would coincide with another corrective wave in the equity markets 
 Market update Sept 1st  2015
Even if the Fed raises rates  and at this point its a 50 50 shot a best  we expect the Feds to come out with some insane form of QE  Perhaps a QE for the people might be the next game plan  It sounds insane  well believe it or not Jeremy Corbyn  Britain s new labour party leader has proposed just this  Note that QE is still going on in the form of share buybacks  Based on the number of share buybacks authorized this year  the total dollar amount is set to exceed  1 trillion  setting yet another new all time record  There is strong support in the 150 15 to 152 ranges  and the current consolidation should end there 
 Market Update Sept 15  2015 
Try to recollect how you acted every time the markets sold off  whether it s the bond market or stock market  it s irrelevant  Did you give into fear  did you panic and join herd as it stampeded towards the exit  A mind driven by panic cannot act rationally  Therefore  any action is bound to lead to a negative outcome  The best thing to do is to focus on what the crowd is doing and then use technical tools to help determine entry or exit points  It is the masses that produce the extreme moves in the market  and if you understand that fact  then you can use it to your advantage  At the Tactical Investor  the game plan is simple  every pullback is buying opportunity as long as the trend  based on our trend indicator is up   The stronger the pull back  the better the buying opportunity 
So what s next 
First and foremost  make sure you never listen to the Doctors of Doom  They are not out there to help you  they will cloud the picture even more  If they knew when the markets were going to crash  then they would be sitting on the beaches of some tropical paradise  sipping Pina Coladas and raking in the millions  Instead  you find them screaming bloody nonsense and doing their best to scare individuals into believing what they very well know to be nonsense  Understanding the psychology of the masses is key to being a successful trader  When you couple technical analysis to the powerful concept of mass psychology  it becomes easy to understand what the masses will and will not do  One can then use the Technical indicators to fine tune one s entry point 
Bonds
Overall  the bond market is far more overvalued than the stock market  and we believe that for now  it would be best to sit on the sidelines regarding bonds  Ideally  they will test the 149 150 ranges  with a possible overshoot to the 147 ranges  at that point one could take a closer look at them  The reason for this view is simple  Stocks are far from being overvalued  and the sentiment is not trading in the euphoric ranges  Therefore  every strong pullback has to be viewed as a buying opportunity  We expect the Dow to experience another pullback  the final strong pullback for the year  It is expected to test the 15800 16000 ranges  with a possible overshoot to the 15500 ranges  If this comes to pass  we will view it as a splendid buying opportunity as the Dow should end the year in the black  Next year  the Dow index is expected to trade to new highs  this was covered in a recent article titled  the Dow is getting ready to soar  A good way to play treasuries is via N TLT  but wait for the bond market to pullback to the stated ranges before taking a position  If you are looking for a way to go long Treasuries  TLT is a good option  Stocks such as N BABA  O GOOG  O CHKP  N CHL  etc   make for good plays and investors can consider opening positions in them after the market has let out some steam ",2015-10-28,Sol Palha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-and-bonds-will-not-crash-soon-269567,269567
124245,345760,CHKP,Cyber Security ETFs In Focus On Mixed Bag Q1 ,opinion,"The hype surrounding the cyber security industry has cooled down this year given a choppy stock market  reduced cyberattacks and lower spending on cybercrime  In fact  many stocks were crushed by concerns over high valuation  In addition  mixed earnings reports from the industry players have taken away the sheen that was left in this corner of the broad technology sector    
Let s dig into the earnings results of some of the cyber security firms that have the largest allocation to the ETFs in this industry Cyber Security Earnings in FocusCyberArk Software    NASDAQ CYBR    reported earnings per share of 15 cents and revenues of  46 9 million  outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents and  44 million  respectively  The company projects earnings per share in the range of 18 20 cents on revenues of  47 5  48 5 million  up 31 33  year over year  for the ongoing second quarter  For 2016  revenues are expected to grow 30  31  to  209  211 million and earnings per share are projected in the band of 87 91 cents 
The lower end of both the earnings projections was well above the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents and 62 cents  respectively  while the mid point of the revenue guidance was in line with our estimates  CYBR gained 2 5  following the earnings announcement on May 5 after the closing bell  read    
FireEye    NASDAQ FEYE    beat our earnings estimate but missed on revenues  Net loss per share came in at 83 cents  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents loss but revenues of  168 million fell shy of our estimated  172 million  FireEye expects revenues of  178  185 million for the second quarter and cut its full year outlook to  780  810 million from  815  845 million  The upper end of both the ranges is much below our estimate of  194 million for the quarter and  830 million for the year at the time of earnings release

For 2016  the company raised its revenue guidance from  1 25  1 26 billion to  1 262  1 272 billion  which represents year over year growth of 26  and was pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 253 billion  Earnings per share are now expected in the range of 69 71 cents compared to the previous guidance of 67 69 cents  This was much above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents at the time of earnings release  The stock has risen nearly 6  following the Q1 earnings announcement on April 26 after the closing bell

ETFs in Focus

The mixed earnings reports have put this niche area of the technology sector in focus for the days ahead  Currently  there are a couple of cyber security ETFs on investors  radar 
PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF   

The fund offers global exposure to those companies that ensure safety to computer hardware  software and networks  and fight against any sort of cyber malpractice  It tracks the ISE Cyber Security Index  holding 35 securities in its basket  It is well spread out across components with FTNT  CYBR and CHKP accounting for over 4  share each while CHKP and JNPR make up for at least 3  of assets  From an industrial look  software and programming accounts for nearly 66  of the portfolio while communication equipment and IT consulting   data services round off the top three 

In terms of country exposure  U S  firms take the top spot at 71   followed by Israel  11    the Netherlands  5    Japan  4    United Kingdom  4    South Korea  3    and Finland  1    The fund has amassed  678 7 million in AUM and charges 75 bps in fees per year from investors  Volume is solid as it exchanges 325 000 shares in hand per day  HACK has lost 11 3  in the year to date timeframe

This ETF has accumulated nearly  106 million in its asset base and charges 60 bps in annual fees  It trades in moderate average daily volume of around 44 000 shares  The fund follows the Nasdaq CTA Cybersecurity Index  which measures the performance of companies engaged in the cyber security segment of the technology and industrials sectors  In total  the product holds 34 stocks in its basket with the in focus five firms accounting for 16 9  allocation 

Further  it is skewed toward the software industry at 44 7  while communications equipment rounds off the next spot with a double digit allocation  Like HACK  American firms account for 69  of CIBR while the Netherlands  Israel  South Korea and many others make up for a single digit allocation  The ETF has shed 7 3  in the same period  read    ",2016-05-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cyber-security-etfs-in-focus-on-mixed-bag-q1-200129340,200129340

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 43 cents per share on  343 66 million in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  5 million on the top
In the past four quarters Palo Alto Networks has reported EPS growth of 100  on 50  revenue growth
The increasingly complex cyber security space  weak IT spending environment and stiff competition poses a significant risk moving forward
The cyber security space has been one of the fastest growing industries as an increasing amount of information becomes stored in the cloud  Many companies have benefited from these trends including Palo Alto Networks Inc  NYSE PANW   Fortinet Inc  NASDAQ FTNT   Check Point Software Technologies Ltd  NASDAQ CHKP  and Fireeye Inc  NASDAQ FEYE   However there is growing concern whether these companies can sustain high earnings and revenue growth  So far we ve seen FireEye validate this trend of muted growth with its first quarter results that featured a 2  gain on the bottom line  Tomorrow we get to see if Palo Alto Networks will follow the pack or pave its own path when it reports fiscal third quarter earnings
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings of 43 cents per share on  343 66 million in revenue 1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and  5 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents an 88  increase in earnings with sales pegged to grow 47   Despite the impressive numbers  results have decelerated in the past year  If everything plays out as expected this would be the first quarter in a year with EPS growth and sales growth below 100  and 50   respectively 

Palo Alto has solidified its status as an industry leading cyber security company  Consistent growth demonstrates the company s increasing strength from its hybrid SaaS model and strategic partnerships  Last quarter featured a key partnership with Proofpoint while also extending the footprint of its cloud ecosystem  Increasing customer adoption coupled with frequent product updates will help boost revenue moving forward
A significant source of concern in the software security space has arisen by virtue of the tight spending environment and competition from tech giants like Cisco  An increasingly competitive landscape could necessitate PANW to raise its spending on sales and marketing thereby limiting its current margin leverage

124260,345775,CHKP,Why Is Palo Alto Networks  PANW  Stock Losing Momentum ,opinion,"Shares of Palo Alto Networks Inc    NYSE PANW   have been losing momentum of late  One of the major reasons behind this could be the company s wider than expected loss during the third quarter of fiscal 2016  along with a discouraging earnings guidance for the fourth quarter Notably  the stock has tanked approximately 10  since the announcement of its third quarter results on May 25  Also  year to date  the stock has lost over 25  Although Palo Alto Networks  revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and recorded a year over year improvement  its bottom line results were quite dismal The company s adjusted loss  excluding amortization and other one time items but including stock based compensation  for the quarter was wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year ago quarter loss  Loss widened mainly due to higher operating expenses  which more than offset the benefits of robust top line growth Weighed down by the dismal bottom line performance as well as enterprise spending concerns  the company gave a weak guidance for the fourth quarter PALO ALTO NETWK Price

124272,345787,CHKP,Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds   Mid Cap Blend,opinion,The mid cap blend style ranks eighth out of the twelve fund styles as detailed in my style roadmap  It gets my Dangerous rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of 19 ETFs and 279 mutual funds in the mid cap blend style as of July 19  2012  Figures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the style  Not all mid cap blend style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 24 to 3093   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the mid cap blend style  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors should not buy any mid cap blend ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this style  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long history of not paying off  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best   Worst Ratings   Top 5   Best ETFs exclude ETFs with less NAV s less than 100 million  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Four ETFs are excluded from

blend ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  there are not any mid cap blend ETFs or mutual funds that get an Attractive or better rating  The takeaways are  mid cap blend mutual fund managers pick poor stocks and mid cap blend ETFs hold poor stocks  Figure 3  Mid cap Blend Style Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds   Stocks    Ratings distribution of stocks applies only to stocks within our coverage universe  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management  Investors need to tread carefully when considering mid cap blend ETFs and mutual funds  because all mid cap blend ETFs are rated either Neutral or Dangerous and 69  of mid cap blend mutual funds are rated Dangerous or worse  If investors want exposure to the mid cap blend style  they should focus on owning a basket of Attractive or better rated individual stocks  and avoid these Neutral or worse rated ETFs and mutual funds  Check Point Software Technologies  CHKP  is one of my favorite stocks held by mid cap blend ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Attractive rating  Check Point is one of the leading stars in the network security industry and their steady accumulation of market share has been accompanied by double digit revenue growth every year since 2007 and widening pre tax operating margins  NOPBT margin up to over 50  in 2011   There can be no doubt that the operations of the business are profitable and growing  The truest measure of a company s profitability is its returns on invested capital  ROIC   and this is where CHKP really shines  Checkpoint has nearly doubled its ROIC since 2009  from 44 7  to 89 1   Consider what those impressive numbers mean  every dollar invested in CHKP s business generated  0 89 of after tax operating profits  NOPAT  in 2011  That s a staggering level of capital efficiency and operating profitability  This is a great company  and right now  it s a great stock because the market s current price    50 00  implies that CHKP s profitability growth will screech to a halt and profits will permanently decline by 7   Unduly low expectations for future cash flows make CHKP a Very Attractive stock  Accelrys Inc   ACCL  is one of my least favorite stocks held by mid cap blend ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Dangerous rating  ACCL has consistently eroded shareholder value by earning an ROIC less than its weighted average cost of capital  WACC   Furthermore  ACCL went on an acquisition spree over 2010 2011  more than doubling the amount of capital invested in the business   58 million in 2009 to  200 million in 2011   That s more than  140 million dollars on which ACCL must earn a return higher than its cost of capital  Inorganic growth can signal that the market s high expectations for growth are starting to catch up with the company  In order to meet the expectations implied by the current market price  ACCL would need to grow its profits by 23  compounded annually for the next 15 years  High expectations for future profits compared to poor past profits make this company s stock extremely risky  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all mid cap blend ETFs and mutual funds  Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst Funds Sources
