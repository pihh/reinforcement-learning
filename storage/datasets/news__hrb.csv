144719,366234,HRB,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  H R Block  Berry Global Group  Emergent BioSolutions  Pilgrim s Pride And Alexion Pharmaceuticals,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 9  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  H R Block Inc    NYSE HRB    Berry Global Group Inc    NYSE BERY    Emergent BioSolutions Inc    NYSE EBS    Pilgrim s Pride Corp    NASDAQ PPC   and Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ALXN   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Value Picks to Counter Recent Stock Market SoftnessAfter an exponential rise in 2019  Wall Street has entered into a correction mode early this year  following the U S  airstrikes in Iran that killed its military general Qasem Soleimani  After this development  the three major stock indexes   the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite   declined 1   0 6  and 0 3   respectively  in the last three trading days However  the stable economic fundamentals of the United States have raised the possibility of the recent stock market volatility being a transitory phase and markets continuing their long term uptrend once the interim trade deal between the United States and China is signed mid January While markets are likely to remain range bound until the signing of the phase one trade deal  the downside potential will be limited owing to U S  economic strength  Nonetheless  volatile trading may become a regular phenomenon in Wall Street  At this stage  it makes good sense to buy those stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes Geopolitical Conflict in Middle East IntensifiesOn Jan 7  Pentagon confirmed that Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U S  military and coalition forces at Al Assad and Irbil military bases in Iraq  The airstrike was in retaliation to the U S  killing of Iran s immensely popular top ranked general  Qasem Soleimani  on Jan 2  Moreover  on Jan 5  Iran announced that it would no longer respect the 2015 nuclear deal on the number of uranium enrichment centrifuges After the attack  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted  we do not seek escalation or war  but will defend ourselves against any aggression   Meanwhile  President Donald Trump tweeted that  All is well  Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq  Earlier  Trump had tweeted that the U S  government has targeted 52 sites very important to Iran and Iranian culture  if that country retaliates and strikes any  Americans  or American assets   Investors remained busy judging how the U S  Iran conflict will affect stock markets Volatility resurfaced in Wall Street in the last three trading days as market participants shifted to safe haven assets such as U S  government bonds  precious metals like gold and currency like Japanese yen  Meanwhile  crude oil prices have skyrocketed in apprehension of a potential oil supply disruption  Higher oil prices will hinder the economic revival process of several important emerging markets Interim Trade Deal and Solid Economic Data  Major DriversChinese officials are set to arrive in Washington on Jan 13 in order to sign an interim trade pact known as the phase one trade deal  Last week  Donald Trump said that he will sign the preliminary trade deal on Jan 15  The deal is expected to at least prevent further escalation of tariff war between the two largest trading countries of the world The Institute for Supply Management reported that the U S  services  non manufacturing  index jumped to a four month high of 55  in December from 53 9  in November  The figure was higher than the consensus estimate of 54 2   Notably  the services sector constitutes 70  of the GDP  Any reading above 50 indicates expansion of service activities and a reading of 55 or more reflects exceptional performance The Department of Commerce reported that the U S  trade deficit declined sharply by 8 2  to  43 1 billion in November  marking the smallest deficit since October 2016  Exports grew 0 7  to  208 6 billion in November while imports dropped 1  to  251 7 billion Our Top PicksAt this stage  investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability  Thus  it would be prudent to pick up value stocks with a

144721,366236,HRB,3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks  A Smarter Way To Boost Your Retirement Income   February 04  2020,opinion,"Strange but true  seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement 
And older Americans have legitimate reasons for this worry  even if they have dutifully saved for their golden years  That s because the traditional ways people manage retirement may no longer provide enough income to meet expenses   and with people generally living longer  the principal retirement savings is exhausted far too early in the retirement period 
Retirement investing approaches of the past don t work today 
In the past  investors going into retirement could invest in bonds and count on attractive yields to produce steady  reliable income streams to fund a predictable retirement  10 year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s hovered around 6 50   whereas at the time of this article  the current rate is under 2  and looks to stay low thanks to an accommodative Fed 
While this yield reduction may not seem drastic  it adds up  for a  1 million investment in 10 year Treasuries  the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
So what s a retiree to do  You could cut your expenses to the bone  and take the risk that your Social Security checks don t shrink  Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady  higher rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
As a replacement for low yielding Treasury bonds  and other bond options   we believe dividend paying stocks from high quality companies offer low risk and stable  predictable income investors in retirement seek 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
Going beyond those familiar names  you can find excellent dividend paying stocks by following a few guidelines  Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3   with positive annual dividend growth  The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
CF Industries  CF  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 3 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 02   This compares to the Fertilizers industry s yield of 1 28  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 82   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 2 is flat compared to last year 
Eaton  NYSE ETN  Vance  EV  is paying out a dividend of 0 38 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 18  compared to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 28  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 5 is up 7 14  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 0 26 per share  H R Block  NYSE HRB  has a dividend yield of 4 62   This is compared to the Consumer Services   Miscellaneous industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 04 is up 4  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
It is true that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  but high quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly  can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market 
An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio  they can help lessen the effects of inflation  since many dividend paying companies  especially blue chip stocks  generally increase their dividends over time 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
You may be thinking   I like this dividend strategy  but instead of investing in individual stocks  I m going to find a dividend focused mutual fund or ETF   This approach can make sense  but be aware that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs carry high fees  which may reduce your dividend gains or income  and defeat the goal of this dividend investment approach  If you do wish to invest in a fund  do your research to find the best quality dividend funds with the lowest fees 
Bottom Line
Regardless of whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  looking for a steady stream of income from dividend paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement

interest rates four times in 2018 to normalize the monetary policy but that inverted the yield curve triggering fears of a recession  But an inverted yield curve is not necessarily an indicator of recession  rather a warning that interest rates are too high and could slow down growth if not fixed For a correction  the Fed lowered interest rates thrice in 2019 and also injected huge amount of cash into the financial system  That boosted the economy and made stocks even more attractive And the small 35 daygovernment had modest impact on the economy 2020  Things to Get BetterThere is an air

144744,366259,HRB,5 Top Value Picks To Counter Recent Stock Market Softness,opinion,After an exponential rise in 2019  Wall Street has entered into a correction mode early this year  following the U S  airstrikes in Iran that killed its military general Qasem Soleimani  After this development  the three major stock indexes   the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite   declined 1   0 6  and 0 3   respectively  in the last three trading days However  the stable economic fundamentals of the United States have raised the possibility of the recent stock market volatility being a transitory phase and markets continuing their long term uptrend once the interim trade deal between the United States and China is signed mid January While markets are likely to remain range bound until the signing of the phase one trade deal  the downside potential will be limited owing to U S  economic strength  Nonetheless  volatile trading may become a regular phenomenon in Wall Street  At this stage  it makes good sense to buy those stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes Geopolitical Conflict in Middle East IntensifiesOn Jan 7  Pentagon confirmed that Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U S  military and coalition forces at Al Assad and Irbil military bases in Iraq  The airstrike was in retaliation to the U S  killing of Iran s immensely popular top ranked general  Qasem Soleimani  on Jan 2  Moreover  on Jan 5  Iran announced that it would no longer respect the 2015 nuclear deal on the number of uranium enrichment centrifuges After the attack  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted  we do not seek escalation or war  but will defend ourselves against any aggression   Meanwhile  President Donald Trump tweeted that  All is well  Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq  Earlier  Trump had tweeted that the U S  government has targeted 52 sites very important to Iran and Iranian culture  if that country retaliates and strikes any  Americans  or American assets   Investors remained busy judging how the U S  Iran conflict will affect stock markets Volatility resurfaced in Wall Street in the last three trading days as market participants shifted to safe haven assets such as U S  government bonds  precious metals like gold and currency like Japanese yen  Meanwhile  crude oil prices have skyrocketed in apprehension of a potential oil supply disruption  Higher oil prices will hinder the economic revival process of several important emerging markets Interim Trade Deal and Solid Economic Data  Major DriversChinese officials are set to arrive in Washington on Jan 13 in order to sign an interim trade pact known as the phase one trade deal  Last week  Donald Trump said that he will sign the preliminary trade deal on Jan 15  The deal is expected to at least prevent further escalation of tariff war between the two largest trading countries of the world The Institute for Supply Management reported that the U S  services  non manufacturing  index jumped to a four month high of 55  in December from 53 9  in November  The figure was higher than the consensus estimate of 54 2   Notably  the services sector constitutes 70  of the GDP  Any reading above 50 indicates expansion of service activities and a reading of 55 or more reflects exceptional performance The Department of Commerce reported that the U S  trade deficit declined sharply by 8 2  to  43 1 billion in November  marking the smallest deficit since October 2016  Exports grew 0 7  to  208 6 billion in November while imports dropped 1  to  251 7 billion Our Top PicksAt this stage  investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable

144759,366274,HRB,H R Block s heavy investments to weigh on future profits  shares sink,news," Reuters    Shares of H R Block Inc  N HRB  fell as much as 21 percent on Wednesday  after the tax preparer said it expected profit margins to shrink as it invests heavily in technology to lure clients who do their own taxes 
H R  which helps corporations and individuals prepare their tax filings  might also see fewer clients using its services because the recent tax overhaul has made it simpler for people to file their taxes 
The company is investing heavily in technology  changing pricing plans and will consolidate 400 offices to cut costs 
Analysts believed it would take several years for those initiatives to take hold 
 H R s spend could be multi year and visibility into payback metrics on the initiatives appears low currently   said Hamzah Mazari  an analyst with Macquarie in a note entitled  The good  the bad and the outlook  
On a post earnings conference call on Tuesday  the company said it expects full year 2019 EBITDA margin to be between 24 percent and 26 percent  down from 29 8 percent in 2018 
The company also sees revenue of between  3 05 billion and  3 1 billion in 2019  down from  3 16 billion it earned in 2018 
The outlook overshadowed the company s better than expected fourth quarter profit  typically the busiest period for tax preparers due to the U S  tax filing deadline 
 Given a volatile track record of results and lack of visibility into if management s initiatives will pay off  our expectations come down    Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  s Thomas Allen said in a note 

Shares of the company were down 19 percent at  23 93 in morning trading ",2018-06-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hr-blocks-heavy-investments-to-weigh-on-future-profits-shares-sink-1491516,1491516

144766,366281,HRB,Top Stock Reports For Toyota  CVS Health   3M,opinion,"Tuesday  December 10  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Toyota Motor  TM   CVS Health  NYSE CVS   CVS  and 3M  MMM   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Toyota s shares have outperformed the Zacks Foreign Automotive industry year to date  22 2  vs  12 1    The Zacks analyst believes that expanding portfolio of product lines is driving the firm s sales 
In order to capitalize on the accelerated global shift to electric cars  the auto giant of Japan is deepening focus on developing electric and autonomous vehicles  which will bolster the company s product competitiveness  Its healthy balance sheet  improving cash flows and investor friendly moves are other positives  However  anticipating a slowdown in India  Indonesia and Thailand  the company narrowed its annual vehicle sales target for fiscal 2020 
High research and development expenses on advanced technologies for the development of EVs and driverless cars are likely to dent near term margins  As such  investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point 
 You can  
Shares of CVS Health have gained 17 2  in the past three months against the Zacks Retail Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry s rise of 10 6   The Zacks analyst is pleased with the company s solid progress in terms of the 2020 selling season  It has started to witness increased customer traffic and incremental sales in pharmacy front store and MinuteClinics 
It successfully executed its strategic priorities  resulting in all three of the company s segments performing in line with  or above its expectations  The Health Care Benefits segment  launched after the Aetna  NYSE AET  acquisition  is showing strong momentum 
The company posted better than expected third quarter results on the back of robust progresses  However  persistent reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions dented the company s retail LTC business growth  Also  Omnicare business performance should continue to remain soft through the rest of 2019 
 You can  
3M s shares have gained 0 5  over the past six months against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry s rise of 6 5   The Zacks analyst believes that 3M stands to gain from the efforts to innovate products  restructuring actions and shareholder friendly policies over the long run 
Its acquisition of the technology business of M Modal is benefiting the health information systems business  while the Acelity buyout will likely strengthen the medical solutions business  In third quarter 2019  the company s earnings surpassed estimates by 4 5   while sales lagged the same by 1 3  
For 2019  3M lowered its adjusted earnings per share guidance to  8 99  9 09 from  9 25  9 75 mentioned earlier  Organic sales will likely decline 1 1 5  versus previously mentioned 1  decline to 2  growth  Forex woes will likely adversely impact sales by 2   while rising costs and restructuring charges might be concerning

144767,366282,HRB,Go Ahead  Be Boring  Buy 3 Mid Caps,opinion,"I undertake a Zacks Chief Investment Officer  CIO  survey 4 times a year  The most recent survey I completed in late November 
Want one of the most interesting tidbits  with salient investor insight into 2020 
 This CIO group thinks large cap stocks  above  5B in market capitalization  likely add something between 0  and 5  to your returnsAt the other end of the market cap spectrum  small cap stocks  those below  1B in market cap  likely deliver 0  to 5  returnsHowever  CIOs collectively felt there is one niche to mine for outperforming 5  to 10  returns next yearThis is a market blind spot  the market cap gap between the two    the so called mid cap stocks  These are firms valued at between  1 and  5B in market capitalization 
In general  you know the quality tickers and company names of large cap stocks  There is a comfort there  Small caps stock groups  like Computer Software  have sexier start up names and new business concepts  So  there is always investor interest in looking into small caps  They are the Home Run stocks  Or the biggest blowups 
In between are these boring companies  Each firm s activities are tied to stock tickers generally overlooked by the crowd  But they can be very profitable 
In the Zacks Industry Ranks in December 2019  I found one classic example  It is the Miscellaneous Consumer Services industry  I counted 9 companies in it 
Earnings estimates here are on a tear  This overlooked stock niche has a Zacks Industry Rank of  19 out of 253  Top 10    Over the last 8 weeks of time  this ranking has never been lower than  49  Top 20   
Yes  Miscellaneous Consumer Services is a convoluted title  Yes  The group is NOT populated with sexy tickers  Yes  The business models are a grab bag of sensible but boring activities 
However  investors can make excellent money on these types of stocks next year  according to both CIOs and our Zacks Rank system  I will just leave it at that 
The top three names 
 1  Cimpress N V   CMPR   This 1st pick is a  3 3B market cap stock with a  118 dollar price tag 
It is a Zacks  2 Rank  BUY   There is a Zacks Value score of C and a Zacks Growth score of A and a Zacks Momentum score of A 
Cimpress N V  is an online supplier of high quality graphic design services and customized printed products to small businesses and consumers 
Its product offerings include business cards  brochures and websites to invitations  thank you notes  calendars  address labels  note pads and signage  among others 
With the use of proprietary web based design software and advanced computer integrated printing facilities  the company has a competitive advantage over traditional graphic design and printing methods 
It has production facilities in the United States  Austria  China  Brazil  Australia  Canada  India  France  Japan  Italy  the U K   Ireland  Mexico and the Netherlands 
Cimpress was originally known as Vistaprint N V  In second quarter fiscal 2015  ended December 2015   Vistaprint changed its corporate name to Cimpress N V  and ticker symbol to CMPR  
The change in the corporate name was a conscious effort to distinguish the corporate entity and its technology and operational mass customization platform with the growing portfolio of customer centric brands like Vistaprint  Drukwerkdeal  Albelli and Pixartprinting 
 2  H R Block  HRB   This 2nd pick has a market cap of  4 6B and a share price of  23 
It is a Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  stock  The Zacks Value score is A  with a forward P E of 9 6  and a Zacks Growth score of D  and a Zacks Momentum score of A 
H R Block Inc  NYSE HRB   is a leading provider of tax preparation services  The company provides assisted income tax return preparation  do it yourself  DIY  tax solutions and other products and services associated with income tax return preparation in the United States  Canada and Australia 
Assisted income tax return preparation services are provided through a system of retail offices operated directly by the company or by franchisees  DIY tax services include preparation of federal and state income tax returns  advice and tax related news  access to tax tips  use of calculators for tax planning  and error checking and electronic filing

Additional offerings from the company include Refund Transfers  H R Block Emerald Advance lines of credit  Peace of Mind Extended Service Plan  Tax Identity Shield  H R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard  and refund advance loans  POM  an Instant Cash Back refund option  and H R Block Pay with Refund option 
H R Block was organized as a corporation in 1955 under the laws of the State of Missouri and is headquartered in Kansas City  MO  The company has around 11 600 company owned and franchise offices worldwide 
As most of the clients file their tax returns from January through April of each year  most of H R Block s revenues from income tax return preparation and related services and products are received during this period  As a result  the Tax Services segment generally operates at a loss through the first nine months of a fiscal year 
 3  SP Plus  SP   This 3rd and final pick has a market cap of  1 1B with a share price of  44 
It is a Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  stock  The Zacks Value score is B  with a forward P E of 15 7  and a Zacks Growth score of A  and a Zacks Momentum score of D 
SP Plus provides professional parking  ground transportation  facility maintenance  security and event logistics services to property owners and managers in all markets of the real estate industry

SP Plus  formerly known as Standard Parking Corporation  is based in United States 
Like I said  the three business models are NOT exciting  They make business cards  do income tax prep  and offer you a parking slot in a downtown garage 
Yet mid cap stocks may well be the top niche to make returns next year  
If you think boring is boring  look at a  and get over it

144770,366285,HRB,2019 Was A Tough Year But These 5 Stocks May Rebound In 2020,opinion,It is turning out to be an epic year for U S  stocks  The equity market s relentless rally has catapulted key indexes to new heights  which are headed for their best year since 2013 The S P 500 stock index   the broadest measure of the equity market   has added as much as 28 6  to its value so far this year  as of Dec 20  2019   Other major market indexes also are on course to deliver solid gains  The tech heavy Nasdaq composite and the 30 company Dow Jones industrial average have increased a respective 34 5  and 22  year to date  In fact  the S P 500  Dow and Nasdaq notched record closing highs on Friday What s Driving the Rises   The S P 500  for its part  witnessed broad based gains  with all 11 sectors rising  led by technology  which is up nearly 47  Let s see what went right for the markets in 2019  It s fairly simple  investors have driven up equities on evidence of economic growth  Another big catalyst was the preliminary U S  China trade deal Investors cheered the Federal Reserve s decision to cut rates thrice this year   in July  September and October   coupled with the central bank s assertions of a robust labor market and strong economic activity  Soaring job growth and a 50 year low unemployment rate have added to the optimism  Moreover  factory production is rebounding  domestic homebuilding market is taking off  while the increase in consumer spending suggests solid momentum for the overall economy  Finally  a sharp fall in the U S  trade deficit should contribute to the fourth quarter GDP The recent agreement on a phase one trade deal between the two biggest economies further boosted the market sentiment  The development   coming after almost two years of wrangling   is seen to prop up the demand outlook and revive global economic growth  What Will 2020 Hold for the Markets While 2019 was an exceptional year  going ahead  the odds of an extended run in stocks next year also appear to be good The bull market turned 10 this year in March and Wall Street pundits expect the rally to continue in 2020  on the back of an accommodative monetary policy adopted by the Federal Reserve as well as strong fundamentals of the U S  economy Meanwhile  the OPEC  group announced cutting output by as much as 500 000 barrels per day from Jan 1 for three months to end a supply glut and prop up prices  This is in addition to the existing production curbs of 1 2 million barrels per day by OPEC  Russia and other non member oil producers  The cartel s renewed supply cuts lifted energy and commodity companies and helped give the markets another lift Certain Underperformers to Bounce Back Next YearWhile the markets this year reached new highs  several stocks underperformed  There are chances that some of these stocks might rebound in 2020 given the favorable factors and their fundamental strength However  it s not easy to pick these

144784,366299,HRB,Column  New tax laws may kill the beach house dream,news,"By Gail MarksJarvis CHICAGO  Reuters    Dreaming of a beach house  You might want to think twice about that  given tax changes that just kicked in will make owning a vacation home more costly and may tank the resale value of the second home market   Prices could drop about 10 percent in some markets  said Zillow    economist Aaron Terrazas  with pricey coastal areas the most vulnerable  This will not be good news for owners in popular areas who have already been waiting a decade for prices to recover the value lost during the housing crash and recession   After the 2006 housing peak  prices dropped more than 50 percent in many popular vacation areas  and remain far off those highs  Zillow data indicates homes in Fort Myers  Florida remain 24 percent below the pre crash peak  and Ocean City  New Jersey is still down 19 percent despite the draw of beach communities  Overall  purchases have been declining for three years   Researchers from Gallup Inc to the Urban Institute have traced slower home buying to multiple factors   from difficulty getting mortgages to the uncertainty that an expensive investment would appreciate enough to make a purchase worthwhile  IMPACT OF TAX LAW The new tax rules will have a big impact because many second home buyers are middle income households  not the super rich  and even a shift of a few thousand dollars can greatly affect affordability  The median buyer s household income in 2016 was  89 900  and only 34 percent of buyers had household incomes over  100 000  according to the National Association of Realtors  NAR   Almost three quarters used mortgage financing   While second homeowners can still deduct the interest on new mortgages up to  750 000  experts predict that many people will no longer itemize their expenses on Schedule A  The new tax rules raise the standard deduction to  24 000 for a married couple  and this may be too high a threshold for many people to reach without being able to claim more than  10 000 in combined property and other state and local taxes   Also  homeowners can no longer deduct interest on home equity loans  That is likely to hold back vacation home buying because many people use home equity on their main residence to purchase additional homes  said Zillow s Terrazas  When homeowners think about the long term impact on their finances  the math becomes even trickier  People are looking at vacation homes as longer term commitments than in the past  with the average buyer planning to own the home nine years compared with five years in 2015  NAR reported   As baby boomers think about future retirement  some are buying vacation properties while still working and use them occasionally as a retreat  Eventually  18 percent plan to turn those second homes into homes for retirement  The only way to afford this in the future may be to become a landlord  If an individual turns their vacation home into a rental property and uses a business tax structure such as a limited liability company or C Corporation  they will be able to deduct mortgage interest and property taxes as a business expense  said Cliff Johnson  co founder of Vacasa     which manages vacation homes  Such an approach is not for everyone  however  and generally requires attention to tax details  For one thing  when you decide to sell the property as a business you may have to pay more in capital gains taxes if the home has appreciated in value  said Alison Flores  researcher for the H R Block  NYSE HRB  Tax Institute   Some individuals could get around this making the property qualify as a private residence again by moving back in prior to the sale   Owners can still use their vacation home for personal use and rent it out  if they keep records of the usage  Expenses can be deducted  but income is also taxable if you rent out a home for more than 14 days   Then there is the hassle factor  which can be hard to calculate  According to NAR research  15 percent of people who tried renting out their vacation homes decided they would not do it again

144791,366306,HRB,Earnings Preview  H R Block  HRB  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"H R Block  NYSE HRB  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tax preparer is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 6  
Revenues are expected to be  163 40 million  up 9 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 52  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for H R Block 
For H R Block  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that H R Block will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that H R Block would post a loss of  0 76 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 72  delivering a surprise of  5 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
H R Block doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-hr-block-hrb-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200488335,200488335

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 59   A quarter ago  it was expected that this tax preparer would post a loss of  0 76 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 72  delivering a surprise of 5 26

H R Block  which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Services   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  160 80 million for the quarter ended October 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 59   This compares to year ago revenues of  148 87 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
H R Block shares have lost about 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 23 4  
What s Next for H R Block 
While H R Block has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for H R Block was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

144795,366310,HRB,What Makes H R Block  HRB  A New Strong Buy Stock,opinion,"H R Block  NYSE HRB  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for H R Block is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for H R Block imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for H R Block
For the fiscal year ending April     2020  this tax preparer is expected to earn  2 12 per share  which is a change of  1 4  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for H R Block  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

144806,366321,HRB,Column  Pre tax retirement contributions at risk in tax reform,news,By Gail MarksJarvis NEW YORK  Reuters    If you like the income tax reduction you get for your 401 k  contribution then make sure to max out now  because you may not get the chance in the future  Tax reform proposals of past years from both political parties have targeted the break people get for 401 k s because it is a gigantic source of untaxed money   perhaps more than  580 billion over five years  according to a 2016 Joint Committee on Taxation estimate   The Tax Policy Center suggests that Congress needs to find  2 4 trillion over 10 years to avoid increasing the deficit with the current tax reform proposal  So the temptation to end the 401 k  tax break could be intense  Currently  401 k  contributions come from pre tax earnings  and the government waits until you take the money out in retirement to tax it and the returns it has earned   If Congress gets rid of this system  saving for retirement would be more like saving in a Roth IRA or Roth 401 k   With a Roth  you do not get any tax benefit when you contribute  but the money grows tax free in the accounts  These accounts are also not subject to required minimum distributions  which retirees must take from 401 k s beginning at age 70 1 2   Roth rules can be a great benefit because people can count on every cent after retirement without worrying about Uncle Sam taxing it  Retirees also are not forced to spend their nest egg  so they can pass it along to heirs with fewer restrictions if they have money left over   It is not clear  however  how the fine print would shake out  because there is no specific proposal on the table yet from Congress  Nevertheless  retirement saving advocates are bracing for a potential fight over preserving the 401 k  system s tax breaks as negotiations over tax reform progress  They know Congress will start looking for sources of billions of dollars so it can cut taxes without adding to the nation s budget deficits  notes Brigen Winters  an attorney with Groom Law Group and lobbyist for 401 k  advocates such as the Plan Sponsor Council of America   Jack VanDerhei  research director for the Employee Benefit Research Institute  is already studying the potential impact  so he is ready at any time   The big fear among experts like Winters and VanDerhei is that if people cannot contribute pre tax money to their 401 k   they will cut back on saving and the nation s looming retirement savings crisis will worsen  Americans already are saving so little that 52 percent of Americans are on track to struggle in retirement  according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College  The way it works now takes some sting out of saving  For every  1 000 a person in the 25 percent tax bracket socks away  they pay  250 less in taxes  notes the H R Block  NYSE HRB  Tax Institute  If that money cannot go in pre tax anymore  they would need to pay tax on all of their income and their take home pay would diminish   People do not like to see their take home pay slip at all  says Aron Szapiro  director of Morningstar Public Policy Research  He calculated that a 30 year old earning  50 000 and now saving 10 percent of pay  would cut savings to 7 5 percent to maintain the same level of take home income while working  By retirement  the reduced savings level would lower total contributions to the nest egg to  230 400 from  307 200   And that person would have only about  28 400 for living expenses compared with  30 800  Szapiro found   Szapiro notes that young workers could ultimately benefit from the Roth treatment if their pay takes a big jump during their careers and they end up with a lot more income when they are retired than when they were young   But he thinks most people miss an important point  The tax breaks people receive on 401 k  savings in the current system give them the financial leeway to save more early in life   If you take that away  people are going to say  why should I bother to contribute    says Szapiro   It will be hard to get people to act  and that would be very bad for people in retirement  ,2017-10-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/column-pretax-retirement-contributions-at-risk-in-tax-reform-537012,537012

144815,366330,HRB,Analysts Estimate H R Block  HRB  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when H R Block  NYSE HRB  reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 28  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tax preparer is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 6  
Revenues are expected to be  152 20 million  up 4 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for H R Block 
For H R Block  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that H R Block will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that H R Block would post earnings of  4 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 32  delivering a surprise of  5 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

144839,366354,HRB,U S  stocks lower ahead of Fed  oil sinks 3  on inventories,news,"Investing com   Wall Street traded lower on Wednesday after dismal economic data that was thought to be unable to stay the hand of the Federal Reserve  Fed  in its policy announcement later in the session and oil sank on a smaller than expected decline in U S  stockpiles 
At 10 59AM ET  14 59GMT   the Dow Jones slipped 15 points  or 0 07   the S P 500 fell 4 points  or 0 16   while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3 points  or 0 05  
The consumer price index  CPI  showed that inflation continued to ease in May  with the annualized reading dropping to 1 9   while the core CPI fell even further to 1 7  
Retail sales also surprised with an unexpected decline in May  showing weakness in an economy where consumption represents about 70  of growth 
Though the weaker than expected data caused jitters among market players with the dollar and gold both reversing course  and the 10 year Treasury yield sinking around 8 basis points to 2 126   experts did not expect the readings to change the fact that the Fed was widely expected to hike rates by 25 basis points to a range of 1 00  to 1 25  in its announcement at 2 00PM ET  18 00GMT  
However  markets became even more skeptical that the Fed would be able to increase rates another time this year with odds in Fed fund futures slipping down to just 29   from an already meager 42  at the start of the day 
The data will increase the pressure on Fed chair Janet Yellen at her 2 30PM ET  18 30GMT  press conference to explain how the CPI reading fits into previous remarks that the decline in inflation was transitory 
All this on a day where markets were looking for Yellen to clarify whether the Fed expected its next tightening of policy to be either another rate hike or the start of reducing its  4 5 trillion balance sheet

144850,366365,HRB,Earnings Preview  H R Block  HRB  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when H R Block  NYSE HRB  reports results for the quarter ended April 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on June 11  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tax preparer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 32 billion  down 3 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for H R Block 
For H R Block  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that H R Block will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that H R Block would post a loss of  0 53 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 58  delivering a surprise of  9 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

144881,366396,HRB,H R Block  HRB  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"H R Block  NYSE HRB  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for H R Block basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For H R Block  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for H R Block
This tax preparer is expected to earn  1 95 per share for the fiscal year ending April 2019  which represents a year over year change of  34 6  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for H R Block  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

144922,366437,HRB,Earnings Preview  H R Block  HRB  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when H R Block  NYSE HRB  reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on December 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This tax preparer is expected to post quarterly loss of  0 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  29 6  
Revenues are expected to be  138 40 million  down 1 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for H R Block 
For H R Block  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that H R Block will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that H R Block would post a loss of  0 79 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 72  delivering a surprise of  8 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
H R Block doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-hr-block-hrb-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200363166,200363166

144981,366496,HRB,Should Value Investors Pick H R Block  HRB  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put H R Block  Inc    NYSE HRB   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  H R Block has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 0  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 0  If we focus on the long term PE trend  H R Block s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 31 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that H R Block has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for H R Block stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  H R Block has a P S ratio of about 1 9  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 6 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  HRB is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  H R Block currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes H R Block a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for H R Block is just 1 0  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 3  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 9 6  which is far better than the industry average of 13 9  Clearly  HRB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though H R Block might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of D  This gives HRB a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current fiscal year as well as the next year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower As a result  the current fiscal year consensus estimate has risen by 35 9  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has increased 16 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below H R Block  Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineH R Block is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  With a formidable industry rank  among the Top 27   and strong Zacks Rank  H R Block looks like a strong value contender  In fact  over the past one year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ,2018-02-20,Zacks

145006,366521,HRB,Plenty Of Small Cap Earnings Still To Come,opinion,"There aren t that many large cap earnings reports still to come  but plenty of small cap companies have yet to report Q2 results  At this stage  Q2 results are awaited from only 9 S P 500 index members  though the number of companies from the small cap S P 600 index yet to report results is 131 We have 67 companies on deck to report results this week  including 7 S P 500 members and 17 S P 600 members  Best Buy     Lululemon Athletica    and H R Block  NYSE HRB     are some of the notable companies reporting quarterly results this week The earnings focus lately has been on the Retail sector where only 3 companies in the S P 500 are still to report results  Total Q2 earnings for the Retail sector in the S P 500 index are up  0 3  from the same period last year on  4 6  higher revenues  with 75 7  beating EPS estimates and 81 1  beating revenue estimates Please note that we have a stand alone Retail sector  unlike the official Standard   Poor s placement of this space in the Consumer Discretionary sector  The Zacks Retail sector includes  besides the traditional department stores and other brick and mortar retailers  the online vendors like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Priceline and restaurant operators  Results from the online vendors and most of the restaurant operators typically come out in the first phase of each reporting cycle   The side by side charts below compare the sector s results thus far with what we have seen from the same group of 37 retailers in other recent periods 

The aggregate growth pace from the 37 retailers that have reported results already are tracking below what we had seen from the same companies in other recent periods  A big contributor to the weak earnings growth showing this quarter is the  77  drop in Amazon s earnings on  24 8  higher revenues  Excluding the Amazon drag  Q2 earnings for the sector would be up  3 9  on  3  higher revenues  This ex Amazon growth picture compares relatively favorably with historical periods  as the chart below shows 

Unlike growth  positive surprises are as numerous in this sector as they have been all along in other sectors this earnings season  In fact  the proportion of retailers beating revenue estimates is the third highest of all 16 Zacks sectors in Q2 at 81 1   behind only the Conglomerates  83 3   Technology  86 4   sectors Scorecard for the Small Cap RetailersThe Retail sector has a shade more earnings weight in the small cap S P 600 index than is the case with the large cap S P 500 index  The sector accounted for 9 2  of the small cap index s total earnings over the last four quarters  with its earnings contribution to the large cap index over the comparable period is 7 2  For the S P 600 index  we now have Q2 results from 35 of the 54 retailers in the index  Total earnings for these small cap retailers are down  13 5  from the same period last year on  1 8  higher revenues  with 60  beating EPS estimates and 51 4  beating revenue estimates  The comparison charts below put these small cap Q2 results in a historical context 

Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Friday  August 25  2017  The Q2 earnings season has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with results from 491 S P 500 members or 98 2  of the index s total membership already out  Total earnings for these companies are up  11 2  from the same period last year on  5 6  higher revenues  with 74 3  beating EPS estimates and 68 4  beating revenue estimates The table below shows the current Q2 Scorecard

The charts below compare the Q2 results thus far from the 491 index members with what we had seen from the same group of companies in other recent periods 

As pointed out earlier  the proportion of companies beating revenue estimates is tracking above historical periods  right hand chart   The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 491 companies is below what we had seen from the same sample of companies in Q1  but an improvement over other recent periods Here are the four takeaways from the Q2 earnings season First  the earnings and revenue growth pace has steadily gone up relative to pre season expectations  Total Q2 earnings for the index are currently expected to be up  11  from the same period last year on  5 5  higher revenues Please note that the  11  growth rate is the blended growth rate  it combines the actual growth for the 491 S P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the still to come 9 index members  At the start of the quarter  the expectation was for earnings growth of  7 9   which came down as the quarter unfolded  reaching as low as  5 6  just ahead of the start of the reporting season The deceleration in Q2 earnings growth notwithstanding  the quarter s earnings tally is on track to reach a new all time quarterly record  surpassing the 2016 Q4 level  as you can see in the chart below  The chart below contrasts the estimated 2017 Q2 total of  294 7 billion with the actual earnings for the preceding four quarters and estimates for the following four periods 

This record isn t expected to last very long  with each of the coming quarters expected to bring in ever bigger earnings tallies Second  an above average proportion of companies are beating estimates  particularly revenue estimates  We typically don t give this factor a lot of weight in evaluating or assessing an earnings season since we all know that management teams are experts in managing expectations  Even then  the trend emerging in the Q2 earnings season is noteworthy for two reasons  First  estimates for the quarter had not fallen by as much as had historically been the case  Second  the proportion of positive revenue surprises  a much harder variable to manipulate relative to earnings  is really off the chart Third  Q2 growth is broad based and not dependent on one or two sectors  There is strong growth contribution from the Finance  Technology and Energy sectors in Q2  but we have 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors on track to produce more earnings than the year earlier period Fourth  estimates for the September quarter have started coming down  but the pace and magnitude of negative revisions compares favorably to other comparable periods  Total Q3 earnings are currently expected to be up  3 9  from the same period last year  down from  6 3  at the start of July  The chart below shows the evolution of Q3 growth expectations since the start of the period 

This is a reassuring start on the revisions front  but we will have to see if this trend will remain in place through the rest of this earnings season The chart below shoes Q2 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters  As you can see in the chart below  this growth pace is expected to continue through the rest of the year

come  but plenty of small cap companies have yet to report Q2 results  At this stage  Q2 results are awaited from only 9 S P 500 index members  though the number of companies from the small cap S P 600 index yet to report results is 131 We have 67 companies on deck to report results this week  including 7 S P 500 members and 17 S P 600 members  Best Buy  NYSE       Lululemon Athletica  NASDAQ      and H R Block  NYSE      are some of the notable companies reporting quarterly results this week The earnings focus lately has been on the Retail sector where only 3 companies in the S P 500 are still to report results  Total Q2 earnings for the Retail sector in the S P 500 index are up  0 3  from the same period last year on  4 6  higher revenues  with 75 7  beating EPS estimates and 81 1  beating revenue estimates Please note that we have a stand alone Retail sector  unlike the official Standard   Poor s placement of this space in the Consumer Discretionary sector  The Zacks Retail sector includes  besides the traditional department stores and other brick and mortar retailers  the online vendors like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Priceline and restaurant operators  Results from the online vendors and most of the restaurant operators typically come out in the first phase of each reporting cycle   The aggregate growth pace from the 37 retailers that have reported results already are tracking below what we had seen from the same companies in other recent periods  A big contributor to the weak earnings growth showing this quarter is the  77  drop in Amazon s earnings on  24 8  higher revenues  Excluding the Amazon drag  Q2 earnings for the sector would be up  3 9  on  3  higher revenues  This ex Amazon growth picture compares relatively favorably with historical periods Unlike growth  positive surprises are as numerous in this sector as they have been all along in other sectors this earnings season  In fact  the proportion of retailers beating revenue estimates is the third highest of all 16 Zacks sectors in Q2 at 81 1   behind only the Conglomerates  83 3   Technology  86 4   sectors Scorecard for the Small Cap RetailersThe Retail sector has a shade more earnings weight in the small cap S P 600 index than is the case with the large cap S P 500 index  The sector accounted for 9 2  of the small cap index s total earnings over the last four quarters  with its earnings contribution to the large cap index over the comparable period is 7 2  For the S P 600 index  we now have Q2 results from 35 of the 54 retailers in the index  Total earnings for these small cap retailers are down  13 5  from the same period last year on  1 8  higher revenues  with 60  beating EPS estimates and 51 4  beating revenue estimates Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of Friday  August 25  2017  The Q2 earnings season has come to an end for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with results from 491 S P 500 members or 98 2  of the index s total membership already out  Total earnings for these companies are up  11 2  from the same period last year on  5 6  higher revenues  with 74 3  beating EPS estimates and 68 4  beating revenue estimates About Zacks Zacks com is a

HRB Numbers

5 Market Beating Dividend Stocks for Steady Growth 

	Though the stock market are at all time highs  geopolitics  Washington turmoil  and Fed s dovish views make dividend investing a perfect choice  These cash payouts are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk 

	In particular  stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pay high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation Why Dividend Growth Stocks 
	Dividend growth stocks offer the best of both worlds    potential for capital appreciation and rising income even in a volatile market  This is because these stocks belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  while simultaneously offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction 
	Dividend growth reflects a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  All these superior fundamentals make dividend growth stocks quality and promising investments for the long term  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that hike is likely in the future 
	Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock  it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields 
	As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero   This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry   A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight    This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks Rank  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy  generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment VGM  of B or better   This is simply a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum  This when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 offers the best upside potential 
	Here are five of the 28 stocks that fit the bill H R Block Inc    NYSE        This Missouri based H R Block is a diversified company involved in tax return preparation  electronic filing of income tax returns and other tax related services  The company has seen strong earnings estimate revision of 23 cents over the past 90 days for this fiscal year and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 8 95  in three of the past four quarters  It has a VGM Style Score of A and sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see   Lazard Ltd    NYSE        This Bermuda based company is a preeminent international financial advisory and asset management firm that has long specialized in crafting solutions to the complex financial and strategic challenges of their clients  The company has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents over the past 90 days for this year and has an expected earnings growth rate of 11 25   It has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of A Westlake Chemical Corporation   NYSE        This Texas based company is a vertically integrated international manufacturer and supplier of petrochemicals  polymers and fabricated products  It has seen solid earnings estimate revision of 32 cents for this year over the past three months  with an expected earnings growth rate of 16 28   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of B Aetna Inc    NYSE        This Connecticut based company is one of the nation s largest health benefits companies and nation s largest insurance and financial services organizations  The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revision of 16 cents over the past 90 days for this year with an expected earnings growth rate of 9 28   The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of A Republic Services Inc    NYSE        This Arizona based company is a leading provider of services in the domestic non hazardous solid waste industry  It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3 58  over the past four quarters and has seen solid earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents for this year over the past three months  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Style Score of B

145034,366549,HRB,Iconix  ICON  Acquires Remaining 50  Stake In Iconix Canada,opinion,The Iconix Brand Group  Inc    NASDAQ ICON   has recently bought back the remaining 50  interest in Iconix Canada from its joint venture partner for  19 million  As per the agreement  Iconix paid  12 million  while the remaining  7 million would be paid in the next two years   Iconix has been forming international joint ventures since 2008 and seeks to monetize its brands through these operations  which have significantly contributed to its revenues  Moreover  expanding international business is a vital aspect in Iconix s growth strategy  Iconix is quite underpenetrated in Canada  Therefore  acquiring the remaining stakes in Iconix Canada will enable the company to strengthen its business in the region  Iconix Canada was formed in 2013 and has licenses for brands such as London Fog  Rampage  Charisma and Zoo York amongst many others Similar to that of Canada  Iconix has previously acquired full interest of its business in other territories  In 2015 and 2014  the company acquired the remaining 50  stake in Iconix China and Latin America  respectively  It has also established a joint venture in Middle East and North America Iconix also announced that it would retain its existing 51  interest in the Buffalo brand  The company had previously considered selling its interest in the Buffalo brand  but refrained from the same as the brand has been performing well in Canada and the U S  Further  retaining the stake in the brand will facilitate gaining 100  control of Iconix Canada as well as solidify the company s position for organic growth Of late  the company has been divesting brands to focus on its core portfolio and spending resources on businesses that generate significant volume  This includes the divestiture of non core brands such as Sharper Image  Badgley Mischka  Peanuts Worldwide LLC and Strawberry Shortcake brand Though such divestitures are in line with the company s efforts to develop a strong and yielding portfolio  they are mainly carried out to reduce its debt burden  We have also noticed that Iconix has been witnessing sluggishness in the women s and men s segments in the last nine consecutive quarters  These headwinds are clearly reflected in the share price of the company  Shares of Iconix have plunged 36 1  in the past six months  underperforming the  s 7 7  gain Despite such challenges  we expect Iconix s strategic partnerships and consistent efforts for international expansion would improve its performance in the long run  Besides entering into joint ventures  Iconix also tries to achieve growth on the back of direct to retail partnerships and licensing agreements  Moreover  the long term agreements and brand exclusivity contracts are incentives to retailers who make efforts to promote Iconix  products  which in turn help to boost sales Iconix currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Interested in the Consumer Discretionary Space  Take a Look at these Some better ranked stocks in the same sector are Deckers Outdoor Corporation   NYSE DECK   and H R Block  Inc    NYSE HRB    each carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  while Time Warner Inc    NYSE TWX   holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Deckers has an average positive earnings surprise of 74 1  over the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 9 8  H R Block has an average positive earnings surprise of 9 1  over the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 11  Time Warner has an average positive earnings surprise of 16 5  over the trailing four quarters and has a long term earnings growth rate of 9 5  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-07-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/iconix-(icon)-acquires-remaining-50-stake-in-iconix-canada-200202619,200202619

145053,366568,HRB,Consumers Remain Confident  Buy These 5 Top Rated Picks,opinion,The Consumer Confidence index rose in June  defying expectations of a decline  This comes as a welcome surprise for market watchers  who have received dismal tidings about the economy one after another  over the past few weeks  The most recent example of these reports is the one on durable orders released on Monday that triggered a flight to safer assets But consumer confidence data indicates that though consumers have adopted a cautious outlook  they remain optimistic about the economy s fortunes  The Fed s most recent pronouncements on these issues have also been positive  with both the Fed Chair and a key official weighing in on the necessity of rate hikes  This is why investing in stocks gaining from consumers  optimism looks like a smart option at this time Consumer Confidence Bucks the TrendDefying the spate of disappointing reports on the economy  the Consumer Confidence index rebounded to increase from 117 6 in May to 118 9 in June  The Present Situation Index also rose from 140 6 to 146 3  However  the Expectations Index slipped from the level of 102 3 recorded in May to 100 6  Meanwhile  consumers  estimation of prevailing business conditions has also improved this month The Conference Board s Director of Economic Indicators said that consumers  outlook about the economy touched a near 16 year high in June  Additionally  even though consumers believe that the pace of growth may remain slow  they expect economic expansion to continue unhindered  Their plans to buy such capital goods as homes and automobiles remain unchanged  Meanwhile  plans to buy purchase major appliances have actually increased Strong Labor Market Powering GainsA strong labor market is widely believed to be the primary reason for consumers  continuing optimism  One of the most closely watched components of the consumer confidence report is a metric known as the labor market differential  This measure is derived using data from respondents who believe jobs are in abundance and those who think they are tough to secure  In May  the survey s labor market differential registered the second best reading in 16 years   Read   This metric has undergone a further improvement in June  increasing to 14 8 points  This is the highest level witnessed since Aug 2001  Previously  labor market differential has also been utilized by Janet Yellen to gauge the unemployment rate  Leading economists believe that its current level should signify that the economy is nearing full employment  Needless to say  such a state of affairs will only spur further wage gains and consequently higher consumer expenditure Fed Officials Remain Cautious but ConfidentSeveral Fed officials have expressed doubts over the need for a rate hike amid conflicting signals over the health of the economy  However  San Francisco Fed President John Williams snapped this chain of doubt on Monday  emphasizing the need to increase rates in a gradual manner  Quite like the Fed Chair  Williams thinks that recent disappointing data on inflation is transitory in nature Williams believes that inflation will hit the Fed s 2  target by 2018  Fed Chair Janet Yellen also provided no indications about a change in the central bank s approach on monetary policy  Yellen did emphasize the need for gradual rate hikes and acknowledged prohibitive asset valuations  But her stance remains one which is in favor of monetary tightening Our ChoicesData on consumer confidence indicates that the economy s engine of growth  consumer spending  is likely to remain strong in the near future  A strong labor market is helping to boost consumers  purchasing power With the economy at full employment and wage rises continuing at a steady pace  investing in consumer discretionary stocks seems to be a prudent option  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 

Top Stocks Flaunting Impressive Relative Price Strength 

	Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average 

	On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it 

	However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands 

	Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy 

	Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains 

Screening Parameters

Relative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   1 week greater than 0 

	 We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S P 500 over the last 12 weeks  4 weeks and 1 week  

  Change  Q1  Est  over 4 Weeks greater than 0  Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks 

Zacks Rank equal to 1   Only Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks   that have returned more than 26  annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years   can get through  You can see     

Current Price greater than or equal to  5 and Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000   A minimum price of  5 is a good standard to screen low priced stocks  while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity 

  less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential 

	Here are five of the seven stocks that made it through the screen

145075,366590,HRB,Inflation Worries To Stall Rate Hikes  4 Great Picks,opinion,"When the Fed voted to raise rates last week  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari emerged as the lone voice of dissent  The Fed Chair and her colleagues had cited rising inflation as a reason for their decision  But Kashkari finds no evidence to that effect in his note  Instead  he wonders how the U S  could be grappling with rising prices even as the rest of the world has experienced depressed prices since the global financial crisis 
Inflation data released over the past three months seem to bear out the Minneapolis Fed President s views on price rise  Meanwhile  some of his colleagues at the central bank have also chimed in to record their concerns about inflation and the Fed s likely rate hike schedule 
Some have even gone on to suggest that the Fed might not hike rates further  or at best  wait for further evidence on inflation to do  Treasury yields declined on Tuesday  heightening concerns over the issue even further  It seems investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may be a prudent option even at this point 
Fed s Inflation Target Remains Evasive
In May  the Fed s preferred inflation gauge  core PCE inflation  increased by only 1 5   This was the poorest level recorded since Dec 2005 and far off the Fed s target rate of 2   Fed Reserve Governor Lael Brainard commented that the PCE measure had remained below the central bank s target rate despite the fact that unemployment had fallen drastically 
Another Fed policymaker  James Bullard  had gone on to say that the Philips curve had failed to work in the case of the U S  The theory underlying the curve postulates that inflation and unemployment are inversely related 
Can the Philips Curve Be Trusted 
Kashkari had raised the same issue in his note of dissent  saying that excessive faith regarding the validity of the theory was driving the Fed to make imprudent decisions  He added that the present FOMC was so focused on controlling inflation  given its belief in the Philips curve  that it was discounting the role of expectations  In effect  the central bank was repeating its mistakes of the seventies  
If at all the relationship between inflation and unemployment remains intact  it implies that the Philips curve has flattened  Further evidence was available last week  when core CPI Inflation  which excludes volatile food and fuel costs  increased only 1 7  on a yearly basis in May  This is the lowest increase recorded since May 2015 when it hit 1 9   And yet the unemployment rate declined from 4 4  to 4 3  in May  marking its lowest level since 2001 
Officials Favor Gradual Approach on Rate Hikes
Already  a debate of sorts is brewing among Fed policymakers on the future path of rate hikes  With the Fed slated to raise rates at least once more this year  voices of dissent are growing louder  Late on Monday  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans hinted that the Fed may not go on to raise rates again this year  Expressing concern about prevailing levels of inflation  Evans said that the Fed should raise rates and trim its balance sheet gradually 
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan has expressed similar concerns  Speaking in California  Kaplan said that he was looking for further evidence to show that the decline in inflation levels was only a transitory phenomenon  Eric Rosengren expressed similar views in Amsterdam on Tuesday  saying that lower rates may become a fixture across economies since they were in line with population trends   
Our Choices
Though the Fed has stated that another rate hike is more than likely this year  voices emerging from the central bank indicate otherwise  Concerns about inflation and a sluggish economy means that the path of rate hikes now seems unclear  Falling Treasury yields provide further evidence to that effect

Inflation Worries to Stall Rate Hikes  4 Great Picks 

	When the Fed voted to raise rates last week  Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari emerged as the lone voice of dissent  The Fed Chair and her colleagues had cited rising inflation as a reason for their decision  But Kashkari finds no evidence to that effect in his note  Instead  he wonders how the U S  could be grappling with rising prices even as the rest of the world has experienced depressed prices since the global financial crisis 

	Inflation data released over the past three months seem to bear out the Minneapolis Fed President s views on price rise  Meanwhile  some of his colleagues at the central bank have also chimed in to record their concerns about inflation and the Fed s likely rate hike schedule 

	Some have even gone on to suggest that the Fed might not hike rates further  or at best  wait for further evidence on inflation to do  Treasury yields declined on Tuesday  heightening concerns over the issue even further  It seems investing in stocks benefiting from a soft interest rate environment may be a prudent option even at this point 

Fed s Inflation Target Remains Evasive

	In May  the Fed s preferred inflation gauge  core PCE inflation  increased by only 1 5   This was the poorest level recorded since Dec 2005 and far off the Fed s target rate of 2   Fed Reserve Governor Lael Brainard commented that the PCE measure had remained below the central bank s target rate despite the fact that unemployment had fallen drastically 

	Another Fed policymaker  James Bullard  had gone on to say that the Philips curve had failed to work in the case of the U S  The theory underlying the curve postulates that inflation and unemployment are inversely related 

Can the Philips Curve Be Trusted

Want to Combat Market Volatility  Buy 5 Low Beta Stocks

	Most investors are like minded and believe that only high risk securities could lead to lucrative return  Yes  the idea is right to some extent as those stocks perform better when markets are bullish  But the converse scenario for a bearish market should also be considered by investors 

	After thorough research and analysis  we have developed a strategy which testifies that low risk stocks could also fetch lucrative returns when some other parameters are considered 

Beta Understanding

	Beta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market 

	If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 

	For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market  Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market 

Building a Low Risk Portfolio

	In order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria 

Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks   We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month 

Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000   A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable 

Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 

Zacks Rank equal to 1   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months

HRB Technical Analysis

HRB opened trading yesterday at  26 58 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  26 44  HRB closed trading yesterday at  26 99 and spiked up after market to  29 72  equivalent to a 10  increase from the closing price  Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time HRB traded above these levels we have to go back to March 3rd  2016 when it traded at  31 42 
Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike up HRB had already been in an overall upward  dating back to February 24th when it traded at  19 86  HRB has a  of 206 02 million shares and traded 1 55 times the normal daily trading volume on Tuesday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see HRB open trading on Wednesday above  28 75 and if it does I would be looking to take a long position at the bell  My  would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap up

145112,366627,HRB,3 Reasons Momentum Stock Investors Will Love H R Block  HRB ,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on H R Block  Inc    NYSE HRB   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for HRB s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for H R BlockA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 15 5  compared to an industry average of 1 8   HRB is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for H R BlockWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of HRB  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 31 5  to  2 3  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 27 5   Clearly  HRB is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors H R Block  Inc  PE Ratio  TTM    HRB Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with HRB as of late too Over the past two months  four earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that two estimates have moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too   These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago HRB was expected to post earnings of  1 77 share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of  2 00 for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have HRB as a security with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A   You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep HRB on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2017-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-h-r-block-(hrb)-200196037,200196037
145113,366628,HRB,5 Top Stocks Flaunting Impressive Relative Price Strength,opinion,Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios  Simultaneously  it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average On such comparison  if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples  it may be better to avoid it However  those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio  since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns  Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen

145130,366645,HRB,Is Guess   GES  Poised For A Beat This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Guess   Inc    NYSE GES   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24 after the market closes  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this apparel retailer will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter 
The company posted an average earnings beat of 22 12   despite missing the consensus mark thrice in the trailing four quarters  Consequently  the dismal performance weighed upon the stock and is clearly reflected in its share prices 
We note that in the past year  the shares of this apparel retailer have declined 39 9   compared with the 19 0  decline witnessed by the Zacks categorized  

Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model shows that Guess  is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks Earnings ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  3 23   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at a loss of 30 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 31 cents  This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Guess  currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Guess  Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  3 23  makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat 
Which Way Are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter has improved marginally in the last seven days  while remaining stable for fiscal 2018 Guess   Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors Influencing the Quarter
The company anticipates net revenue to grow 2 4  on a constant currency basis  in the first quarter  It also anticipates operating loss margin in the range of 6  and 7   including 30 bps of currency headwind  The company expects a loss in the band of 30 33 cents 
Guess  is struggling with waning comps in the North American Retail segment  Comps declined 4 9   2   4  and 7   respectively in the four quarters of fiscal 2017  due to a tough retail environment  Further  foreign currency is putting pressure on the company s sales 
Further  the company is experiencing lower margins due to higher cost of sales  Although it is taking several cost cutting initiatives  higher promotional environment and competitive retail environment are putting strain on gross margins 
For fiscal 2018  the company expects improvement in both Europe and Asia as the company continues its retail expansion there  In the Americas  the company expects to remain focused on profitability improvements  backed by plans of rent reductions and closing underperforming stores  The company also expects to implement supply chain initiatives to drive profit improvement in fiscal 2018 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies in the consumer discretionary sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Gildan Activewear  Inc    TO GIL   has an Earnings ESP of  2 08  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  
H R Block  Inc    NYSE HRB   has an Earnings ESP of  2 56  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Vail Resorts  Inc    NYSE MTN   has an Earnings ESP of  3 41  and a Zacks Rank  2

145139,366654,HRB,Strong Jobs Report Gives Yellen Green Light As Oil Gets Rocked,opinion," Competition is always a good thing  It forces us to do our best  A monopoly renders people complacent and satisfied with mediocrity     Nancy Pearcy 
As a boy and later a young man growing up  I was ultra competitive and took losing very hard  The same can be said for many people  but consider yourself fortunate if you receive the proper guidance on dealing with the short end of a sporting endeavor  If one figures out the mistakes made and how to improve those areas  ultimately you can wind up stronger in the long term 
In nearly every field  but especially business  competition is brutal  Let s take money management as an example  If you are a good investor and find a way to outperform market indexes  a very difficult task   you would think people would beat down a door so you can help them grow their capital  Maybe  maybe not  It turns out there are other good investors  and not just in equity investing  They can be also be found in fixed income  bonds   venture capital  real estate  commodities  private equity  hedge funds  currencies  and options  With technology  the current environment makes it so you can mix and match any one of these asset classes looking for your ideal portfolio  You know  the one where you gain 30  per year with no risk  the one everyone wants 
Anyway  in every area of the economy the competition is fierce  Interestingly  maybe the best investments are ones where there is lack of competition  or none at all  Oops  darn it  I might have given away an important secret to my worthy competitors 
In the market this week  the February jobs number came in hot at 235 thousand  essentially making it all but certain Janet and the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates  25 basis points on March 14 
Elsewhere  large institutional investors are now reticent to embrace the new IPO of Snap  NYSE SNAP  as the dual class structure gives them pause  even going so far as to push for SNAP to not be included in major indexes 
Another emerging area  the artist known as Bitcoin  was handed a setback late Friday as the Winklevoss twins were rejected by the SEC in their efforts to create an ETF centered around the asset  Bitcoin s price had shot up to 1200 before retreating after the SEC s decision  It is up significantly from the 300 buck level only a few years ago 
The oil world met this week in Houston for the CERA conference where all the big boys spoke including the Saudi oil minister  the heads of all major integrated international oil companies  the largest shale producers  and low and behold  the Prime Minister of Canada  Justin Trudeau  The CEO s of the largest majors spoke of efficiency and their prospects for improving their cost structures over the next few years  mostly because of projects coming on line which should be immediately accretive to cash flow and earnings  The Saudi s met with the shale guys to warn them about production levels and market share gains 
Looking ahead  the crucial issue is the ability of OPEC and non OPEC producers to keep production restricted versus the ability of the shale producers to make money at lower prices  Usually technology wins  but with oil  depletion rates and return on capital also are important  All in all  if you are long you go with the shale guys  more conservative stick with the majors  and short find a good refiner  No extra charge for the advice

In the political world  the House passed the first few attempts to find a way to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  and in the process have upset nearly every medical constituency imaginable  nurses  doctors  and patients  The key person in the attempt to replace the ACA is HHS Secretary Tom Price  who gets a great deal of latitude on many of the different elements of that law  As a long time doctor familiar with the profession  he is going to be the driver if the Republicans are going to have success  As part of this effort  a major obstacle is the Freedom Caucus  the most conservative and vocal opponents of the new reform bill  which they deem as Obamacare light 
Meanwhile  it is clear Mr  Trump will also have to help drive the effort to pass the bill  Donald is doing his part  hosting members of Congress like Ted Cruz  inviting them bowling  showing them around the White House  the friendly host thing  Kind of acting like a President should  right  Of course  the Democrats will be at war with him for at least the next four years  so competitive forces always act as a mitigating force in the political realm  just like in so many others

145174,366689,HRB,Stocks Close Near Lows,opinion,"U S  stocks finished near the lows of the day to wipe out most gains for the week as widespread global equity losses accompanied festering growth concerns and a persistent decline in sovereign bond yields  Crude oil prices were lower as the U S  dollar extended the previous day s advance  Treasuries and gold were higher  while a preliminary read on U S  consumer sentiment came in slightly above expectations 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  fell 120 points  0 7   to 17 865  the S P 500 Index lost 19 points  0 9   to 2 096  and the Nasdaq Composite finished 64 points  1 3   lower at 4 895  In moderately heavy volume  865 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 8 billion shares changed hands on the Nasdaq  WTI crude oil decreased  1 49 to  49 07 per barrel and wholesale gasoline declined  0 06 to  1 56 per gallon  while the Bloomberg gold spot price increased  4 74 to  1 274 55 per ounce  Elsewhere  the Dollar Index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 7  higher at 94 58  Markets were mixed for the week  as the DJIA increased 0 3   the S P 500 Index decreased 0 2  and the Nasdaq Composite declined 1 0

Consumer sentiment dips but tops forecasts 
The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index dipped to 94 3 this month from May s 11 month high of 94 7  and compared to the Bloomberg estimate of a decline to 94 0  The economic conditions component of the survey improved  while the outlook portion declined  The 1 year inflation outlook held at 2 4   though the 5 10 year inflation estimate declined to 2 3  from 2 5  
Treasuries were higher  with the yields on the 2 year note and the 30 year bond decreasing 3 basis points  bps  to 0 73  and 2 46   respectively  while the yield on the 10 year note dropped 5 bps to 1 64   Bond yields have shown some downside volatility as of late with recent data and Monday s speech from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen dampening summer rate hike expectations  along with the recent flare up in global growth concerns 
Financials lead European losses  Asia finishes the week out on a sour note 
European equities traded broadly lower  posting a third straight down session  Financials led the decline as dampened Fed rate hike expectations and flared up global growth concerns buoyed the U S  dollar to exacerbate pressure on oil and commodity prices and depressed global interest rates  Also  the global markets appeared cautious ahead of next week s key monetary policy decisions out of the U S   Japan  and the U K   while the June 23 referendum looms on whether the U K  will leave the European Union  EU   known as a Brexit  The euro declined and the British pound fell versus the U S  dollar  Bond yields in the region were mixed  though the continued fall for the yield on the German 10 year bond raised some concerns  In economic news  French industrial and manufacturing output in April rose much more than expected  along with U K  construction output 
Stocks in Asia finished lower to close out the week amid the recent flare up in global growth uneasiness ahead of next week s key monetary policy decisions  including from the Bank of Japan  BoJ   The U S  dollar has firmed as of late to exacerbate the pressure on oil and commodity prices  as well as emerging markets  Oil and gas  basic materials and financials were some of the biggest decliners in the region  which led to a decline for Australian equities  Japanese stocks decreased  with financials being bogged down by the nation s 10 year government bond yield falling to a record low of  0 155   per Bloomberg  ahead of the BoJ s decision  Indian securities traded to the downside  ahead of a read on the country s industrial production  After the closing bell  India s industrial production unexpectedly fell for April  China is expected to deliver key lending statistics over the weekend  which will be followed by next week s reports on industrial production  retail sales and property prices  Mainland Chinese markets remained closed for a holiday  while trading in Hong Kong reopened after yesterday s holiday closure  though stocks were lower  Finally  South Korean equities finished lower 
Mixed week as uncertainty remains
With data on the lighter side  the markets had little help to determine if last week s severe miss for May U S  nonfarm payroll growth was an anomaly  This likely contributed to the late week flare up in global growth concerns  along with a cut growth outlook from the World Bank  and more lackluster economic reports out of China and Japan  The global markets appeared cautious ahead of a plethora of monetary policy decisions  while polls continued to foster uncertainty regarding a U K  Brexit  However  U S  stocks finished mixed as the late week stumble was preceded by the continued march higher for crude oil prices and a speech from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen  who omitted a time frame for a next hike only to counter this with a relatively upbeat assessment of the domestic economy  Financials were the biggest drags on the week as lower global interest rates weighed on the sector  while energy issues were standout winners as crude oil prices enjoyed some time north of the  50 per barrel mark 
Stocks moving nowhere for over a year  and a continued low yield environment is fueling investor frustration  There doesn t appear to be a lot of impetus for that to change soon  but investors should remain patient as positive signs are emerging  For the frustration to end  we believe businesses need to pick up their capital spending  For now  a relatively healthy consumer and housing are keeping the U S  economy afloat and making it possible that we ll see a Fed hike this summer  The discontent in the U K  has led to an upcoming vote on whether to leave the European Union or not  We believe they ll stay  but there are risks  and unfortunately stocks likely won t rally on a vote to remain  but could slide on a vote to leave 
Data and Fed set collide next week
Next week s economic docket will heat back up  with key releases of retail sales  the Consumer Price Index  CPI   the Producer Price Index  PPI   industrial production and capacity utilization  along with housing starts and building permits  However  the headlining event is poised to be Wednesday s monetary policy decision from the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC   Although June rate hike expectations were taken off the table by last week s severely disappointing labor report and this week s speech from Fed Chair Yellen  the markets will be paying close attention to the FOMC s updated economic projections and Yellen s press conference shortly after the decision  The latest U S  employment report  and some of its accompanying components that suggested some worrisome labor market trends  may well be another bump in the road toward higher rates  While an increase in July isn t off the table  the likelihood of a rate hike has been reduced 
Other notable reports on next week s economic calendar include  the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index  June New York and Philly regional manufacturing data  and the NAHB Housing Market Index 
International reports slated for next week include  Australia employment change  China industrial production and retail sales  India industrial production and the CPI  Japan Bank of Japan monetary policy decision  Eurozone industrial production  trade balance  1Q employment  new car registrations and the CPI  U K  Bank of England monetary policy meeting  retail sales  CPI and employment change ",2016-06-12,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-close-near-lows-200135400,200135400

Nonfarm payrolls rose by 242 000 jobs month over month  m m  in February  compared to the Bloomberg forecast of a 195 000 increase  The initial rise of 151 000 seen in January was revised to a gain of 172 000 jobs  Excluding government hiring and firing  private sector payrolls increased by 230 000  versus the forecasted gain of 190 000  after expanding by an upwardly revised 182 000 in January  from the 158 000 rise that was initially reported  The unemployment rate remained at 4 9   as expected  while average hourly earnings dipped 0 1  m m  versus projections of a 0 2  gain  and January s 0 5  increase was unadjusted  Finally  average weekly hours declined to 34 4 from January s unrevised 34 6 hours level  where it was expected to remain Employment gains were seen in health care and social assistance  retail trade  food services and drinking places  as well as educational services  while job losses continued in mining 
The markets are grappled with the mixed report as job growth came in much stronger than expected  However  the accompanying unexpected dip in wage growth may have kept Fed rate hike expectations in check due to its implications on inflation  which continues to run below the Central Bank s target  Recession fears have risen  and the market is now expecting fewer Fed rate hikes this year  We believe those fears are overdone and that chances of a recession  while higher than late last year  are still low  With the labor market tightening  we believe the Fed will be able to move toward normalization of monetary policy with a rate hike or two this year less than expected late last year  but still beneficial to much of the financial sector 
The trade balance showed that the deficit widened to  45 7 billion in January  compared to the  44 0 billion estimate  December s deficit was revised to  44 7 billion from the initially reported  43 4 billion  Exports dropped 2 1  m m to  176 4 billion  and imports decreased 1 3  m m to  222 1 billion 
Treasuries declined  with the yield on the 2 year note rising 2 basis points  bps  to 0 87   while the yields on the 10 year note and the 30 year bond gained 4 bps to 1 88  and 2 70   respectively 
Europe higher  Asia posts modest gains 
European equities finished higher  with mining stocks continuing their recent rally  while traders grappled with the stronger than expected U S  February job growth figures  though the wage component of the report was on the disappointing side  Ahead of next week s monetary policy meeting from the European Central Bank  the Stoxx Europe 600 Index posted a weekly rally of over 3 0  after rising four out of the last five sessions  The euro was higher versus the U S  dollar and bond yields in the region moved to the upside  In economic news  growth in German construction output accelerated in February as reported by Markit  while Italy s 4Q GDP growth was unrevised at a 0 1  quarter over quarter pace  matching forecasts 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher extending a positive week that saw global sentiment improve after China announced further stimulus measures and data out of the U S  and Europe that was relatively upbeat  Also  traders may have treaded with some caution ahead of today s February labor report in the U S  Japanese equities rose  posting a four session winning streak  after showing some late day resiliency as the yen gave up early gains  Chinese stocks advanced  bolstered by reports that the government intervened to support the markets before the start of the country s annual economic policy meetings over the weekend  per Bloomberg  The meetings are for the government to set a five year plan for the economy and will include its annual growth target  Australian securities gained ground with continued strength in basic materials stocks helping offset a report showing the nation s retail sales rose at a smaller than expected rate in January  Finally  Indian equities nudged higher  extending their rally to four sessions  while South Korean listings dipped trimming the weekly gain 
Stocks higher for third straight week
Domestic stocks posted their third consecutive week of gains with energy issues leading the major sectors broadly higher  along with the materials sector  as crude oil and other commodity prices continued to recover  Also  the recently battered financial sector was among the standout winners  Relatively favorable reads on U S  manufacturing and non manufacturing activity from the ISM teamed up with a mostly upbeat Fed Beige Book  to help ease unnerved global sentiment  along with some positive reports out of the eurozone  Moreover  another dose of disappointing Chinese manufacturing and services sector data was met with the announcement of further stimulus measures from the People s Bank of China  PBoC  in the form of a 50 bp cut of its banking sector reserve requirement ratio the amount of cash that banks need to keep on reserve instead of using in the financial system to 17 00  
The sharp downward move by stocks to start the year has abated  but volatility is likely to persist  We believe the bulls will ultimately win the tug of war  but risks are elevated  The roller coaster ride in stocks is reflected in the mixed readings among recent economic releases  This  combined with signs some inflation has re emerged  complicates the Fed s upcoming decisions on rates and adds to uncertainty  Global stocks have joined in on the wild ride  with some comforting words from China aiding the rebound  but the upcoming European Central Bank decision could ignite further volatility 
Next week s data light in the U S  but focus could be on the other side of the pond
Next week  the U S  economic calendar will take a bit of a breather  with the key releases being the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index  wholesale inventories  and weekly jobless claims  However  the global markets will likely focus across the pond  with the highly anticipated monetary policy meeting from the European Central Bank  ECB   which will be preceded by the eurozone s preliminary 4Q GDP report  The ECB needs to avoid actions that may undermine the financial sector to help sustain the stock market rally  Investors may want to watch for several key developments that could help determine the direction for Europe s stock market  A cut to the key rate on banks  deposits at the ECB is priced into futures markets  but a bigger cut may be viewed negatively by investors since it may raise banks  costs  An introduction of a tiered system to shield some of banks  deposits from the cost of negative interest rates would likely be viewed as a positive by the stock market  Any expansion of the ECB s quantitative easing  QE  asset purchase program from the current monthly pace of 60 billion euros may be welcomed by market participants 
Other international reports slated for next week include  Australia consumer confidence  China trade balance  CPI and PPI  new yuan loans  aggregate financing  industrial production  and retail sales  India trade balance and industrial production  Japan final 4Q GDP and trade balance  U K  trade balance  industrial and manufacturing production  and construction output

145223,366738,HRB,What Happened To Gas Tax Windfall ,opinion,"Wall Street analysts unanimously cheered last fall when the price of oil fell from nearly  100 a barrel in June of 2014  to almost  45 a barrel by the end of January 2015  The theory was that the average American family  paying less at the pump  would plow this savings into other goods and services  giving GDP a much needed boost 
In the winter of 2014 optimism about a strong 2015 was abound  The average household was now poised to have an extra  750 a year that would soon be burning a hole in their pockets  Falling gas prices would free up billions of dollars for consumers to spend next year  with the spend happy middle class seeing most of the benefit 
Lower prices at the pump was the equivalent of cutting taxes between  100 billion and  125 billion  Increased consumer spending as a result of lower gas prices were predicted to add as much as a half percentage point to economic growth in 2015 
With first quarter GDP now running negative  it is clear this  gas tax  did not have the simulative effect analysts had hoped for 
What Happened To Our Gas Tax Windfall 
It appeared most analysts assumed if consumers liked their gas tax cut  much like Obama s promise to keep their health plan  they could keep it  Unfortunately Obamacare may be the Grinch who stole the gas tax gift meant for consumers  An increase in what the average American pays in health care costs as a result of the Affordable Care Act  ACA  has swallowed all the savings from the fall in gas prices 
The first victims of Obamacare were small businesses  who quickly learned their once sufficient coverage did not match the arduous ACA mandates  The increase in health care costs passed on by employers caused Individual year round employees at businesses with 50 to 99 workers to lose  935 in take home pay annually  while those at firms with 20 to 49 workers were out an average of  827 50  And workers with solo coverage now pay an average of  1 081 in annual premiums  according to a Kaiser Family Foundation Health Research   Educational Trust report  up a whopping 8 1  from a year ago 
But small business and the self insured are not the only ones suffering the Obamacare wrath  With Obamacare s onerous Cadillac tax  many who once enjoyed lavish health care plans  curtesy of their large employer  are now paying a lot more for premiums and out of pocket expenses 
Under this law  if an individual health insurance policy costs more than  10 200  the employer has to pay a 40  excise tax for the amount the policy exceeds that threshold  For family policies  the corresponding threshold is  27 500  This tax goes into effect in 2018 but most employers aren t waiting for the tax to kick in  They have been busy trading in their employee s Cadillac for an AMC Gremlin  These high deductible plans are less expensive to the employer  allowing them to avoid the threshold and corresponding tax  but they are more expensive to the employee    burdening them with a lot of additional costs 
And it s only getting worse for employees of larger companies  Next year  nearly a third of large employers only plan on having the Gremlin on the lot  That is  they are only offering high deductible plans  This is up from 22 percent in 2014 and 10 percent in 2010  according to a study by the National Business Group on Health 
Fittingly  this year  employees will pay 55  more for health insurance premiums and out of pocket medical bills than they did in 2010  This is taking a big bite out of consumer s disposable income  The average worker with employer sponsored health insurance will pay about  2 664  or nearly 24  of the total cost of their plan premium in 2016  Five years ago  employees paid  1 835 
When you couple this with the high deductible plans  employees will pay an average of  2 487 in out of pocket costs  nearly double what employees paid in 2009  Not too long ago half of employees had deductibles below  500  now  only one third do  Goodbye gas tax hello higher health care costs 
Finally we have the previously uninsured  whom Obamacare was designed to help  Surely they are reaping the benefit of all this  affordable care   Unfortunately  those Obamacare recipients who count on a tax refund to balance their household books may have to look for another way to make those ends meet  Customers who received subsidized coverage based on their estimated income are now seeing tax bills for part or all of the subsidy because their actual income turned out to be higher 
The hard cutoff for subsidies occurs once incomes exceed 400  of the official U S  poverty rate  Going over that amount by even  1 00 can result in a hefty IRS bill because all those subsidies go to Zero once you surpass that threshold  Health policy analyst and former New York Lt  Governor Betsy McCaughey wrote   For about 1 in 4 tax filers  it s turning out to be a nightmare  with extra paperwork and penalties   It is anticipated that at least half of subsidy recipients owed more in taxes this year due to underestimating their income  And according to H R Block  NYSE HRB   sixty one percent of those filers saw their refunds reduced by an average of  729 
But Obama care isn t the only reason why the economy won t achieve  escape velocity   Cheerleaders on Wall Street don t want you to focus on the other drags to growth such as stagnant real incomes  the rise in the cost of rental housing and the debt disabled  overregulated condition of the nation  They only want to talk up the positives  and then provide a myriad of banal excuses  e g  weather  when the economy fails to live up to their over hyped expectations  Q1 GDP will most likely produce a negative number for two years in a row and now interest rates on sovereign debt have spiked across the developed world  That doesn t bode well for a second quarter rebound in growth 
Still  the narrative on Wall Street is that Q2 will finally show a massive boost in consumer spending from lower oil prices  But the truth is there was no boost in retail sales when gas prices were coming down  and there is not going to be one now that gas prices have risen by 31  since mid January  The decline in oil prices merely helped defray the spike in healthcare costs from the ACA  Therefore  those expecting a Q2 rebound driven by consumer spending from the erstwhile drop in oil prices should  unlike Ms  Pelosi  be careful to  read the bill now that they have passed it

145224,366739,HRB,SPX  Shorts Start To Cover,opinion,"Technical Outlook 
S P 500 on Friday sold off hard at the open  but traders managed to buy the dip and turn  1 5  loss into a  1 4  gain 
The reversal on Friday  was one of the biggest reversals seen out of the market going all the way back to 2011 
If SPX finishes higher today  it would be the first time this year  it has managed trade higher five days in a row in 2015 
On the daily chart  SPX managed to close above the 20 day moving average 
Volume on SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  was very strong on Friday and well above average 
The employment report initially sold the market off hard and fast  but wasn t enough to keep the market down 
VIX dropped 7 1  down to 20 94 
The possibility exists that the VIX could close below 20 for the first time since the rally began back on 8 20 15 
There is a very good chance  as we enter into a historically strong Q4  that the lows for the year have been established 
If the lows for the year are in  there is a nice double bottom chart that is forming on the daily SPX 
30 minute chart of SPX shows a that a break of 1950 has occurred  and now needs to see some follow through at this point 
In the final hour of trading on Friday  SPX managed to rally 20 points into the close  A strong sign of short covering taking place  considering there wasn t a single pullback of any kind 
The huge miss in the employment report likely insures that there won t be a rate hike in October 
After trading lower for two straight quarters  a rarity that hasn t been seen since 2011   I wouldn t be surprised to see quarter four turn out to be very bullish for the market 
The Fed has never raised interest rates at a point where the market was trading lower on the year 
The large gaps in the market  the record number of stock buybacks  and ETFs that are constantly accumulating dumping large chunks of stocks  and most importantly the high frequency trading  shows just how illiquid this market has become in recent years  These entities are the most responsible for the massive market swings that stocks incur each day

orange line on the graph plots earnings per share since 1999  A quick glance vividly reveals the historical operating record of the company This article will reveal the business prospects of H R Block Inc  HRB  through the lens of FAST Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool  Therefore  it is offered as the first step before a more comprehensive research effort  Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past  present and future data and expectations  A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business  Simply put  the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of their time and effort based on the data as presented and organized  The FAST Graphs  unique advantage is the graphical articulation of the price value proposition  Earnings Determine Market Price  The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line

at the forecasting graph below  the stock appears in value  it s within of the value corridor of the five orange lines   based on future growth  H R Block Inc  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal P E Since 1999Performance Table H R Block IncThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 5 7  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of H R Block Inc  assuming an initial investment of  1 000  would have received an additional  585 10 in dividends  blue highlighting  that increased their total return from 5 7  to 7 5  per annum versus 2 6  in the S P 500 following graph plots the historical P E ratio  the dark blue line  in conjunction with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1999 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current P S ratio relative to its historical P S ratio  The current P S ratio for H R Block Inc is 2 30 which is historically normal  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense

their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in H R Block Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that H R Block Inc s expected earnings would be 5 5  purple circle  times that of the 10 year T bond interest  see EYE chart

145254,366769,HRB,Stocks Still Thin to Win ,opinion,"Patterns will always be part of the S P 500 futures E mini  ES   and  really  any financial chart  Noticing these patterns can help when trading but once the public notices them they generally don t last very long 
When Turnaround Tuesday became one of the best up days of the week  after a few months it was taken out by the return of Mutual Fund Monday which has been up 7 of the last 8 Mondays 

Stats and More Stats
I have said many times that I have never seen anything like the current up move and our friend Marty  PitBull  Schwartz  one of the original  Market Wizards   agrees 
Part of it is the relentless move to the upside but the other and more scary part is how low the volumes in the E mini  CME ESM14  have gotten  While the CME says the average volume in the ES was 2 million contracts a day in 2013 and down to 1 5 million in 2014  I don t see that  In fact the ESM14 is barely doing 1 million contracts a day including pre market Globex volumes 
I told the PitBull yesterday that I think by mid July the total volume in the ES will drop to 750 000 a day  This is a far cry from the CMEs all time volume of 6 69 million E minis traded in one day at the height of the credit crisis 
Up Days
No matter how you look at it or count  it the S P is going up  I could go back further and add to the positive stats  but the last 18 trading days are enough  As of this morning s open the ESM14 has closed higher 16 of the last 18 trading days and 15 of the last 16 with the one down day being down just 1 tick  The E mini futures have been up 9 days in a row

Complacency

There is little doubt that lower volumes have worked in favor of the S P s march to new highs  As the VIX drops to historically low levels the S P will sell off at some point but there is no sign of that right now 
Many people we talk to think the current slow down   up move could continue right into the fall  There are a lot of nervous longs in the stock market but the VIX does not seem to be scaring anyone out right now

Our View
The S P is giving the impression that it wants to go down but that will require the sellers to return  From what we see  it looks like they went on an extended vacation  From Monday s 1954 75 high to yesterday s 1943 00 low was an 11 handle pullback  the largest since Friday May 16th  when the market closed down 18 handles  and May 20 when the ESM closed down  14 2  After that  the only down day over the last 15 sessions has been on May 28  down 1 tick  
While the S P may have broken its winning streak in the S P cash  the futures managed to close 3 ticks higher yesterday keeping the winning streak at 9 days and counting  Our view is to sell the early rallies and buy weakness and look at buying some cheap puts for a lotto play

First is the short term pattern  The price broke above an ascending triangle in June  and then pulled back to retest the breakout level  Now it is moving higher again and carries a target from the pattern to 39 50  The second reason is that the price movement into that ascending triangle would measure to 44 on an equivalent Measured Move higher  Finally the Point and Figure chart  or tick chart  shows a triple top breakout with a price objective to at least 66 50
