147250,368766,BHC,Left s Citron hedge fund posts 43  gain in first year,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Andrew Left  who has long targeted companies that he thinks are over valued through his work at Citron Research  told investors on Monday that his new hedge fund returned 43  after fees in 2019  its first year in business 
Left also made a prediction that home furnishing company RH  one of his winners last year  may make a tempting takeover target for someone 
 In 2019  our first full year of operation  Citron Capital  LP   Fund   generated a gross return of 56 4  and net return of 43 3    Left wrote in the letter seen by Reuters 
While the fund bet that certain stocks would climb  Left also bet that certain ones would drop  writing  the Fund s average exposure during 2019 was 75 8  long and 80 3  short  
Left said that winners on the long side included Bausch Health  TO BHC   RH  N RH   and Snap  N SNAP  and on the short side included  Ligand Pharmaceuticals   O LGND   Jumia Technologies   and Grand Canyon Education  O LOPE  
After investing only his own wealth for roughly two decades Left in 2018 began laying the groundwork for Citron Capital  his hedge fund  By raising outside capital  Left has more firepower to go after some of the biggest U S  companies 
Citron has not disclosed the size of its hedge fund 
For this year  Left said RH  whose stock price closed at  212 77 on Monday  may be bought   We believe the company has matured to a point that we might see it acquired in 2020  
He also said he is sticking by his bet that shares in Peloton  NASDAQ PTON  Interactive  whose stock closed at  29 75 on Monday  will fall   Citron put a one year price target of  5 and we stand by it as  5 makes this still a  1 5 billion company  
Neither RH nor Peloton responded immediately to emails seeking comment 
Left also gave investors lessons that he learned last year  reminding himself and others to stay away from what he calls  big story  cult stock   companies and sticking with what he does best  exposing fraud 
He also said that this year will be a year of growth and that he is looking to expand beyond his home base in Los Angeles ",2020-01-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lefts-citron-hedge-fund-posts-43-gain-in-first-year-2053568,2053568

147254,368770,BHC,Luckin Coffee share price may nearly double to  60 on U S  exchanges  hedge fund Citron Capital,news,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK  Reuters    China based  Luckin Coffee  Inc s  O LK  shares could double in price after it overcomes the negative impact of the coronavirus outbreak and a widely publicized bearish bet against its stock  according to Andrew Left  managing partner at hedge fund Citron Capital 
Better known for his short bets  Left  who is also editor of the online investment newsletter Citron Research  has come out in defense of Luckin s stock  which his fund owns  The stock will probably eventually trade at  60 per share on U S  exchanges once uncertainty over the coronavirus clears  he told Reuters 
Luckin was forced to temporarily close an estimated 200 coffee shops in Wuhan  capital of the Hubei province in China and epicenter of the deadly virus outbreak 
Its stock slumped as much as 27  on Friday after hedge fund Muddy Waters said it had sold short the shares of the Chinese challenger to Starbucks  O SBUX   citing an anonymous report that questioned the coffee chain s financials 
Short sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares  hoping to buy them back later at a lower price 
Luckin has denied all allegations in the anonymous report 
Left said he decided to take a position in the stock after conducting an analysis of Luckin s business  including speaking with stakeholders and competitors and reviewing payments data 
 I don t think that report is correct   Left told Reuters 
Luckin shares staged a partial recovery on Friday when Left mounted a defense of its fundamentals via Twitter and said his fund had bought the stock 
Shares were up 14  to  35 64 in afternoon trading on Tuesday 
About 30  of Luckin s available shares have been sold short  with the dollar value of these bearish bets at  951 million  according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners  Left  dubbed  The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street  by New York Times Magazine  is known for successful bets against Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE BHC  and for publishing critical reports on Chinese companies and profiting when their shares fell 
Carson Block  founder of Muddy Waters  has made his mark in the hedge fund industry by betting against the stocks of a number of Chinese companies that trade on North American stock exchanges after challenging their accounting practices 
Muddy Waters declined to comment

147255,368771,BHC,Should Value Investors Pick Bausch Health  BHC  Stock Now ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put  Bausch Health Companies Inc    NYSE BHC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bausch Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 92  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 57  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level Bausch Health puts current PE ratio above its midpoint  which is 5 42  over the past five years  Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Bausch Health has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 6 47  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Bausch Health has a P S ratio of about 1 25  This is somewhat lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 56  right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bausch Health currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BHC a solid choice for value investors and some of its other metrics make it clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Bausch Health is just 0 60  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1 02  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2 36  which is noticeably better than the industry average of 4 68  Clearly  BHC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall 
Though Bausch Health might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D  This gives BHC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to one higher  while current year estimate has seen two upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has shown no earnings movement in the past two months  while current year estimate has inched up 0 5  in the same time period  You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bausch Health Cos Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBausch Health is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 44  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released  Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys  They deem these tickers  Most Likely for Early Price Pops   Since 1988  the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of  24 6  per year  So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention ",2020-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-value-investors-pick-bausch-health-bhc-stock-now-200499612,200499612

Consistency  not flow
Mytesi is one of only two drugs approved by the FDA under its botanical product guidance  It is an extract of the Croton lechleri tree found in the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and inhibits cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  CFTR  and the calcium dependent chloride channel  CaCC   which are responsible for controlling the quantity of water in the bowel  thus resulting in more formed stool  Importantly  this inhibition does not inhibit peristalsis unlike other available anti diarrheal medicines such as Lomotil and loperamide  The lack of significant constipation risk positions it positively for chronic use  Other indications that the company is exploring include irritable bowel syndrome  inflammatory bowel disease  congenital diarrheal disorders  idiopathic diarrhea and acute infectious diarrhea 




Unmet need but also underappreciated
The drug has a long development history dating to the 1990s and was previously marketed for HIV associated diarrhea by Salix  launched in 2013  at the time it was bought by Valeant  now Bausch Health   Diarrhea in people with HIV is under reported and under recognized as a significant contributor to poor quality of life in the 1 1 million HIV patients in the US  With the introduction of newer antiretroviral drug therapy  there has been a reduction in the incidence and or severity of diarrhea  but clinical trial data suggest a continued diarrhea prevalence of 19

Company description  A GI focused drug
Jaguar is a biopharma company focused on marketing and developing the drug Mytesi  crofelemer  for the treatment of diarrheal disorders in the US  Crofelemer is a botanical drug extracted from the Croton lechleri tree that normalizes fluid content in the gut in patients with diarrhea  It is approved and marketed for symptomatic relief of non infectious diarrhea associated with HIV antiretroviral therapy  ART  in adults  and is being investigated for a range of other causes of diarrhea  the most advanced program being for CTD  which is in a Phase II investigator initiated trial  The company had  4 4m in sales in 2018  almost entirely from Mytesi 
Valuation  Initiated at  86 5m or  4 14 per diluted share
We arrive at an initial valuation of  86 5m or  4 14 per diluted share based on a risk adjusted NPV analysis  We include the ART program  the CTD program  Canalevia  a canine product for chemotherapy induced diarrhea  and unallocated costs in our model  with ART driving the majority of the valuation   66 8m   We forecast  74 1m in peak sales in 2031 for the product if it can capture 12  of the market  We may add other indications to our model if the company commits capital to further developing them 
Financials  In the process of converting debt
The company is revenue generating with  1 7m reported for Q219 and had a net loss of  16 7m  These losses are driven in large part by non cash charges associated with the recapitalization of the company and an undisclosed  4m impairment on the company s intangible assets  As part of this multi pronged recapitalization process the company has issued 10m common shares  or equivalent in convertible preferred shares  and 19m warrants  at  2 00  on a base of 0 9m split adjusted shares at the beginning of 2019  The company may substantially dilute further both to eliminate its remaining debt   7 8m in exchange notes  and to finance operations  We expect the company to require  80m in additional capital to reach profitability in 2024   30m each in 2020 and 2021  and  20m in 2022  We forecast that this is likely to be difficult using equity at the current market capitalization 
Sensitivities  Marketing and clinical challenges
The company s operations are focused primarily on marketing Mytesi for ART diarrhea  which poses a number of significant hurdles  It is more difficult for a small company like Jaguar to market a single drug because of limited resources  whereas a larger pharma company could simply add another asset to its offering  The marketing story is also difficult because it involves increasing the awareness of ART diarrhea  which is under recognized  and convincing physicians that Mytesi is needed as a solution when there are multiple prescription and OTC remedies  Mytesi has a unique profile of improving stool consistency without inhibiting peristalsis  but the company will need to shift the treatment algorithm before these details will be appreciated  Additionally  the company faces clinical risks with its development programs  similar to other companies performing clinical trials  The drug was approved for ART diarrhea on the basis of positive efficacy data  but has previously missed its endpoints for other indications such as irritable bowel syndrome  so there is no guarantee that positive data will translate between indications  The drug has been in development since the 1990s and the first patents expire in 2022  although there currently is not a pathway to develop generics to drugs approved under the FDA s botanical guidance  And finally  the company faces significant dilution risk in its efforts to reduce its debt load and to finance future operations  and it may be forced to reduce spending or seek alternate financing 
Company description  Advancing diarrhea treatment




Jaguar Health is a pharmaceutical company focused on the marketing and development of crofelemer  a drug for the treatment of diarrhea in various patient populations  The product is currently approved and marketed in the US under the trade name Mytesi for the symptomatic relief of non infectious diarrhea in adults with HIV AIDS on anti retroviral therapy  ART   The company has planned clinical programs to expand Mytesi use into a range of other possible diarrhea indications  Exhibit 1   Additionally  the company is developing the same drug for animal use under the brand Canalevia for dogs and currently markets it as Neonorm or Equilevia for large animals  although these programs are significantly deprioritized in favor of advancing Mytesi  Finally  the company has identified a similar molecule  lechlemer   which it is investigating for the treatment of cholera in preclinical studies  This program if it advances could qualify the company for a priority review voucher for targeting an underserved tropical disease 
Crofelemer background and mechanism




Crofelemer is a drug isolated from the latex of the Croton lechleri tree in the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   the dragon blood plant  It is only one of two prescription drugs approved by the FDA under the botanical drug guidance  which allows for the approval of products from a botanical source where the product is not a pure substance  The active component of crofelemer is a mixed proanthocyanidin oligomer of indeterminate chemical structure  Exhibit 2  that is administered orally 
Diarrhea is typically triggered by exposure of cells of the intestine  enterocytes  to pathogenic bacteria or virus  the toxins these species produce  or to other chemical toxins such as drugs  These triggers lead to a signaling cascade in the enterocytes that ultimately culminates in the activation of the CFTR and the calcium dependent chloride channel  CaCC   Both of these proteins are transmembrane ion channels responsible for regulating the concentration of chloride ions in the lumen of the gut  By extension  these channels regulate the concentration of water in the gut as the chloride and other ions drive water into the gut via osmosis  The increased fluid improves motility and ultimately the pathogens or toxins are eliminated from the gut 
Crofelemer is an inhibitor of both CFTR and CaCC  and therefore by inhibition of these proteins can prevent the formation of watery stool  CFTR  as the name implies  is also present in the lungs and other organs and is implicated in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis in an unrelated fashion  due to a loss of function mutation   but there is no threat of off target effects of crofelemer in other organs because it is not systemically absorbed  These proteins have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of both a range of infectious diarrhea conditions as well as drug induced diarrhea and inhibition is effective at preventing watery stool in animal models 




History of crofelemer
Crofelemer as a therapeutic agent has a long business history  The drug was initially discovered at Shaman Pharmaceuticals in the 1990s  a company headed at the time by current Jaguar CEO Lisa Conte  Shaman was also developing crofelemer for the treatment of ART associated diarrhea  but declared bankruptcy in 2001 after the FDA requested additional clinical trials  The intellectual property was then purchased by Napo Pharmaceuticals  also headed by Lisa Conte  with the goal of pursuing the requested clinical studies with the support of development partners  The company unsuccessfully attempted to develop the drug for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea  IBS D  with partner Trine Pharmaceuticals after a Phase IIb study failed to show improvement in stool consistency  although it reached statistical significance for improvement in pain   Napo then shifted its focus back to ART associated diarrhea and partnered with Salix Pharmaceuticals in 2008 to finance the completion of a Phase III study in exchange for rights to US and European markets  The drug was approved in 2013  under the trade name Fulyzaq  However  Napo sued Salix for breach of contract and accused the company of deliberately deprioritizing crofelemer in favor of Salix s own drug Xifaxan  which had popular use off label as a treatment for IBS D  Xifaxan has subsequently been approved for IBS D   In the meantime  in 2013 the initial incarnation of Jaguar was formed as an opportunity to develop crofelemer for animal use  the rights to which were uncontested  Also during this period  Salix was embroiled in a scandal involving channel stuffing and the company was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE BHC   now Bausch Health   The lawsuit was settled in 2016 and all rights to crofelemer transferred back to Napo  which began selling the drug again in 2017  Napo was subsequently acquired by Jaguar in 2017  forming the current incarnation of the company 
Crofelemer is protected by three Orange Book patents covering the use of the drug for the treatment of secretory diarrhea broadly  expires in 2022  and ART associated diarrhea  two patents  expiring in 2031   All patents are on the method of use because as a natural substance  crofelemer is not subject to composition of matter patents  We would expect these 2031 patents to be challenged if the drug is successful  However  the product s special status as a botanical extract may give it additional IP protection because there is currently no established pathway for the development of generic versions of drugs approved under the botanical drug guidance of the FDA  The agency has stated that it intends to provide a product specific guidance document on crofelemer to aid in the development of such generics  although the document has not been published  and there is no timeline provided  This is in line with greater efforts of the agency to promote the approval of generic drugs  and we do not consider the special status of Mytesi to be perpetually protective 
Clinical trial experience




Crofelemer has been examined in a range of clinical studies against diarrhea indications  For its approved indication of ART associated diarrhea  it was evaluated in a 374 person  placebo controlled Phase III study  The trial examined three dose levels of the drug  125mg  250mg and 500mg bid  versus placebo  and the selected dose was examined in a one month evaluation phase  followed up by a five month uncontrolled observation period  The primary endpoint of the study was the number of  monthly responders   subjects with less than or equal to two watery stools per week for more than two weeks out of a month  It was found that the selected dose  125mg bid  had a monthly responder rate of 17 6  compared to 8 0  for the placebo  p 0 0096  at the end of the one month evaluation period  However  patient responses continued to improve over the five month evaluation period  Exhibit 4  
The rate of adverse events in the study was lower for the crofelemer arm than for placebo  A larger analysis provided on the FDA label for Mytesi looking at all the patients across trials that received 125mg of drug for ART associated diarrhea compared to placebo  504 patients total  found a relatively benign safety profile  The most common adverse events that occurred more frequently than placebo were upper respiratory infection  6    bronchitis  4   and cough  4   
The results from other clinical studies have been mixed  Exhibit 5   The drug previously showed a positive treatment effect for traveler s diarrhea  as measured by a reduction in time to the first solid stool  TLUS48   Patients reported solid stool in seven to 10 hours on crofelemer  compared to 44 hours on average with placebo  In a separate study  the drug also demonstrated improvement in a range of metrics for patients with acute infectious diarrhea  improvement in weight  frequency  and consistency of stools  as well as a greater number of resolutions within the first 48 hours  79  vs 28  p
However  in other trials  even though positive trends were observed  these effects did not reach statistical significance  Of particular importance is the IBS D clinical study performed in collaboration with Trine Pharmaceuticals in patients with IBS D  The study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in stool consistency  However  the study s primary investigators noted that there appeared to be improvement in the number of discomfort free days for patients in the study  after three months on the highest dose  500mg bid   24 3  of patient days were discomfort free with crofelemer compared to 13 1  without  p 0 03  




The HIV associated diarrhea market
Mytesi is approved in the US for the treatment of non infectious diarrhea in HIV patients on ART  HIV D  and is the only drug approved with this indication  According to the US Department of Health  there are approximately 1 1 million people living with HIV in the US  of which the majority  six out of seven  are diagnosed  The department estimates that an additional 38 700 became infected in 2017  However  despite the widespread availability of ART treatments to control the disease  there remains room to improve adherence  a 2011 meta analysis found an adherence rate of 62  
Diarrhea is common in patients with HIV  although results vary  one survey suggested that approximately 60  of patients receiving ART had diarrhea in the preceding month  There are multiple causes of the condition in these patients that can be roughly broken into two classes  infectious and non infectious diarrhea  Infectious diarrhea is when an opportunistic infection colonizes and irritates the gut  whereas non infectious diarrhea can either be caused by ART treatment  ART treatment associated diarrhea  or  HIV enteropathy  in which the HIV infection itself leads to deterioration of the lining of the gut 




Clinical trial data suggests that up to 19  of diarrhea cases are attributable to ART therapy  One study chronicling the advent of ART therapy from 1995 to 1997 found that incidence of diarrhea remained constant in HIV patients  but the infectious variety declined from 53  of cases to 13  of cases as ART became more established  This reduction in infectious diarrhea can cause diarrhea as a whole to be under recognized as a result of ART  because diarrhea rates may not change significantly when patients begin receiving ART  but these patients may see improvement when treated with Mytesi 
The HIV treatment market is constantly evolving as new anti retroviral agents are developed and regimens are refined  Although improvements have been made  diarrhea continues to be a significant medical need in this patient population  Jaguar studied this in a retrospective study using NIH data from 38 clinical trials and found that diarrhea rates in these patients have fallen insignificantly between 2008 and 2016 and are approximately 18   An example of this phenomenon is the case of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor  NTRI  tenofovir  which is the cornerstone of most ART regimens  Tenofovir has been reported to be associated with diarrhea rates as high as 16   depending on the study  It is provided as one of two commonly available prodrugs  tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  TDF  Truvada  is the historically available molecule  but tenofovir alafenamide  TAF  Vemlidy  was subsequently developed as an alternative that allows for substantially lower circulating levels of drug and the potential to avoid the associated nephrotoxicity  Both prodrugs are currently in use  but there is a trend toward increasing use of TAF containing regimens  However  when considering rates of ART associated diarrhea  TAF does not appear to provide a benefit and had similar rates of associated diarrhea in clinical trials  5  for both TAF and TDF  per the Vemlidy label  
In addition to ART associated diarrhea  Mytesi can potentially be used to treat diarrhea stemming from HIV enteropathy  HIV enteropathy is a negative diagnosis characterized by the presence of diarrhea without any infectious or other identifiable cause  The pathology of HIV contributes to a progressive deterioration of the lining of the gut that culminates in chronic diarrhea after many years of treatment  Unfortunately  there is little epidemiological data to separate HIV enteropathy from other forms of HIV associated diarrhea

Jaguar faces a unique set of commercial hurdles marketing Mytesi  First  the company must communicate the importance of treating diarrhea in this patient population  The extent of diarrhea in HIV infected individuals is underappreciated  as is the degree to which it affects both their quality of life and adherence to their ART regimen  ART has had little impact on rates of diarrhea  but this is largely due to high baseline rates  as described above  Additionally  although treatment has improved  ART has historically been associated with a range of more serious adverse effects than diarrhea  and therefore the condition has not had top priority  The company therefore engaged in efforts to communicate both the quality of life impact that treating HIV D can have  as well as the potential impact of treatment on adherence of ART regimens  The company collected data from its Phase III study that quantitatively demonstrates that treatment with crofelemer can improve a range of quality of life factors  in particular an increased ability to perform work and leisure activities  p




Additionally  the company must communicate the benefit of Mytesi over other commonly available diarrhea treatments  Antidiarrheals can be divided into three classes  absorbants  antimotility agents and antisecretory agents  Exhibit 7   Absorbants bind bacterial toxins and water to improve stool consistency  but are rarely used for HIV D because of the potential to interfere with oral ART medications  The antimotility agents are the most widely employed for diarrhea by slowing the transit of stool  However  these agents can cause constipation as a side effect  especially in cases where the diarrhea may be intermittent  and may not be appropriate for use as a prophylactic in these cases  Moreover  antimotility agents can be contraindicated for certain infectious forms of diarrhea  Antisecretory agents  such as Mytesi  operate by decreasing the amount of water delivered to the gut  Octreotide is the only other antisecretory agent approved in the US  although it is used off label for this purpose  Results are inconclusive for the treatment HIV D  and its use is limited due to side effects 
Jaguar currently has nine salespeople promoting the drug in the US following a recent salesforce reduction of up to 10 that was announced in August 2019  In order to expand its commercial footprint and reach more providers  Jaguar signed an agreement in June 2018 with RedHill Biopharma to co promote Mytesi in 36 territories across the US  details on which specific territories or areas have not been disclosed  that are not currently being served by Jaguar s internal salesforce  Sales under the agreement have been insignificant to date  Further details have not been released  Additionally  in September 2018  the company signed an agreement with Knight Therapeutics to commercialize the drug in Canada and Israel  Jaguar is entitled to a transfer price as well as up to  18m in regulatory and sales milestones  The product has widespread reimbursement in the US  90  of lives in AIDS Drug Assistance Programs  ADAPs   top 10 commercial insurers  245m lives   top 10 Medicare plans  2 4m lives  and Medicaid in all 50 states 
Cancer therapy related diarrhea
Although the specialty market of ART related diarrhea in the US is of limited size  the commercialization of Mytesi in this space demonstrates Jaguar s ability to operate a supply chain that started with sustainably harvested trees in the rainforest  and the effectiveness and safety of the product  Additionally  bringing Mytesi to market has required the company to develop refined messaging and educational initiatives regarding the benefits of a new way of treating diarrhea with a chronically safe agent  as opposed to the use of anti peristaltic alternatives such as Imodium and Loperamide  The company has outlined a clinical pathway forward toward expanding the approved indications for crofelemer to leverage some of this groundwork 
The most advanced clinical program is cancer therapy related diarrhea  CTD   which is currently in ongoing investigator initiated trials  IIT   GI adverse events are common in patients being treated for cancer with estimates as high as 40  of standard dose chemotherapy patients  Diarrhea is also a common adverse event for a range of targeted cancer therapies  Notably  drugs that target the ErbB family of growth receptors  which includes EGFR and HER2  typically have diarrhea as the most common adverse event  This is true of both monoclonal antibodies targeting these receptors as well as a tyrosine kinase inhibitors  TKIs   Rates of diarrhea seen in clinical trials for this class range from around 45  for most to over 90  for Gilotrif  afatinib  Boehringer Ingelheim  and Nerlynx  neratinib  Puma  more detail below   Moreover  these can be complicating factors for treatment  and GI issues are a major cause of discontinuations  delays and dosage adjustments 




The ongoing clinical study is sponsored by Georgetown University and funded by Genentech  Exhibit 8   The study is examining the use crofelemer for diarrhea in patients undergoing treatment for HER2  breast cancer  Diarrhea is a frequent problem in these patients  driven by both chemotherapy and the available targeted therapies  Herceptin  trastuzumab   7 1bn 2018 sales  is the standard of care for these patients for both induction and adjuvant therapy and is associated with high rates of diarrhea in both settings  This clinical trial will be examining patients treated with Herceptin and Perjeta  pertuzumab   2 8bn 2018 sales   the latter of which typically exacerbates patient diarrhea  66 8  with Perjeta compared to 46 3  with Herceptin and docetaxel alone  The study is expected to have an interim readout on the first 23 patients in Q319  which we believe will inform the direction of the CTD program 
In addition to the above IIT  the product is being tested in another trial sponsored by the University of California San Francisco in collaboration with Puma Biotechnology  but without the participation of Jaguar  Patients in the study will receive Nerlynx as the adjuvant treatment  Nerlynx is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  TKI  that was effective in clinical trials at preventing future metastases  but it is characterized by pervasive and severe diarrhea  95  of patients have some form of diarrhea  40  at grade 3  The Nerlynx label includes a direction to initiate prophylactic loperamide before the first dose  We expect this level of diarrhea to be a major limiting factor on sales of the drug   200m in 2018   as well as potentially limiting future expansion of the drug into other indications 
Additionally the company recently reported top line results from an animal study in dogs that is informative for CTD  The study examined 24 healthy beagles who were given the maximally tolerated dose of a specific undisclosed TKI and 125mg Mytesi twice a day  bid   four times a day  qid   or none at all  placebo   The study used a responder analysis similar to that used in the pivotal trial for HIV associated diarrhea  where responders were counted as dogs with less than seven watery stools per week for at least two weeks out of the 28 day treatment period  Seven of eight dogs in the qid group were responders  p 0 02  as were six of eight in the bid group  p 0 03  compared to three of eight in the placebo arm  Although the study is in dogs  these results are in line with previous studies and suggest that Mytesi may be useful in this particular variety of diarrhea 
The size of the addressable market for CTD will depend on the scope of future clinical study  and this will depend on future feedback from the FDA  The most attractive scenario would be one in which the drug can be tested and approved for diarrhea caused by a broad class of drugs  as opposed to individual cancer indications   We believe that this pathway should be possible considering the approval process for drugs used to treat chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  CINV   Drugs approved for CINV have been approved based on trials centering on groups of treatment regimens instead of certain diseases  One scenario would be if the drug can seek approval for diarrhea secondary to drugs that target the ErbB family  This would also expand the potential indications to other solid tumors such as lung cancer and renal cancer  among others   We estimate that there are over 100 000 person years of drug exposure for these drugs per year  However  the most attractive scenario is one in which the drug would be broadly approved for alleviation of diarrhea secondary to both targeted treatment and chemotherapy  An estimated 650 000 patients in the US undergo chemotherapy each year  and the success of the CINV market highlights the opportunities  The leading CINV drug Emend  aprepitant  Merck  had peak US sales of  356m  with an estimated 149 000 patient years per year 
The company met with the FDA in March 2019 to discuss the clinical trial design for the pivotal study  including discussions of a  basket  study including multiple cancer agents  According to the most recent reports  the company is still finalizing the design with the agency for the anticipated basket label  However  the FDA did agree in the meeting that no additional preclinical safety studies or drug interaction studies were needed and that the product s chemistry  manufacturing and controls  CMC  were sufficient 
Canalevia
The company is also advancing a different crofelemer product for a similar indication in dogs  Canalevia for chemotherapy induced diarrhea  CID   The company announced in June 2019 that it had completed the clinical data for the final technical section of its new animal drug application  NADA  and would be submitting it in Q319  and that these data indicate that the product is potentially also safe in puppies  We expect the primary market for this drug to be dogs undergoing chemotherapy for the treatment of canine lymphoma  which affects 20 100 dogs per 100 000  It is the primary cancer indication in dogs that is not treated surgically and can be well addressed with standard chemotherapies  Chemotherapy is also used post surgically for soft tissue sarcomas  35 122 per 100 000   which may provide an additional market 
The company has also stated that it intends to file for approval of the product for exercise induced diarrhea  EID  in dogs  The company completed safety studies for the program in 2015  The indication is poorly understood and there is limited research into the subject  but it appears that strenuous exercise can lead to immune disturbances that translate into gastrointestinal irritation in some dogs  This has been studied the most extensively in Alaskan sled dogs  where it was seen that dogs had increased frequency of gastric erosions and ulcerations as well as increased intestinal permeability following a race  We expect this indication to be minor compared to CID given its poorly defined nature and intermittent presentation 
The company is seeking approval through the Minor Use and Minor Species Act  MUMS   intended to promote approval of animal drugs that are used in either limited indications or in less prevalent species  It allows drugs to be marketed before all the necessary efficacy data has been collected and allows for post marketing studies to provide this information  The program is modelled on the orphan drug program for human indications  and its structure is fundamentally similar  Canalevia has already received a MUMS designation for CID and the FDA has indicated EID would qualify as a minor use  The company has stated it intends to seek approval and launch the product for CID in 2020 
Other future programs
The company s other human use development programs are not currently in the clinic but it may expand into them depending on resources  All of these programs center on the anti diarrheal activity of the drug  These include potential new indications such as short bowel syndrome  which has orphan drug designation  as well as revising previous programs such as IBS D to build on prior clinical experience  The company has not released specific timing regarding the initiation of any of these proposed studies 




The company s cholera program is different than for other indications because it is being performed with the drug candidate lechlemer instead of crofelemer  Lechlemer is also an extract of the Croton lechleri tree with similar properties to crofelemer and reportedly similar activity  Jaguar decided to use lechlemer instead of crofelemer because it will potentially enable it to receive a priority review voucher  PRV  if the drug is approved for the indication  PRVs are awarded to companies that receive approval for certain classes of disease that the FDA wants to encourage investment in  In this case  cholera is included in the tropical disease PRV program  Only newly approved drugs can receive a PRV  thus excluding crofelemer  After approval  the PRV can be sold to another drug company for a significant amount of money  previous sales have been for between  68m and  350m  and the latest transaction  to our knowledge  was for  105m  GW Pharmaceuticals to an undisclosed company  
Sensitivities
Jaguar faces a set of risks associated with both its commercial operations and future development  The company is commercializing Mytesi internally  which means it must bear the whole cost of its marketing  whereas a larger company could rely on a salesforce established to sell multiple drugs  The company has signed the promotional agreement with RedHill  although the latter is in a similar position as a small biotechnology company marketing a small portfolio of products and the collaboration has not produced any fruit to date  Adding to this is the fact that the marketing problem for Mytesi is particularly complicated because it involves changing certain perceptions with regards to the prevalence  severity and importance of addressing ART associated diarrhea  Campaigns with an educational component such as this can take many years to develop 
The company also faces the unavoidable risk associated with clinical development  The drug is in clinical trials for CTD  although these were not started by Jaguar and therefore may not be designed or executed with the intent of getting approval  Moreover  as with other investigator initiated trials  the scope of these studies is more limited and the drug is only being tested in a small number of clinical sites  If the company choses to progress with the program  we expect pivotal studies to require a substantial number of patients  over 1 000  and carry significant costs 
Finally  the company must raise a substantial amount of capital to cover its marketing and development costs  We estimate that Jaguar will require at least  80m in additional capital to reach profitability in 2024 if the CTD program advances  If the CTD program does not advance  we forecast profitability in 2027 on ART sales alone and an additional expense of  12m  Raising capital to maintain operations could result in substantial dilution and addressing these needs in the past has diluted earlier shareholders  the company started 2019 with 0 9m split adjusted shares and has issued 10m more shares  or equivalents  and 19 5m warrants by August 2019 
The conversion of this debt is ongoing  and we expect further dilution to be very likely  Raising this much capital given the current market capitalization is unlikely to be feasible   80m at  2 00 per share would result in 5x dilution  and if the company cannot either lift its share price substantially  obtain debt financing  or constrain its spending  future operations may be imperiled 
Valuation
We arrive at an initial valuation of  86 5m or  4 14 per diluted share based on a risk adjusted NPV analysis  We include Mytesi for ART and CTD in our valuation as well as Canalevia for canine CID 
The majority of our valuation is driven by the ART program  for which we forecast  74 1m in peak sales in 2031 at a penetration of 12   We assume relatively low penetration given the availability of effective generic and OTC alternatives  We estimate an addressable market of approximately 70 000 individuals in the US who have HIV  are diagnosed  adherent and have non infectious diarrhea  We assume a conservative 2  price growth per year  from the current  668 per month   and a 20  gross to net sales discount  COGS for Mytesi have historically been high at approximately 50   although we see this improving progressively with volume to 25   We also assume  6m in S M overhead and 10  marketing expenses  Our model also includes revenue from the Knight agreement to market in Canada and Israel  We assume a transfer price of 50  of COGS and  13m  of a possible  18m  in milestones  We assume Knight will begin commercialization in these geographies in 2021  Our discount rate is 10   which is our standard for approved products 
Of the company s proposed development programs  we include CTD because it is the only program with ongoing clinical studies  albeit studies not initiated by the company  If the ongoing IIT studies are positive  we expect Jaguar to initiate pivotal studies in 2020  We expect a pivotal trial for CTD approval to be large with over 1 100 patients  based on previous approvals for CINV   but this is mitigated by a low per patient cost of  10 000 as we expect timelines to be quick as in previous studies  Our model assumes the drug will be approved broadly for CTD  including patients on chemotherapy  as opposed to exclusively patients receiving TKIs or other ErbB inhibitors   We model approval in 2022 with similar pricing  COGS  etc  to the ART diarrhea program  We model lower S M overhead for this program   5m  as we expect there to be fewer headwinds convincing physicians of the importance of addressing this indication  Our probability of success for this program is 30   which is our standard probability for programs in Phase II  We may also adjust this parameter based on the indication targeted for pivotal trials  Our discount rate is 12 5   which is our standard for products in development 
We also include Canalevia for canine CID with lymphoma and STS as initial indications  We model pricing of  67 per month given the increased pricing pressure in the cash pay veterinary market  Our probability of success for this program is 60  based on the stage and would be higher if we could evaluate the efficacy data being provided to the agency as part of the NADA 
Each of these indications is modelled to 2031  when the product s Orange Book patents expire  Although there is not a pathway to develop generics for botanical drugs such as crofelemer  given the agency s focus on removing barriers to generic drug development  we expect it to facilitate market entrants in that event  We also only model Jaguar marketing these products in the US as we believe anything else is beyond the company s capacity short of partnerships such as those with Knight 




We also include a line item for unallocated costs to offset cash flow associated with corporate overhead and other factors  This negative NPV of  34 6m is driven primarily by high G A expenses of approximately  12m per year  We may adjust this in the future if the company institutes cost controlling measures 
Financials
The company recently underwent a major effort to recapitalize and eliminate a portion of its debt  This process took approximately six months to complete following the end of 2018 and involved multiple elements 
The conversion of  5 1m in debt through the issuance of 0 8m shares through exchange agreements with its lender Chicago Venture Partners  CVP A  16 5m registered direct offering  2 9m common shares and 10 787 preferred shares convertible to 5 4m common shares  priced at  2 00 per common share or equivalent and carrying 200  warrant coverage  at a  2 00 exercise price The issuance of  5 05m in bridge notes accompanied by warrants for the purchase of  2 8m shares  at  2 00    3 6m in bridge notes have been reported to have been repaid to dateA 1 70 reverse split in June 2019 The process has resulted in substantial dilution to the company s shares  It ended 2018 with the equivalent of 0 9m split adjusted shares  which has increased to 10 9m common shares or equivalent in convertible preferred shares as of August 2019  Moreover  the company has issued 19 2m warrants so dilution will likely continue  Including these dilutive securities  this corresponds to a dilution of 97  in the past eight months  In addition to the above bridge notes  the company ended the quarter with  7 8m in notes  10  maturing December 2020   of which  1 1m has subsequently been converted to stock under exchange agreements  The elimination of this remaining debt may result in further dilution 
We expect the company to require substantial additional capital to deliver on its development plans  We forecast that the company will need no less than  80m in additional capital to deliver on its current development plants and reach profitability in 2024  We include this as debt for illustrative purposes in our forecasts   30m each in 2020 and 2021  and  20m in 2022  However  if the company finances these costs through equity  we would expect substantial further dilution 
The company reported revenue of  1 7m for Q219  roughly flat on a sequential basis   1 6m Q119   but almost doubled  up 92   year on year  The revenue is almost entirely attributable to Mytesi  with a small portion from sales of its Neonorm products   21 000   Operational expenses were similar to previous periods and dominated by G A   3 2m versus  1 7m for R D and  2 2m for S M  The loss reported for the period was  16 7m  which is not necessarily representative as it includes  6 5m in non cash charges associated with the company s refinancing and a  4m write down on its intangible assets  for undisclosed reasons   We expect the reported loss in 2020 to be lower   28 5m  due to fewer non cash charges  but for there to be  22 9m negative cash flow for the year ",2019-08-27,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/jaguar-health-a-different-angle-on-an-old-problem-200458865,200458865

147285,368801,BHC,Short   distort  The ugly war between CEOs and activist critics,news,"By Lawrence Delevingne NEW YORK  Reuters    On the morning of July 11  Paul Pittman was on a corn farm in Western Illinois  unaware his company had taken a devastating hit  Just before the stock market opened  an anonymous short seller named  Rota Fortunae  posted on Twitter and financial website Seeking Alpha that Pittman s small real estate investment trust  Farmland Partners Inc  had engaged in dubious transactions and risked  insolvency    The posting pushed shares down enough to make thousands of previously purchased stock options profitable  according to a later expert analysis  in turn causing more selling by those on the other side of the trade who committed to buy shares at a higher set price  The accelerating losses were probably compounded by high frequency trading algorithms activated by price swings and negative keywords  according to that analysis  Pittman s stomach churned when he checked his smartphone around noon  Shares were off almost 40 percent   Graphic     The game was rigged   Pittman  56  told Reuters  What followed exemplified a new  ugly phase in a war between companies and activist short sellers  with businesses fighting back against social media fueled attacks and investors accusing executives of trying to muzzle critics  Farmland sued Rota Fortunae   Latin for  wheel of fortune    and other unnamed individuals alleging a  malicious scheme  to profit from the spread of false information and well timed stock options  The short seller  a Texas based individual whose identity has been kept secret  sent a statement to Reuters via an attorney that the litigation aimed to  intimidate and choke critical opinion  and that the idea of crashing the stock through  sophisticated trading  was  utter hogwash   It is all under the watch of the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  which has been briefed on the matter  The stand off reflects a broader debate over how to balance the desire to keep public companies accountable with concerns over market manipulation   Short selling  said to be as old as stock markets  used to be a low profile affair where bearish investors relied on the media  analysts or regulators to take the lead in exposing over valued companies  New tools such as Twitter and Seeking Alpha changed that  creating a small but prominent group of brash public activists  Successful campaigns that exposed corporate fraud or dubious practices  including Carson Block s Sino Forest Corp takedown and Andrew Left s shorting of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE BHC   underscored short sellers  role as market watchdogs  Such victories  coupled with elevated stock valuations  helped spur record numbers of short campaigns  according to industry tracker Activist Insight  Activist Insight data show such campaigns can have a noticeable impact on stock prices  A 2017 working paper by researchers Yu Ting Forester Wong and Wuyang Zhao also showed they weigh on target companies  investments  dividends and access to financing  Block  Left and other prominent short sellers interviewed by Reuters say they do thorough research and help keep companies honest  Yet targeted businesses say many short campaigns waged this decade amount to  short and distort  schemes  They accuse some activists of spreading false or misleading information to drive a stock down and then quickly cash out  a mirror image of  pump and dump   where unscrupulous investors promote speculative stocks before selling out at the top   Cases against short sellers are rare  though  given free speech protections and companies hesitant to put themselves under the microscope of regulators  lawyers say   SHORT IDEAS AND OPTIONS Recent research provides fresh fodder for the debate  Columbia Law School securities expert Joshua Mitts said in a working paper that he had looked at 1 720 pseudonymous short idea posts on Seeking Alpha between 2010 and 2017 and found that 86 percent were preceded by  extraordinary  options trading  Mitts told Reuters his review of the posts found that  like with Farmland  many short sellers appeared to use fast expiring put options bought before the release of a report to spur more selling by underwriters   Shorts have to rely on good research  not trading tricks  to punish a stock   said Mitts  whose work has led to paid consulting for Farmland and other companies   He has also found other unusual trading patterns  including dozens of cases of  spoofing  and  layering   illegal trading strategies of placing and canceling orders to create a false impression of demand or supply  Mitts said  however  that high frequency traders were probably responsible  not activists  Prominent activists deny engaging in practices described by Mitts and say they rarely use options  Instead  they would typically borrow stocks and immediately sell them in anticipation of a price drop  so they can buy them back for less and pocket the difference   I m sure there are a few anonymous guys out there doing tricky stuff  but it s not a systemic problem   Left said   One smaller short seller said he used put options in conjunction with Seeking Alpha posts to make larger bets given limited capital  but emphasized making unfounded claims could backfire   With options you can get totally destroyed   said the investor  who requested anonymity   A bad thesis can be debunked almost instantly   Activist Insight  which has analyzed hundreds of campaigns  found many cases where target share prices went up  not down   So far Mitts is virtually alone in analyzing trading activity around short campaigns  but his findings have already drawn the attention of a top U S  regulator  SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson told Reuters the research was  important  and challenged his agency to  identify folks who are dancing a very fine line between trading and market manipulation    The question  Jackson said  was whether the regulator would go after short sellers who engage in fraud as forcefully as it investigates companies for bad behavior   I hope the answer to that question will be yes   A hint came last September  when the SEC brought a rare  short and distort  case against hedge fund manager Gregory Lemelson for making false claims about Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc  an allegation which Lemelson has denied   Jackson said  however  laws on anonymity and free speech could limit any steps that went beyond straightforward cases involving false information  On March 12  for example  a New York state judge dismissed a lawsuit against short sellers by Indian media company Eros International PLC  noting their opinions on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere were substantiated and therefore protected  Still  companies are increasingly retaliating with lawsuits  hiring private investigators and using other aggressive tactics  according to some activists  Block  for example  said he has faced  constant  legal threats  at least one undercover operative  and a failed  50 million investigation to discredit his research    More than ever  bad companies are trying to shoot the messenger through any means available   Block said  FARM WAR In the days after Rota s post  Farmland issued a public rebuttal and Pittman  a former farmer and financial executive  said the company had to go on an   I am not a crook  tour  in meetings and calls with investors and business partners   Most were sympathetic  Pittman said  including farmers who had traded land for stock  but Farmland lost a potential partnership and had to cut staff from 17 to 13  George Moriarty  executive editor of Seeking Alpha  said that courts have respected the site s status as a neutral platform and that its staff vetted all posts  In this case  Rota made  limited factual corrections  after Seeking Alpha contacted him about Farmland s rebuttal  Still  shares have never quite recovered  and Rota told Reuters that Farmland has yet to substantively address his concerns   Stock analysts said Rota s language was dramatic relative to the underlying issues and instead focused on broader business challenges and the potential costs of fighting back  Farmland recently reported about  1 6 million in extra expenses over 2018  before insurance  citing Rota s campaign  That included defending against a related shareholder class action and legal costs from its suit against the short seller  Mitts has submitted his opinion on put options in the case  a pattern he said he discovered independently during his academic research   The short seller behind the Rota moniker told Reuters he planned to challenge Mitts  assertions and would continue his defense of first amendment rights  Farmland s lawyers said Rota s free speech argument was undercut by his acknowledgement of payments received for research on Farmland  Whatever happens in court  the SEC is watching  Rota submitted his Farmland analysis to the agency s whistleblower hotline  while Farmland later briefed SEC staff on its side  
The SEC declined to comment  but on Jan  29 it denied Farmland s request for records on Rota and options trading because  according to a letter revealed in a court filing  related information was in an  investigative file  from an  on going law enforcement proceeding  ",2019-03-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/short--distort-the-ugly-war-between-ceos-and-activist-critics-1813828,1813828

147304,368820,BHC,Aerie  AERI  Q1 Earnings Beat  Rhopressa Misses Estimates,opinion,"Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ AERI   are trading down 5 4  after the company reported mixed results for the first quarter  The company reported a loss of 78 cents in the first quarter 2019  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 91 cents and the year ago loss of 83 cents 
Aerie s stock has gained 6  in the year so far compared with the  s growth of 8 3  

 
In December 2017  Rhopressa was approved by the FDA for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  The drug was launched by the end of April 2018 
Rhopressa s revenues came in at  10 9 million in the quarter  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  12 7 million 
Quarter in Detail
Rhopressa revenues reflect a higher proportion of Medicare Part D rebates which are steeper than commercial rebates 
In the reported quarter  research and development expenses increased to  17 9 million from  13 million in the year ago quarter  Selling  general and administrative expenses surged to  36 3 million from  22 9 million in the year ago quarter 
Rhopressa now has preferred brand Tier 2 market access for approximately 75  of lives covered under Medicare Part D plans  Rhopressa also has approximately 90  of lives covered under commercial plans  including 55  in preferred brand Tier 2 and 35  in Tier 3 
Pipeline Updates
In Mar 2019  Aerie announced that the FDA has approved Rocklatan 0 02  0 005  to reduce elevated intraocular pressure  IOP  in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  Rocklatan is a once daily  quadruple action fixed dose combination of Rhopressa  netarsudil  and Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Xalatan  latanoprost  
A phase III trial  Mercury 3  on Rocklatan continues to progress in Europe 
Aerie s retina program   AR 13503  Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor implant  and AR 1105  dexamethasone steroid implant  continues to advance as well  The IND  Investigational New Drug application  for AR 13503  Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor implant  was accepted by the FDA  last month  Clinical trials are expected to begin in the second quarter of 2019 for wet age related macular degeneration and DME  diabetic macular edema  
In March 2019  a phase II study was initiated on AR 1105 for macular edema due to RVO  retinal vein occlusion   Safety and efficacy data for AR 1105 will be evaluated at six months after dosing 
2019 Guidance
Aerie reiterated its annual guidance  The company expects full year 2019 net revenues in the range of  110 million to  120 million 
Our Take
Aerie reported mixed results for the fourth quarter  Rhopressa sales miss estimates due to higher rebates  Nevertheless  the approval of second drug  Rocklatan is a big boost for the company and should propel sales in the coming quarters even though competition is stiff from the likes of Bausch Health s   NYSE BHC   Vyzulta  among others 
Zacks Rank   Another Key Pick
Aerie currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A better ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Bristol Myers Squibb   NYSE BMY     which sports a Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Bristol Myers  earnings per share estimates have increased from  4 76 to  4 93 for 2020 in the past 60 days

147319,368835,BHC,Bausch  BHC  Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates  Revenues Down Y Y ,opinion,"Bausch Health Companies Inc    NYSE BHC   reported better than expected results for the fourth quarter of 2018  The company s adjusted earnings per share of  1 05 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 88 but was down from  1 98 reported in the year ago quarter 
Total revenues of  2 12 billion also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 09  but was down 2  from the year ago quarter s figure 
Quarter in Detail 
Revenues in the Bausch   Lomb   International segment were  1 2 billion  approximately flat with the year ago quarter s figure  primarily due to divestitures and discontinuations  Excluding the impact of discontinuations and divestitures  the Bausch   Lomb International segment organically improved approximately 5   The increase was primarily due to higher volumes despite a planned channel inventory reduction of  10 million in the Global Ophtho Rx business 
Salix segment revenues came in at  426 million  roughly flat year over year as 12  growth in Xifaxan was offset by a planned channel inventory reduction of  47 million and generic competition following the loss of exclusivity for Uceris 
Ortho Dermatologics segment revenues were  165 million  down 2  year over year due to lower volumes  This was partially offset by 32  revenue growth in the Global Solta business  
Diversified Products segment revenues were  325 million  down 11  from the year ago quarter  primarily due to the impact of divestitures and discontinuations 
2018 Results
Revenues came in at  8 4 million  which was down 4  from 2017 but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 34 billion  Earnings of  4 01 also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 81 
2019 Guidance
Revenues are expected between  8 30 billion and  8 50 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is  8 51 billion 
Our Take
Bausch s performance in the fourth quarter was encouraging  After a tumultuous period  Bausch started a rebuilding process  The company also changed its name  Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process  Bausch s efforts to sell non core assets and pay down huge levels of debt are commendable  The company recorded 1  organic growth in 2018 and reduced debt by more than  1 billion  Bausch repaid  400 million of debt in the fourth quarter of 2018 
The Bausch   Lomb International segment registered 4  organic growth in 2018  driven by volume growth across all segments  The company recently announced that a subsidiary of Bausch Health acquired the U S  rights to Eton Pharmaceuticals    NASDAQ ETON   EM 100  an experimental eye drop  EM 100 has been submitted to the FDA for review  Upon approval  the eye drop will be the first over the counter  OTC  preservative free formulation eye drop for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis 
Bausch s stock has gained 32 8  in the year so far compared with growth of 10 2  for the  

 
Bausch s Salix business continues to drive growth and contribute to the top line  In particular  increased sales of Xiaflex and Relistor are boosting the segment   However  the dermatology market is challenging 
While the guidance for 2019 wasn t that impressive  we do expect momentum to pick up  Bausch has narrowed focus on seven recently launched or expected to be launched products pending completion of testing and receipt of FDA approval  The company launched 10 key products during 2018  including two copromotions  Four of the Significant Seven products were launched during 2018 and the company expects a decision from the FDA on Duobrii shortly 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Bausch currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Some better ranked stocks in the healthcare sector include Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   and GlaxoSmithKline plc   NYSE GSK    both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

147320,368836,BHC,Is Bausch Health Companies  BHC  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bausch Health Companies Inc    NYSE BHC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bausch Health Companies has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 4  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Bausch Health Companies  current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint  which is 5 9  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 7 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Bausch Health Companies has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 5 9  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future     P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Bausch Health Companies has a P S ratio of about 0 9  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bausch Health Companies currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BHC a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Bausch Health Companies is just 0 3  a level that is considerably lower than the industry average of 1 1  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 1 9  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 4 6  Clearly  BHC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Bausch Health Companies might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A  This gives BHC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and two lower  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen 4 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 3 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bausch Health Cos Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBausch Health Companies is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 41  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Top 10 Stocks for 2019In

147352,368868,BHC,Is Bausch Health  BHC  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Bausch Health Cos Inc    NYSE BHC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Bausch Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 5 9  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 5x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Bausch Health s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 8 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Bausch Health has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 6 6  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Bausch Health has a P S ratio of about 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  BHC is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Bausch Health currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Bausch Health a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Bausch Health might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives ANIP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been upbeat  The current quarter has seen four estimates go upper  while two lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen seven up and no down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 7 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 10 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Bausch Health Cos Inc  Price and Consensus
     This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineBausch Health is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 26  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Bausch Health Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ",2018-11-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-bausch-health-bhc-a-great-stock-for-value-investors-200361107,200361107

Review 
Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question  Are You Out Of Your Comfort Zone  We reviewed how traders must adapt to changing market conditions rather than sticking to old trading methods that were once profitable  but are now destructive  If you missed it  a glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant 
This Week  Do You Trade the 50 Day Moving Average 
The following chart shows the S P 500 basically skipped along the top of its 50 day moving average for most of the last year 

And the same is largely true for the NASDAQ 

This basic technical trading indicator  50 day moving average  is used by so many market participants that it often serves as a magnet  and then support or resistance  However  when something sends the market through this level  many stops are often triggered  thereby increasing the market move  For example  here is a look at the S P 500 over the last week 

The market was down moderately on Wednesday of this week  Feb 28th   but then collapsed around the 50 day moving average  Regarding such market moves  our models do not anticipate down moves  but do exit in time to avoid the big losses  According to an  from Morningstar earlier this week  active management has most of its advantages in down markets 
Another advantage of our models is when our performance is staying even with the markets  our returns still have a significantly low correlation  which is powerful for risk management purposes  it helps keep volatility lower  
Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we re continuing to share the performance of our trading models  This week we have extended the performance reporting back further  to 12 months 

Important to note  we find that blending a trend following   momentum model  Athena  with a mean reversion   dip buying model  Holmes  provides two strategies  effective in their own right  that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market  By combining the two  we can get more diversity  lower risk  and a smoother string of returns 
And for these reasons  I am changing the  Trade with Jeff  offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50 50 split between Holmes and Athena  Current participants have already agreed to this  Since our costs on Athena are lower  we have also lowered the fees for the combination

Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger 
Holmes  This week I like Wayfair  NYSE W   I purchased shares on 2 23 when the price was down  Are you familiar with this stock 
Blue Harbinger  Yes  Holmes I am familiar  Wayfair basically sells all kinds of stuff online  both domestically and internationally  through a variety of websites  The company is not profitable  but sales and the stock price have both been growing rapidly  especially over the last year  For your reference  here is a look at the Fast Graph 

Holmes  That is interesting information  but I like the shares because I am a  dip buyer   and Wayfair s dip over the last week is the sort of set up I like to see  From the chart below  you can see it is below its 50 day moving average  and it has attractive upside over the next six weeks 

BH  That dip is because the market didn t especially like the company s latest earnings announcement  The share price seems to be bouncing off the 200 day moving average though  What do you have to say about that Holmes 
Holmes  I am aware of the 200 day and 50 day moving averages  I typically hold my position for about 6 weeks  so why don t you check back in with me on this one then 
BH  Sure  How about you  Road Runner what have you got for us this week 
Road Runner  I bought CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  on 2 28  How do you like that one 
BH  Yikes  Really  You bought a stock with a 12 4  dividend yield  Isn t that a bit of a red flag for you  Holmes  I m worried you re doing what I often refer to as  yield chasing  
RR  I m not investing in this stock for the dividend  I typically hold for only about four weeks  And you know this  BH we discuss it almost every week  I like to buy stocks at the low end of a rising channel  as shown for CTL in the following chart 

BH  Well  the telecom business is capital intensive  which could create challenges in our current rising interest rate environment  Plus its share price is down 50  in the last 5 years  Here is a look at the Fast Graph 

RR  Again  4 weeks is my typical holding period  I like the setup on this one  Check back with me then 
BH  Fine  How about you Felix what have you got for us 
Felix  I sold my Valeant  NYSE VRX  shares on 2 26  I purchased them back on 5 8 17 

BH  Looks like it was a bumpy ride  but you mad money  And based on the performance table earlier in this report  it looks like you ve been making a lot of money over the last year  Felix 
Felix  Thanks for noticing  My momentum strategy has been in style  Check out the performance of momentum stocks versus other styles over the last year  in this table as of February month end 

BH  Interesting data  Felix  thanks for sharing 
Felix  I also ran the Russell 2000 small cap index stocks through my model this week  and I m sharing my top 20 in the following ranking 

BH  I see Mulesoft NYSE MULE  on your list  It s a small cap cloud Software as a Service company with tremendous growth and a lot of room to run  I ve been keeping an eye on that one  Anyway  how about you Oscar what have you got for us this week 
Oscar  This week I ran the diverse and comprehensive ETF universe through my model  and I m sharing my top 20 rankings in the following table 

BH  I see U S  Oil USO on your list  But I thought you were a momentum trader  Oscar  Isn t oil down  I know the energy sector is way down based on the table Felix shared earlier 
Oscar  Yes I am a momentum trader  I typically hold for about 6 weeks  and yes oil is down  but it has started to rebound already after its big decline in early February 
BH  Interesting that oil is rebounding but the energy sector is not  But I suppose part of that is news from the new Fed chair that this latest batch of market volatility won t stop the Fed from raising interest rates  A lot of energy companies rely heaviliy on debt to fund growth  and higher rates means more expensive growth 
Conclusion 
The simple 50 day moving average is a popular guidepost and risk indicator for many technical traders  As long as the market stays close  things have been calm  but when it breaks through  stop orders kick in  and market conditions can become increasingly volatile  Our active models don t anticipate down moves  but they do avoid the biggest losses  Another advantage of our models are their blended approach  which helps generate strong returns with a lower market correlation something very valuable for volatility reduction purposes

147403,368919,BHC,Valeant  VRX  Touches 52 Week High  Is The Stock Officially Back ,opinion,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals   NYSE VRX   surged more than 2  higher on Wednesday morning  touching a new 52 week high in the process  The embattled pharma stock continues to polarize investors  but its recent recovery is starting to gain momentum  As we approach the New Year  it is time to ask  is Valeant officially back 
Shares are still a long way from their highs of mid 2015  but the stock has climbed about 90  since the beginning of November  Valeant s run comes as investors gear up for the company to begin sales of its new glaucoma treatment  Vyzulta  which should start this month Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc  Price and Consensus   
 
According to analysts surveyed by   Vyzulta is projected to generate about  174 million of revenue by 2021  while the company s new ocular redness treatment  Luminesse  is expected to bring in about  38 million that year 
On top of Vyzulta and Luminesse  Valeant should benefit from sales of other new drugs  such as Siliq  a psoriasis medication  and IDP 118  a topical lotion that is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration 
Valeant has languished near  14 per share for most of the year  At those levels  new drug approvals attracted the attention of value investors  including Dimensional Fund Advisors LP  which more than tripled its stake in the pharma firm during the third quarter 
But Wall Street analysts remain lukewarm on both the stock and the company s near term prospects  The average analyst price target for VRX still sits at just  17  and earnings estimates for the upcoming fiscal year are not looking great 
Based on our latest consensus estimates  we expect Valeant to report full year earnings of  3 59 per share in 2018  That figure would represent a 7  slump from this year s projected full year profits  which are expected to be down about 30  
Valeant is finally starting to rebound  but investors should not expect volatility to disappear  However  the stock could be attractive to buy and hold investors looking to cash in on the company s new drugs somewhere down the line

147407,368923,BHC,20 High Yield Bonds Selling Off  These 3 Are Worth Considering,opinion,"High yield bonds can be an attractive source of income and capital appreciation  Their prices are often driven more by company specific idiosyncrasies than by macroeconomic interest rate risks  And depending on your situation  they can be a valuable addition to a diversified investment portfolio  This report highlights 20 high yield bonds that are down big  and then reviews 3 specific bonds that we believe are worth considering 
The Market Rover is all about idea generation  Each week we screen the market  focusing on a different investment theme  in search of interesting investment opportunities  We then highlight a few of our favorites from the list  This report is intended to be a resource for investment idea generation 
This Week  
20 High Yield Bonds Down Big  These 3 Are Worth Considering   
Considering interest rates remain very low by historical standards  and they re also rising not good for bond prices   many investors have been focusing almost entirely on healthy dividend paying stocks with some capital appreciation potential  or at least less volatility and less downside risk than many non dividend paying stocks   However  many investors often completely overlook high yield bonds which can offer not only high yields but also significant capital appreciation opportunities  when they re trading at a discount   To be clear  high yield bonds are generally riskier that low yield bonds  that s why the yields are high   but not always  the rating agencies are often reactive in their ratings  not proactive   plus high yield bonds can often offer asymmetric return opportunities that are skewed in your favor 
For your consideration  here is a list of 20 high yield bonds that are currently trading at discounted prices and offer interesting return opportunities 

Also for your consideration  here are three bonds from the list that we currently find very interesting 
1  CBL   Associates  NYSE CBL  2023 Bonds  Yield  7 5 
CBL is a retail shopping mall REIT  and it is one of those  battleground  equity ideas where investors argue passionately on both the  buy  and  sell  sides of the isle  For example  bull Rida Morwa and his team have been beating the table for months about the attractiveness of CBL equity  and    We have no interest in owning CBL s 16 8  dividend yield equity  but the bonds are interesting to us 
What s interesting to us about the bonds  is that despite all the turmoil in the equity space  CBL equity is down about 80  in the last 5 years   the bonds have held up relatively well until the last week whereby they ve just finally sold off  they currently trade at around 90 cents on the dollar as shown in the following chart  

CBL announced dismal earnings earlier this month and the equity sold off again  and importantly Moody s just finally  to  junk  status  However  per managements earnings call  when asked about debt covenants  CFO Farzana Khaleel explained 

We still have plenty of room  The lines of credit  similarly  we have plenty of room  So I don t   when we do add   when we pay off a loan and added to the unencumbered pool  it gives us more capacity  So I don t necessarily think that we have any concern that we are hitting any of these metrics
Yes  Our debt level has come down  We re at  4 7 billion  A year ago  we were at  4 9 billion  So yes 
For 2018  the debt number will come down by the fact that we ll give back Acadiana Malls  that s  125 million  And amortization brings the debt level down  So it does come down  yes  And it will continue to go down  particularly with the amortization  We have all  50 million in amortization each year 

In our view  CBL debt is now very interesting after the credit rating downgrade  finally   the recent sell off  a lot of institutions must sell when a bond falls below investment grade  thereby contributing to the recent sell off   and management s continued focus on improving  Said differently  these bonds offer an attractive yield and may actually have more upside potential than down at this point  These bonds are worth considering  and we are watching them closely 
2  Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  2022 Bonds  Yield  4 9  
Teva develops and markets generic and specialty medicines  it offers a 4 1  dividend yield  and the stock price is down about 70  in the last 30 months  The company has struggled in recent years considering it s had some pipeline missteps  its branded segment is shrinking  and it faces a lot of low cost competition  However the bonds are interesting 

With only a 2 95  coupon  the yield on these bonds has currently risen to over 4 9  as the price has fallen  as shown in the above chart  However  despite the decline  there are reasons to believe this company will improve  and bondholders will continue to receive coupon payments and capital appreciation as the bond price will eventually recover to par  it traded over par as recently as mid 2017  
For example  just a few days ago we received news that Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  has taken a position in the equity  which caused the equity share price to jump significantly  
And aside from Buffett  Teva does have continuing strong revenues  and opportunities to improve its debt and earnings via its large operating scale and resources  According to CEO Kaare Schultz during last week s earnings call 

 we re deleveraging and reducing our debt on an ongoing basis  

We suspect the bonds are far safer than their discounted price suggests 
3  Energy Transfer Equity  NYSE ETE  2023 Bonds  Yield  4 9 
If you re not comfortable with the risks of owning shares of Energy Transfer Equity  you might consider the lower risk bonds  currently offering a 4 9  yield and trading at a discounted 97 cents on the dollar  these bonds were trading at a premium earlier this year  

The company owns interests in energy assets  crude oil  natural gas  natural gas liquids  through 100  ownership interests in Energy Transfer Partners  ETP  and Energy Transfer LNG 
The bonds sold off modestly this year as the market sold off and after a negative article is the Wall Street Journal on February 8th   
Why Tax Law Likely Means Lower Revenue for Pipeline Operators 
We believe fears and the sell off are overblown with regards to the equity and especially with regards to the debt sell off  Even the article itself suggested Energy Transfer Equity would be less affected than other companies  per the following graphic 

In our view  these 2023 bonds are safer than their 4 9  yield suggests  the fears are overblown  and the recent sell off creates an attractive discounted price for new fixed income buyers to consider

Technical Trading Ideas  Stock Exchange
In addition to fundamentals  we pay attention to short term technical indicators when entering new positions  For example  Valeant was on our list of 20 bonds above  and it s one we follow from both a debt and equity standpoint  For more information on Valeant s recent stock price technicals  check out Jeff Miller s Stock Exchange report from this week  Were You Stopped Out  We edit this report for Jeff  and Valeant s stock was covered this week  We also have more to say about Valeant s bonds later in this report 
More Perspective on the Market 
Outside of Blue Harbinger  we manage investment accounts for individuals and institutions  And these in person interactions often provide very good perspective for the things we write about at Blue Harbinger  For example  here is the feedback we gave to a long term investor a week ago when asked about the sharp market sell off 

 The market did have the biggest volatility in years over the last few days  When that happens  a lot of people try to get clever with their  buys  and  sells   and that s when a lot of costly mistakes get made  People often end up selling everything and then they miss out on the subsequent rebound  You guys are back in the positive  and the best thing to do is remember you re in it for the long term  and you re going to do better than all the dummies that sold everything out of fear yesterday  

In our view  the perspective provided in the above quote also corroborates well with the technical trading article referenced earlier  Were You Stopped Out   
Case Study  Valeant  NYSE VRX  Bonds
Valeant bonds were among the 20 ideas listed in the table earlier in this report  We also covered Valeant s equity  briefly  from a technical standpoint  as described earlier in this report  i e Were You Stopped Out    However  we believe the strong performance of Valeant s bonds over the last year is a good case study 

For example  we contribute research and portfolio management services to a private investment vehicle  and Valeant bonds have been one of the more interesting investment ideas within that fund  as described in this Barron s video and this CNBC video  More specifically  the videos provide some very good ideas about what to look for when investing in high yield bonds 
Conclusion 
High yield bonds are risky  And they are not for everyone  However  if you re interested in wading into this space  there are some very interesting opportunities to pick up attractive yield  and price appreciation  with risk versus reward profiles that are often skewed in your favor ",2018-02-19,Blue Harbinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-rover-20-high-yield-bonds-sellingoff-these-3-are-worth-considering-200291648,200291648

147425,368941,BHC,Valeant  VRX  Earnings And Revenues Beat In Q3  Stock Up,opinion,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc    NYSE VRX   rallied 23 6  after the company reported better than expected third quarter results on Nov 7 

Notably  Valeant s stock has increased 26 7  in the last six months compared with the  loss of 2 2  
The company s adjusted earnings per share of  1 04 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents but was down from  1 46 per share in the year ago quarter 
However  total revenues of  2 21 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 17 billion but declined 10 5  from the year ago quarter  The decrease was primarily attributed to declining volumes in the Diversified Products in the United States and Branded Rx segments due to the loss of exclusivity for a basket of products 
The fall in revenues can also be blamed upon the discontinuations of divestitures and unfavorable foreign exchange  The decline was partially offset by increased sales in the Bausch   Lomb International segment and Salix business Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc  Price and Consensus
 

   Quarter in Detail
Revenues in the Bausch   Lomb   International segment were  1 2 billion  up 1  year over year  Excluding the impact of discontinuation of divestitures  primarily the skin care divestiture  and foreign exchange  the Bausch   Lomb International segment organically grew by approximately 6  year over year driven by increased volumes in the global Consumer  International and Global Vision Care businesses 
The Branded Rx segment revenues were  633 million  down 17  due to a decrease in sales which primarily reflects lower volumes in the Ortho Dermatologics business and the loss of sales due to the divestiture of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  This was partially offset by increased sales in Salix  
The U S  Diversified Products segment revenues were  332 million  down 29 4  year over year due to decreases in volume and price attributed to the previously reported loss of exclusivity for a basket of products 
Research and development expenses were  81 million in the reported quarter  down 19 8  from the year ago quarter 
Selling  General and Administrative costs were  623 million compared with  661 million in the year ago quarter 
During the quarter  the company received clearance for the Thermage FLX System to non invasively smooth skin on the face  eyes and body  Earlier  the company received the FDA filing acceptance for the NDA for Plenvu  NER1006   a novel  low volume polyethylene glycol based bowel preparation for colonoscopies  The FDA also approved its new psoriasis treatment  Siliq and the drug has been launched  The company had an agreement with AstraZeneca plc   NYSE AZN   for Siliq but the agreement has been amended 
2017 Guidance
The company expects total revenues in the range of  8 65  8 80 billion  down from  8 70  8 90 billion projected earlier  The updated guidance reflects the impact of the sales of the CeraVe  AcneFree and AMBI skin care brands  the sale of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  the sale of the iNova Pharmaceuticals business  and the sale of the Obagi Medical Products business  which is expected to close before the end of this year 
Our Take
Although third quarter results were encouraging  the company trimmed its guidance due to recent divestitures  After a tumultuous period  Valeant started a rebuilding process with its CEO  Joseph C  Papa  Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process  but the company s efforts to sell non core assets and pay down huge levels of debt is commendable and should bode well in the upcoming quarters  As of Nov 7  2017  the company has reduced total debt by approximately  6 billion since the end of first quarter 2016 
The company is also divesting Sprout Pharmaceuticals and ADDYI businesses 
The Bausch   Lomb International segment and Salix businesses are doing well  In particular  uptake of Xifaxan and the launch of Relistor tablets drove prescription growth by 61   New drug approvals are also expected to boost growth and offset the weakness in the dermatology segment  The FDA recently approved Vyzulta for open angle glaucoma  Meanwhile  pricing in the dermatology business is beginning to stabilize 
Zacks Rank   Key Picks
Valeant currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

147451,368967,BHC,Why Did Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  Stock Fall Today ,opinion,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals   NYSE VRX   fell more than 7  in morning trading Tuesday  following a key analyst s warning that the struggling company still has  numerous weaknesses  in its business 
In a cautious note to clients today  Mizuho s Irina Koffler highlighted her concerns about Valeant s second quarter investor presentation and lowered her price target for the stock to  7 from  8 
 Our valuation relies in part on SOTP analysis and we note that EBITA margins in the Diversified segment dropped from  81  in 2016 to 73  YTD  This business remains very critical to Valeant and in 2Q 17 Diversified revenue declined 27 3  Y Y   Koffler wrote 
 Our other main takeaways from the detailed 2Q 17 slides are that the company divested a number of its remaining 2Q 17 growth drivers within B L International  Dendreon  and Obagi  leaving behind less attractive businesses  
Despite surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an impressive 8 25  in the most recent quarter  Valeant still has a massive pile of debt to be worried about  The company has already pared down its debt by about  4 8 billion and looks to be on its way to easily hit its  5 billion target  but as Koffler notes  this could be at the expense of key growth drivers 
Ultimately  Koffler reiterated her  Underperform  rating on Valeant   We expect Valeant to miss its 2017 revenue and EBITDA guidance  and FactSet consensus 2018 estimates still appear too high   she concluded 
Koffler s hesitant note comes just a few days after the news that Valeant might be facing another legal battle  Last week  mutual fund company Lord Abbett   Co  filed a securities fraud lawsuit against Valeant  alleging that it was sold the company s debt securities at an artificially inflated price based on misleading information provided by Valeant 
Valeant has set aside about  162 million to handle its legal troubles  but with Lord Abbett seeking up to  80 billion in damages and with Justice Department and regulatory investigations looming it looks like the company may have underestimated its challenges 
Still  Valeant remains a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and currently sports an overall VGM grade of  B

147452,368968,BHC,The Fallacy Of Value Investing  With Neil Woodford ,opinion,"This week  star London based fund manager Neil Woodford talked about his recent poor performance  mainly as a result of the huge losses suffered in his holding in Provident Financial 
Below is the chart  which tells its own sorry story 

In the articles I have read  Woodford appeared to be lamenting the  hysteria  and  irrational behaviour  of traders and investors in the market  The price gaps in June and August were as a result of profit warnings being announced  the second of which led to a reported loss suffered in excess of  300m across his funds 
Maybe the hysteria he is talking about was actually other traders and investors reacting to seeing those profit warnings  and they simply cut their losses and moved on 
When I come across situations like this  I am reminded of a story Ed Seykota once told 

One evening  while having dinner with a fundamentalist  I accidentally knocked a sharp knife off the edge of the table  He watched the knife twirl through the air  as it came to rest with the pointed end sticking into his shoe   Why didn t you move your foot   I exclaimed   I was waiting for it to come back up   he replied 

Of course  the danger in looking for  value  is that what appears to be cheap  can end up being a lot cheaper  and consequently better value  a few weeks or months later if a downtrend takes hold 
 I believe Provident Financial shares started the day undervalued  and have become even more so as a result of the market s reaction to today s news   Neil Woodford  22 August 2017
The trend is clearly down  Where is the bottom  Can it go lower 
It was interesting to note that  in the aftermath of the latest profit warning  he started talking about price earnings ratios  dividend yields etc   in an attempt to put some positive spin on the situation  Sure  like the  assumed resumption of the payment of a dividend  he talked about would be a justifiable reason for holding onto a  300m  loss 
 I don t believe that there is a problem with owning a large stake in a business that is profoundly undervalued  
 It s a great portfolio  one that I own and want to own more of  The short term performance is painful and is difficult  but it isn t a permanent loss of capital   Neil Woodford  07 September 2017
I have long talked about the merits of long term investors including a trend following element in their selection process  Even a simple metric such as the 200 day moving average would help  Tellingly  price had been oscillating above and below the 200 day moving average for over a year  and dipped below it again just ahead of the first profit warning back in June  Of course  it is way below that now 

A couple of years ago  I had the pleasure of meeting a portfolio manager who works at a major investment bank in the City of London  Although their portfolio recommendations are fundamental based  and determined by committee   plus they are restricted in their selection process to the constituents of the FTSE 350  it was noticeable when he said that they experienced an upturn in performance when they added a trend filter to help with the timing of their buying and selling activity 
Of course  this was not a surprise to my friend  who had an encyclopedic knowledge of trend following and its merits  It was the first time someone starting quoting Dickson Watts  Speculation as a Fine Art to me 
I am not setting out to diss Woodford here  He has a long and successful track record in what he does  And obviously to achieve what he has  there has been some stocks held for a very long time to generate the big returns required to offset the occasional big losses such as this 
And I accept and understand that when you run such a fund  and hold such concentrated positions in a stock  it would be impossible to sell out in one go  Woodford s funds owned a significant chunk of the Provident stock   a bit similar to the approach of   
But his approach couldn t be further from my own  or of those who consider price and its movements to be their primary concern 
I am least hopeful that individual traders who read this post will appreciate the potential devastation a holding like this can cause in your own investment portfolio or trading account  not to mention the emotional upheaval 
It s the age old principle again of cutting your losses at the first sign of trouble  Taking a small loss is frustrating  but it sure beats taking the mother of all losses ",2017-09-10,Trader Steve,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fallacy-of-value-investing--with-neil-woodford-200212344,200212344
147453,368969,BHC,Pricing Pressure  Competition Remain Headwinds For Pharma Stocks,opinion,"While the drug pricing issue no longer remains a major headwind for pharma and biotech stocks  it will nevertheless remain a headline risk until the Trump administration comes out with a policy for controlling drug prices  The sector  previously a Wall Street favorite  was hit hard by political rhetoric and increasing media and public focus on the high prices of drugs  With the drug pricing controversy gaining steam since September 2015  companies like Valeant saw their share prices plunging as they found themselves in the midst of the controversy 
According to the April 2017 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  six in ten Americans believe affordability of prescription drugs should be a top priority for the President and Congress   focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices 
Some of the options favored by the public for drug price control include getting drug companies to reduce prices for medications for people on Medicare  making it easier for generics to enter the market  and requiring drug companies to provide information on how drug prices are set 
Although the pharma and biotech sectors have rebounded in 2017  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market 
Biosimilars a Key Headwind
Another challenge being faced by the sector is the recent entry of biosimilar competition in the United States  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative with several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus slated to lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments 
According to research released by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics last year  increasing acceptance of biosimilars across different therapeutic areas plus an active pipeline of 56 candidates are expected to lead to total savings of about  110 billion to health systems across Europe and the United States through 2020  The report further says that by 2020  biosimilars will start competing with biologics that have annual sales of  50 billion 
Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies  Although there is still low visibility on how well biosimilars will perform or how much of the market they will be able to capture  the focus on making expensive drugs more affordable and formulary coverage for biosimilars could very well make it challenging for innovator companies to hold on to market share for their blockbuster drugs 
Generics Pose a Threat
Quite a few of the big players in the drug industry are looking at loss of patent protection for major blockbuster drugs  With generics and biosimilars breathing down their necks  many of these companies are looking towards new products to pick up pace and make up for lost sales  However  products like Repatha and Praluent are yet to ramp up significantly  With efforts on to control drug prices  the FDA is focusing on speeding up the generic drug approval process especially for third  fourth  or fifth generics which leads to rapid erosion of branded drug sales 
Slowdown in Sales of Mature Products 
Many companies like Amgen  NASDAQ AMGN  are facing a slowdown in sales of mature products in their portfolios  At the same time  new product sales are yet to pick up significantly  Many of these companies are also facing loss of patent protection  which means generics or biosimilars  as the case may be  could enter the market soon and lead to price erosion 
Pricing Pressure to Hit Sales
While concerns regarding the drug pricing issue may have taken a backseat for the time being  pharma and biotech companies remain wary of increasing scrutiny of drug prices  Moreover  with increasing competition in the market and the entry of innovative treatments  pricing pressure is expected to hit sales 
Regulatory Setbacks
Although the FDA has already surpassed last year s tally of new drug approvals  there were a few companies that failed to gain approval for their drugs this year and were issued complete response letters  CRLs  by the agency  A CRL is issued by the FDA to inform the company that its application will not be approved in its present form  There could be several reasons for the same including insufficient data to support approval as well as manufacturing issues 
Some of the companies that are facing a delay in getting their drugs approved include Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   biosimilar version of Amgen s Neulasta   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   sirukumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis   Valeant  Vesneo   eye drug   and Amgen and UCB  Evenity for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis  
Mylan NV  MYL  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock   you can see  
Stocks to Avoid
As concerns regarding pricing pressure  slowdown in legacy product sales and biosimilar competition continue to keep the sector volatile  it would be prudent to stay away from stocks that have not been able to win analysts  confidence and carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank 
Companies like Acorda Therapeutics  ACOR   BioMarin Pharmaceutical  BMRN   Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  International  VRX   Merck  MRK   Teva Pharmaceuticals  TEVA  and Sanofi  PA SASY   SNY  are all sell ranked stocks  While Merck and BioMarin are Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stocks  Sanofi  Teva  Acorda and Valeant carry a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   To know more about this sector  check out our latest

147472,368988,BHC,Facebook  Valeant Pharmaceuticals And Advanced Micro Devices Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL  July 26  2017   highlights Facebook  NASDAQ FB   NASDAQ          as the Bull of the Day Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   NYSE       as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   Inc   NASDAQ        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

Facebook   NASDAQ          reports Q2 earnings today after the close and any investor who gets excited about advertising sales growth of 45  year over year  and 15  sequentially  should read this article and get ready to buy FB shares on any dip Points on Why It s All About the Ecosystem1  Consensus Projections   Raised Estimates
	Facebook is expected to report just over  9 billion in ad revenues for the quarter and  1 13 EPS  representing 49  profit growth  Since the company will be evaluated on many other growth metrics besides the top and bottom lines  my last point will briefly address the  What if they miss   question 
	What s been fascinating for me to watch as a Facebook bull in the face of so many who doubt the ad growth can continue is how estimates have just kept moving higher all year  In January  we started out with the consensus for full year 2017 revenues projected to be under  36 billion in ad sales  fully 98  of total revs   or 32  growth 
	In the past few weeks  as analysts have done more channel checks  the numbers have climbed to just over  38 billion in advertising revenues for over 40  top line growth  And the 2018 estimates keep getting bumped too with revenues to hit over  49 billion and EPS of  6  representing 28  and 24  growth 2  Ad Inventory Shrinking 
	Part of the doubt about how Facebook could continue to grow ad sales as such a clip was that even they warned about reaching capacity on the News Feed for ads  But this is clearly the right side of the supply and demand curve to be on 
	As Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said last quarter  they diligently track the impact of  ad loads  on the user experience  going for quality and relevance over quantity and annoyance  my paraphrase  
	The key has been to innovate and execute on a plan to shift more advertising to Instagram where social audience targeting can be just as effective as on the core FB feeds 3  Instagram Leapfrogs Snapchat
	Instagram hit 700 million total users and 400 million DAUs  daily active users  as of Facebook s last quarterly report May 3  The real growth has come from Instagram Stories which has greatly surpassed that of rival they copied  Snapchat 
	Stories passed 250 million DAUs in June  up from 200 million in April  150 million in January  and 100 million in October    only two months after launch 
	While the company is taking their time to monetize Instagram  we could see a dramatic shift forward in those efforts in Q2  They might even begin to break out Instagram revenue as a segment  Until then  analysts estimate the photo sharing app could generate over  4 billion  or 10    to Facebook s top line 

	Bear 

Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE         shares have more than doubled since late April as much of the pessimism that was priced into the beleaguered medical empire was likely over done near  10 

	Obviously  with projected EPS this year of over  3 50  the stock appears to be a terrific bargain  even today near  18 and under 5X 
	But VRX is still getting put in the cellar of the Zacks Rank because estimates were reduced recently by 2 analysts  And consistent with the longer term evaporation of the franchise  next year s projections are only registering 0 66  top line growth and 4 4  on the bottom 
	The earnings picture could turn around for VRX at any time  but right now analysts are not that optimistic 
	Valeant is in the middle of a large debt reduction program  While it sells non core assets  there is probably more uncertainty about the timing of a lasting sales and profit turnaround 
	For instance  just last week Valeant announced an agreement to sell its Obagi Medical Products business for  190 million in cash to Haitong International Zhonghua Finance Corporation  The  190 million sale price is over 55  below the  437 million VRX paid for Obagi in April 2013 
	Some investment bank analysts see more uncertainty ahead  They cite still high leverage and believe that recent deals  including divestitures of iNova and Dendreon  have had limited impacts on the overall leverage situation 
	Until the estimates start going back up for next year  it may be time to shed VRX shares near this  18 resistance level while you can

The company expects total revenue in the range of  8 70  8 90 billion  down from  8 90  9 10 billion projected earlier  The updated guidance reflects the impact of the sale of the CeraVe  AcneFree and AMBI skincare brands and the sale of Dendreon Pharmaceuticals LLC  However  the guidance does not reflect the impact of the sales of the iNova Pharmaceuticals and Obagi Medical Products businesses  which are both expected to close in the second half of the year 
Our Take
Although second quarter results were encouraging  the company trimmed its guidance due to recent divestitures  The company expects to meet its target of  5 billion debt reduction ahead of schedule  The Bausch   Lomb International segment and Salix businesses together represented 73  of revenue in the quarter 
After a tumultuous period  Valeant started a rebuilding process with its new CEO  Joseph C  Papa  Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process  but the company s efforts to sell non core assets and pay down huge levels of debt is commendable and should bode well in the upcoming quarters  The company still has  27 6 billion of debt as of Jun 30  2017

Some more volatility came into stocks on Thursday as summer rolls on 
Miners were strong Wednesday and foretold the gold strength Thursday as often happens and now gold and silver are once again on the verge of a breakout  after being rejected strongly from those levels Monday 
I m mostly just doing some day trading  and a top pick for that is Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX   since it s very liquid and moves fast 
I will be establishing a position in VRX once the signal comes  but until then  it s a fine day trading vehicle I ve found 
So  looks like we will see more corrective action which is great  so enjoy the summer 
I m trying to eek out a couple or few early trades and then take the afternoons off if the weather is sunshiny 

SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  closed definitively below the 50 day average on heavy volume 
I d enjoy a move down to the gap area at 238 but who knows in this wild and very strong market overall

147499,369015,BHC,Pricing  Competition Remain Headwinds For Pharma In 2017,opinion,"Although fears regarding the drug pricing issue have waned  it will nevertheless remain a headwind until the Trump administration comes out with a policy for controlling drug prices  Drug pricing is an issue that weighed on pharma and biotech stocks for more than a year  The sector  which previously had a stellar run  started its downward trend in Sep 2015 when a single tweet by Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sent pharma and biotech stocks tumbling  Clinton s  price gouging tweet  was in response to a huge price hike  about 5 000   taken by Turing Pharmaceuticals for a drug that was approved by the FDA way back in 1953 Since then  companies like Valeant    saw their share prices plunging as they found themselves in the midst of the drug pricing controversy Although pharma and biotech shares rallied post election in November on hopes that drug pricing would not be a key focus area under a Trump presidency  the relief rally turned out to be short lived following President Trump s views regarding drug pricing  Trump made it clear that he does not like what happened to drug prices and he will bring down drug prices According to the Apr 2017 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  six in ten Americans believe affordability of prescription drugs should be a top priority for the President and Congress    focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices Some of the options favored by the public for drug price control include getting drug companies to reduce prices for medications for people on Medicare  making it easier for generics to enter the market  and requiring drug companies to provide information on how drug prices are set Although the pharma and biotech sectors have rebounded in 2017  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market Biosimilars Changing the Competitive ScenarioAnother challenge being faced by the sector is the recent entry of biosimilar competition in the U S  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative with several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus slated to lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments According to research released by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics last year  increasing acceptance of biosimilars across different therapeutic areas plus an active pipeline of 56 candidates are expected to lead to total savings of about  110 billion to health systems across Europe and the U S  through 2020 The report further says that by 2020  biosimilars will start competing with biologics that have annual sales of  50 billion  Several companies are working on bringing biosimilars to market for reference products like Johnson   Johnson s Remicade  Amgen s    Enbrel  Roche Biogen s Rituxan and AbbVie s Humira Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies  Although there is still low visibility on how well biosimilars will perform or how much of the market they will be able to capture  the focus on making expensive drugs more affordable and formulary coverage for biosimilars could very well make it challenging for innovator companies to hold on to market share for their blockbuster drugs Generics Pose a ThreatQuite a few of the big players in the drug industry are looking at loss of patent protection for major blockbuster drugs  With generics and biosimilars breathing down their necks  many of these companies are looking towards new products to pick up the pace and make up for lost sales  While several new products were approved last year  many like Orkambi  Repatha and Praluent failed to live up to expectations Moreover  with efforts on to control drug prices  chances are high that the approval process for generics could be made smoother Fewer FDA Approvals in 2016There was a notable dip in FDA novel drug approvals in 2016 with the agency giving its nod to 22 treatments during the year  Compare this to 45 approvals in 2015 and 41 in 2014 and the 2016 numbers look really disappointing It s not like a fewer number of applications were submitted in 2016    as of Dec 9  2016  36 new molecular entity  NME  applications were submitted  in line with the average NME filings of 35 over the past decade However  a pretty high number of applications got complete response letters  CRLs  from the agency    a CRL is issued by the FDA to inform the company that its application will not be approved in its present form  There could be several reasons for the same including insufficient data to support approval as well as manufacturing issues Some of the drugs that got CRLs in 2016 include Spectrum Pharma s Qapzola  immediate intravesical instillation post transurethral resection of bladder tumors in patients with non muscle invasive bladder cancer   Dynavax s experimental hepatitis B vaccine Heplisav B  Advanced Accelerator s Lutathera  treatment of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in adults   and AstraZeneca s ZS 9  hyperkalemia   AstraZeneca is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock    you can see

147526,369042,BHC,Here s Why Mallinckrodt  MNK  Shares Are Lower Today,opinion,"On Monday  shares of pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt Plc    NYSE MNK   are slipping  down about 5  to  40 50 per share in afternoon trading MNK dropped about 8  in heavy morning trading after a  from short seller Citron Research targeted the company 
Citron s report focused on Mallinckrodt s key drug H P  Acthar Gel  which can be used for many types of diseases including multiple sclerosis  dermatological diseases  and respiratory diseases  But due to huge price increases over the years  Acthar s price tag comes in at almost  40 000 a vial  the drug brings in over  1 billion in revenue for Mallinckrodt 
The report goes on to reference comments made by Everett Neville  pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts    NASDAQ ESRX   Senior Vice President  Supply Chain and Specialty  who criticized Acthar   I don t think it s a very great   it s a pretty poor drug with a very limited need   he said on a call hosted by Citigroup  NYSE C  analysts  Interestingly  Express Scripts is the sole distributor of Acthar 
 Express Scripts has FINALLY changed its stance on Acthar and the effect will send shares of Mallinckrodt to ZERO   the report claimed   The words of Express Scripts management will echo through the halls of Medicare and insurance companies as Acthar has finally met the truth  it is an old drug that is way too expensive and not as good as its competition  
This is not new behavior for Citron  who has targeted both Mallinckrodt and Express Scripts in the past  comparing the former to Valeant   NYSE VRX   and the latter to Philidor Rx Services

147558,369074,BHC,Will Valeant Recover Or Go To Zero ,opinion,"In some cases  a stock crashes due to circumstances beyond its control  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  is not one of those cases  Valeant stock is edging toward zero and most of the investing public understands why 
In 2016  a scandal came out of Valeant that rocked the pharmaceutical world  The conglomerate had participated in a series of extremely unethical price rigging schemes for important drugs  It also apparently maintained  pay to play  relationships with several specialty pharmacies    another giant ethical no no 
As a result  Valeant stock is down almost 85  in the last year 

On the other hand  when companies are in this bad shape  one of two things can happen  They can go under    or they can eventually recover  creating the ultimate contrarian buy opportunity 
We saw the latter scenario play out with Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB   NYSE  DB  in the last year  Most analysts left the stock for dead after its Brexit troubles in mid 2016  But it survived and recovered  handing incredible gains to investors who bought the bottom 
Thus  in this crisis period for Valeant stock  Investment U readers are wondering    what are its prospects for recovery  Is the scandalized pharmaceutical company a good contrarian buy 
To find out  we ran Valeant stock through the Investment U Fundamental Factor Test   As a reminder  our checklist looks at six key metrics to diagnose the financial health of a stock  
Earnings per Share   EPS  Growth  Valeant stock is off to a spectacularly bad start in our analysis  The pharmaceutical industry generally manages healthy earnings growth   averaging 46 79  in the last year  Valeant s earnings growth rate over the same period is  524   It s gone below zero 
Price to Earnings   P E   And since Valeant stock s earnings are now in the negatives  we can t calculate a P E ratio  Strike two 
Debt to Equity  Once again  Valeant does nonsensically bad on this metric  Its debt to equity ratio is a whopping 712 40   Its competitors have a reasonable average debt burden of 49 97  
Free cash flow per share growth  FCF  As a whole  pharmaceutical companies are quite cash rich right now  The average firm in the space has grown free cash flow per share by 89 90  in the last year  Valeant has seen it sink  28 06  
Profit Margins  In case it wasn t clear already  Valeant is bleeding money right now  Its profit margin of  49 14  is well below the industry average of 19 56  
Return on Equity  In our last metric    Valeant is still failing  Early stage investors have lost  42 45  on their Valeant equity in the last year  By contrast  the pharma industry has been kind to most investors  handing them an average gain of 17 90  
As you can see  Valeant stock got shut out on all six key metrics  Earnings  valuation  debt  cash flow  profits  returns   no matter what you look at  Valeant is below average 
At least from a fundamental analysis perspective  it seems safe to say that Valeant stock is irredeemable 
Granted  we can t guarantee that it won t recover  Crazier things have happened  But not even Deutsche Bank was this far gone  The prospects for Valeant getting out of this are pretty limited 
For these reasons  Valeant stock has earned a grade of F  Get rid of it if you haven t already

147560,369076,BHC,Fanaticism  2017 Crash 2017 Or More Bull Market,opinion,"A fanatic is a man that does what he thinks the Lord would do if He knew the facts of the case 

   Finley Peter Dunne
Not too long ago this bull market was one of the most hated in history  that no longer appears to be the case  Throughout the unpopular phase of this bull market  we consistently and much to the dismay of many penguins  oops we mean experts  stated that every pullback should have been treated as a buying opportunity  There were two reasons for this  market sentiment was consistently negative  and the trend was up 
We even penned an article before Trump won stating that a Trump win like Brexit would prove to be a buying opportunity  As expected after the initial panic of having to deal with A Trump Presidency  the markets recouped their losses and never looked back  We were so bullish that on De 15  2016 we provided our subscribers with the path we expected the Dow to take in 2017 

To be fair  we expected the markets to let out some steam as indicated the chart above  but the Dow only hesitated at 20 000 for a bit before surging like a rocket  Many experts were predicting the end of this bull at that time  some of which had for the most part been on the right side of the market  A stock market crash is not something we were ready for  and we voiced this sentiment in several articles in late 2016 and in Jan  and Feb  of this year  We were waiting for a pullback as the sentiment at the time  Dec  2016  had turned quite bullish  Long story short  our targets have been hit and they have been hit a lot faster than we expected  One would almost be tempted to state that we are in the feeding frenzy stage which usually represents the last stage of a Bull Market  However  the crowd is not euphoric  so this would rule that option out at least for now  So what s going on  Well  it appears to be fanaticism or madness  The markets are operating out of the realm of reality 
Fanaticism is a different emotion from euphoria  it is a form of madness  and it is hard to analyze an insane person as there is no discernible pattern  at least not immediately  History is not replete with such situations  so we need to spot these new patterns in real time  This emotion does not expire as fast as Euphoria or Fear  it can be maintained for a prolonged period  Thus  when one encounters it  the safest play is to take a defensive position  Assume the outlook is worse than it is  but without letting the panic factor seep into the equation 
The data is twisted  on the one hand  the sentiment is far from Bullish  but on the other hand  more money is flowing into the markets  and our indicators are now in the extremely overbought ranges on the long term weekly and monthly charts  Just because the outlook is different does not mean we need to start becoming anxious  Panic is not something we favor or look kindly at  panic is a useless emotion  One has to be prudent when it comes to the markets  and we have been right on the money regarding this bull market for a long time  We do not want to let arrogance take over  common sense which we value highly dictates that caution  and not fear is warranted  Thus  prudent traders would do well to tighten their stops and if committing new funds  look for companies that are selling at a huge discount or trading in the extremely oversold ranges  If the markets pull back suddenly your risk will be limited 
This market will pullback  however  no one call tell it when to pull back especially when the primary emotion driving this market is fanaticism  It is relatively easy to determine a market s trajectory if the emotion is euphoria or fear  but fanaticism is something different  As stated it is a form of madness and insanity is not easy to spot  especially if it is in stealth mode 
We are not going to pen another thousand words telling you why this stock market should crash or soar or anything like that  The bottom line is the market does not care about what if scenarios  What if scenarios are for people that have too much time on their hands to talk about useless concepts that most likely will not come to pass  Let s deal with reality
Let s first take a look at the data 
Polarization is spreading or contaminating the bullish and bearish camps  It has been a long time since we have the sentiment so evenly divided between the two camps  This week exactly 37  are bullish  and exactly 37  are bearish  with 26  falling in the neutral camp  One would normally expect the bullish sentiment to soar through the roof  euphoria is clearly not gripping the market  and neither is panic  When we combine the bears with the individuals from the neutral camp  we arrive at a figure of 63   The masses appear to be uneasy  the key word is  appear  for insanity is operating in stealth mode for now 

We spotted traces of fanaticism late last year  and that is why we briefly addressed this topic in late Dec  of 2016 and early January  The trend is gathering in intensity  and it could be with us or for some time  If this trend picks up  then this bull market could last longer than the most ardent of bulls ever envisioned  but there will be at least one correction that will break the backs of almost all the bulls and make the bears believe that a new bear market has started  Sadly  both of these chaps will be wrong  A stock market crash  a bear market  etc  all come down to perception as is the case with the truth or a lie  Alter the angle of observance and the perception changes  it all depends on when you got into the market or out of it 

Our proprietary anxiety index is also getting infected with the polarization flu  it is sitting right at the 50  mark  These are all subtle clues that something new is taking place in the background  Trend investing comes down to identifying the primary trend  it does not mean that the market cannot and will not pull back while it is an uptrend  In the long run the market tends to revert to the mean  currently  the market is trading almost two standard deviations from the mean  Thus regardless of the trend  one of the two things needs to happen


Our indicators pullback into the oversold ranges  preferably the extremely oversold ranges  Currently  they are trading in the extremely overbought ranges on the weekly charts and overbought ranges on the monthly charts


A sharp correction that drives many bulls to join hands with the Bears  A long term bull market has to experience one back breaking correction  We do not know when this will occur  but the sooner  the better as  the higher it trades  the more painful the correction will be especially for those that embraced this bull market very late in the cycle


Ideally  both of the above occur simultaneously  and at that point  one could start conjuring images of Dow 24K  To do this  the above two need to occur simultaneously 
Shockingly  V readings have surged a whopping 100 points in just two days  In just one week they have moved 160 points  a new three day record and a new record  What can we say  expect what will appear to be chaos regarding human emotions  weather  politics and market movements  However  remember there is no such thing as true chaos as chaos has a pattern  Thus embrace this development for we are trend players and not chickens that squawk the moment we smell change  For the umpteenth  we are going to raise all the overbought and extreme ranges as V readings show no sign of letting up  If you look at the reading going back to Dec 16  2009  you can see how insanely high this indicator is trading  Note that when we launched this indicator  readings were in the 300 ranges  This further cements the argument that the central driving theme in the world  and not just the U S  is going to be to  polarize the masses   Do not become part of the crowd for they are going to go insane and lose a lot in the process  you  on the other hand  could stand to benefit tremendously provided you do not lose control  Market Update Feb  20  2017
The crowd has gone insane at least when it come to the markets  Remember  that the mass mindset does not refer to just the small players  Hedge fund managers and even big players are all part of the mass mentality  Look at Bill Ackman  he finally conceded defeat and sold his position in Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  at what could very well turn out to be the bottom  Would it not have made sense to sell it earlier  why now  when the stock is trading close to the levels it was trading in 2005 well before it took off   a classic example of the mass mindset in action  buying when you should have been selling and selling when buying probably makes more sense 
Individuals falsely assume that big hedge funds or mutual funds cannot be part of the mass mindset  Some of the biggest players are nothing but cattle  they just give the impression that they know what they are doing  but in the end  they are just following each other to the Promised Land  which usually turns out to be den full of vipers  Insanity  madness  is a very powerful force  never underestimate it 
Conclusion
As insanity is the main driving force  caution is called for  and we are going to change our tactics  At this point  the Markets are trading in the extremely overbought ranges on both the weekly and monthly charts  We are not stating that the markets are going to crash or that they need to crash  What we are stating is that common sense says that an old bull market such as this one needs to let out a healthy dose of steam  At this point  the risk to reward ratio is not strongly in our favor  We still view substantial pullbacks as buying opportunities unless the trend changes  but the pullback would have to sharp in nature 

A fanatic is one who can t change his mind and won t change the subject

147562,369078,BHC,Valeant  VRX  Q1 Earnings   Revenues Miss  View Raised,opinion,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc    NYSE VRX   surged significantly after the company raised the annual guidance for 2017 concurrent with the first quarter 2017 earnings 

 
We note that the shares of Valeant have underperformed the Zacks classified  industry in the last year  The stock lost 12  as compared to the industry s gain of 5 5  
The company s adjusted earnings per share of 78 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 96 cents 
However  total revenue came in at  2 10 billion missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 16 billion and declined 11  from the year ago quarter  The year over year decline was due to lower volumes in the U S  Diversified Products and Branded Rx segments as a result of the loss of exclusivity for a number of products and challenging market dynamics  Revenues were also negatively affected by foreign currencies  divestitures and discontinuations  and a modest decrease in average realized pricing 
Quarter in Detail
Revenues in the Bausch   Lomb   International segment were  1 15 billion  up 0 3  year over year driven by increases in international volumes  particularly in Europe  the Middle East  South Africa  Asia and Australia which were partially offset by declines in volumes in the U S 
Average realized pricing across the segment increased mainly from the international business units  However  volume and pricing gains were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and the impact of divestitures and discontinuations 
Revenues in the Branded Rx segment were  604 million  down 9  in the year ago quarter mainly due to decreased volumes in the dermatology and Salix business units due to the loss of exclusivity of certain product lines  continued generic competition and the impact of an increase in the prevalence of high deductible medical plans 
Nevertheless  pricing improved in the dermatology business  driven by lower customer subsidies and accommodations and higher wholesaler selling prices  The Salix business benefited from higher wholesale selling prices and favorable chargeback  These increases were partially offset by higher managed care rebates particularly in the dermatology business 
Revenues in the U S  Diversified Products segment were  355 million  a decline of 37  year over year due to a decrease in volume and lower average realized prices which in turn were attributed to loss of exclusivity for products in the segment 
Research and development expenses were  96 million in the reported quarter  down 6 8  from the year ago quarter 
Selling  General and Administrative costs were  661 million compared with  813 million in the year ago quarter 
During the quarter  the company reduced debt by  1 3 billion  On a cumulative basis  the company reduced total debt by  3 6 billion since the end of the first quarter of 2016  Moreover  the company completed more than  1 3 billion in asset sales  including the earlier than expected closure of the sale of the CeraVe  AcneFree and AMBI skincare brands  
On a positive note  the FDA approved its new psoriasis treatment  Siliq  The company also resubmitted its glaucoma treatment  Vyzulta  latanoprostene bunod  in Feb 2017 and the FDA granted a PDUFA date of Aug 24  Meanwhile  the company completed two successful phase III studies on IDP 118  a topical psoriasis treatment  The company recruited and launched a new primary care sales force for Xifaxan  The company also licensed EGP 437 from EyeGate Pharmaceuticals for a new eye care indication 
2017 Guidance    
The company continues to expect total revenue in the range of  8 90  9 10 billion but raised its guidance for adjusted EBITDA by  50 million  The company will close the sale of Dendreon to Sanpower Group for  819 9 million in mid 2017  The company plans to use the proceeds from the divestiture to pay down its high levels of debt 
Our Take
Although first quarter results missed estimates  the company raised its guidance for EBITDA  After a tumultuous period  Valeant started a rebuilding process with its new CEO  Joseph C  Papa  Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process  but the company s efforts to sell non core assets and pay down huge levels of debt is commendable and should bode well in the upcoming quarters  The company still has  28 5 billion of debt as of Mar 31  2017 
The dermatology business saw some positive trends as the average selling price stabilized  The GI business continues to struggle with weak sales of Xifaxan  However  the drug should see gain in market share with an increased sales force 
Zacks Rank   Key Picks

147611,369127,BHC,Small is lucrative for Wachtell  corporate America s legal defense force,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis NEW YORK  Reuters    Every Tuesday  partners and associates at Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen   Katz gather for a communal lunch in the dining room of the law firm s Manhattan offices  Food ordered from top New York restaurants is served  but the real attraction is Martin Lipton  one of the firm s co founders and corporate America s most famous consigliere  The father of the  poison pill    a key defense strategy used against hostile takeovers   Lipton has helped build the firm into the most lucrative legal outfit in the world  a go to shop for companies seeking to seal complex deals or repel suitors and activist investors  The weekly lunch is just one of the ways the 85 year old stays in touch with new associates and reinforces the firm s close knit culture  where young law graduates are often paired with senior partners to work on big deals  Partners say a flat structure and relatively small size   Wachtell s lawyer headcount of about 260 is roughly half of its closest rival Cravath  Swaine   Moore   is key to the firm s success   The firm s concentrated business model contrasts with the strategy of many law firms to become one stop shops for deals  from navigating niche regulatory processes to sorting through labyrinthine tax affairs  Lipton is confident that his strategy of concentrating on high stakes corporate situations will persist  according to interviews with several senior partners at the firm  This is because corporate America continues to turn to Wachtell as its top legal gun for hire    Wachtell s business model is to be the firm you go to when you are not willing to take any risk at all   said Stephen Gillers  a New York University School of Law professor   They know that in the big M A cases  legal fees  no matter how big they are  are insignificant to the value of concluding the deal    When French drug giant Sanofi SA  PA SASY  threatened U S cancer drug company Medivation Inc with a  9 3 billion hostile bid last year  for example  Medivation called Wachtell despite having an existing external legal adviser  Cooley  Cooley helped Medivation to go public in 2004 and is best known for advising on initial public offerings and defending against patent and class action lawsuits  Cooley and Medivation declined to comment  MOST LUCRATIVE  With some U S  companies domiciled overseas  Wachtell s partners often have to adapt their techniques to different jurisdictions   Rather than opening offices internationally as some of their rivals have done  Wachtell s lawyers fly out to advise  staying weeks in some cases to see a case through  and turn to other law firms to assist them   Wachtell did consider opening a London office in recent years  but decided against it  partner at the firm said  The feeling among the firm s senior partners was that expansion would dilute its culture  which is based around forming ad hoc teams to deal with situations  all from the one office in Manhattan   Keeping itself small has helped Wachtell become the most lucrative law firm in the world  with the average partner making a profit last year of  5 8 million  according to trade publication American Lawyer  The top 100 law firms averaged profit per partner of  1 66 million  Capping the workforce also means that partners do not have an army of associates to foist work onto    We work harder on average than other places  the work is very partner heavy  It s the type of work where vast experience is critical   said Daniel Neff  co chairman of Wachtell s executive committee   No one is more experienced than Lipton  referred to as Marty by clients and colleagues  He continues to work on high profile cases including  most recently  advising General Motors Co s  N GM  board of directors on its defense against activist hedge fund Greenlight Capital  as well metal parts maker  Arconic Inc   N ARNC  on its settlement with activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp   Besides Lipton  two of the other three founding partners  Leonard Rosen and George Katz  have died  However  like Lipton  founding partner Herbert Wachtell remains active at 84 practicing law  focusing on corporate litigation  which is the firm s other major area of strength  M A ROYALTY Lipton has built a bench of seasoned deal lawyers who now account for the majority of the business that comes through the door  They include Neff and Edward Herlihy  who formally lead the firm as co managing partners  as well as Andrew Brownstein  David Katz  Steven Rosenblum  Adam Emmerich and Andrew Nussbaum  among others   When  Perrigo Co  Plc  N PRGO  turned to Wachtell in 2015 to defend against a  35 billion offer from Mylan NV  O MYL   it was a 45 year old partner  Igor Kirman  that the Irish domiciled generic drug maker chose to lead its defense in three continents  Perrigo subsequently defeated what was the largest hostile bid ever rejected by a company s shareholders   It was a given for me that by turning to Wachtell we would get excellent legal advice  But Igor also took very complex issues and simplified them so Perrigo s board could understand   said Joseph Papa  Perrigo s former CEO who now leads Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  International Inc  TO VRX   Lipton remains influential  fielding calls and studying cases every day from his 31st floor office  which is filled with memorabilia from major deals stretching back to the 1970s    Lipton is royalty in the M A bar  There is no immediate successor to the status that he has achieved   said Gillers   
 The fact that clients still ask for him at the age of 85 shows you that the most important assets of a lawyer are his experience and judgment  ",2017-06-08,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/small-is-lucrative-for-wachtell,-corporate-america's-legal-defense-force-493191",493191

147627,369143,BHC,Headline Risk Is Still Poison For These Stocks,opinion,"Stock picking is hard  Most institutional and retail stock pickers underperform the indexes  But every investor could improve the likelihood they beat the market by following one rule 
Avoid high profile  controversial companies where an adverse news event could produce an overnight price collapse 
Three stocks have proven the utility of this investing rule in spades  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  and Mylan Labs  NASDAQ MYL   All three have been scrutinized for behavior labeled unethical by some and illegal by others  and all three have cost their investors in a big way because of it 
In February  I cautioned that an upcoming Congressional investigation into Valeant s pricing policies might unveil further malfeasance by the company s management  VRX was  92 then  It closed at  22 today  While the hearings produced no bombshells  a few weeks later management reported disappointing fourth quarter earnings and drastically lowered earnings guidance for 2017  The stock dropped 40  to  36 in a single day  and has slid lower since 
Had folks followed my rule  they would have unloaded Valeant as soon as news surfaced that it had a lengthy history of buying prescription and OTC drugs  with money borrowed via multiple Wall Street bond offerings  and then drastically raising drug prices  The stock was still over  200 when these damning stories first emerged  But many investors including a who s who of the hedge fund industry held onto their Valeant stakes  betting that good times were sure to return as the negative press faded and headline risk abated  Even Wall Street  experts  who openly acknowledged the company s troubles refused to believe things could get significantly worse 
On September 28th  2015  with Valeant s stock still trading for  199 share  Nomura analyst Shibani Malhotra initiated coverage on the company  In a thorough 46 page report  Malhotra rightly called VRX a  controversial company that polarizes investors  and noted its  aggressive pace of M A  which some perceive as an unsustainable  roll up  strategy   And yet  Malhotra still rated the company a buy  pegging its upside at  335 share and its downside at a mere  180 only  19  or 10 percent  less than the stock was trading for on the day the report was issued 
Oops 
One year later  the rot within Valeant is still being unearthed  and its stock keeps on falling  Just this week Wall Street analyst David Maris dug up another example of quasi criminal behavior  Apparently Valeant induced doctors to prescribe its second biggest product  the antidepressant Wellbutrin XL  through the obscure mail order pharmacy  Direct Success   Even though much cheaper generic competitors to Wellbutrin existed  Valeant increased Wellbutrin s list price 11 times over the last few years to  17 000 annually  Who knows when  or if  another negative story around Valeant is discovered  But with over  30 billion of debt and now shrinking revenues  it s an extremely risky stock that could very well zero out  Now that is a downside risk 
The recent Wells and Mylan scandals could drag on just as long as the Valeant saga  and potential investors in either company would be wise to remember all the false bottoms we ve seen in Valeant s stock since it first started sliding 
Mylan has followed the Valeant playbook  buying a much needed drug and then rapidly raising its price  Because Medicare and Medicaid are often the ultimate payors  a large portion of these price hikes have been borne by American taxpayers  In Mylan s case the product was the epipen  used to avert anaphylactic shock for folks with severe allergies  Mylan s CEO  who is among the highest paid CEO s in America  was criticized for this price gouging at a recent congressional hearing  but she has retained her job  and her eight figure annual compensation 
Wells Fargo had a multi year program of  cross selling  products  like credit cards  to customers who had not requested them  Last week longtime Wells CEO John Stumpf resigned over the scandal  but not before first blaming  and firing  5 300 employees and the head of Wells  consumer operations  I suspect these were not  rogue  employees  just folks following an internal culture that promoted unethical and illegal behavior in order to stay employed  Thankfully  the head of the consumer finance protection bureau  Senator Elizabeth Warren  lambasted Stumpf at a recent Senate hearing

As for Wells  I believe our government would have been well within its rights  per the Treasury Department s oversight of all FDIC insured institutions to place it under conservatorship  as it did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after the 2008 financial crisis  The company s stock would have zeroed out  and that would have put the entire financial services industry on notice that predatory behavior will not be tolerated  While a drastic step  I fear such action is necessary to prevent further abuse  Instead Wells  investors  including Warren Buffett  have remained silent  It appears protecting the company s share price is more important to these folks than treating American consumers and taxpayers fairly",2016-10-21,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/headline-risk-is-still-poison-for-these-stocks-200159974,200159974

147632,369148,BHC,Pricing Issues Continue To Weigh On The Pharma Sector,opinion,"Sector Remains Volatile on Drug Pricing Issues
Drug pricing is an issue that has been weighing on pharma and biotech stocks for more than a year now  The sector  which previously had a stellar run  started its downward trend in Sep 2015 when a single tweet by Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sent pharma and biotech stocks tumbling  Clinton s  price gouging tweet  was in response to a huge price hike  about 5 000   taken by Turing Pharmaceuticals for a drug that was approved by the FDA way back in 1953 
Since then  focus on the drug pricing issue has gone up and companies like Valeant and Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  have seen their share prices plunging as they find themselves in the midst of the drug pricing controversy  Moreover  insulin drugmakers like Lilly  LLY  and Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb   NVO  are also under attack with Senator Bernie Sanders posting a series of tweets questioning the prices of their insulin drugs  Lilly is a Zacks Rank  3 stock  You can see  
And then there is Proposition 61   California s ballot measure to ensure that the State of California is able to negotiate with drug companies for drug prices that do not exceed the price paid for the same drugs by the U S  Department of Veterans Affairs  DVA   Not surprisingly  the drug industry is fighting this proposition 
According to the Oct 2016 Kaiser Health Tracking poll  affordability of prescription drugs remains at the top of the public s priority list for the President and Congress    focus should be on ensuring the affordability of high cost drugs to people who need them and taking steps to lower prescription drug prices 
In Sep 2016  Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced a health care plan that will address the excessive price hikes of treatments that have been around for years and also reaffirmed her earlier broader plan  announced in Sep 2015  with the aim to lower drug prices for all Americans 
Given the current scenario  drug companies may find it a bit difficult to justify their high prices by citing the years and funds that go into bringing new treatments to market and the need to invest in R D to bring additional treatments to market  With elections round the corner andPresidential candidates  policymakers  the media and the general public focusing on the high price tags for drugs  this issue is not likely to die down easily 
Biosimilars Changing the Competitive Scenario
Another challenge being faced by the sector is the recent entry of biosimilar competition in the U S  While a relatively new area  the market for biosimilars is huge and highly lucrative with several blockbuster biologics including Humira and Lantus slated to lose patent protection by 2020  Biosimilars are expected to reduce healthcare costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments 
According to new research released by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics earlier this year  increasing acceptance of biosimilars across different therapeutic areas plus an active pipeline of 56 candidates are expected to lead to total savings of about  110 billion to health systems across Europe and the U S  through 2020 
The report further says that by 2020  biosimilars will start competing with biologics that currently have annual sales of  50 billion  About 30 companies are developing biosimilars of 16 molecules   most of the biosimilars in development are for reference products like Johnson   Johnson s Remicade  Amgen s  AMGN  Enbrel  Roche Biogen s Rituxan and AbbVie s Humira 
Biosimilars are also gaining acceptance across formularies  CVS Health  NYSE CVS  announced that biosimilars and follow on biologics will be a key part of its 2017 standard formulary strategy  replacing higher cost drugs within the categories  Similar steps have been taken or are being contemplated by other formularies as well 
Although there is still low visibility on how well biosimilars will perform or how much of the market they will be able to capture  the focus on making expensive drugs more affordable and formulary coverage for biosimilars could very well make it challenging for innovator companies to hold on to market share for their blockbuster drugs 
Will New Products Make Up for Lost Sales 
Quite a few of the big players in the drug industry are looking at loss of patent protection for major blockbuster drugs  With generics and biosimilars breathing down their necks  many of these companies are looking towards new products to pick up the pace and make up for lost sales  While several new products were approved last year  many like Orkambi  Repatha and Praluent failed to live up to expectations 
Vertex  VRTX  lowered its 2016 guidance for cystic fibrosis treatment Orkambi in September to reflect slower refills in the U S  during the summer months of July and August as well as a slower than expected launch in Germany 
Meanwhile  PCSK9 inhibitors  Repatha and Praluent  which are expected to bring in blockbuster sales  are yet to see a significant ramp up  Sales of these products are not likely to pick up significantly until the availability of favorable cardiovascular outcomes study data

147652,369168,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  Appoints New CFO  Stock Gains 7 2 ,opinion,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals   NYSE VRX   were up over 7  in midday trading on Monday after the company announced the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer  CFO   Monday s stock movement reflects is yet another continuation in the company s rollercoaster story 
Earlier in August  shares of Valeant  after the company reported an earnings miss but issued a positive outlook   Two days later  shares  following reports that the company is under criminal investigation 
The investigation concerns Valeant s relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx  with claims that it worked with the company to boost sales but hid the relationship from insurers  defrauding them in the process 
Investigations aren t new for Valeant  which has seen its stock decline over 90  over the last 12 months due to multiple SEC and congressional probes into its price hikes for drug products 
Still  many see the arrival of a new CFO as the beginning of a turnaround for the troubled company  Mad Money on CNBC s Jim Cramer  that bringing in a high quality CFO  could change things  and that  Valeant shareholders should cheer this move  
Regardless  it is difficult to remain optimistic on a company that has been blighted by successive challenges  The company has seen two upward and one downward earnings estimate revision for the current quarter  representing a consensus estimate of  1 79 in earnings per share  This however  is still six cents lower than the consensus estimate of 60 days ago 
Furthermore  the company has seen multiple downward earnings estimate revisions for the current fiscal year  Current estimate stand at  6 64 in earnings per share  down from the  6 86 estimate of 60 days ago 
The chart below reflects the many woes that have plagued the company in recent times VALEANT PHARMA Price   While the move to bring in new executive management is to be welcomed  investors still have plenty of reason to remain skeptical of Valeant s future prospects  The company did receive lender approval to amend its credit facility  a move that will help improve its financial condition  However  the aforementioned investigation is ongoing 
Investors should maintain a watchful eye for new developments before deciding on a potential play

147656,369172,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuiticals Stock  Skyrocketing On CFO News,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  
Valeant Pharmaceuticals is having an incredible day in the market today  and for good reason  The company announced the appointment of a new CFO  Today  we ll talk about the news  how the stock reacted  and what we can expect to see from VRX ahead  So  let s get right to it   
VRX Appoints Paul Herendeen As CFO
Valeant Pharmaceuticals has been through quite a bit as of late  After being caught in a scandal and shown to have been lying to investors  the stock has fallen dramatically  However  there s a new CEO in town  and he is making some big changes  One of the most recent changes was an announcement early Monday morning that the company has hired Paul Herendeed as the CFO  This is the latest in a string of management changes that we ve seen in VRX since the Philidor scandal that left the company in shambles 
Paul Herendeen was previously an executive at the animal healthcare company known as Zoetis  ZTS   In the announcement  we learned that Herendeen will be replacing Robert Rosiello  effective immediately 
It was also announced that Rosiello will not be leaving VRX entirely  Moving forward  he will stay on board at the company as the executive vice president of corporate development and strategy 
How The Stock Reacted To The News
As mentioned above  Valeant Pharmaceuticals is having an incredibly strong day in the market  After all  any moves that shake up existing management and continue to rebrand the way people view the company will likely lead to positive movement in the market  Currently  12 55   the stock is trading at  31 05 per share after a gain of  2 31 per share or 8 04  thus far today 
What I m Expecting To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  there is a relatively mixed view among analysts  Personally  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from VRX ahead  At the end of the day  the company did make a mistake that came to light late last year  and the stock did tank as a result  However  since then  we ve seen several changes at the company  They are no longer working with Philidor  management has changed significantly  new contracts have been opened  and more  The announcement today of Herendeen being appointed as the company s CFO is just another point that shows that we re working with what could be perceived as an entirely new company  One that had nothing to do with the scandal 
With that said  looking at VRX from this point of view  the stock is incredibly promising  When we talk about Valeant Pharmaceuticals  we re talking about a company that has amassed a massive amount of products  many of which have proven to be successful  Also  the pipeline the company has is really second to none  Moving forward  I m expecting to see an incredibly strong recovery as the company works to regain its footing and trust among investors  All in all  I m expecting to see strong gains from the stock in the long run ",2016-08-23,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuiticals-(vrx)-stock:-skyrocketing-on-cfo-news-200149428,200149428
147657,369173,BHC,Here s Why I m Bullish Valeant,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  is one of the most heavily debated stocks in the pharmaceutical space  and for good reason  Late last year  the company was caught in the middle of a scandal that led to declining investor sentiment  a completely shift in management  and a massive decline in the price of its stock  However  since the scandal  many see the company as one that has turned around completely  Personally  I side with the bulls on VRX  Today  we ll talk about why 
Morgan Stanley Upgrade
If you follow my work  you know that I never advise blindly following the opinions of analysts  The truth is that they are only human  which means they too are subject to error  However  recently a Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst by the name of David Risinger upgraded the stock  In so doing  he noted some key points 
In his comments  Risinger made a point of the fact that Joseph Papa has really shifted management around  turning it into a more trusted company  He also said that the new management team seems to be making the right moves  which should lead to growth for VRX  He also went into NOLs that offset tax issues associated with asset sales and upcoming consideration payments  Finally  he was impressed with the fact that the company is on the right track toward paying off debt  Here s a key quote from the release that outlines 4 reasons that Risinger decided to upgrade VRX 

Papa had been in discussions with new CFO Paul Herendeen for a few months to bring him on board  Papa did not commit and say that Herendeen has  bought in  to 2H16 guidance  but commented that Herendeen had spent a lot of time trying to understand the business before taking the role 
The company has approximately  2B of NOLs in the U S  and  2B in Canada  which help offset tax leakage in asset sales 
Mgmt  believes investigation related settlements are two years away at minimum  Once fines settlements are  estimable and probable  then the company will reserve cash for settlements in restricted cash  as per accounting rules   
Upcoming contingent consideration payments include   150M for brodalumab approval and  50M for Relistor oral  We already factor in  400M of contingent consideration in 2H16 in our cash flow model 

It s A New Company
When we talk about VRX  we re talking about a new company with the same products and others coming on board  The reality is that any company is only as strong as the management that runs it  Unfortunately  the previous management team that was part of the company made huge mistakes  However  Papa knew that he had to shake things up and bring other people in to really revamp the process and improve the company  Since his start with Valeant  he has done just that 
At the end of the day  VRX has a strong lineup of great products  It has agreements with leaders in the industry to sell these products  Now  the company has a new management team that s focused on increasing sales  paying off debt  and returning value to shareholders  All in all  I believe that we ve seen a complete 180  and that this stock will climb from here ",2016-08-26,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here's-why-i'm-bullish-valeant-200150336,200150336

147666,369182,BHC,Exclusive  Billionaire investor Julian Robertson pulls plug on prot g s fund,news,By Lawrence Delevingne and Svea Herbst Bayliss NEW YORK BOSTON  Reuters    Billionaire investor Julian Robertson is shutting a portfolio that let outsiders bet with him on would be star managers and has exited entirely from former prot g e Nehal Chopra s Ratan Capital Management  according to recent regulatory filings  The closure of Tiger Management Advisors LLC s six year old Tiger Accelerator Fund comes after poor performance and sharp declines in assets at its underlying hedge fund firms  For now  it marks the end of retired hedge fund legend Robertson s side business of gathering other people s money to invest in smaller hedge funds  even though he left open the possibility of pursuing such a strategy again   For nearly two decades  Robertson has made investments with roughly three dozen hedge funds  including a number run by his former employees  whose firms are often referred to as  Tiger Cubs   in a nod to the name of Robertson s hedge fund Tiger Management   The Tiger Accelerator Fund was unusual in that it grouped six such individual funds together and allowed investors  who might not be able to afford getting into some of the other funds that Robertson backs  to track the billionaire s best new prospects  The fund gave them stakes as limited partners and let them share in the revenue  It managed just  28 5 million of outside capital as of Dec  31  2016  according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing made on March 30  That is down more than 90 percent from  450 million at its launch in 2011  which marked Robertson s return to accepting outside capital  a practice he had ended in 2000 when he shut his hedge fund  A spokesman for Robertson  84  declined to comment  Tiger Accelerator joins the growing list of failed hedge funds hurt by investors flocking to the exits in the face of high fees and sluggish returns  Data from Hedge Fund Research show 1 057 portfolios shuttered last year  the most liquidations since 2009  Among the latest wave of managers supported by Robertson  the reversal of fortune at Chopra s Ratan Capital Management has been particularly stark  Her fund  named after the Hindi word for jewel  grew quickly to manage more than  1 billion  with capital from a public pension fund in New York and the family foundation of Robert Kraft  owner of the New England Patriots  Working in the same Park Avenue  New York City building as Tiger  Ratan produced three straight years of double digit gains until a big bet on drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  International Inc  TO VRX  soured and hurt the fund in 2015 and 2016  The fund managed just  375 million as of Dec  31  according to its latest regulatory filing  Robertson has pulled out of the Ratan fund completely according to a separate March 30 SEC filing  Most of the other five Tiger seedlings have also suffered  Tiger Veda closed down in November 2015  Cascabel Management shut down in the first half of 2015  Robertson pulled his money out of Long Oar Global Investors LLC in early 2014  and the firm is no longer registered with the SEC  an indication that it is either out of business or manages less than  100 million   Tiger Eye Capital  now the largest of the Tiger Accelerator Fund cohort of managers  has seen its assets drop to  923 million at the end of last year from  1 4 billion at the start of 2016  according to a recent SEC filing  Teewinot Capital Advisors LLC decided to stop managing money for the Tiger Accelerator portfolio in the third quarter of 2016  a source familiar with the matter said  At the end of last year  Teewinot managed  154 million  up from  138 million in April 2015  Representatives for the six funds either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment  For more on the history of the Tiger Accelerator Fund  click here      DIASPORA DELIVERS MIXED RESULTS  Some of the managers in the fund initially posted strong performance and assets grew significantly  especially at Tiger Eye and Ratan  As a result  early investors in the Tiger Accelerator Fund appear to have made money  As of August 2015  about  15 million has been paid out by Tiger Accelerator to investors from their minority stakes in the underlying hedge funds  people familiar with the matter told Reuters   A more up to date figure was not available  The fund has been run day to day by Chief Investment Officer Gil Caffray and President Alex Robertson  Julian s son   Julian Robertson s personal wealth continued to climb even as the Tiger Accelerator Fund has stumbled  Forbes puts his net worth at  3 8 billion  up from  3 4 billion in 2015 and  1 5 billion in 2000  Robertson had more than  230 million invested with the six newcomers in the Tiger Accelerator Fund in January 2011 before raising outside capital with the help of  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  marketers  according to fund materials seen by Reuters  While many members of the Tiger diaspora boast strong long term results  some have struggled lately  Tiger Global Management  led by Robertson prot g  Chase Coleman  lost 15 percent last year  This year the firm s hedge fund is making money again  having returned 13 5 percent in the first quarter  an investor said  Another Tiger seeded firm  Hound Partners LLC  ended 2016 with a 2 3 percent loss and is roughly flat this year after a 1 1 percent gain in March  an investor said  And Viking Global Investors  led by former Robertson deputy Andreas Halvorsen  ended 2016 with a 4 percent loss  but is up 4 9 percent this year  an investor said  Representatives for those funds declined to comment

147682,369198,BHC,4 Stocks To Watch  AMBA  CPE  CWEI  DEPO,opinion,"It was a distinctly different market on Tuesday  First it was up sharply in the morning making new all time highs on the S P 500  then a nice  solid pullback  5 wave decline midday  before a late bounce brought them back to close just slightly positive on the day  Nevertheless  we have a lot of stocks that we are watching that are doing very well  Let s take a look at them 
Ambarella  Inc   NASDAQ AMBA   a swing trade of ours  is doing well  It had a solid decline from mid 2015 to early 2016  formed a base  broke out  flagged  and ran up in a nice channel  It s getting up near my target near the Dec high  up around the 64 65 range  which could be reached rather shortly  It was up 1 83 to 61 08  or 3   on 1 3 million shares  It has 9 24 days to cover 
Callon Petroleum Company  NYSE CPE  popped 42 cents to 12 84  or 3 38   on 6 7 million shares on Tuesday  I have been watching this stock for a very long time  After a crumbling in 2007 8  going from 28 all the way down to under a dollar  it based out over the last several years  then popped  and consolidated for a year and a half  It went up to resistance  held it  continued to hold  formed a 3 month consolidation  and then spiked up in the last six days  going from about 10 34 to 13 25  It may consolidate  but I think the target right now is just under 15  and then 17 and 19 1 2  I put it out as a swing on Tuesday  It may be a little early  but it has momentum  It has 5 2 days to cover  so we may see an extension 
Clayton Williams Energy  Inc   NYSE CWEI  is one of the best acting stocks of ours for this year for a swing trade  having gone from 19 to 54  It did back off late on Tuesday  closing up 1 34 to 51 78  or 2 66   on 643 168 shares traded  My target was 54 55  and we reached that  It looks to me like it has a very strong pattern  The most recent moves have taken it from a low of 6 35 to 54  That s huge  If it gets near mid to high 60 s that would be a stellar move  This stock has come a long way  It has 4 94 days to cover 
DepoMed Inc   NASDAQ DEPO  had a nice pop on Tuesday after a pullback  up 26 cents to 21 49  or 1 22   on 1 15 million shares  but it didn t hold high  The reason I like it is because of the way the OBV is acting  The wedge that it was in is broken  It s been up for five days in a row and the pullback held support  I m going to look for a breakout above Tuesday s high at 22 02  and a move to 25  or better  It has 11 days to cover

According to   U S  prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Valeant s relationship with a specialty pharmacy  Philidor Rx Services  that helped improve its drug sales  and whether or not it hid this relationship from insurers 
Lawyers at the U S  Attorney s Manhattan based office are figuring out if Valeant s ties with Philidor resulted in defrauding insurers 
 We have been fully cooperating with the authorities throughout the investigation  and we are in frequent contact and continue to cooperate with the U S  Attorney s Office   Valeant said in a statement   Valeant takes these matters seriously and intends to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct  
It was just last year that Valeant came under scrutiny over issues including its business practices  in particular with Philidor  The company cut ties with the pharmacy last October after reports surfaced that Philidor had allegedly used tactics to gain more insurance reimbursements for Valeant drugs 
Valeant has already admitted that about  58 million of incorrectly marked sales were tied to Philidor  Joseph Papa  the drug maker s new CEO  has made efforts to put these issues behind Valeant like hiking its drug prices and using Philidor to distribute these newly expensive medicines and to gain back shareholder trust

147694,369210,BHC,Valeant s  VRX  Brodalumab BLA Up For Review In The U S ,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  Inc  s   NYSE VRX   Biologic License Application  BLA  for brodalumab is up for review by an FDA panel  The FDA Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee  DODAC  is slated to meet on Jul 19 to review the application 
Note that the briefing documents that were released last week do not appear promising 
We remind investors that Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   had submitted the first Investigational New Drug Application  IND  for brodalumab in 2008  Thereafter  the sponsorship of the program was granted to AstraZeneca   NYSE AZN    which subsequently transferred the same to Valeant 
Valeant s BLA contains 21 studies that were conducted by Amgen and four studies that were conducted by Amgen s partner in Japan  The candidate met all primary endpoints across the three pivotal phase III studies 
The most common adverse events associated with brodalumab were nasopharyngitis  upper respiratory tract infection  arthralgia and headache  However  events of suicidal ideation and behavior  along with major cardiovascular events  constituted the greatest risks  These events are considered important potential risks and will be the focus of the advisory committee 
We note that Amgen s decision to terminate the co development deal with AstraZeneca was essentially due to events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program  which the former believed would likely lead to restrictive labeling by the FDA  The company believed that such labeling requirements would limit the eligible patient population for the product upon approval 
Suicidal ideation and behavior was identified as a potential risk in 2014  quite late in the brodalumab psoriasis development program  when most patients had already completed 52 weeks of study 
Hence  we believe that the FDA advisory committee will focus on this aspect while reviewing the BLA and the outcome may not be favorable  In fact  even if a positive recommendation is given  the labeling would be accompanied by precautions and warnings

147702,369218,BHC,4 Things To Watch When Gilead Sciences Reports On Monday,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Gilead Sciences  NASDAQ GILD   a global biopharmaceutical company  reports Q2 results on Monday  after the close 

1  Revenue and earnings forecast
Gilead Sciences  forecast for Q2 is  3 02 EPS on  7 83B revenue  Should Gilead meet this EPS forecast  it would indicate that the company hasn t grown its EPS this past quarter the first time since 2013  Gilead had a spectacular 2015  beating EPS estimates by 10  or more each quarter  In Q1 2015  the company reported EPS of 2 94 vs 2 32 expected  which made for a very welcome 26  upside surprise  Unfortunately  so far  2016 hasn t been nearly as impressive  Reports for Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 beat EPS estimates by a paltry 1   at  3 03 per share  The slowdown is also reflected in its current share price   86 55 as of Friday s close  a far cry from its all time high of  123 37 during June 2014 

2  Hepatitis C  GILD s core business
Right now  the two major diseases treated by Gilead s medicines are HIV and Hepatits C  Its two biggest products  both blockbusters  are Hepatits C  HCV  medications  Sovaldi and Harvoni  Together  these meds account for almost half of the company s revenue 
Understandably  during Monday s report the focus will be on their recent performance  In Q1  Gilead s HCV product sales fell by 6  year over year  to  4 3B  The problematic market for Gilead is the United States 
For the better part of the past three years  Gilead had a monopoly in the field of HCV drugs  which allowed it to accrue uncontested profits  At the end of April however  AbbVie Inc  NYSE ABBV  launched its competitive HCV drug  Viekira Pak  which followed Merck s  NYSE MRK  competitive offering  Zepatier  launched at the beginning of the year  The increased competition led to an inevitable loss of market share and a price war  Harvoni sells for 94K for the length of the treatment  Sovaldi for 84K  while Merck s Zepatier costs 54K for the identical course 
All three companies are applying for approval in China  where it is estimated that 10 to 20 million Chinese citizens have Hepatitis C  Perhaps more significant in the short term  on June 28 the FDA approved Epculsa  Gilead s newest HCV treatment  which is effective for all six major forms of HCV   the first of its kind  For comparison  Harvoni is used primarily to treat genotype 1  the most common form of Hepatitis C in the US and Europe 
Because of the recent introduction  the new drug s financial impact won t be visible in the coming report  but its longer term effect could be significant in upcoming quarters 

3  Balance Sheet and Valuation
Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for owning Gilead is its strong balance sheet  The  115B company has over  21B in cash assets  and is engaged in a stock buyback program which has taken over  8 billion worth of shares out of circulation  Its current liabilities are under  11B  which means Gilead has a ratio of Cash Current Liabilities of almost 2  Pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK   AbbVie and Merck all have a ratio of below 1 
The company s operating income for Q1 was  4 6B on  7 8B total revenue  meaning its operating margin is 59   which compares very well against Merck s 17  or AbbVie s 37   As of today  the company has a very low P E ratio of 7 4  significantly less than the industry average of 40  As if these numbers weren t impressive enough  the company also has over  17 7B of free cash flow  which means it trades at under 7 times its cash flow 
During June 2015  Gilead started handing back some of its excess cash to investors in the form of dividends  The dividend  which began as a quarterly  0 43 payout  grew to  0 47   a 9  increase   as recently as last month  With its current cash situation  it looks as if GILD will be able to grow its dividend when and as it wishes for the foreseeable future 

4  Developments in the R D pipeline
Stock prices often reflect future expected value  rather than present worth  For pharmaceutical companies  their R D pipeline may arguably be just as if not more important than their current product lineup  If that s the case  what s in Gilead s pipeline  We ve already mentioned Epculsa  above  which is expected to reclaim at least some of Gilead s lost HCV revenue  GILD s next big prospect is Simtuzumab  which is currently in a phase 2 study  The drug aims to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   If approved  it is expected to generate well over  10B in annual sales  Behind these two products  Gilead has seven late stage clinical trials and 16 additional phase two studies in the works  While its R D expenses  at  3B annually  are lower than Merck s or AbbVie s  they are on par with similarly sized GlaxoSmithKline  which indicates there s no scrimping at Gilead s end 
Conclusion
Gilead currently generates over  32B in annual revenue  It can no longer be considered an up and comer  as its share price has already exploded from the mid 30s in late 2012 to regularly being priced at over  110  which happened in 2014 and 2015 
Both its current performance and future prospects are looking good  Why then is it so undervalued 

With a P E ratio of 7 4  it appears the market is discounting any future growth  and may have already priced in a decline in profitability  We believe this is an incorrect assessment of the company and its potential 
An alternative explanation could be that unfortunately Gilead has been dragged down by the pharma sector as a whole  As evident by the current performance of the popular SPDR S P Biotech ETF  NYSE XBI   which is now trading at  59 35 well below its all time high of  91 1 a year ago the entire sector is still hurting  nor has it recovered from the early 2016 Valeant  NYSE VRX  price gouging fiasco which pulled the sector down significantly 
Notwithstanding all of the above  we believe it s merely a matter of time before Gilead s share price recovers  The company s revenues are immense  its operating margin is extraordinary  cash is flowing freely  and the company is buying back stock 
The way we see it  Gilead is like a high end race car  spinning its wheels at the starting line  held back only by the weight of the sector in which it operates  Once that drag is removed  we believe it will take off at top speed  potentially leaving at least some competitors in the dust ",2016-07-24,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-things-to-watch-when-gilead-sciences-reports-on-monday-200143735,200143735
147703,369219,BHC,Is Valeant The Next Enron ,opinion,"Earlier this year in March  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  stock plunged in one day from  70 to  36  I had not paid much attention to the VRX saga until then  When I examined the financials I was quite aghast with what looked to be the potential for  
The financials are riddled with multiple accounting improprieties  if not outright fraud  The balance sheet sports over  31 billion in debt against just  9 billion in tangible assets  It s tangible net worth is negative  32 6 billion 
I stopped following the Valeant saga once Bill Ackman made a lot of noise announcing a new CEO and board  I figured the stock would bob and weave before and after every press release Ackman crafted to generate interest in the stock  Early April was  on the stock  although I ve considered featuring it my  as a great short idea 
But today  VRX stock caught my attention because it dropped over 6  on heavy volume for no apparent reason  Upon closer inspection  it looks like VRX may be in danger of violating its debt covenants this year 
VRX appears to be in an irreversible debt spiral  Valeant s current credit rating from Moody s is B2  VRX s ratings have been on a downward path for several years  Typically this is an irreversible path that eventually leads to bankruptcy of some kind or a pre pack debt restructuring 
I was fooling around with graphs earlier and noticed an absolutely stunning similarity between Enron s stock and Valeant s stock 


Where there s smoke in the stock market  there s usually fire  At some point I would bet   in fact I am betting with puts   that VRX shareholders are going to get doused with napalm But hey  stock and bond investors should be grateful  Moody s had Enron rated triple A until just before it filed for bankruptcy  At least with VRX  Moody s has been gracious enough to give investors a  heads up  ",2016-08-02,David I.

147704,369220,BHC,Mattress Firm Stock Is In The Danger Zone,opinion,"A beaten down company will always find its suitors  those wanting to  pick up the pieces  or buy the bottom  This week s Danger Zone pick is down 32  year to date  but it is not a good value and carries high downside risk  Unsustainable revenue growth  destructive acquisitions  and declining profits land Mattress Firm  NASDAQ MFRM   31 share  in the Danger Zone 
Revenue Growth Masks Soaring Losses
Mattress Firm s   the true cash flows of the business  have declined from   14 million in fiscal 2012 to   111 million over the trailing twelve months  These losses come despite revenue growing from  704 million in fiscal 2012 to  2 5 billion in fiscal 2015  or 38  compounded annually 
Revenues have continued to grow to  2 8 billion over the last twelve months  Figure 1 highlights the disconnect between revenue and cash flow  See the reconciliation of Mattress Firm s GAAP net income to economic earnings  
Figure 1  MFRM s Losses Grow Despite Revenue Growth

In its quest be the leading mattress retailer  since 2013  MFRM has made over 15 separate acquisitions for upwards of  1 4 billion  Most recently  the firm paid  795 million for the acquisition of HMK Mattress Holdings in February 2016  While these acquisitions are   they are highly dilutive to cash flows and MFRM s balance sheet 
From 2013 2016  Mattress Firm s debt grew 42  compounded annually to  2 1 billion  Over the last twelve months  debt has ballooned to nearly  2 9 billion  more than double the current market cap 
The telltale sign that these acquisitions have been a raw deal for investors is the steady deterioration of MFRM s return on invested capital     Since earning a 10  ROIC in 2012  Mattress Firm s ROIC has more than halved to a bottom quintile 4  over the last twelve months  Similarly  MFRM has burned  1 6 billion in free cash flow from 2013 2016  and over the last twelve months  FCF sits at   603 million 
Executive Compensation Rewards Destroying Shareholder Value
Apart from base salaries  executives at Mattress Firm receive annual cash bonuses and long term stock based awards  The cash bonuses are granted solely for meeting adjusted EBITDA targets  As seen in Figure 2 below  adjusted EBITDA presents MFRM in a much more positive light than the true profits of the business  which misalign executives incentives with those of investors 
By removing costs such as compensation expense or acquisition costs  executives can grow the top line and adjusted metrics with little or no attention paid to the economics of their actions  Additionally  we ve seen the damaging effects that incentivizing executives with stock price targets can have  particularly at Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  
The best way to create shareholder value  and align executives with the best interest of shareholders  is to tie performance bonuses to ROIC because there is a  
Adjusted EBITDA Rises While Profits Decline
Investors analyzing non GAAP metrics would believe Mattress Firm s business is achieving great success  Mattress Firm is a prime example of how companies  of the business  Here are expenses MFRM has removed when calculating its non GAAP metrics  including adjusted EBITDA  adjusted EPS  and adjusted cash EPS 
Loss on store closing and impairment of store assets
Loss from debt extinguishment
Stock based compensation
Secondary offering costs
Acquisition related costs
ERP system implementation costs
These costs have a material impact on results  particularly acquisition related costs  In 2016  MFRM removed  23 million  35  of GAAP net income  in acquisition related costs to calculate its adjusted EBITDA  After removing these costs  MFRM is able to report non GAAP results that are not only much improved from economic earnings  but rapidly rising when cash flows are declining 
Adjusted EBITDA grew from  87 million in 2012 to  255 million in 2016  or 31  compounded annually  Over this same time  GAAP net income grew 17  compounded annually while economic earnings declined from   14 million to   55 million  or  41  compounded annually  per Figure 2 
Figure 2  Misleading Non GAAP Metrics

Low Profitability In A High Margin Industry
The retail mattress market is well known to have exorbitantly high markup on its products  Such markup provides excellent opportunity for profits  which ultimately breeds competition  The mattress market is highly fragmented  and MFRM faces competition from regional and local stores such as America s Mattress  retail furniture stores like Ashley Furniture  Haverty s  and Rooms to Go  department stores like Macy s and J C  Penney  and large retailers like Wal Mart  Costco  and Amazon 
This list doesn t even mention the new start up online mattress retailers such as Casper  Tuft   Needle  Saatva  and Leesa  Unfortunately for investors  MFRM has not been able to translate these high markup prices to high margins or a high ROIC  As seen in Figure 3  MFRM s ROIC ranks well below most competitors and its margins hardly surpass big box retailers better known for selling products with razor thin margins 
Figure 3  MFRM s  Retail Like  Profitability

Bull Hopes Rest On Happy Ending to Roll Up
First  we ve seen this movie before  In my experience on Wall Street  going on 20 years   there have been precious few roll ups that have a happy ending  Most of them end with investors realizing the emperor has no clothes  or the consolidator has no cash flows 
Roll ups make the insiders  corporate executives and Wall street bankers  lots of money  and investors should not be surprised to see these folks touting the roll up plan  Remember that these insiders  interests are not aligned with yours  As we detail below  Mattress Firm s roll up pitch fits the description of a roll up scheme very well 
Prior to the HMK Mattress Holdings acquisition  the mattress market was highly fragmented  Post acquisition  MFRM stated the combined firm would have a 21  share of the mattress market  As market share climbs  roll up strategies become harder to execute  because the impact of acquisitions becomes ever smaller 
As such  those betting on the future growth of Mattress Firm are betting on the inevitable end of the roll up and successful  more importantly profitable  integration of all the acquired firms 
However  without the constant acquisitions to grow the top line and poor organic growth  the bull case appears rather weak  Since 2012  total sales have grown on average 38  each year  Excluding new stores  comparable store sales have grown only 4  on average each year since 2012 
Even the revenue growth numbers are misleading  Once the roll up strategy comes to an end  revenue growth will follow the negative trend that profits have been setting for years 
Investors have taken note of the lack of organic growth at MFRM  but as we ll show below  even after falling 32  YTD  MFRM is still priced for significant profit growth  Such profit growth is unlikely to be achieved with such low comparable store sales 
The current expectations baked into the stock price require the acquisitions to continue  but also become immediately profitable  which has not occurred as of yet 
Even if you think the roll up strategy will work  you have to be mindful of new entrants providing mattresses at much cheaper price points  Online mattress firms  such as Casper and Tuft   Needle  cut out middlemen like Mattress Firm  They are more profitable because they don t require the costly overhead of showrooms or commissioned sales staff as they ship mattresses directly to buyers 
While this shift in business model is certainly too new to judge its overall effect  there is no debating that cutting out middlemen and providing consumers cheaper products is a threat to the viability of Mattress Firm s business model 
The largest risk to the bear case is what we call     With a stock price that is down YTD  another firm could step in and acquire MFRM at a value that is much higher than the current market price  As we ll show below  only in the event a firm is willing to destroy shareholder value is MFRM worth more than its current share price 
Unraveling Roll Up Worth Acquiring 
The biggest risk to our thesis  apart from MFRM continuing to acquire smaller competitors to maintain non GAAP growth  would be if an outside firm was to acquire MFRM at a value at or above today s price 
Despite being the industry leader  we ll show below that Mattress Firm is not an attractive acquisition target because unless a buyer is willing to destroy shareholder value  an acquisition at current prices would be unwise 
To begin  MFRM has liabilities that investors may not be aware of that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest 
 1 4 billion in   122  of market cap 
 52 million in   5  of market cap 
 19 million in   2  of market cap 
 8 million in    1  of market cap 
After adjusting for these liabilities  which total 129  of market cap  we can model multiple purchase price scenarios  Even in the most optimistic of scenarios MFRM is worth less than the current share price 
Figure 4 shows what we think Wal Mart should pay for MFRM  given different growth scenarios that account for the capital outlay required to achieve such a scenario  Because MFRM is the largest mattress retailer  any acquiring firm would likely be another furniture store or big box retailer 
WMT acquiring MFRM could lead to more efficient supply chain management  cost reductions due to WMT s massive distribution footprint  or even increased sales through marketing efforts or integration of MFRM s products into WMT stores  However  there are limits on how much WMT would pay for MFRM given the cash flows being acquired
Each implied price is based on a DCF scenario  linked below  assuming different levels of future revenue growth 
  51  in  estimated  year one  6  in  estimated  year two  and 4  in  estimated  year 3 and beyond 
  51  in  estimated  year one  6  in  estimated  year two  and 6  in  estimated  year 3 and beyond 
  51  in  estimated  year one  6  in  estimated  year two  and 8  in  estimated  year 3 and beyond
In each scenario  the estimated revenue growth rates in year one and two equal the consensus estimates for 2016  51   and 2017  6    For the subsequent years  we use 4  in scenario one because it represents the average same store sales growth since 2012 
We use 6  in scenario two because it represents a continuation of 2017 expectations  We use 8  in scenario three because it represents the average 2017 expected revenue growth rate of all 47 Household Durables firms under coverage 
Additionally  we assume MFRM s invested capital increases  968 million in estimated year 1  which is equivalent to the change in net working capital and fixed assets after the acquisition of HMK Mattress Holdings  This acquisition grew MFRM s store count by over 40  and accounts for much of the revenue growth expected in estimated year 1 
We  then  conservatively assume that WMT can grow MFRM s revenue and NOPAT free cash flow without any incremental capital outlays after year 1  an unlikely and very optimistic scenario  We also assume MFRM achieves a 7  NOPAT free cash flow margin  which is the highest margin achieved since 2013 when acquisition activity began ramping up 
For reference  MFRM s current NOPAT margin is 4 6   This assumption  while optimistic  creates a scenario where acquisitions stop post takeover  and the new parent firm focuses on profitability not topline growth  As shown below  even in this best case scenario  MFRM is not worth acquiring at current prices 
The resulting implied values for MFRM in each scenario represent the maximum amount WMT should pay for MFRM  given the expected cash flows and the costs to achieve those cash flows 
Figure 4  The Best Case Scenario Value for MFRM If Acquired

  values in millions except per share amounts 
  value destroyed equals the difference between implied price and acquisition at current market price plus net assets liabilities 
Figure 4 shows that even if Mattress Firm can grow revenue 15  compounded annually  achieve 7  NOPAT margins  and require no excess capital spending  beyond year 1  for the next five years  the most WMT should pay for the firm is  24 share   a 23  downside from current price 
Note in even the most optimistic scenario that the average ROIC over five years only equals 8   which is slightly below WMT s 10  ROIC  In order to achieve an ROIC equal to its current ROIC  WMT would either need to pay below  24 share  or grow MFRM s revenue greater than 15  compounded annually while spending  0 in incremental invested capital 
Without Acquisition  Shares Remain Overvalued
On its own  MFRM still has unrealistically high expectations already baked into the current stock price  Specifically  to justify the current price of  31 share  MFRM must maintain 2016 NOPAT margins  6   and 
In this scenario  MFRM would be generating over  7 4 billion in revenue 11 years from now  For reference  MFRM notes in its 2016 10 K that the entire U S  retail market totaled  14 billion in 2014  of which specialty mattress retailers accounted for 47  of sales 
Put another way  current expectations imply MFRM reaching a sales volume that is greater than the market share of all retail mattress firms in 2014  MFRM must take significant market share from any and all competition over the next decade  which seems unlikely given disruptive new competition and common antitrust laws made to stop exactly such an event 
Even if we assume MFRM can maintain 2016 NOPAT margins and   the stock is only worth  16 share today   a 48  downside 
Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets after  estimated  year 1  an assumption that is unlikely  even if the firm ceased destructive acquisitions 
We make assumption to show investors just how optimistic they must be about the future cash flows of this company to warrant owning the stock  For reference  MFRM s invested capital has grown on average  501 million  20  of 2016 revenue  each year since 2013 
Catalyst  MFRM Runs Out Of Options
Mattress Firm finds itself in a tough position  It has acquired its way to the top of the market  but has none of the profits to show for it  Moving forward  MFRM has a few options each of which do not meet the expectations baked into the stock price 
Continue the roll up strategy  MFRM could continue acquiring smaller competitors in an effort to grow the top line and boost non GAAP metrics  However  this option may be difficult  as the firm s total debt is now more than double its market cap  which could make funding future acquisitions difficult  At the same time  the firm s non GAAP earnings cannot cover its cash costs  and with MFRM s climbing debt  it could only be a matter of time before the costs of the debt outweigh the benefits of acquiring additional revenue 
Focus on organic growth  MFRM could cease its roll up strategy and focus on growing its organic business  However  as noted above  without rapid sales growth  and cost cutting  it s hard to see the organic growth at MFRM reaching levels that meet the expectations already baked into the stock price 
At the end of the day  neither of these options meets the current expectations embedded in the market price  If MFRM ends the roll up  its growth story comes to a fast end  and the firm s valuation would adjust accordingly  At the same time  if it abandons the roll up  investors will quickly realize the emperor has no clothes 
Insider Action Is Strong While Short Interest Is High
Over the past 12 months 2 7 million insider shares have been purchased and 204 000 have been sold for a net effect of 2 5 million insider shares purchases  These purchases represent 7  of shares outstanding  which is a strong number for insider purchases  Additionally  there are 7 2 million shares sold short  or just over 19  of shares outstanding 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Mattress Firm s 2016 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  199 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  88 million in non operating expenses  3  of revenue   We removed  143 million related to  and  56 million related to   See all adjustments made to MFRM s income statement  
Balance Sheet  we made  1 6 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of  1 2 million  The most notable adjustment was  1 4 billion  100  of net assets  related to   See all adjustments to MFRM s balance sheet  
Valuation  we made  2 9 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  2 9 billion  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  The largest adjustment was the removal of  2 9 billion  254  of market cap  due to   which includes  1 4 billion in

147711,369227,BHC,This Crushed Biotech Leader Is Trying To Break Out,opinion,"When you think of stocks that have been crushed  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  comes to mind 
How bad has it been for VRX  How about a 90  decline in less than a year  which may have something to do with the biotech sector s huge under performance compared to the broad market over the past 12 months 

We believe that for the broad market to keep going higher  it wants needs biotech and financials to start doing better  
So far  the only thing Valeant has proven is that investors want out of the stock 
If VRX is to start heading higher  it has to first prove it can break free from its 1 year falling channel  which is where it lost 90  of its value 
What VRX does with the test of resistance at  1  should have a big impact on the stock  the biotech sector and the broad markets

147731,369247,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals Stock  Gains On Coming,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  
Valeant Pharmaceuticals has been an incredibly interesting stock to follow for nearly a year now  Late last year  news surfaced that the company had misled its investors using a relationship with its biggest customer  Since then  the stock has declined dramatically  However  the company has made several changes to improve its business and appease investors  Now  there s a big conversation surrounding whether or not the stock will recover  Today  we ll talk about the scandal that led to the declines  what we ve seen from the company since  and why I believe that VRX will likely soar in the long run 
The Scandal That Started It All
For quite some time  VRX had a relationship with a pharmacy known as Philidor  This pharmacy just so happened to be the company s largest customer  generating massive amounts of sales  However  the actual sales generated weren t enough for Valeant  Instead of simply reporting the numbers as is  the company padded the numbers  misleading investors to believe that more money was being made than the actual sales would have allowed for 
This could have stayed under wraps for quite some time  However  late last year  there were several questions surrounding VRX and their pricing practices  As a result  the government launched an investigation into the company  Of course  when government investigations are going on  analysts want to investigate as well  This is where Citron comes in 
An analyst firm known as Citron decided to launch their own independent investigation into VRX  During their investigation  they found the misleading statements made by Valeant  and the relationship with Philidor that allowed the scandal to happen  Soon  Citron published a report  making the scandal public and calling Valeant the Enron of the pharmaceutical industry 
VRX Has Made Big Changes Since The Scandal
Since the scandal  VRX has been forced to make several changes to the way it does things  After all  the old way doesn t work if it allows for the misleading of investors  So  the changes started with a cancellation of he agreement with Philidor  the agreement that made the scandal possible 
Shortly after announcing that the company had cut ties with Philidor  Valeant announced something new  The company would be signing an agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  NASDAQ WBA  under which Walgreens would start to carry their products  This would help with the amount of sales lost due to the Philidor cancellation 
Finally  VRX has also made several changes to management  First and foremost  the company replaced the CEO  J  Michael Pearson  with a well respected member of the Pharmaceuticals industry  Joseph Papa  On top of that  the company has also added two members to its Board of Directors   one being Activist Investor Bill Ackman 
Why I Believe The Stock Will Climb From Here
There s no denying the fact that Valeant Pharmaceuticals was in the wrong when it comes to the Philidor scandal  However  that doesn t mean that the company is dead in the water  VRX has fallen by far more than 70  at this point  but has not lost nearly that much in revenue nor earnings  While it may take some time to regain investor trust  with the changes the company has made  things are turning positive in a big way  So  in the long run  buying now will likely lead to big gains

147732,369248,BHC,We Like Valeant Pharmaceuticals For A Trade ,opinion,"Considering it costs  2 5 to  5 Billion from the initial Research phase to bringing a new drug to market  the  32 Billion in VRX Debt given their other assets  and proven drug portfolio makes this stock look cheap here on a valuation basis 
I bet I could find a buyer willing to pay  50 a share for Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  over the weekend if Bill Ackman wasn t in such a hole on this stock  and needs a much higher price given the average stock price on his accumulated share stake 
Given that there is going to be further consolidation in this space  and the high costs associated with organically generating new drugs for the marketplace with no guarantees of success   VRX looks like an attractive take out candidate to me  Their debt is actually in line with many utilities trading at much higher valuations with much lower revenue generation capabilities from both an overall margins and gross profit standpoint

147733,369249,BHC,Big Pharma On The Hunt For Profit,opinion,"With a record  724 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions  M A  in the pharmaceutical sector  2015 would be a truly difficult year to duplicate   much less follow 
Especially since much of that M A activity was conducted by specialty pharmaceutical companies  whose business model is now in disrepute after the fall of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  NYSE VRX  
That model involved serial acquisitions of companies possessing the rights to niche drugs  and then skyrocketing the price of those drugs 
This leaves just the pharmaceutical giants in the M A game  And they seem most willing to play  despite the collapse of the  160 billion merger between Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  
The Need for Speed
Just look at what happened on April 28  when three deals   totaling  45 billion   were announced  The assets included Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT   Abbvie  NYSE ABBV   and Sanofi  NYSE SNY  
Big pharma companies like Pfizer  Merck  NYSE MRK  and others are looking to find growth anywhere they see a glimpse of profit 
These wily acquisitions  however  are bound to push U S  politicians to clamp down on price hikes  which was once a fairly easy way for big pharma to increase earnings  But without moderation  the general public is balking at paying higher prices for drugs that were once more affordable 
This leaves pharmaceutical companies scrambling for a new way to maximize their sales without further aggravating the powers that be  And it s looking like the beaten down biotechnology sector is the perfect avenue 
For instance  in May  Pfizer bought the small biotech firm Anacor Pharmaceuticals for  5 2 billion  Anacor is developing an eczema drug that Pfizer believes could lead to peak annual sales of more than  2 billion 
Low interest rates are also aiding the big pharma companies in their hunt for profit  because it is still relatively easy to borrow money at practically nothing to fund purchases 
In fact  the Financial Times reports that the major pharma companies have already accrued more than  50 billion in debt since the start of 2016  That is the second highest sum in two decades 
It would appear that the big pharmaceutical companies are loading up on ammo to pursue those smaller biotechnology companies   like Pfizer s deal 
Precision M A
The difference from then until now is that large pharma companies have become a lot more focused 
Most large pharmaceutical companies are pursuing what Joe Jiminez  CEO of Novartis AG  NYSE NVS   calls  precision  M A 
Jiminez explains that this kind of deal making is a drastic change from the mega mergers of the past  which often left the newly merged company with nothing more than a collection of assets and cultures that really didn t fit well together 
But now  instead of having exposure to a wide swath of therapies  most big pharma firms are focusing on just a few segments   vaccines  for example 
Vaccines are a growing business  with viruses like Zika in the headlines  There are only the  big four  left in the vaccine business  the aforementioned Pfizer  Merck  Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK  
This means that drug companies will likely be facing less than a handful of other competitors in a specialty market  rather the wild free for all of the past where many companies competed against one other in nearly every disease category 
Of course  there are always exceptions 
Johnson   Johnson
In the case of big pharma  the exception is Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   which still follows a conglomerate approach to the healthcare industry  JNJ is the world s largest healthcare company  with three main divisions   consumer products  pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
It has come under increasing pressure from activist investors like Artisan Partners Limited Partnership  which wants it to split those sectors into three separate companies 
JNJ has  for the most part  sat out the M A spree of the past couple years  But I expect the company to make a splash this year with acquisitions for its pharmaceuticals division 
With much of its over  18 billion in cash  trapped  overseas  and with the Brexit knocking down U K  and European assets  I would not be surprised to see even the conservative Johnson   Johnson go on a shopping spree in the U K    a country which has a lot of promising biotech firms 
It needs the growth perhaps more so than even the other big pharmaceutical companies 
With drug pricing under pressure from multiple sources  expect big pharma   even JNJ   to remain on the hunt for small  fast growing biotech companies

147734,369250,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals Stock  Gaining On Licensing Changes,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  
Valeant Pharmaceuticals is having an incredible day in the market today and for good reason  The company made an announcement early this morning with regard to an agreement it has with AstraZeneca PLC  NYSE AZN   Today  we ll talk about the announcement  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from VRX moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
VRX Announces Amendments To AZN Agreement
In August of 2015  Valeant Pharmaceuticals entered into an agreement with AstraZeneca surrounding a drug known as brodalumab  Brodalumab is an IL 17 receptor monoclonal antibody  The treatment is currently under regulatory review for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
According to the announcement today  the two companies have decided to terminate the company s right to develop and commercialize the treatment in Europe  Under the amended agreement  VRX will maintain the license to develop and commercialize the treatment in the United States  The company will also retain the license to develop and commercialize brodalumab in the remainder of territories outside of the United States 
In exchange for VRX agreeing to terminate rights in Europe  AZN will offer payment  First and foremost  there will be an upfront payment of a currently undisclosed amount  On top of that  Valeant Pharmaceuticals will still be receiving certain sales based milestone payments  Finally  one of the pre launch milestone payments has been reduced  but is still active  In a statement  Joseph C  Papa  Chairman and CEO at VRX had the following to offer 

 We are pleased with this new licensing arrangement for broadalumab  which enables us to more sharply focus our efforts on delivering this important treatment to patients in the U S  and other key markets  while providing us with immediate value and significant ongoing exposure to the treatment s commercialization in Europe  Our current focus is on the upcoming advisory panel  where we will have the opportunity to discuss brodalumab treatment options for adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and provide information about this novel antibody we are developing  

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that the news moves the market  Any time positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock associated with the company  The news released by VRX today was overwhelmingly positive  So naturally  we re seeing gains in the value of the stock  Currently  11 58   the stock is trading at  20 92 per share after a gain of  0 81 per share or 4 03  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from VRX  First and foremost  I m excited about today s amended agreement news  As a result of the amended agreement  Valeant Pharmaceuticals not will receive immediate payments  On top of that  the company will also be receiving milestone payments as the treatment makes it to the market  However  today s announcement isn t the only reason that I maintain a bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from VRX 
Throughout the past several months  the company has been struggling as the result of the Philidor scandal  However  since the scandal  we ve seen nothing but positive news  With a new CEO  new board members  new contracts and more  it seems as though VRX is finally headed in the right direction  All in all  I m expecting to see long run gains from the stock

147754,369270,BHC,Democrats lean on drug pricing as Obamacare repeal looms,news,By Susan Cornwell and Caroline Humer WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    Democrats are showing little interest in cooperating with the Republicans who control Congress on legislation to dismantle the Obamacare health insurance law but some are signaling a willingness to collaborate on action to curb rising drug prices  Republican U S  President elect Donald Trump pledged two weeks ago to bring down drug prices  addressing an issue that could appeal to voters in both parties  He did not say how he would accomplish this although he previously suggested he was open to allowing importation of cheaper medicines from overseas  Nineteen Senate Democrats this week urged Trump to push the issue with Republican lawmakers  many of whom have resisted government action to rein in medication costs  Persistently rising drug prices have imposed a heavy burden on consumers  Many Americans cannot afford their medicines or face increasing co pays on prescription drugs  The 2010 Affordable Care Act  dubbed Obamacare  enabled about 20 million Americans who previously had no medical insurance to get coverage  It is considered outgoing Democratic President Barack Obama s signature legislative achievement and an important accomplishment for his party  Republicans  who will control both the White House and in 2017  condemn it as a government overreach  Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to repeal and replace it  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said senators will start the repeal process shortly after Jan  1  Trump takes office on Jan  20  A House of Representatives leadership aide told reporters drug pricing was one of several areas Republicans would use to reach out to Democrats to solicit their involvement in Obamacare replacement legislation  along with the Medicaid insurance program for the poor  and children s healthcare    We are going to try and find where the other side wants to engage   the aide said  Democrats may be difficult to persuade  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said drug pricing proposals might have been part of a bipartisan healthcare reform package to address Obamacare issues  if Republicans were not insisting on repeal first  placing the two parties in opposite camps    My vision before the election was that we would have some form of reform package  and now that s murky because of this effort to repeal   Klobuchar said in a telephone interview  PROCEDURAL HURDLES Republican lawmakers have angered Democrats with their plan to use arcane congressional budget procedures to repeal Obamacare as quickly as possible  without having to secure any Democratic votes  This approach would thwart procedural hurdles Democrats could pursue under normal circumstances  Republicans including Senator John Thune of South Dakota  a member of his party s Senate leadership  have said they want Democrats to work with them to replace Obamacare once it is repealed  They will almost certainly need them   In the 100 seat Senate  Republicans need a super majority of 60 to clear procedural hurdles and pass replacement legislation  With 52 Republican senators  they would need to attract at least eight Democrats   If they genuinely wanted to work with us on fixing the Affordable Care Act  we would have that conversation before they repealed   Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said of the Republicans  Americans can obtain health insurance from private insurers through the Affordable Care Act by buying it on state or federally run exchanges  In 2016  costs on the individual insurance market rose  Insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  and  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  pulled out for 2017  saying they were losing too much money  More insurers may drop out for 2018  making insurance plans more expensive   Lawmakers in both parties expressed outrage after Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV raised the price of a pair of the generic drugmaker s lifesaving EpiPen allergy treatments to more than  600 this year from  100 in 2008  Klobuchar has worked with Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley on drug pricing issues  introducing legislation that would help put an end to brand name drug companies paying generic drugmakers to delay marketing low cost competing medications  She was among the Democrats who sent Trump the letter on drug costs  They suggested five areas of cooperation  allowing the Medicare insurance program for the elderly to negotiate prescription prices  increasing transparency  stopping abusive pricing  encouraging incentives for innovation  and supporting generic competition for branded drugs  In addition  Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri this week released a report detailing drug pricing abuses at Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  International and Turing Pharmaceuticals  Health policy expert Joe Antos of the American Enterprise Institute think tank said Democrats may refuse to work on Obamacare replacement legislation for some time  especially if Republicans delay the repeal s effective date by up to three years   Democrats can just say  we don t have to do it now   Antos said  Stuart Butler of the Brookings Institution think tank said it will get harder for Democrats to stay on the sidelines after a repeal because hospitals  insurers and Americans who may lose their coverage will press for action   I think they  Democrats  will get as much political capital out of not engaging as they can  and then I think their own constituents will start to push them   Butler said

147764,369280,BHC,Valeant Dives On Earnings,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  is having a rough day in the market today  following up on losses that we saw from the stock yesterday  The reason for the decline is relatively simple  The company reported earnings that were well below expectations  and guidance wasn t much better  Nonetheless  don t count VRX out just yet  Today  we ll talk about earnings  how the market reacted to the news  and why the stock can still climb moving forward 
VRX Releases Upsetting Results
As mentioned above  Valeant Pharmaceuticals is having an incredibly rough time after reporting earnings for the first quarter  Here s what we saw from the report   

Earnings Per Share   In terms of earnings per share  VRX missed the mark in a big way  During the quarter  analysts were expecting that the company would generate earnings in the amount of  0 28 per share  However  the company actually generated a loss in the amount of  1 08 per share  missing expectations by a wide margin 
Revenue   In terms of revenue  VRX also missed the mark  While the company saw revenue increase by 9 3  quarter over quarter  analysts were expecting to see the figure come in at  2 38 billion  However  the company actually reported revenue in the amount of  2 37 billion 
Guidance   While both earnings and revenue proved to be concerning the most concerning part of the report  proved to be guidance  Valeant Pharmaceuticals has reduced its full year outlook yet again  For the year 2016  VRX is expecting to generate earnings between  6 60 and  7 per share  This falls well short of the previous guidance between  8 50 and  9 per share as well as analyst estimates which sit around  8 47 per share 

While the report was overwhelmingly negative  the company has made progress with regard to stabilizing the organization following the Philidor scandal  In a statement  Joseph Papa  CEO at VRX had the following to offer   

We have made progress toward stabilizing the organization over the past few months  and we expect to file our financial results in a timely manner going forward    Valeant Pharmaceuticals has a portfolio of world class brands  a strong new product pipeline and dedicated leaders who are committed to doing what is right and what is necessary to turn this company around by re engaging our workforce  rebuilding our relationships with prescribers  patients and payors  and regaining the trust of our debtholders and shareholders 

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that the news moves the market  Any time there is positive news released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock associated with the company as a result  However  the news that was released surrounding VRX was anything but positive  As a result  we re seeing declines in the value of the stock at the moment  Currently  12 28   VRX is trading at  23 82 per share after a loss of  0 82 per share or 3 33  thus far today  This follows wide losses we saw from the stock yesterday as well 
VRX Can Still Climb
There s no denying the fact that the earnings report released by Valeant Pharmaceuticals was overwhelmingly negative  However  it s important to keep in mind the fact that this was the first report since the Philidor scandal  Since the scandal  we ve seen a CEO change  board changes  and an agreement signed with Walgreens  Not to mention  with the 70   decline we ve seen since the scandal  the bad news was already priced in  Moving forward  I m expecting for Joseph Papa to do wonderful things with VRX  With a strong pipeline  great products  and a willingness to claw its way out of the hole it currently sits in  VRX looks like it s likely to head upward in the long run ",2016-06-08,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-dives-on-earnings-200134823,200134823

UA remains inside a uniform rising channel since the 2009 lows  As mentioned above  a Head and Shoulders topping pattern is NOT proven at this time  UA is testing dual support at  1   which seems important to hold for this high flying stock

147766,369282,BHC,Valeant s CEO Bought VRX Shares  But Here s Why You Shouldn t,opinion,"Joseph Papa  CEO of the controversial Valeant Pharmaceuticals   NYSE VRX    disclosed his purchase of 202 000 shares of VRX stock at the price of  24 48 per share   The total transaction is valued at close to  5 million  and disclosure of the purchase has helped to boost investor sentiment on Valeant shares today   Should you be bullish on Valeant though   Shares have lost a lot of weight over the last year  but the 89  stock price loss is warranted   Valeant shares have faced major backlash because of congressional and SEC investigations over its accounting methods  
VRX stock has lost 19  of its value in June because it missed first quarter earnings expectations   Upon the Q1 earnings release  VRX has also lowered its own earnings expectations for this year   This has left the sentiment on Valeant extremely bearish for the most part 
Valeant is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   and for good reason   After all  18 analysts have revised their quarterly earnings expectations lower for VRX over the last 60 days   No analysts have revised earnings expectations higher for this quarter  next quarter  the current year  or even the next fiscal year   20 analysts have lowered their EPS estimates for this fiscal year  as well as the next VALEANT PHARMA Revenue  Quarterly YoY Growth    Our quarterly EPS consensus has trended lower over the last 3 months   The estimate is 42  lower compared to where it was just 90 days ago   What s even more alarming is the fact that our current year EPS consensus has shrunk by 43 95  over the last 90 days  
As estimates trend lower  you may be better off waiting for VRX s EPS expectations to bottom out  as we have yet to find out what the company s true earnings potential is

For some time now  Valeant Pharmaceuticals has been struggling  However  at this point  the company is on a clear path to recovery  So  it s no surprise that we re starting to see takeover bids  Recently  a biotechnology company out of Japan  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co   Ltd   T 4502   and a private equity firm known as TPG  made an offer to takeover the company  If the takeover were successful  Takeda would focus on Salix Pharmaceuticals while TPG would handle the rest  However  VRX made the decision to reject the offer 
While the takeover bid didn t come with a firm price  it seems as though VRX wouldn t be willing to sell at just about any reasonable price at the moment  In fact  Mizuho analyst  Irina Koffer  said that she doesn t think the larger shareholders are willing to part with the stock at the moment  This is even if a strong premium were offered  Here s what she had to say 
 We think that large shareholders and Valeant Board members are so far underwater on their positions that they may be resistant to a potential bid which may  undervalue  the company  
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  Any time there is positive news associated with a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in that company s stock as a result  Adversely  negative news will generally cause declines  In this particular case  the news was overwhelmingly positive  First and foremost  investors tend to get excited when takeover bids are offered  However  in this particular case  the news that the company declined the bid is even more positive  The reality is that VRX has fallen dramatically  and many investors believed that declines would continue  If the management of the company felt the same  they would have sold out quickly  However  Valeant isn t ready for that  they see more gains coming  As a result  we re seeing strong movement in the value of the stock today  Currently  10 40   VRX is trading at  28 93 per share after a gain of  1 99 per share or 7 39  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Over the past month or so  I have been very forthcoming about my bullish opinion on VRX  The reality is that the company fell on an incredibly hard time  It had to deal with a scandal going public  which caused the loss of its biggest customer  However  in the months following the scandal  we ve seen incredible positivity  The company has switched out it s CEO  added members to its Board of Directors  and even signed a contract with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  NASDAQ WBA  for the sale of its treatments  While I know that it s going to take quite a while for investors to become confident in the stock once again  it s clear to me at this point that VRX is incredibly undervalued  The reality is that the company has made it over the hurdle and is now once again moving forward  As a result  I m expecting to see gains in the value of the stock moving forward ",2016-05-29,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-climbing-on-takeover-rejection!-200132759,200132759

Valeant Pharmaceuticals  the Canada based multinational specialty pharmaceutical company  has been under close scrutiny in the past several months as it has lost nearly 90  of its share price since August of 2015 on a string of negative news along with questionable business operations  In recent headlines  speculation has surfaced that VRX could stand to be a potential takeover target 
Analyst Expectations
An analyst at Piper Jaffray had the following comments on VRX 

Valeant takeover rejection report  difficult to fathom   says Piper Jaffray  Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem noted the report claiming that Valeant  VRX  previously rejected a takeover offer from Takeda  OTC TKPYY  and TPG prior to appointing Joe Papa as CEO  but said he finds it  difficult to fathom  why a buyer would have interest in the entire asset portfolio  since he believes the value of its segments to be  meaningfully  below the company s  31B in total debt outstanding  Amsellem  who thinks there would be significant strategic interest in Valeant s gastroenterology assets  believes that any strategic activity will come in the form of asset sales or a breakup of the company  The firm keeps an Underweight rating on Valeant shares    

VRX Technicals

Since August of 2015  VRX has plunged  230  or 90   VRX was once the most valuable company in Canada until the recent collapse fueled by constant negative news on their internal business practices 
Trading just off the lows  VRX does have huge risk reward potential as it starts to consolidate near its recent lows  Geometrically speaking  VRX has been slowly attempting to form a falling wedge pattern for several months and is nearing a completed pattern  Falling wedge patterns can resolve explosively to the upside once a proper resolution occurs  Ideally  a break of the falling wedge to the upside on high relative volume would signal a shift in momentum as the buy pressure pours in

147794,369310,BHC,Here s Why Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  Is Crashing Today,opinion,"On Tuesday  shares of struggling pharmaceutical company Valent Pharmaceuticals Inc    NYSE VRX   are crashing  down almost 15  in morning trading after the company reported dismal first quarter results 
Valeant  which is under scrutiny regarding its business and accounting practices  reported adjusted earnings per share of  1 27  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 42 per share and decreasing 45 7  year over year  this number excludes  2 35 from non recurring items  Revenues  however  came in at  2 4 billion  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 345 billion and increasing 9  year over year 
 The first quarter s results reflect  in part  the impact of significant disruption this organization has faced over the past nine months   said Joseph Papa  chairman and chief executive officer   This has been a difficult period for Valeant and its stakeholders  and while there are some challenges to work through in certain business operations in 2016  such as our U S  dermatology unit  the majority of our businesses are performing according to expectations  
As a result  Valeant slashed its full year earnings forecast to  6 60  7 00 per share  down from  8 50  9 50 per share  Revenue guidance was also cut  and the company now expects  9 9 billion  10 1 billion for the year compared to original projections of  11 billion  11 2 billion 
In late April  Valeant filed its 2015 financial report  calming concerns about a potential default on its debt of over  30 billion  The company missed the original deadline of March 15  which prompted an in house review of its accounting practices  the probe discovered problems dating back to 2014 ",2016-06-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here's-why-valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-is-crashing-today-200134560,200134560

Health Care   Pharmaceuticals   Reports June 7  Before Market Opens
Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 46 on  2 36 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and nearly  10 million on the top
Last month Valeant reiterated its Q1 guidance of  2 3 2 4 billion in revenue and earnings between  1 30 1 55
In its analyst call  Valeant must put to rest concerns over the  31 billion in long term debt and also deliver a viable growth strategy 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals is prepared to announce its first quarter results tomorrow before the market opens  This earnings report marks the second since a scandal last fall put the company in the public eye  Since then  the stock has dropped over 90   Michael Pearson  was ousted as CEO  and Bill Ackman was placed on the board in an attempt to save the company  Tomorrow also marks the first report under new CEO Joseph Papa and will give investors an early indication of the company s vision 
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 46 on  2 36 billion in revenue  4 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and nearly  10 million on the top  Compared to a year earlier this represents a 24  decline in earnings while sales are expected to grow by 13   Both earnings and revenue estimates have been cut by double digits since its last report  reflecting analysts negative sentiment towards the company  Just last month  Valeant confirmed Q1 earnings would fall within guidance given in its fourth quarter analyst call  Total revenue is expected in the range of  2 3 2 4 billion while EPS is forecasted in the range of  1 30 1 55 
For investors  the actual numbers are not as important as what is said during the analyst call  The company s old strategy of profitability  splash acquisitions and drug price increases  is no longer viable  Investors still don t have an idea for what to expect moving forward  Meanwhile  Valeant s fundamentals remain frightening  The company had over  31 billion in long term debt at the end of 2015  Without the possibility of raising its drug prices  Valeant will struggle to finance its debt  The company has already received multiple default notices associated with delayed filings of financial reports to the SEC 
With all these big questions remaining  everything hinges on what CEO Joseph Papa has to say tomorrow  If he can put investor s concerns to rest  the stock could be in store for a quick pop  Otherwise  shareholders should expect more of the same and perhaps another double digit decline

147821,369337,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceutical Stock  Gains On The Horizons,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  
Valeant Pharmaceuticals has had an incredibly hard time in the market as of late  and for good reason  Late last year  it was uncovered that the company was using its relationship with a pharmacy to fluff the numbers and make it look like it was doing better than it actually was  However  we ve seen quite a bit of change since the scandal  So  I believe that we re finally nearing the bottom of the declines  Today  we ll talk about the scandal  what s changed since  and what we can expect to see from VRX moving forward 
The VRX Scandal
Late last year  an analyst firm known as Citron decided to do some digging into Valeant  After all  the company had come under fire for pricing practices  but the stock was climbing  When Citron released their report  it was something that no one expected to see  According to their report  VRX and its biggest client  a pharmacy known as Philidor were giving false statements to investors  In fact  in the report  Citron called Valeant Pharmaceuticals the Enron of the pharmaceutical industry 
While I didn t want to believe the claims  more and more evidence came out proving that VRX had indeed done the wrong thing  Soon  the stock started to fall like a brick dropped from the empire state building  Unfortunately  there was no denying the facts anymore  it was time for Valeant to admit to the wrong doing  and make some changes 
That s Exactly What Happened
Once the Philidor scandal was uncovered  VRX found themselves trapped between a rock and a hard place  The company had to admit that it had done wrong  and make changes to make things whole again  That s exactly what happened  Here are some of the changes we ve seen since the Philidor scandal 
Philidor Agreement Was Canceled   Shortly after the news surfaced  VRX announced that it had canceled the agreement it had with Philidor  Of course  this excited investors  but it also meant that the company was giving up its biggest customer 
Walgreens   Valeant knew that without Philidor  it had to come up with something to keep sales rolling  After all  the pharmacy was their biggest customer  However  shortly after the news that the agreement between VRX and Philidor had been canceled  we heard the announcement of a new agreement  Walgreens had agreed to sell Valeant products  Although this didn t make up for sales loss completely  it did put a big dent into the lower sales volume issue 
Board Changes   As time passed  it was clear that VRX needed changes to management  After all  the management at the company allowed the scandal to happen  As a result  the company announced the addition of two activist investor board members 
CEO Changes   When it comes to things going wrong at a company  the end of the blame lies with the CEO of the company  As a result  it was announced recently that J  Michael Pearson  LON PSON  would be stepping down from his position as CEO of VRX  In his place  Joseph Papa was named the new leader of the company 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
At this point  I m incredibly impressed with the changes that we ve seen at Valeant Pharmaceuticals  While it is going to take time to win back the trust of investors  the company is clearly headed in the right direction now  All in all  I m expecting to see long run gains on the stock ",2016-05-13,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-gains-on-the-horizons!-200129681,200129681

147823,369339,BHC,This Week In Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  News,opinion,"Only a few things in life are certain  death  taxes  and Valeant Pharmaceuticals   NYSE VRX   making headlines  Well  at least that s what is has seemed like for the past several months  and the insanity that is VRX is continuing this week with a fresh swath of news from the company 
The first interesting thing to note is that the T  Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund  which held a 6 37  stake in Valeant at the end of 2015  revealed that it sold 90  of its position in the company during the first quarter 
Interestingly enough  this T  Rowe Price fund is managed by Taymour Tamaddon  who has been one of Valeant s biggest supporters for years  As  reports  Tamaddon has recommended Valeant since his days as a junior analyst over a decade ago  so it is certainly noteworthy that he and his fund have basically moved on 
While Tamaddon may finally be getting bearish on Valeant  another notable investor recently announced their support for VRX as a long term hold  Andrew Left  founder of short selling firm Citron Research  told  yesterday that he  wouldn t be surprised if there s a bounce  in the embattled drug stock 
 I don t think they re going to make any decisions that are going to torpedo the company   Left said in the interview 
Speaking of company decisions  Valeant has certainly made a few interesting ones recently  First of all  the company announced that it will reward some of its top executives with multi million dollar bonuses after navigating the company through  challenging times  
Chief financial officer Robert L  Rosiello  and executives Dr  Ari Kellen and Anne C  Whitaker will rake in  1 million retention bonuses in 2016 following the company s many recent struggles  including an accounting scandal  regulatory investigations  and pricing criticisms 
Valeant also  that it would be expanding a discount program for Nitropress and Isuprel  two expensive heart drugs  The company said that all hospitals are now eligible for at least a 10  rebate on the drugs  with some qualifying for a rebate of 40  
 Under this new program  the discounts we previously implemented for Nitropress and Isuprel will be simplified and more accessible   said Valeant chief executive Joseph Papa 
Valeant previously received criticism for its pricing of Nitropress and Isuprel  The company acquired the treatments in February of last year and immediately raised the prices of the already established drugs 
It is certainly shaping up to be another busy week for Valeant and its investors with all of this news  As always  you ll want to keep your eyes on the headlines for the latest regarding this stock ",2016-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-week-in-valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-news-200130525,200130525

147826,369342,BHC,Fed Rate Rise Not Enough For Currency Peace,opinion,"Last week  several Fed officials suggested they might raise interest rates at the Fed meeting scheduled for June 14 and 15 
The dollar strengthened and the gold price declined following their statement  suggesting the  Currency Cold War  of the last few years may be ending 
However  the likely 0 25  rate increase is nowhere near enough to end the Currency Cold War  or even reduce the chance of a hot war 
So long as interest rates remain below the inflation rate  the financial system is unstable and heading for a crash 
Rates Not Rising Enough
Another Fed rate rise in June will take the federal funds target range to 0 50  to 0 75  
However  inflation is still around 2   the  core  consumer price index was up 2 1  in the 12 months to May   Hence real interest rates are still below negative 1  
What s more  the Fed is unlikely to undertake the four rate rises that were forecast at the beginning of the year  At most  the Fed is likely to raise rates just one more time at the four remaining Federal Open Market Committee meetings in 2016 
At that rate of progress  with rates rising at 0 50  per annum  the federal funds rate won t reach a target rate of 2  to 2 25   level with inflation  until the middle of 2019 
Given that the Bank of England  the European Central Bank  ECB   and the Bank of Japan  BoJ  are pursuing more stimulative policies  the Currency Cold War will continue  or be replaced with something worse 
Negative real interest rates cause the amount of free money sloshing around to increase exponentially  because borrowing is so cheap   especially when money is injected into the system  as the ECB and the BoJ are doing  That  in turn  leads to wild currency fluctuations  not the milder  slower moves that occur when money is expensive and speculators are scarce 
We now know the picture won t change with the arrival of a new President in January   supports Janet Yellen and her easy money policies  while  has now confessed himself a  low interest rate guy    a pity nobody asked him this question earlier in the primary process  when it might have made a difference 
If nothing disrupts the U S  economy  the achingly slow interest rate rises will continue 
Trouble Ahead
In practice  disruption is likely to arrive well before 2019 
The current low rate policy  which has been in effect since 2008  brought about a massive flood of  malinvestment   These misguided investments will have to be washed out of the economy before healthy growth can resume 
Think of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX   the drug company whose business model was to buy smaller companies  jack up the prices of their drugs by 100  to 500   and hope the drug buyers wouldn t notice  That s  30 billion of wobbly debt  right there 
Then there are the energy master limited partnerships like Breitbart Energy Partners LP  NASDAQ BBEP  that bought assets when oil was  100 per barrel and hoped the derivatives market would take away their oil price risk  It didn t 
Then there are the gigantic hotel projects  several times the size of the market  whose empty silence makes you feel like a Pharaoh buried under a pyramid when you visit 
Finally  there s the high tech taxi service valued at  50 billion   maybe healthy  but massively inflated in value 
The unhealthiness of the current economy is demonstrated by productivity growth  averaging only 0 6  annually over the last five years and negative in the last quarter  compared to an average of 2  annually before 2007  Frankly  it s unlikely the current economy can continue until 2019 without a massive financial crisis  however hard the Fed may attempt to avoid one 
At the point  the Fed and other central banks may come to their senses  ending the Currency Cold War  Unfortunately  they ll most likely push us into negative interest rates  intensifying it   though that would give us some wonderful profit opportunities  if we re nimble 
Another possibility is that continued stimulus will be accompanied by a true attempt to push the dollar down  possibly accompanied by Trumpean tariffs  At that point  the Currency Cold War will turn hot 
But with my Currency and Capital new Hillary Hedge  or Trump Trade  of a long term gold call option  we re ready for that  too

147827,369343,BHC,Danger Zone  XPO Logistics,opinion,"Stop us if you ve heard this scenario before  soaring debt  significant shareholder dilution  multiple large acquisitions  and executives paid for stock price performance  all of which results in massive revenue growth with no profits  No we re not talking about Valeant  NYSE VRX  or Perrigo  NYSE PRGO  or any prior Danger Zone stocks  We re talking about XPO Logistics  NYSE XPO   which looks like another roll up scheme  for the Danger Zone this week 
Acquisitions Boost Revenue While Killing Profits and Diluting Investors
Over the past few years  XPO Logistics has engaged in aggressive acquisitions that have fueled revenue growth upwards of 100  compounded annually over the past five years  These acquisitions  specifically the buyouts of Norbert Dentressangle and of Con way Freight  which totaled over  6 5 billion  were done with little regard to the economic cash flow repercussions  As can be seen in Figure 1  XPO Logistics  economic earnings  the true cash flows of business  have declined from  1 million in 2010 to   310 million in 2015  See the reconciliation of XPO Logistics  GAAP net income to economic earnings  

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Aside from negative economic earnings  XPO s return on invested capital  ROIC  has fallen from 12  in 2010 to a bottom quintile 2  over the last twelve months 
Major Dilution  Acquisitions Funded At Expense Of Investors 
Adding to the issues  XPO has greatly increased debt and diluted shareholders over this time frame  2010 2015  XPO s debt grew over 290  compounded annually to  7 3 billion  238  of market cap   Its shares outstanding grew from 33 million to 110 million  or 27  compounded annually from 2010 2015  Essentially  XPO funded its acquisition based growth at the expense of shareholders  while deriving no profits 
Shareholder Destructive Acquisitions Driven By Misaligned Executive Compensation
We blame XPO s executive compensation plan for the acquisitions that dilute shareholders  grow debt and lose money  Apart from cash bonuses  which are tied to meeting  adjusted EBITDA  goals  over 80  of the CEO s pay and over 50  of other executives  pay is awarded via long term incentive restricted stock units  RSUs  
Vesting of these RSU s is tied directly to stock price and  adjusted cash earnings per share   Essentially  management has been incentivized to grow XPO s stock price at almost any cost   7 5 million in 2015 RSUs vest if XPO trades above  60 share for 20 consecutive days prior to April 2  2018  or above  86 share for 20 consecutive days prior to September 2  2020  and the company can meet the cash EPS goals  In 2016  executives were granted  38 million in RSU s for the 2016 2019 period that vest based upon the achievement of target  adjusted cash flow per share  metrics  Executives were given the green light for on an acquisition spree and as the high low fallacy shows  executives can increase EPS through value destructive acquisitions  all while profiting for themselves  One other important note about XPO s executive compensation plan  it s strictly focused on non GAAP metrics  an issue we detail below 
You Cannot Pay Your Debtors With Non GAAP Earnings
Investors only following XPO management s presentations might believe the company is a high flying success  especially when it comes to  adjusted EBITDA   the company s go to metric to present its operations  When looking through this noise  the underlying economics of the business reveal a much worse situation per Figure 1  Here are the expenses XPO removes to calculate its non GAAP metrics  including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income 
Transaction   integration costs
Foreign currency losses
Rebranding costs
Debt commitment fees
Accelerated amortization
In 2015  XPO Logistics  non GAAP net income was a   37 million  compared to   246 million GAAP net income and   310 million economic earnings  Figure 2 shows the discrepancies between GAAP  non GAAP  adjusted EBITDA  and economic earnings from 2013 2015  We would take a longer look  but adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income were not used until 2013

Low Profitability Puts XPO Logistics At A Disadvantage
XPO Logistics operates across many different forms of freight  including full truckload  FTL   less than truckload  LTL   global forwarding  supply chain logistics  and last mile delivery for heavy goods  By encompassing so many different aspects of the freight industry  XPO faces numerous competitors  Unfortunately  XPO s multifaceted approach leaves it operating much less profitably than its competition  including  but not limited to  Landstar System  NASDAQ LSTR   C H  Robinson Worldwide  NASDAQ CHRW   United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS   and FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX   Each of these competitors has a higher ROIC and NOPAT margin than XPO  A lower ROIC and NOPAT margin mean lower pricing flexibility  Lack of pricing flexibility is a big disadvantage in an industry where transport rates can greatly impact purchase decisions and profit margins  See Figure 3 for more details 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Bull Hopes Rest On Continued Acquisitions
From 2013 2015  XPO grew revenue from less than  1 billion to over  7 billion  For bulls of XPO  these acquisitions were integral in building different facets of XPO s operations  despite the massive value destroyed  However  such hopes ignore key challenges facing the industry and XPO 
First  the industry is highly competitive  and as e commerce grows in popularity  freight transportation and the delivery of goods will become even more commoditized  As a result  pricing power will only get weaker for the industry at large  Given how unprofitable XPO is today  it is at a competitive disadvantage in terms of pricing power and will have a harder time with price pressure than its competitors 
Second  demand for XPO services could shrink  In March 2016  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  announced it was leasing 20 planes and starting its own air freight service  While there are few firms with as much sway in the retail ecommerce industry  Amazon taking back control of its logistics chain could be a sign of things to come for the freight industry 
The biggest risk to our thesis  as with all roll up schemes  is that investors continue to turn a blind eye to the value destruction occurring and  instead  focus on revenue and  adjusted EBITDA  growth  As long as the company can continue this  albeit value destructive  growth  bulls will tout the ability of management to expand the business  find  accretive  deals  and continue believing that profits are right around the corner  In this scenario  the stock price could remain overvalued for some time 
Acquisition Hopes Cannot Justify Valuation
XPO Logistics  CEO  Brad Jacobs is no stranger to building companies with a takeover endgame  He founded United Waste Systems in 1989  acquired over 250 companies  and then sold to Waste Management  WM  in 1997  Similarly  he entered into a deal to sell United Rentals to a private equity firm in 2007  but the deal fell through amidst the economic collapse in 2008  Could XPO just be another company being built up to ultimately be acquired  If so  XPO has hidden liabilities that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest 
 1 8 billion in off balance sheet debt  58  of market cap 
 716 million in deferred tax liability  23  of market cap 
 355 million in minority interests  12  of market cap 
 257 million in underfunded pensions  8  of market cap 
 23 million in outstanding employee stock options   1  of market cap 
After adjusting for these hidden liabilities  which add up to 102  of market cap   we can model multiple purchase price scenarios  Unfortunately for investors  only in the best of scenarios does XPO warrant a takeover at a price higher than today s 
To highlight how overvalued XPO is  Figures 4 and 5 show what we think UPS should pay for XPO to ensure the deal is truly accretive to UPS s shareholder value  Each implied price is based on a  goal ROIC  assuming different levels of revenue growth  We chose to assess the economic value of XPO after 5 years at three different levels of revenue growth  15   18  and 23   These levels were chosen to represent reasonable scenarios for revenue growth over the next five years assuming that UPS would put a stop to the value destroying acquisitions 
There are limits on how much UPS should pay for XPO to earn a proper return  given the NOPAT or cash flows being acquired  For each of the scenarios  we assume XPO achieves a 4  NOPAT margin post acquisition  This margin is more than double XPO s current margin  1 7    but lower than UPS s 8  margin  which is higher due to United Parcel Services  highly profitable domestic and international package delivery segment  We give XPO a slight increase in margins due to UPS s ability to cross sell within its larger Logistics segment and aggressively attract retain customers using resources from UPS s profitable business lines 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
The first  goal ROIC  is UPS s weighted average cost of capital  WACC  or 6   Figure 4 shows the prices UPS should pay for XPO assuming different levels of revenue growth achieved post acquisition  Only if XPO can continue growing revenue at double digits each year for the next five years and earn a 4  NOPAT margin is the firm worth more than its current share price of  27 share  We include this scenario to provide a  best case  view  Regardless  any deal that only achieves a 6  ROIC would be value neutral  as the return on the deal would equal UPS s WACC 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Figure 5 shows the next  goal ROIC  of 8   which is UPS s current ROIC  This deal would be truly accretive to shareholders as it would maintain UPS s ROIC  Any purchase price below this would actually increase ROIC  which is directly correlated to increasing valuation  In the best case growth scenario  the most UPS should pay for XPO is  18 share  33  downside  
Without A Takeover  Organic Growth Expectations Are Unrealistic
To justify its current stock price   27 share  via organic growth  XPO must grow NOPAT by 28  compounded annually for 19 years  For context  in this scenario XPO would be generating over  800 billion in revenue 19 years from now  or greater than the entire U S  trucking industry in 2015  A more realistic  but still optimistic scenario  given that XPO focuses on organic growth and ditches costly acquisitions assumes XPO can grow NOPAT by 19  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth only  4 share today   an 85  downside 
Catalyst  Unraveling of The Roll Up Scheme Will Sink Shares
XPO and other firms that use acquisitions to significantly grow become reliant upon acquisitions to meet not only internal goals for compensation  but also external expectations  However  this roll up strategy cannot go on forever  When they end  stock prices can crash rather violently especially when there has been significant shareholder value destruction  As we saw with Valeant  when the government and analysts alike began asking questions about its business  the economics of the business were revealed to be rather hollow  XPO is in a similar predicament  While its acquisitions can create a rosy  superficial picture of the business  the economics of the company are in decline 
XPO may have entered a vicious cycle in which it must find acquisitions to meet growth expectations  but in doing these deals  management is only putting further strain on the fundamentals of the business  Banks don t have unlimited appetite for risk  and there may come a time when XPO is no longer a company to whom banks will be willing to lend  In either scenario  funding is harder to get  acquisitions become harder to find  and expectations become harder to meet  While we can t predict when this house of cards will fall  we do know this roll up practice cannot go on forever  We ve said it before  and we ll say it again  non GAAP earnings  or  adjusted EBITDA  can t make the cash payments required to run a company  Look for an earnings miss  or multiple misses  to reveal that the picture being portrayed by XPO management is not as rosy as they d like you to believe 
Insider Sales Rather Low But Short Interest Is High
Over the past 12 months 5 6 million shares have been purchased and 107 000 shares have been sold for a net effect of 5 5 million insider shares purchased  These purchases represent 5  of shares outstanding  Additionally  there are 16 7 million shares sold short  or just over 15  of shares outstanding 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to XPO Logistics  2015 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  785 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  368 million in non operating expenses  5  of revenue   We removed  577 million related to non operating expenses and  208 million related to non operating income  See all adjustments made to XPO s income statement  
Balance Sheet  we made  7 4 billion of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  3 1 billion  The most notable adjustment was  3 8 billion  38  of net assets  related to midyear acquisitions  See all adjustments to XPO s balance sheet  
Valuation  we made  8 8 billion of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  8 8 billion  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  One of the largest adjustments was the removal of  1 8 billion  61  of market cap  due to off balance sheet operating leases

147855,369371,BHC,A Stark Lesson From The SunEdison Collapse,opinion,"Solar energy company Sunedison Inc  NYSE SUNE  filed for bankruptcy on April 21 
This event demonstrates the weaknesses of a business model dependent on renewable energy subsidies   especially when the subsidies have only just begun to lessen  never mind dry up altogether 
It also demonstrates the folly of over leveraged business models 
Sadly  the biggest losers from SunEdison s bankruptcy will be bondholders  especially those who invested in SunEdison s many securitization vehicles 
Among securitization vehicles  income investors should avoid debt and equity in the  yield cos  actively peddled by Wall Street 
If you re unfamiliar with the term  yield cos are basically corporations that typically own renewable energy assets like solar farms and wind farms  But they own the more stable  cash producing operating assets  rather than more capital intensive areas like research and development and construction 
The goal is to deliver greater earnings  which are paid to investors through dividends  In short  they re designed to strip out some of the risk of investing in renewable energy 
However  SunEdison s yield cos differed from other securitization vehicles because they involved issuing equity rather than debt  Solar power and other renewable energy plants were hived off into separate companies  which then financed themselves with IPOs  issuing dividend paying equity to investors and assuming a whole pile of debt 
Two such companies were formed from SunEdison   TerraForm Power Inc  NASDAQ TERP  and TerraForm Global Inc  NASDAQ GLBL  
The Problem With Yield Cos
There were several problems with the structure 
First  the yield cos  income depended on the amount paid by utilities and consumers for power  as well as on any subsidies they received  As power prices declined along with oil and gas prices  subsidies also declined and yield cos  revenues weren t able to sustain their dividend payments 
Second  the leverage was too great  At its formation  TerraForm Power had almost no tangible equity in its capitalization 
Third  since SunEdison controlled the yield cos  it could force them to enter into unattractive transactions   such as the failed takeover bid for Vivint Solar Inc  NYSE VSLR   a rooftop solar panel installer  Indeed  as SunEdison ran short of cash  it was able to transfer cash from the yield cos 
This combination of problems has caused share prices of both TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global to decline by 75  in the past six months 
Now that SunEdison has filed for bankruptcy  the future of the yield cos is highly uncertain 
SunEdison s creditors will undoubtedly attempt to get at the better assets and revenue streams of TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global  arguing that SUNE controls both companies  so their assets should be made available to the creditors 
Meanwhile  the yield cos  own debt will require servicing  and there may not be enough cash flow to do so 
The obvious vulnerability is the yield cos  dividends   which currently provide investors with a double digit yield  They ll almost certainly be cut back or  more likely  eliminated altogether 
Avoid These Investments
You won t be surprised to learn that SunEdison was a favorite investment of several hedge funds  This kind of aggressive financing driven growth is a favorite tool of that sector 
Of course  the Fed has helped this strategy by keeping interest rates below the inflation rate for nearly eight years  This encouraged all kinds of dopey schemes   such as the one undertaken by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc   NYSE VRX  
However  my advice isn t to avoid investing in hedge fund driven get rich quick schemes  As an income investor  this should be obvious 
Instead  beyond get rich quick schemes  there s a problem in investing in securitization structures in general   whether debt or equity 
After all  you ve probably heard about the  5 billion fine imposed on Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   partly for misstating the quality of subprime mortgages it securitized 
From the email traffic  we know that in some cases Goldman Sachs executives had inspected mortgage portfolios and discovered that they didn t fit the description in the prospectuses used to sell the securities 
I don t want to channel Senator Bernie Sanders  but in my view  a fine   where the cost falls on the Goldman Sachs  shareholders of 2016   a decade after the problems occurred is the wrong punishment  If there was evidence of fraud  someone at Goldman Sachs should have gone to jail 
We ll never keep Wall Street steering towards the white side of the many gray areas involved in finance if we don t invoke the ultimate penalty 
Goldman s 2006 malfeasances were only possible because once you ve bundled assets up into a securitization package  it s impossible to know what you have in there 
The rating agencies may give it a stellar credit rating  but the near impossible task of assessing it is evidenced by the fact that the rating agencies themselves were fooled by the mortgage securitizations of 2006 07  And after all  home mortgages are a pretty simple asset 
Part of the problem is that Wall Street has no clue how to manage risk properly  as it uses Gaussian mathematical models based on assumptions that simply aren t true 
As a retail investor in a securitized debt or equity  you re buying the ultimate pig in a poke  The seller knows more about what s in there than you  but you can t trust either his ethics or his competence to have disclosed it completely 
And in any event  a proper disclosure may be 200 pages long  and who has time to read it all 
So as an income investor  avoid securitization structures   no matter how attractive the immediate dividend may seem

147857,369373,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals Stock  Time For A Big Recovery,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals has had an incredibly rough time in the market as of late  and for good reason  After Citron exposed the company s relationship with Philidor and called Valeant the Enron of the pharmaceutical industry  investors got cold feet and started to push for facts  Unfortunately  Citron was correct  The relationship helped VRX to fluff the numbers 
However  there has been quite a bit that has changed since then  In fact  just last week  the company made two announcements that are fueling my bullish opinion looking ahead  Today  we ll talk about the recent changes  other changes we ve seen from VRX  and what we can expect to see from the stock moving forward 
So  let s get right to it   
Valeant Pharmaceuticals Partners With IBM  NYSE IBM 
Recently  it was announced that a wholly owned subsidiary of VRX  Bausch   Lomb  will be working with IBM  The goal is to develop the first app of its kind for iPhone and iPad  The app will be designed to assist surgeons who perform cataract surgery 
The new app is expected to streamline the workflow for these physicians by offering patient information  clinical insights and intraocular lens selection guidance  If this app works out well  it will likely prove to be a great thing for both VRX and IBM 
Patient Access And Pricing
One of the factors that has been haunting Valeant is patient access  Unfortunately  the company has made a name for itself as a company that overprices treatments  As a result  VRX has formed a new Patient Access and Pricing Committee 
The new committee will be responsible for pricing all of the company s drugs and will initially be chaired by the CEO of the company  Joseph Papa  The Committee will be made up of a team of VRX employees that will include scientists  doctors  and other executives of the company  In a statement  CEO  Joseph Papa had the following to offer   

 Valeant has made mistakes in how it priced its drugs in the past  and we are committed to ensuring those mistakes are not repeated    This new committee will take a disciplined approach to reviewing the company s pricing of drugs  and will consider the impact on patients  doctors  and our health care industry partners  Valeant s number one priority is ensuring patients can access the medicines they need  

Other Changes VRX Has Made Since The Philidor Scandal
When the Philidor scandal hit  it hit hard  and as a result  Valeant had to make some big changes in order to appease its investors  As a result  we saw management changes that would likely change the game for the company 
First and foremost  when something wrong happens at a publicly traded company  the CEO is the final point of blame  As a result  the CEO during the scandal  J  Michael Pearson resigned from his post  leading to Joseph Papa taking on the role  Also  VRX added some big names  including Bill Ackman to its board of directors 
However  management changes weren t the only changes that were made  After canceling its relationship with Philidor  VRX had to make up for losses in sales  In order to do so  the company contracted with Walgreens  which has helped pick up their prescription numbers in a big way 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish expectation of what we can expect to see from VRX  The reality is that while the company is down at the moment  thanks to the Philidor scandal  the scandal is over  At this point  Valeant is making the right moves  and those moves will pay off in the long run  All in all  I m expecting to see gains from the stock

147872,369388,BHC,How Trump  Clinton would fix the  crazy  U S  health system,news,"By Caroline Humer and Emily Stephenson  Reuters    When former President Bill Clinton called parts of Obamacare  crazy   he put his wife Hillary Clinton on the defensive and gave much needed ammunition to her Republican rival for the presidency  Donald Trump  who wants to scrap it  Bill Clinton said this month that while millions more Americans now have insurance coverage under President Barack Obama s signature 2010 healthcare law  small businesses and some families are still  getting killed  by surging healthcare costs  He later clarified that he was not criticizing the entire initiative  he was just making an argument for fixing it   Still  Clinton s comments may not have been so crazy  He put a spotlight on an uncomfortable truth  after six years  billions of dollars and a sweeping reform that stands as Obama s single biggest domestic policy achievement  health care is still unaffordable for many Americans  Americans are growing increasingly anxious about rising healthcare costs  and critics of the law have said it is not living up to its promises  Two of the nation s largest health insurers  Aetna  NYSE AET  and United Healthcare  are also pulling out of the state based health insurance exchanges that are the best known creations of Obamacare  Clinton says she wants to save the best of Obamacare  also known as the Affordable Care Act  while reducing costs  Trump says it is an expensive  disaster  that is on track to implode in 2017  He wants to replace it with something cheaper  Whoever wins the presidency on Nov  8 will likely face pressure to move quickly to reshape a healthcare initiative that affects millions of Americans  WHY CONSERVATIVES THINK OBAMACARE IS CRAZY Republicans opposed Obamacare from the start  labeling it a government intrusion into the healthcare market  Some of them say the individual exchanges where Americans shop online for coverage are already in a  death spiral   They warn that with fewer consumers using the exchanges  more health insurers will exit them  sending premiums even higher  and further deterring people from signing up  As the U S  population ages  U S  spending on healthcare    2 9 trillion in 2014   is projected to rise to more than one fifth of the nation s gross domestic product  Spending rates under Obamacare did slow for a time  but they are on the rise again  Trump has proposed getting rid of the exchanges and setting up tax free health savings accounts for people with high deductible insurance plans  He has also said he would set up state based high risk pools for people with medical conditions that make it hard to get coverage on their own  He also wants to allow companies to sell insurance across state lines to boost competition and drive down prices  His advisers say he would draw on a plan proposed by Republicans in the U S  House of Representatives  which includes a refundable tax credit to help Americans buy individual plans  Republicans  like Trump  also want to change how they fund Medicaid  which serves poor families  Obamacare increased federal funding to states that expanded the program to more people with low incomes  Now Trump wants to limit funding by switching to pre set  block grants  Health policy experts are skeptical selling insurance across state lines would do much to rein in health insurance costs  And health wonks on both sides of the aisle said Republicans would likely balk at any proposals that threatened to yank health insurance away from 20 million people   Even Republican members of the House and the Senate are going to end up resisting rolling back the Medicaid expansion if that means that lots of people in their states would go uninsured   said Jim Capretta  a health policy expert at the right leaning American Enterprise Institute   LIBERALS DON T THINK IT S CRAZY  BUT    Liberals like former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders haven t called Obamacare crazy  but Sanders does believe it doesn t go nearly far enough  During his campaign  he proposed replacing it with a single payer insurance system he called  Medicare for all   based on the government plan for elderly and disabled Americans  Hillary Clinton s plan doesn t go that far  but she would build on Obamacare by expanding tax credits for people shopping on the individual marketplaces  letting Americans buy into Medicare at a younger age  and adding a  public option   or a government run insurance plan to compete with private insurers on the exchanges   She has also proposed reducing Americans  out of pocket expenses outside their private insurance by offering a new refundable tax credit  and she would give states more federal funding to expand Medicaid for low income people  Two thirds of states expanded Medicaid under the 2010 law  and that s where most of the newly insured people got coverage  Policy experts said that after Obama leaves office  more Republican led states that objected to a plan so closely identified with Obama might be willing to expand Medicaid too   Clinton s ability to expand tax incentives likely depends on which party controls the U S  Congress  And while some states could act independently to launch public plans on their exchanges  many Republicans view the idea as wildly expensive and would strongly resist any effort by Clinton to require them nationwide  WHAT EVERYONE THINKS IS CRAZY   DRUG PRICES Obamacare did little to deal with soaring drug prices for lifesaving treatments like Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  NV s EpiPen  Democrats and Republicans say that s a problem for the next president  even though it s getting little attention on the campaign trail  Trump and Clinton both want Americans to be allowed to buy cheaper drugs from overseas  Americans pay the highest prices in the world for drugs   Former Democratic U S  Representative Henry Waxman made a similar proposal in 2009  but he was defeated by pressure from drug companies  which would likely oppose it again   Clinton says Medicare should negotiate drug prices with companies  using its 55 million users to get a better deal  Trump made a similar call during the Republican primaries but it does not appear on his campaign website now  Some health policy experts believe drug companies would respond to lower prices for Medicare patients by raising prices for everyone else  And to negotiate better prices  Medicare would have to be willing to stop covering certain drugs  which would be unpopular  they say  Clinton has also suggested creating a commission that would watch for sudden spikes in prices of older life saving drugs  a proposal that health policy experts said is achievable through rule making rather than legislation  She has also proposed a cap on drug co payments  Clinton has already put Wall Street on watch  Her tweets have brought down shares of Mylan and Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  International  which helped push many institutional investors out of healthcare stocks

Yes
Valeant Pharma has been in the news  for all the wrong reasons  since last summer  The news has been bad and its price action has been even worse 
The huge decline in VRX over the past 9 months has the stock testing two long term support lines that have been around for some 16 to 20 years  with both of them meeting at  1  above

147878,369394,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals Stock  The Bears Come Out To Play,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  
Valeant Pharmaceuticals is having a great day in the market  However  for many the recent upswing we ve seen in the stock is a shocker  After all  VRX has been falling for quite some time  Today  we ll talk about why the stock has had such a rough time in the market as of late  why we re starting to see gains  and what we can expect to see from VRX moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
Why Valeant Pharmaceuticals Has Had Such A Rough Time
As mentioned above  VRX has been struggling in the market for quite some time now  and for good reason  You see  the company had a relationship with a pharmacy known as Philidor  However  the relationship wasn t a positive one  In fact  it was uncovered that VRX was using its relationship with Philidor in order to fudge the numbers and make their company look like it was doing better than expected 
The story started when an analyst firm known as Citron announced that it had done a thorough investigation of Valeant and that things simply weren t adding up  In their report  Citron called VRX the Enron of the pharmaceutical industry  While no one wanted to believe it  the proof was in the pudding  Valeant had been lying to its shareholders  and that didn t bode very well  As a result  the company has been forced to make some big changes  The first of which was canceling the agreement it had with Philidor 
Other Changes VRX Has Made Since
There have been a couple big changes Valeant Pharmaceuticals has made since its cancellation of the agreement with Philidor  Here s what we ve seen 
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  NASDAQ WBA    When VRX cancelled its agreement with Philidor  investors cheered  However  there was some bad  The reality is that Philidor was Valeant s biggest customer  So  canceling the agreement meant a big decline in sales  However  shortly after the cancellation  VRX signed a big deal with Walgreens  and that deal has helped to push the company s sales back upward 
CEO Changes   The CEO of any company is the ultimate reason things happen  good and bad  So  the Philidor scandal fell largely on the shoulders of the company s CEO  As a result  it was announced that the CEO would be resigning  At the moment  VRX is in the midst of a search for a new leader 
Board Changes   Since the Philidor issue  VRX has made several changes to management  This included changes to its board of directors  In fact  the company has made a couple of additions to its Board 
Why The Stock Is Climbing Now
Since the Philidor scandal  VRX has fallen in a big way  giving up more than 70  of its share price  However  since the scandal  we ve seen a ton of positive changes from the company  In fact  VRX recently announced that it is very close to finding its new CEO  At this point  I believe that investors are starting to see that Valeant is doing things the right way and that the declines we saw on the stock are now presenting a strong opportunity  This is leading to momentous gains for the stock  In fact  currently  11 31   VRX is trading at  35 82 per share after a gain of  2 47 per share or 7 41  thus far today  All in all  things are starting to look up for the stock ",2016-04-24,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-the-bears-come-out-to-play-200126078,200126078

147894,369410,BHC,Up Is The New Black ,opinion,"Watching the Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  disaster unfold has  for those who are bystanders like us  resembled viewing an express train hurtling off an unfinished bridge into the ravine below  taking with it the reputations of some highly regarded investors  You ll find no criticism here   professional humility has always been part of our DNA   but if it wasn t  enduring the 58 2  collapse in Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  from August 31st  2014 to February 11th  2016 assured an additional helping  those dates and figures are imprinted in my memory   Watching someone else s catastrophe is an awe inspiring distraction  in the same way that one feels sorrow for the victims of a foreign earthquake while assuring oneself of the sensible choice to not live on a fault line  We ll resist the self satisfied observation that Valeant s fall eclipsed even the most hated energy infrastructure MLP  During a stunningly brief period of a few months from August 5th  2015 through last Friday  down for VRX investors was a long way   a staggering 89 7  
We have no opinion on VRX and certainly wouldn t suggest that its collapse was obvious  But it s often the case that fund flows develop their own momentum  While Pershing Square and ValueAct  two large hedge fund investors in VRX  can manage their exposure to this calamity with little regard to fund withdrawals given their long lock ups  the asset base of Sequoia s mutual fund  SEQUX  is at the daily whim of its investors  Having similarly peaked with VRX on August 5th  SEQUX is down 33 5  and redemptions are likely causing unwilling selling of VRX by its managers  Morningstar s placing of its rating under review can t have helped their fund marketers 

Whatever the true value of VRX  in the short term Ben Graham said the market s a voting machine  and investing in public equities forces you to endure the popularity  or loss thereof  of your holdings  MLPs certainly found that even as their security prices offered ever greater discounts to value  the marginal investor was nonetheless more often a seller rather than a buyer 
It s worth revisiting the above chart  originally shown in early January  see    which remains our best explanation for the substantial dislocation we endured  Although MLP distributions  in red  used to comfortably exceed new capital raised  in blue   the Shale Revolution gradually reversed this relationship by creating an ongoing need for new infrastructure which required financing  The increasing shortfall between cash paid to investors via distributions and cash taken back via IPOs and secondaries was  for a time  met with new money from mutual funds and ETFs  in green  until falling prices induced the more recent investors to curtail inflows and eventually switch to outflows 
Ultimately  institutional flows from non traditional MLP investors were attracted  see    Although operating performance of midstream MLPs wasn t immune to the collapse in oil  their stock prices often fell by many multiples of their drop in EBITDA  We continue to believe that what happened exposed the financing model of MLPs far more than their operating results  and that the flow of funds explanation is the most likely cause 
One pre requisite for buyers to overwhelm sellers is excessive pessimism  and VRX is at least approaching that zip code  21 of 23 analysts following the stock were bullish prior to last Tuesday s earnings call  following which there was an undignified rush for the relative anonymity of a target price close to the current market  One firm slashed its target price from  200 to  70  on Friday VRX closed at under  27   MLPs saw something similar over the past several weeks  see   as sell side analysts reacted as humans to the relentless criticism their bullish forecasts received from investors apportioning blame for their losses 
On recent trends  MLPs should soon be positive for the year  The last time that could be said was May 8  2015  Over the following seven and a half months the sector turned in its worst year ever  Whether or not February 11th  58 2  below the August 2014 high  was the low for MLPs  it couldn t be so without sufficient Wall Street analysts giving up  Industry mutual fund flows were heavily negative into the end of 2015  and there s evidence more recently that flows are turning  We re still 43  below the market peak  It is at least no longer unfashionable to expect rising MLP prices 
On Thursday  TransCanada  NYSE TRP  announced that they had agreed to acquire Columbia Pipeline Group  NYSE CPGX  for  10 2BN in cash  of which  4BN was funded with the proceeds of a TRP secondary offering of equity   The Wall Street Journal had reported on the negotiations several days earlier  TRP of course is behind the Keystone XL pipeline project which was eventually blocked by the Administration  further challenging Canada s E P companies as they seek ways to ship crude oil from Alberta to foreign markets 
CPGX is the General Partner that controls 15 000 miles of natural gas pipelines  mostly at the GP level  although their MLP Columbia Pipeline Partners  NYSE CPPL  holds some of the assets  TRP saw no need to acquire CPPL  since their acquisition of CPGX already gives them control of CPPL and thereby retains the ability to continue dropdowns into the MLP where assets can be more cheaply financed  although crucially this financing option isn t currently available  The deal is the classic use of the MLP GP structure  CPGX as the GP is analogous to a hedge fund manager  and CPPL is the hedge fund  Owning CPGX provides control of CPPL  CPGX  or now TRP  can eventually move assets into CPPL and continue to earn Incentive Distribution Rights on them  similar to a hedge fund manager earning a fee on assets in his hedge fund 

Although the acquisition valued CPGX at 19X 2016 estimated EV EBITDA compared with TRP s 12 75X  TRP expects the transaction to be accretive from 2017 as some of the CPPL backlog drops into production  TRP expects to finance  8BN of projects at CPGX over the next four years  earning  5 5BN in EBITDA over that time and exiting 2020 at a  1 7BN run rate  The cancellation of Keystone and delay in another big project  Energy East  has left room in TRP s budget  in addition to which TRP s size leaves it better placed to finance this kind of backlog 
Prior to the deal  CPGX was yielding 2 25   Moreover  CPGX and CPPL moved sharply in opposite directions following the announcement  as the market reflected the control premium paid for CPGX that wasn t necessary for CPPL  This illustrates why owning MLP GPs is better than owning MLPs 
We were invested in CPGX until Friday and remain invested in TRP ",2016-03-21,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/up-is-the-new-black-200122242,200122242
147895,369411,BHC,Bill Ackman And Valeant Pharmaceuticals ,opinion,"The big news this past week was the bloody nose that Bill Ackman and his Pershing Square fund received regarding their investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  
Following a dire update  the stock plunged to levels not seen since 2011  and has dropped almost 90   yes  you read that correctly  from its all time highs above  260 back in August As Ackman is an investor rather than a trader  I ve shown the chart below on a weekly timeframe to show a longer term perspective  but however you look at it  the chart is just plain ugly if you are trying to go long as a trader  or are currently holding as an investor  The downtrend has clearly been in place for several months  Price tells you all you need to know 
Whenever I come across situations like this  I am reminded of the story Ed Seykota once told 

 One evening  while having dinner with a fundamentalist  I accidentally knocked a sharp knife off the edge of the table  He watched the knife twirl through the air  as it came to rest with the pointed end sticking into his shoe   Why didn t you move your foot   I exclaimed   I was waiting for it to come back up  he replied  

The problem with holding such large volumes of shares in a company  Pershing currently hold over 30 million shares  which is more than 5  of the issued share capital   is that when price goes against you  it can be difficult to unload your holding without starting to make price go even further against you 
As it is  Pershing clocked up losses of more than  1 billion on Tuesday alone  in the immediate aftermath of the announcement 
So  it looks like Ackman  at best  will be stuck in a losing position for a while to come  But there s always someone worse off  According to  report  the Sequoia fund is currently holding an even bigger stake in Valeant  which accounted for 20  of its assets 
As a trend follower  the odds are only in your favour when the direction of your trade is aligned to the price trend of the stock or instrument you are holding  On that basis  anyone who follows price trends would have exited long positions in Valeant a while back and would be safely in cash  or may be sitting in a short position after getting the appropriate entry signal 
So what can you learn from this as a trader 
Richard Donchian summed it up very well As Donchian said   don t lose money 
If something goes against you  get out and move on 
Aim to keep your losses as small as possible 
You never want to see a trade turn into a long term investment simply as a result of not taking a small loss when you had a chance 
Remember that preservation of capital is key to you surviving 
I could go on with all the clich s  but  hopefully  you get my point 
Even if you follow company fundamentals  a simple trend following system will help you with the  timing  of your entries and exits  and help you avoid scenarios like this 
As I ve said many times when I come across charts like this  what appears to be cheap now  may be even cheaper in 6 months time   ",2016-03-21,Trader Steve,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bill-ackman-and-valeant-pharmaceuticals-200122332,200122332
147896,369412,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  Stock  Here s Why It s Climbing Today,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  has had an incredibly hard time in the market as of late  and for good reason  After the company s relationship with an underground pharmacy known as Philidor came to light in the media  many questions were raised  As a result  the company had to cease business with the pharmacy which just so happened to be its biggest customer  Soon sales fell and further questions came up about the stock  Nonetheless  VRX is up big in the market today after big changes were announced with regard to the management of the company  Here s what s happening   
Bill Ackman Will Be On The Board Of Directors
It was announced earlier this morning that Bill Ackman will be added to the board of directors at VRX  After all of the hardship the company has faced  they needed to bring on a high profile expert that would help the business grow  Now  I ve followed Ackman for quite some time  and I have to say I m not a huge fan of him as much as I know of him  on a personal level  However  when it comes to business  the guy is an absolute genius  So  taking that into account  it s overwhelmingly clear why investors are so happy that Ackman is being brought onto the board of directors 
J  Michael Pearson Will Be Stepping Down
J  Michael Pearson has served as the CEO of VRX for quite some time now  However  following the issues the company has faced as of late  he will be stepping down  While Valeant Pharmaceuticals searches for a successor to Pearson  he will maintain his role as CEO 
In a statement  Pearson had the following to say   

 It s been a privilege to lead Valeant for the past eight years    While I regret the controversies that have adversely impacted our business over the past several months  I know that Valeant is a strong and resilient company  and I am committed to doing everything I can to ensure a smooth transition to new leadership  

Robert Ingram  chairman of the board also had a bit to say about the transition to a new CEO  Here s what he had to say   

 While the past few months have been difficult  Valeant has a collection of leading brands  valuable franchises and great people  and I am confident that the company will be able to rebuild its reputation and thrive under new leadership  We thank Mike for his dedicated service to Valeant and for agreeing to stay on until we conclude our search  As a colleague and a friend he will be missed  and we wish him the best for the future  

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that any time there is positive news with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the company  While management changes aren t always positive news  the fact that Bill Ackman will be taking a seat on the board at VRX and that the company is looking for a new CEO is definitely positive news  As a result  we re seeing strong growth in the value of the stock today  Currently  10 45   VRX is trading at  30 40 per share after a gain of  3 42 per share or 12 68  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly positive view of what we can expect to see from VRX  The reality is that Valeant Pharmaceuticals has an incredible growth story  one that has required them to make it over hurdles in the past  Every time  they have done just fine  Now  with the new leadership coming on board  things are looking better than ever  Sure  VRX is in a rough patch at the moment  but the sun always shines after a rainy day ",2016-03-21,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-here’s-why-it’s-climbing-today-200122365,200122365
147897,369413,BHC,Can Specialty Pharma Survive Valeant s Toxic Collapse ,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Recently we checked in with the Pharma sector  where the prevailing business model of spending  sometimes lavishly  on research and development in order to bring to market an exclusive blockbuster drug has long been  and remains  the industry standard  Recently  however  some specialty pharma companies most notably and notoriously Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   have tried a bit of disruption  using aggressive acquisitions and attendant steep price hikes to drive the business 
Valeant s ongoing collapse  in part due to the toxic PR accompanying its aggressive pricing policies  but perhaps as much due to its   has pulled down an assortment of biotechs in its wake  as market participants seem to be fleeing the sector  When we published our original Pharma article  VRX was trading for  61 31 a share  Since then  on March 15  2016  Valeant issued a downgraded outlook for 2016  lowering its expected annual EPS to around  9 5  down from  13 25 13 75  Moreover  CEO Michael Pearson claimed on the company s conference call that the company understands that  The world has changed   which probably means the end of operations under its current business model  Add to all that a  600 million  typo  in the company s press release concerning its expected future EBITDA  and you ve got a real mess on your hands 

Unsurprisingly  the events of that day cut Valeant s value by as much as 51   after it closed at  33 51  And the carnage isn t over 
As of yesterday  the stock is trading even lower   31 89 at close  A potential recovery will be possible but only if Valeant is able to regain the public s trust  But firing CEO Pearson and naming investor Bill Ackman to the board has not stopped the bleeding  With  30B dollars in long term debt and a business model that has now crashed and burned  it s hard to see Valeant ever returning to its mid 2015 high of  263 81 
So is the specialty pharma sector finished  Or is it just Valeant s business model that needs to be scrapped 
A few other  strikingly similar companies have been dragged down by Valeant  Horizon Pharma PLC  NASDAQ HZNP   Endo International PLC  NASDAQ ENDP  and Mallinckrodt  NYSE MNK  have all lost well over 50  in the past six months 
Endo stood at  88 54 in August  and now trades at  30 81  down 65  

Mallinckrodt  which traded for  125 85 in August  is now at 61 05  down 54  

Finally  Horizon fell from  37 to  as of yesterday s close   15 74  57  less than what it used to be 


For each company mentioned above  losses are primarily due to the fact that their ongoing strategies of mergers and acquisitions mirror the model Valeant relied on  But should each of these companies be tarred with the same brush 
In Valeant s case the damage from this business model is glaringly apparent in the company s balance sheets and income statements  Valeant s long term debt jumped from  10 5 to  30 billion dollars  while its R D investment grew by a mere  40 million  to a total of  96 million  In comparison  Pfizer  NYSE PFE  spends about 2 billion annually in R D   50 times the amount VRX allocated 
Endo International s long term debt has grown from  3 to 8 billion dollars  following acquisitions of five pharmaceutical companies in 2013 2014 alone  Its focus on M A is obvious from its slim R D costs just  44 million Similarly  Horizon has added  1 1 billion of long term debt to its balance sheet  while at the same time spending only  13 million on R D 
The numbers seemingly implicate Mallinckrodt as well  which  from just  9 million of long term debt in 2012 now owes a whopping  6 5 billion  And over the same period  its R D costs rose only about 30  from  144 to  185 million  Even though Mallinckrodt s CEO  his company from Valeant  we d rather pay attention to the numbers 
While each of the three companies might be similar to VRX in some ways  each is not even close to the same amount of of trouble currently bringing down Valeant  VRX s long term debt to equity ratio is 4 75  meaning the company owes 4 75 times as much money as the value of its market cap  The ratios for Endo  Horizon and Mallinckrodt aren t even close at 1 38  0 9 and 1 23  respectively  That s not to say each is financially sound since all are still very indebted  but so are most pharma companies which first spend on development and then recoup when introducing a winner 
Looking ahead  it s our assessment that each of these three companies is probably better positioned to re adjust course  now that the pricing party has ended  And if any aren t willing to do it voluntarily     Another factor in favor of each of these three smaller companies  they have less debt to serve  and have managed to avoid the crushing public wrath now being heaped on Valeant  and on Martin Shkreli and his company  Turing Pharmaceuticals  beforehand  
While HZNP  ENDP and MNK have obviously been connected to the Turing Valeant mess  we view their situations more along the lines of collateral damage  and believe they have just momentarily fallen out of favor with investors  making them potential value buys as the dust settles  This hypothesis is supported by the joined  upward movement of the stocks this week  when the unrelated firing of Valeant s Pearson led to gains for Horizon and Mallinckrodt 
The specialty pharma market is burning right now  and related price movements are out of sync with actual performance or future outlook  Of course  we don t recommend blindly buying into specialty pharma  nor anything else  for that matter   but a little time spent on due diligence might reward the bold with double digit gains once the fires subside ",2016-03-23,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-the-biotech-sector-survive-valeant's-collapse-200122602,200122602
147898,369414,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  Stock  Will We See More Gains ,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  has been struggling for quite some time  and for an incredibly good reason  The company has had several accounting errors and had an iffy at best relationship with an underground pharmacy known as Philidor  Soon  Citron started to call VRX the Enron of the biotechnology industry as it brought to light the issues with the company  Investors held onto the statements and VRX started to fall dramatically  When this all started  the stock was trading at over  100 per share  Now it sits around  30 per share  Nonetheless  Valeant recently closed over 7  higher as the result of a big announcement    can it go higher  Today  we ll talk about the announcement that was made  what we re seeing from Valeant Pharmaceuticals in the market today  and what we can expect to see moving forward  So  let s get right to it   
VRX Releases Information That Excites Investors
In any case  the CEO of the company is the leader  and therefore  the person to blame when something goes wrong  So  when we see something bad happen with regard to a publicly traded company  it s common practice that the CEO may step down  That s exactly what we re seeing from VRX  On Monday  it was announced that the company would be hunting for a new CEO as the current CEO will soon be stepping down  He will continue to hold his position at Valeant until a new CEO is found  On top of the CEO change  VRX made changes to its board of directors and offered an update with regard to accounting and financial reporting issues  Yesterday  the company came out and accused the former CFO of VRX of  improper conduct  that led to the misstatements in financial results  In fact  in a press release on Monday  Valeant had the following to say about its former CFO    

 The improper conduct of the company s former Chief Financial Officer and former Corporate Controller  which resulted in the provision of incorrect information to the Committee and the company s auditors  contributed to the misstatement of results  In addition  as part of this assessment of internal control over financial reporting  the company has determined that the tone at the top of the organization and the performance based environment at the company  where challenging targets were set and achieving those targets was a key performance expectation  may have been contributing factors resulting in the company s improper revenue recognition  

What We re Seeing From VRX Today
While we are still well in the beginning of the day  things are looking to be shaping up to be a great Wednesday for Valeant Pharmaceuticals  Currently  9 42   the stock is trading at  32 70 per share after a gain of  0 79 per share or 2 48  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
When it comes to VRX  it is my belief that the struggles are over for the most part  The reality is that VRX made some very big mistakes  and ultimately  the company is paying for those mistakes  However  since the issues have come to light  Valeant has made changes with regard to management  has re established realistic accounting figures  and has even signed a contract with Walgreens for the sale of their treatments  All in all  things seem to be heading back in the right direction  and I m expecting to see gains in the long run as a result ",2016-03-23,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-will-we-see-more-gains-200122639,200122639
147899,369415,BHC,Slave To The System ,opinion,"Whenever a trend follower captures a big winning trade  outsiders often wonder if it is down to pure luck  skill or something else 
In a lot of cases  trends can start to develop in spite of the current sentiment and beliefs of many of the market participants 
Trend followers  however  approach the markets in an unemotional state   if their method tells them to enter a trade at a certain price level  they enter  Similarly  if their method tells them to exit at a certain price level  they exit  A trend follower would never get into a situation where they would allow price to start trending significantly in the opposite direction to that they are trading   witness  and the chart of Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   If their exit level is hit  they get out  no questions asked  and move onto the next opportunity 
They are conditioned to exit based on price and their chosen parameters  not on opinions or beliefs about where the price on a stock or instrument may or may not go  In other words  they are slaves to their own system or method for getting in and out of their positions 
Now  there is undoubtedly luck involved in getting into a major trend on a sample size of one  And historically  trend following has a typical win rate of between 30  and 40   However  trend followers work on the premise that trends have a tendency to persist  So  they take their entry signals at the start of a potential new trend  If they are wrong  they will know quickly and will exit as soon as possible  with as little damage as possible to their equity 
If however  they do get into a position where a significant trend starts to develop  then the only skill involved is having the ability to stay in the trade until an exit signal is given  They never predict when that will be  or at what price level  The price action in the market they are trading will tell them when that time has arrived 
Psychologically  it can be very difficult for people who start to use a trend following approach to truly grasp how it works until they have been through the myriad of emotions and cycle of market conditions that accompany such an approach  lots of small losses  some small wins  and the occasional big win 
Trend following is not an approach geared toward achieving a high win rate  You have learn how to lose  small  before you can win  It is not easy telling someone they are trading well when they are clocking up small loss after small loss  But that is all part of the game  Similarly  you also have to accept that hard earned gains can be lost as part of the process when a trend starts to end or reverse  Those who can understand and accept that  along with applying strong risk control  have the best chance of success 
I talked  about how a trader friend I ve  for a few years went through this process  All his development  learning and initial frustration  in effect  was the precursor to making a big psychological breakthrough  But all through that process  he was sticking to what his basic method was telling him to do  It kept him in the game  It eliminated the possibility of big losses  He knew he was getting closer and closer 
I ll never forget the phone call I got from him when he managed to get into a few positions  the majority of which started to develop major trends  I was on holiday at the time  but we kept in touch as the profits were mounting up day after day  The urge to take profits off the table was huge  however he knew that would go against the basic premise of letting the profits run   This is really testing my mettle   he said   but NOW I truly see and understand the power of trend following  
He now trades more than one trend following system on different timeframes and is making decent returns  Whenever we chat about things  he continually refers to being a slave to his system  and stresses to himself the need for him to not listen to his own thoughts and opinions about what may or may not happen  He continues to take the positions when he gets an appropriate signal and his risk limits allow  and then he lets the markets do its thing 
And that is the way it should be ",2016-03-25,Trader Steve,https://www.investing.com/analysis/slave-to-the-system-200122872,200122872
147901,369417,BHC,Valeant Isn t A Bad Investment,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  has had a rough time in the market as of late  and for good reason  Late last year  Citron published a report on the company and its relationship with an underground pharmacy known as Philidor  Since then  everything seemed to fall apart for the company as investors  analysts  and reporters questioned its dealings  As a result  the stock tanked dramatically  At this point  many are still holding onto the idea that VRX may be a bad investment  but is it  Today I ll explain what we ve seen since the Philidor issue and what I expect to see moving forward 
VRX Since The Philidor Issue
Valeant Pharmaceuticals has had a tough time in the market over the past several months  When Citron published the article explaining the relationship between the company and the pharmacy known as Philidor  investors lost faith  After all  Citron did call VRX the Enron of the pharmaceutical industry  As a result of the publication  investors started to ask a ton of questions  many of which went relatively unanswered  Soon enough  investors started to push for the cancellation of the agreement between VRX and Philidor  which of course  they got 
This led to a new problem for Valeant Pharmaceuticals  You see  Philidor just so happened to be the biggest customer that VRX had on the books  So  when Valeant cut Philidor out  they also cut out a massive amount of prescriptions for their treatments  Essentially  the company was stuck between a rock and a hard place  trying to figure a way out 
Shortly after the relationship between VRX and Philidor came to an end  we started to see a bit of good news from the company  Soon  Valeant signed an agreement with one of the world s largest pharmacies  Walgreens  Under the agreement  Walgreens would sell Valeant s products  While this wouldn t make up the total prescriptions lost from the Philidor issue  this was a step in the right direction  Since then  we ve seen several changes to the company  including management changes 
What We re Seeing In The Market 
As mentioned above  during the Philidor issue  VRX started to fall dramatically in the market  The company simply couldn t seem to find support  However  more recently  we ve started to see gains on the stock  In fact  today  the gains were continuing in early morning trading  Unfortunately however  the stock has fallen into the red for the day  Currently  10 24   VRX is trading at  28 96 per share after a loss of  0 02 per share or 0 07  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
While several analysts have a relatively bearish opinion of what we can expect to see from Valeant Pharmaceuticals  my opinion on the stock is very different  The reality is that VRX has fallen from well over  100 per share to under  30 per share  While we have seen declines  we ve also seen that since this issue happened  the company is recovering large amounts of sales  At this point  I believe that VRX has fallen to a key level at which it seems advantageous to get involved in the stock again  From here  I m expecting to see growth  while it may be relatively slow in the beginning  I m expecting to see growth nonetheless ",2016-03-30,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-why-this-isn’t-such-a-bad-investmen-200123378,200123378
147906,369422,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals May Jump 50  On Friday,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  NYSE VRX  has had an ugly past 52 weeks  After trading as high as  260 per share  the stock hit a low on Thursday of  25 75 
So why on earth could it potentially rally 50  in the next month  The answer is surprisingly simple 
Thursday was the last day of the quarter  which is when hedge funds sell their biggest losers    especially those with so much media attention into quarter s end  They do this to avoid showing the position on their quarterly statement  This creates added down pressure into the end of the quarter  In addition  no hedge funds would buy prior to the new quarter for the same reason    not wanting the position on their statement  That means  come April 1  it s a whole new ball game  The selling from hedge funds should have concluded and there will be some hedge fund buyers taking positions

basically rolling back the increase of the past year   he said   In all  we estimate that today s news results in a 20 25 percent hit on EpiPen revenues   He expects that to translate into a 3 4 percent hit to Mylan s earnings per share over the next few years  He estimates the company will earn  4 77 a share in 2016 and  5 58 in 2017  Mylan is the latest company to be caught up in the growing outrage at apparently egregious drug price increases  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX  and Turing Pharmaceuticals have both been publicly excoriated for similar price increases  Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton  who has spoken out against escalating drug prices   welcomes the fact that Mylan is now apparently open to taking steps to lower some of the cost sharing burdens imposed on families   Tyrone Gayle  a campaign spokesman  said in a statement  However  he added   discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of EpiPens are insufficient  because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums   Clinton s view was echoed by Democratic lawmakers  including Rep  Elijah Cummings  who said Mylan s move is nothing but a public relations stunt that does nothing to help the majority of patients who need the drug   Offering a meager discount only after widespread bipartisan criticism is exactly the same tactic used by drug companies across the industry to distract from their exorbitant price increases   he said in a statement   Nobody is buying this PR move any more   Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch  defending the price in an interview on Thursday on CNBC  said her company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving EpiPen  including making its needle invisible  since acquiring the device from German generic drugmaker Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA    When we picked up this product  they  Merck  weren t spending a dollar on it   said Bresch   Bresch said Mylan recoups less than half of EpiPen s list price because pharmacy benefit managers  which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers  are involved  along with insurers and others  Democratic U S  Senator Amy Klobuchar said Mylan s action was a  welcome relief  to many who are struggling to afford the medication  but said it does not address the root of the problem of rising drug costs  Earlier this year  Clinton chastised drug companies for exorbitant pricing and unveiled a plan that she said would cut costs  making the issue not only a hot election discussion topic but potentially an issue that could have policy implications if she is elected  On Wednesday  Clinton pressed Mylan to voluntarily cut the EpiPen price  sending the company s share price lower and pushing down biotech stocks  Mylan shares fell more than 10 percent this week before rising 3 2 percent on Thursday after announcement of the discount program  EpiPens are preloaded injections of epinephrine  adrenaline  used in case of a dangerous allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis that could cause death if untreated  Anaphylaxis can occur in as little as a couple of minutes of exposure to the allergen  which can come in the form of food such as peanuts or insects such as bees  Certain medications or latex can also cause a severe reaction  Symptoms include itching  swelling of the lips  tongue and roof of the mouth  tight chestedness and difficulty breathing  People who are susceptible to such reactions are frequently advised to carry an EpiPen  which can deliver an immediate emergency jolt of adrenaline to reverse the symptoms   A group of lawmakers said on Wednesday they had written the U S  Food and Drug Administration asking about its approval process for alternatives to the EpiPen  FDA spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman said in a statement the agency is reviewing the questions posed in the letter  and will respond directly to the Congressional members   She noted that the FDA does not have the authority to review or approve drug prices  Bresch  daughter of Democratic U S  Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia  said she contacted members of Congress over the past two days and asked to meet with them to discuss what she called an  unsustainable  drug pricing system  
She said one of the calls was to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley  R Iowa   who recently wrote a letter to Mylan asking for an explanation of big EpiPen price increases ",2016-08-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mylan-cuts-patient-cost-of-epipen-422297,422297
147915,369431,BHC,Mylan to launch generic EpiPen at half the price of original,news,"By Ankur Banerjee and Ransdell Pierson  Reuters    Mylan NV  O MYL  said it would launch the first generic version of its allergy auto injector EpiPen for  300  half the price of the branded product  the drugmaker s second step in less than a week to counter the backlash over the product s steep price  The company reduced the out of pocket costs of EpiPen for some patients on Thursday  but kept the list price at about  600  a move that U S  lawmakers and Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said was not enough  EpiPen cost about  100 in 2008  Mylan said on Monday it expected to launch the generic product  in several weeks   an unusual move considering the branded bestseller is still patent protected and major rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearances   Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response   Chief Executive Heather Bresch said Monday   We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option   Mylan s price move failed to squelch criticism of the company s huge price increase for EpiPen since it acquired the product in 2007  The U S  House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform sent a letter to Mylan s CEO on Monday seeking documents on EpiPen pricing  including those relating to revenue from EpiPen sales since 2007  manufacturing costs  and the amount of money the company receives from federal government health care programs  And former Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders tweeted on Monday   At  300 generic EpiPens will still cost 3 times more than they did in 2007  This isn t a discount  It s a PR move   Consumer watchdog group Public Citizen said Mylan s latest move was another  convoluted mechanism to avoid plain talk   It said activists on Tuesday will deliver petitions from more than 600 000 consumers and allergy sufferers to Mylan s headquarters in Canonsburg  Pennsylvania  demanding further price cuts   We would like the company to drop the price to  100 for two EpiPens   said Public Citizen spokeswoman Angela Bradbery  adding that was about the price charged in France  She said the  petitions were gathered by it and various other consumer groups  including Consumers Union   EpiPen has a 94 percent market share for auto injector devices  which jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts  food allergies and bee stings  The biggest danger is an allergic reaction called anaphylaxis that could cause death if untreated   Its only U S  competitor is Adrenaclick  a device sold by Impax Laboratories  O IPXL  that has not caught on with patients and doctors  The product  which is assembled by hand and is not considered by regulators to be an exact copy of EpiPen  has a list price of more than  400   Impax spokesman Mark Donohue declined to comment on whether the company would lower Adrenaclick s list price given the planned cheaper price of Mylan s generic Dr  Howard Selinger  chairman of family medicine at Quinnipiac University  said he has only written two prescriptions for Adrenaclick because it is not much cheaper than EpiPen  Many other doctors do not even know the product s name because of EpiPen s long domination  he said  Industry analysts said the biggest potential threat to EpiPen is a similar device being developed by rival generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  Industries Ltd  TA TEVA   The U S  Food and Drug Administration in February declined to approve the product because of dosing problems  But some analysts believe Teva  after fixing the issue  could re apply for approval and have its product on the market as soon as next year  and win considerable market share  Sanofi SA  PA SASY  pulled its own device from the market last year  also on concerns of inaccurate dosage  It returned rights to the product to tiny privately held drugmaker Kaleo  Mylan has defended EpiPen s high price  saying it had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the product since acquiring it in 2007  It has said it recoups less than half the list price as pharmacy benefit managers  PBM   which often require discounted prices or rebates from drugmakers  are involved  along with insurers and others  Mylan shares closed up 0 4 percent at  43 22 on the Nasdaq  amid a moderate upturn for the broader stock market  The stock had fallen 12 percent last week amid a wave of criticism over prices of EpiPen  which generates annual sales of  1 billion  Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said though Mylan had  infinite possibilities  to handle the outcry over EpiPen prices  the generic launch was  the big one  and would help PBMs cap their costs  However  he expects Mylan to still come under fire for its prices and U S  health regulators to face more pressure to approve competing treatments  Some lawmakers last week asked the Food and Drug Administration about its approval process for rival treatments  Leerink Partners said that the generic launch only removed a near term pricing lever for Mylan as they expect the launch of Teva s version in 2018 to become a pricing headwind

147929,369445,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals  VRX  Stock  More Declines To Come,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc  NYSE VRX  
Valeant Pharmaceuticals has had a rough time over the past several months  and for good reason  A few months ago  there were big concerns among investors with regard to the relationship between Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a pharmacy known as Philidor  Since then  there has been some good and some bad news with regard to the company  Nonetheless  investors are pushing the stock downward  Today we ll talk about the relationship between Valeant and Philidor  what we ve seen from the company since the cancellation of the agreement  and what we can expect to see from VRX moving forward 
Valeant and Philidor
As mentioned above  last year there were several questions with regard to the relationship between VRX and an underground pharmacy known as Philidor  Philidor just so happened to be one of Valeant s largest customers  but there was very little information about the company  Perhaps more importantly  investors were concerned that VRX may have owned a stake in Philidor  giving them the ability to hid specific financial data in an attempt o make VRX look better on earnings reports  At the time  some investors even started to call Valeant Pharmaceuticals the Enron of the pharmaceutical industry  Soon  VRX would cut ties with Philidor  While the fact that the relationship between the two companies was coming to an end excited investors  this led to concerns of its own  Because Philidor was Valeant s largest customer  sales would surely fall  and fall dramatically  As a result  we saw massive declines in VRX for quite some time following the cancellation of the agreement between the two companies 
What Has Happened Since Philidor
Canceling the relationship with Philidor was a big hit to VRX  As mentioned above  Philidor was Valeant s largest customer  However  since the cancellation  there has been some good and some bad news from the company  Here s what we ve seen 
The Good News   The good news that we ve seen from VRX since the Philidor issue has quite a bit to do with Walgreens  NASDAQ WBA   Shortly following the news of Philidor  VRX signed an agreement with Walgreens that would make their medications largely available in Walgreens pharmacies  This is expected to increase sales in a big way  However  it s not likely to be enough to make up the losses we saw as the result of the cancellation with Philidor entirely 
The Bad News   The bad news is that VRX is getting quite a bit of political pressure  You see  VRX is known for increasing the prices of its medications on the drop of a dime  In fact  it can be argued that excessive costs of medications were what made Valeant the incredibly profitable company it has become  However  we ve seen quite a few conversations with regard to price gouging in the medical space lately  and VRX just so happens to be in the center of these conversations  As a result  investors are fearful that Valeant may be investigated and forced to reduce its prices of some of its most profitable medications 
Where VRX Is Headed From Here
While I will say that I believe Valeant is going to be just fine in the long run  at the moment  there is quite a bit of uncertainty  The company has still yet to make up for the loss in sales as the result of the agreement cancellation with Philidor  On top of that  there s quite a bit of uncertainty with regard to what s coming down the line in terms of drug pricing  The truth is that there are few things that scare investors quite like uncertainty  As a result  I m expecting to see further downward movement until VRX offers a clear path and the political issues with regard to pricing dissipate

147930,369446,BHC,Here s Why Valeant s Gaining,opinion,"VRX Announces 3 Additions To It s Board
Early this morning  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  announced that it has added new independent members to its board of directors  In fact  it has added three new independent directors  This is a much needed move considering the issues that the company has faced over the past several months  The additions to the VRX Board of Directors include   
Stephen Fraidin   Stephen Fraidin is the vice chairman of Pershing Square  Capital  According to Reuters  Pershing Square Capital Management is one of the largest investors with VRX  owning about 16 5 million shares 
Fred Eshelman   Fred Eshelman is the former CEO of Pharmaceutical Product Development 
Thomas Ross   Thomas Ross has severed as the president of the University of North Carolina 
In addition to the new additions to the company s board of directors  Anders Lonner has stepped down as director at the company  In a statement  Robert Ingram  chairman of the VRX Board of Directors had the following to say about the changes 

Fred s extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry  Steve s business  legal and corporate governance acumen  and Tom s broad public policy expertise are valuable additions to the Board as we strengthen the company s corporate governance practices and move the company forward   

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news ultimately moves the market  The news that new members of the Board of Directors were added were added is incredibly good news  and will likely lead to solid changes in the company  As a result  we re seeing strong movement in the value of VRX today  Currently  10 47   VRX is trading at  65 36 per share after a gain of  2 21 per share or 3 50  
Why I Maintain A Bullish Opinion On VRX
When it comes to Valeant Pharmaceuticals  the news released today is just another bit of news that lends to the bullish opinion I maintain with regard to the stock  The company has been through quite a bit in a relatively short period of time  and to regain faith among investors  a management shift is a great move  However  it s not the only reason I m bullish on VRX  Here are some others   

VRX And Walgreens  NASDAQ WBA    Valeant s problems started as the result of its relationship with Philidor  an underground pharmacy that seemed to be doing things the wrong way  While Philidor was Valeant s largest customer  it was pressured by investors to cut ties with the pharmacy  As a result  VRX gave up quite a bit in revenue from the sales of their treatments at Philidor  Nonetheless  VRX has made up a large portion of the lost sales due to its newly found relationship with Walgreens 


VRX Price   Another factor that makes me bullish on Valeant Pharmaceuticals is the price at which the stock is trading  Following tremendous downtrends as a result of the Philidor issue  VRX is trading at an incredibly low price  While the company s prescription sales are recovering  the price of the stock isn t gaining quite as much  making it undervalued in my eyes 


Positive Strategic Changes   Since the Philidor issue  VRX has made several positive strategic changes  one of which happened today when the new members were added to the board of directors 

The bottom line here is that Valeant Pharmaceuticals is a great company  While it has been dealing with more than its fair share of issues  the company has proven its ability to overcome issues in the past  and I m expecting no different today  All in all  I m expecting to see great things out of VRX moving forward ",2016-03-09,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-here’s-why-it’s-gaining-200120993,200120993

 What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals     Zig Ziglar
Today was so full of chop  and the chop came upon us very quickly  making it pretty obvious it s just the algos and computers ripping markets around and hurting those who are a bit too eager to try to get into this market 
I had a small short position in NYSE VRX from Tuesday  and then after the close the company announced they had some new board members and this made the stocks move up overnight 
I took about a  2 loss per share early in the day and it would have been worse had I held 
Nothing wrong with trying  but having success remains very tricky in this market  so I m all cash and looking to stay there until better setups complete and they are getting there 

SPY remains in consolidation mode  which is great 
Not much to do these days as I wait for setups to form  but I say often in markets like this that it s key to preserve your mental and real capital and not get chopped up 
Waiting for setups is key  albeit a bit on the boring side  but it s part of the game

147932,369448,BHC,Valeant  Expect Declines After Earnings,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  has been dealing with a very rough time as of late  While I would like to say the struggle is over  I don t believe that to be the case  Don t get me wrong  I ve said it before and I ll say it again  in the long run  I m expecting to see great things out of VRX  However  I believe that the company is going to hit its last hurdle before long term growth tomorrow morning  Today  we ll talk about what that hurdle is  what we can expect to see in the short term  and what we can expect to see in the long term outlook with regard to VRX 
Valeant Pharmaceuticals Is Set To Disappoint On Earnings
VRX is expected to release its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2015 after the before the market opens tomorrow  This is what I believe will be the next  and hopefully the last hurdle for VRX to get over before we can expect to see long term growth  During the quarter  analysts have estimated that we will see  2 61 in earnings per share on revenue in the amount of  2 75 billion  If this were the case  we would see incredible year over year growth from in both EPS and revenue from  2 58 and  2 28 billion respectively  This would be great  but in reality  it doesn t seem as though this is going to happen 
The truth is that in the fourth quarter  Valeant Pharmaceuticals hit a brick wall  It was in this quarter that Citron started accusing VRX of being the Enron of the pharmaceutical industry  citing their relationship with an underground pharmacy known as Philidor as the reason they have been able to manipulate investors  As a result  Valeant was forced to cancel its agreement with Philidor  their biggest customer  This undoubtedly will cost VRX a massive amount of revenue and likely cause earnings to dive  So  I m expecting for VRX to miss earnings expectations  leading to investor fears 
What We Can Expect To See From Valeant Pharmaceuticals In The Short Term
In the short term  I have a very bearish opinion of what we can expect to see  The truth is that I think that VRX is going to dive on earnings  As investors  we know that there are few pieces of news that have the ability to move the needle in the market quite like earnings  So  with the poor earnings expectations  I m expecting for investors to react in a negative way  So tomorrow  and likely throughout the rest of the week  I m expecting to see declines on VRX 
What We Can Expect In The Long Run
In the long run  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from Valeant Pharmaceuticals  While the company has struggled as of late with regard to the Philidor issue and the fact that the CEO of the company was on medical leave for more than a month  I believe that when we talk about VRX  we re talking about a strong company  I have no doubt in my mind that VRX has the ability to make a comeback from the lows we re seeing on the stock and the declines we re likely to see tomorrow  The reality is that they are already seeing a strong recovery in prescription numbers thanks to their relationship with Walgreens  On top of that  the company has a long line of incredible products  a great management team  and perhaps most importantly  an impressive track record of success  All in all  while there is a reason to be bearish in the short run  I m expecting to see long term gains from Valeant Pharmaceuticals ",2016-03-14,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-expect-declines-after-earnings-200121526,200121526

147951,369467,BHC,Bill Ackman And Some Perspective On The Index Bubble,opinion,"He s often controversial  and usually pretty brash  But Pershing Square s  is also usually quite insightful  He s been at this game a long time  and he s had his share of big wins  and big losses  Ackman has an ego on him   What hedge fund manager doesn t   But he s also his own biggest critics  and like all good investors he learns from his mistakes 
Today  let s take a look at Ackman s   which came out last week  Ackman  like a lot of hedgies  had a terrible 2015  Here were some of his takeaways 
Not All Valuation Metrics are Equal
Ackman bet big on Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX   and lost big when the stock rolled over  Per Ackman 

Principally  we missed the opportunity to trim or sell outright certain positions that approached our estimate of intrinsic value  Our biggest valuation error was assigning too much value to the so called  platform value  in certain of our holdings  We believe that  platform value  is real  but  as we have been painfully reminded  it is a much more ephemeral form of value than pharmaceutical products  operating businesses  real estate  or other assets as it depends on access to low cost capital  uniquely talented members of management  and the pricing environment for transactions   Emphasis Sizemore 

Charles here  I learned a similar lesson in 2015  Just as Ackman lost money in an acquisition hungry pharma stock  I lost money in MLPs  small cap REITs and business development companies   three sectors that would normally have very little in common  But the tie that bound them was their dependence on the capital markets for fresh funding  When the credit markets got skittish  Mr  Market relentlessly punished these sectors  and two of my holdings   Kinder Morgan  N KMI  and Teekay Corporation  N TK  were forced to slash their dividends 
Know Who You re In Bed With
Due to Ackman s high profile  he tends to attract copycats  I myself have been guilty of perusing his SEC disclosures  This creates risks of its own 

Perhaps the largest correlation in our portfolio is one that we have not previously considered  that is  the fact that we own large stakes in each of these companies  We have had the benefit of a  following  of investors who track and own many of our holdings  This has given us significantly greater clout than is reflected by our percentage ownership of these companies  and we believe that it is partially what has caused the  pop  in market price when we announce a new active investment  As a result  these active managers  performance is often closely tied with ours  When Valeant s stock price collapsed  our performance  and that of Pershing Square  N SQ  followers  were dramatically affected  Nearly all of these investment managers are subject to daily  monthly  and quarterly redemptions  and therefore  many were likely forced to liquidate substantial portions of their holdings which overlap with our own 
While it is impossible to know for sure  we believe that our continued negative outperformance in the first few weeks of the year relates primarily to forced selling of our holdings by investors whose stakes overlap with our own 

This raises a bigger issue of simply considering who the major holders of your stocks are and what their constraints or motivations might be  Returning to my own losses last year  The selloff in MLP shares was massively exacerbated by mutual funds  ETFs and   most importantly   leveraged closed end funds and hedge funds that were forced to liquidate to meet redemptions or margin calls  This were holders that were forced to sell at whatever price the market gave them 
The Index Fund Bubble  And What It Means
Finally  Bill Ackman has some insightful comments about the  bubble  in indexing  Given the lousy performance of active managers over the past decade  it s easy to see why investors continue to flock to index funds  They are cheaper in terms of fees  more tax efficient and have had better returns of late 
But here s the problem  Indexing only works when their are a sufficient number of active managers to make the market at least semi efficient  If everyone becomes a passive indexer  then the returns of the major indexes will start to lag in a major way as the stocks in the index become overowned and overpriced 
But there are other considerations too  Passive ownership essentially gives management a free pass and allows lousy management teams to stay entrenched 
As Ackman writes 

As index fund ownership grows as a percentage of shares outstanding  the voting power of index fund managers increases  While on the one hand  one might believe this is good for America as these  permanent  owners should think very long term compared with the many investors whose average holding period is less than one year 
On the other hand  there are significant drawbacks  While index fund managers are  of course  fiduciaries for their investors  the job of overseeing the governance of the tens of thousands of companies for which they are major shareholders is an incredibly burdensome and almost impossible job  Imagine having to read 20 000 proxy statements which arrive in February and March and having to vote them by May when you have not likely read the annual report  spent little time  if any  with the management or board members  and haven t been schooled in the industries which comprise the index 

Of course  this is impossible  Index managers are passive and will generally toe the line for management  Ackman points out some very significant long term effects of this  asking the proverbial question of what happens when index funds effectively control corporate America 

If the index fund trend continues  and it looks likely to do so  what happens when index funds control Corporate America  Courts have often deemed shareholders to be in control of a corporation with as little as 20  of the ownership of a company  At current rates of asset inflows  it will not be long before index funds effectively control Corporate America and the corporations of many foreign countries 
The Japanese system of cross corporate ownership  the keiretsu  has been blamed for decades of Japanese corporate underperformance and economic malaise  Large passive ownership of Corporate America by index funds risks a similar outcome without the counterbalancing force of large active investors 

The thought of corporate America turning Japanese should be enough to make even the biggest proponent of indexing pause for a moment 
Ackman says that the  greatest threat to index fund asset accumulation is deteriorating absolute returns and underperformance versus actively managed funds  because money flows into these funds with no consideration of value  I agree  and would add that this was the major rationale for the  smart beta  movement 
But perhaps the greatest takeaway here is simply to not give up on active management  When you invest outside of the mainstream  you will have returns that are outside of the mainstream  That means that there will be plenty of years when you underperform 
But if you re a good investor  it also means that there will be years where you massive outperform  So keep your chin up  Even hedge fund masters of the universe lose money some years

147952,369468,BHC,Valeant Pharmaceuticals  Why We re Seeing Declines,opinion,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  is having a rough day in the market today after a series of mixed news  On the good side of the coin  CEO J  Michael Pearson  has completed a full recovery and has returned to his post at VRX  On the bad side of things  results have been delayed  leading to a bit of uncertainty  Today  we ll talk about the return of Pearson  what results were delayed  and what we can expect to see from VRX moving forward  So  let s get right to it   
J  Michael Pearson Has Returned
At possibly the worst timing  J  Michael Pearson took a medical leave from VRX more than a month ago has he suffered from a severe case of pneumonia  At this time  the stock struggled quite a bit as investors worried about the company s recovery without Pearson involved  Nonetheless  the team appointed to take on his role did incredibly well  Today  it was announced that Pearson would be returning to his post at Valeant effective immediately  This is incredibly good news  While the team appointed has done well  the company is definitely in need of Pearson s leadership 
While this is good news  there is some bad news that came along with the announcement  VRX was scheduled to report preliminary result from Q4 and provide updated guidance to investors relatively soon  However  given the timing of Pearson s return  the investors  call has to be pushed back  There is already a bit of uncertainty with regard to what investors can expect given the recent hardships Valeant Pharmaceuticals has faced  As a result  the delay adds to the uncertainty and is becoming a big reason for declines  In a statement  J  Michael Pearson had the following to say with regard to his return   
 I want to express my sincere gratitude to Howard for his willingness to step in and lead the company through a challenging period    I realize that recent events are disappointing to everyone and it is my responsibility to set the appropriate tone for the organization  My immediate priority will be to build stronger relationships with important constituents  such as managed care and other channel partners  regulators and government representatives  while improving Valeant s reporting procedures  internal controls and transparency  I will focus on the retention and enhancement of our management teams and employee groups around the world and ensure that we maintain a culture that adheres to the highest ethical standards  Finally  we expect to deliver strong operating performance going forward by working closely with physicians to better serve patients  and we remain committed to reducing our leverage  
How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  In this particular case  there was a bit of good news in the fact that Pearson has made it back to VRX  However  there was also a bit of bad news in the fact that results and guidance are being delayed  Given the current circumstances revolving around Valeant  the delay in results and guidance is leading to investor fear  As a result  we re seeing sharp declines in the value of the stock today  Currently  10 10   VRX is trading at  73 20 per share after a loss of  7 45 per share or 9 24  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
While I know I m probably going to catch some flack for the bears for my opinion here  I believe that we re going to see relatively positive movement out of VRX moving forward  The reality is that when we talk about Valeant  we re talking about an incredible company  While they have had to get over hurdles as of late  the company has a long list of great products and has put together a solid plan for growth  Now that Pearson is back  I m expecting for things to move in the right direction relatively quickly  All in all  my view of VRX is positive ",2016-02-29,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valeant-pharmaceuticals-(vrx)-stock:-why-we’re-seeing-declines-today-200119880,200119880
147953,369469,BHC,5 Stocks With Heavy Downward Revisions Heading Into This Week s Reports ,opinion,"Monday  February 29

Thursday  March 3

Friday  March 4


Hertz Global Holdings  Inc   N HTZ 
Industrials   Road and Rail   Reports February 29  after the close 
The Estimize community is looking for EPS of  0 06 and revenue of  2 51 billion  one cent Wall Street on the bottom line  and around  9 million below on the top line  However  our Select Consensus  which more heavily weights historically accurate analysts and recent estimates  is in line Wall Street on earnings  and  28 million below on revenues  The Estimize community has been bearish on Hertz s profitability this quarter  pushing EPS estimates down 17  in the past three months  The company has historically beaten Wall Street on the bottom line 60  of the time while only besting the Estimize EPS consensus 25  of the time 

What to Watch  Hertz Global has been struggling to perform for the past two years mostly due to competitive pressures  Just this week  Hertz s stock took a beating following a lackluster fourth quarter earnings report from rival Avis Budget Group  O CAR   Following the announcement  shares fell over 13   having dropped a total of 45 9  since the start of 2016  Hertz has been unable to improve growth metrics as the car rental industry freefalls  Competition from ride sharing rivals like Lyft and Uber have adversely impacted Hertz s revenue growth  Last quarter the company reported a 2  decline in U S  car rental revenue  while international car rentals fell a resounding 14   largely due to weak global economic conditions  High debt obligations and weaker operating cash flow also remains a top concern  Despite its misfortunes  activist investor Carl Icahn took an interest in Hertz  purchasing a 14 3  stake in the company with the hope of rectifying fleet management issues and cost inefficiencies  This year  the company also plans to spin off its equipment lease company into a separate publicly traded company 

Stratasys  Inc   O SSYS 
Information Technology   Computers and Peripherals   Reports March 3  before the open 
The Estimize community calls for EPS of   0 08 and revenue of  168 9 million  3 cents higher than the Street on the bottom line  and roughly  4 million greater on the top line  However our Select Consensus is showing a more modest beat of 2 cents  Since November 2015  the Estimize community has been bearish on Stratasys  profitability  revising EPS estimates down 63   Compared to the same period last year  current estimates predict a YoY decline in EPS and revenue of 113  and 21   respectively 

What to Watch  Once expected to be the next big thing  Stratasys and all the other 3D printing companies had another disappointing year in 2015  After losing 38  of its value in 2014  Stratasys managed to out do itself in 2015  watching shares fall an additional 71   Negative FX headwinds have been the main scapegoat for missed earnings expectations throughout the year  This in itself has effectively hampered capital investments  as well as performance of its MakerBot business  In Q3  Stratasys reported a 55  YoY revenue decline in its MakerBot business  pressuring margins as the overall popularity of 3D printing has waned  Additionally  higher operating costs from increased investments have led investors to question the company s long term profitability  As of Q3 2015  the company has no debt  allowing Stratesys to focus on improving its products  specifically 3D printing 

Ambarella  Inc   O AMBA 
Information Technology   Semiconductors   Reports March 3  after the close 
The Estimize community is looking for EPS of  0 52 and revenue of  68 0 million  5 cents higher than the Street on the bottom line  and roughly  3 million greater on the top line  The Select Consensus is slightly more bearish  with EPS of  0 50 and a sales consensus of  66 5 million  Compared to Q4 2014  this represents a project Yoy decline on the bottom line of 23  while sales are expected to rise 6   The Estimize community has been bearish on Ambarella s earnings  revising EPS estimates down 13  and revenues down 10  in the past 3 months 

What to Watch  Video and imaging chipmaker  Ambarella  has a year it would soon like to forget  After reaching highs of  126 70 in June 2015  shares of Ambarella have plummeted 65 5  in the past 8 months  The company s weak outlook has been closely tied to the disappointing growth of its biggest customer  GoPro  O GPRO   Ambarella produces the chips inside all GoPro devices  accounting for a third of the company s sales  GoPro s dismal Q4 earnings report foreshadows equally disappointing results for Ambarella come Friday  GoPro severely missed on the bottom line  reporting a loss per share of   0 08 and a 16  decline in the number of units sold YoY  Ambarella s relationship with GoPro  which was once a blessing  has become quite the burden  Last quarter  the company warned investors that Q4 sales were only expected to rise 0 5  to 4 3   compared with to its 62  growth in the March 2015 quarter  Fortunately  Ambarella is attempting to diversify its top line away from action cameras and drones and into less volatile products 

Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX 
Healthcare   Pharmaceuticals   Reports March 3  after the close 
The Estimize Select Consensus calls for EPS of  2 77  9  higher than Wall Street  while revenue expectations of  2 77 billion are roughly  27 million greater than the Street s consensus  The Estimize community has been bearish on Valeant s profitability in the past three months  revising EPS estimates down 22  and sales down 11   That said  the company has consistently delivered positive earnings surprises  beating Wall Street s EPS estimates 88  of the time 

What to Watch  In the past year  Valeant has been in the limelight for all the wrong reasons  Shares have taken a steep dive  falling 58 4  in the past 12 months following claims that the company was raising prices without discretion but also booking phantom sales under a separate company  Philidor  After vehemently denying this  Valeant announced an earnings restatement ahead of its fourth quarter earnings to reclaim  58 million worth of wrongly booked sales  Investors responded positively to the news  giving shares a 4 4  boost  The restatement is expected to be minimal  increasing FY2015 EPS by  0 09  In focus during the upcoming earnings release will be updates on Valeant s distribution partnership with Walgreens  product performance  and any ramifications following recent accounting missteps  Valeant s ability to continue consolidating with competitors and grow are largely contingent on how the company addresses its high debt level  Last quarter Valeant reported a leverage ratio of 4 87  reflecting its relatively low financial leverage  The company s recent partnership with Walgreens should help offset losses incurred after parting ways with speciality pharmacy Philidor  Through key partnerships and cost reducing strategies  Valeant is expected to cut  2 25 billion in debt by the end of 2016 

SunEdison  Inc   N SUNE 
Information Technology   Semiconductors   Reports March 4  before the open 
The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of   0 85  14 cents higher than Wall Street  with revenue expectations of  800 million around  100 million less than the Street  The Select Consensus on the other hand  is showing a greater loss on the bottom line  with EPS of   0 90  The Estimize community has maintained a pessimistic stance on SunEdison  revising EPS estimates down 20  since the company last reported  Compared to the same period last year  current estimates predict a resounding profit decline of 412   On average  the company has consistently missed on the bottom line  reporting negative earnings surprises in each of the past 3 quarters 

What to Watch  This past year has not been kind to SunEdison  The company missed profit estimates for each quarter of 2015  leading to a 92 9  decline in stock price for the year  Earnings per share losses were primarily incurred from significant increases in marketing costs and interest expenses from a high debt burden  However  top line performance and volume growth were better than expected 
The solar industry has experienced a significant downturn in recent years  as new laws and regulations have reduced the favorable subsidies these companies receive  In the third quarter  the company s G A expenses rose 135   with interest expenses nearly doubling as they work to repay a  11 7 billion debt load  As a result  SunEdison has reported a net loss of  1 16 billion in the past 12 months 
In an effort to bolster its financials  SunEdison has insisted it will refocus its solar material operations and cut costs to reach cash flow breakeven by the end of 2016  The company s sustained focus on expanding through acquisitions and strategic partnerships is an encouraging first step to reaching this goal  This past year  SunEdison entered the energy storage market with the acquisition of Solar Grid Storage and has planned to form second publicly traded company in YieldCo  Ahead of the company s fourth quarter earnings  investors will be looking for more information on acquisitions and growth initiatives to restore their confidence

147966,369482,BHC,Update  Bull Market Still Depends On What This Stock Does,opinion,"Could one stock really tell you where the broad market heads  Joe Friday shared he thought so on November the 13th in the chart below  Bio tech stock Valeant Pharma  N VRX  had been slammed the prior few months and the broad market dipped along with it 
The chart below reflected that VRX was testing five support lines at one time at  3   along with oversold momentum at  1  and volume was sky high at  2   which could have reflected panic selling  All of these conditions would suggest this price point was key for the stock and maybe the broad markets 
Since the Joe Friday post  VRX is up over 28  in less than 3 weeks

We remain of the opinion that what Bio Tech does going forward is key for the broad markets and VRX is an important part of the puzzle  We shared of late that Bio tech was up 250  more than the S P 500  from the 2011 lows and highs of this year 
Below  an update on VRX 

The 28  rally in the past couple of weeks has VRX up against falling channel resistance at  1  above 
The Power of the Pattern continues to believe  what happens at  1  above  will have profound impact on VRX going forward and could well impact the broad markets as well  Stay tuned friends  this could be a BIG DEAL for both bulls and bears   ",2015-12-02,Chris Kimble,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/bull-market-depends-on-what-this-stock-does-(update),-says-joe-273148",273148

Joe liked the following conditions in VRX  Momentum the most oversold since 2009  Volume was shooting way up  looked like panic selling  and VRX was hitting 15 year channel support and four other support lines  at the same time   See original post here  
The Power of the Pattern attempts to find low risk high reward entry points  One looked to be taking place at  3  above  as it was hitting five support lines at the same time  Below looks at the performance of VRX  since the posting on 11 13 

Yesterday  VRX had the  7th best day  in its history and the best single day returns since January of 2011 
The table below reflects that VRX just had its best 21 day returns since 2000 

We ve continue to find the opportunities in the broad market limiting  with overhead resistance just overhead at the 2 150 zone  We believe huge opportunities like VRX  continue to present themselves and that 2016 should be one of the best years  to make monies in a long  long time ",2015-12-15,Chris Kimble,https://www.investing.com/analysis/joe-friday-had-his-eye-on-valeant-(vrx)-and-it-delivered-(up-45)-376130,376130
147971,369487,BHC,Credit Distress Is Not Contained,opinion,"By early 2007  homeowners in the United States were already in trouble  Many were having serious problems making their mortgage payments 
But former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke downplayed the risks 
On March 28  2007  he reassured Congress   The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime  mortgage  market seems likely to be contained  
Instead  the ensuing fallout would be so severe that the word  subprime  would forever be associated with the credit crisis 
Today  contagion risks are being dismissed in a similar fashion 
Many say that the problems in the high yield corporate bond market are confined to the energy sector 
For those who harbor this misguided view  I present the following chart of high yield credit spreads by sector 

Corporate bond credit spreads basically reflect the perceived risk of default  The wider the spread  the higher the risk  and  thus  the more yield demanded by bond investors 
In July 2014  every single sector   including energy   had an average credit spread below 400 basis points  market value weighted average spread  
Less than two years later  not a single sector s average credit spread is below 400 basis points  bps  
Of course  energy companies are leading the way  as spreads have blown out past 1200 bps  Credit distress in the energy sector is only part of the story  though 
The second widest spreads belong to the industrial sector   not the materials sector  Yes  the credit markets realize we re in an  
However  even the  safe  sectors are experiencing strains 
At over 650 bps  utilities spreads are the fourth widest of all the sectors 
High yield healthcare spreads have widened from below 300 bps just a few months ago to nearly 500 bps  I talked about how Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  N VRX  was the top  issuer this year 
Problems are accelerating  too 
Last week   made waves when it announced that it was suspending withdrawals in its high yield distressed debt mutual fund  Then on Friday  hedge fund firm Stone Lion Capital Partners also suspended redemptions in a credit fund 
Naturally  funds throwing up gates won t engender confidence among credit investors  Rather  it will lead to more risk aversion  which will impact junk bonds in every sector 
As a whole  high yield bonds experienced a monumental mispricing in 2013 and 2014  Companies issued record amounts of bonds at miniscule yields to quench investor demand  Call it a credit bubble if you like 
Due to the collapse in crude oil prices  the energy sector was simply the weakest link and the first to run into major problems 
Ultimately  credit distress isn t contained  The credit cycle has turned  and a default wave in corporate bonds approaches 
Safe  and high yield  investing ",2015-12-16,Alan Gula,https://www.investing.com/analysis/credit-distress-is-not-contained-376052,376052

FXCM Inc   N FXCM  has had an interesting few days  First it popped on Tuesday  it pulled back  held support  and then popped again on Wednesday  up another 2 40 to 9 16  or 35 5   on 1 7 million shares  Based on the way it s acting  and with the volume coming into it after coming down so far  it may be wanting to go higher  It took out the downtrend  and it may be a good candidate for a move up to 10 10 35 as early as Thursday  There s some key resistance up in that zone  If it gets through that  this is a stock that could make it to the 12 1 2 range 
China Finance Online Co   Ltd   O JRJC  exploded on Wednesday on a very surprising earnings report  The entire trend line was taken out a few days ago  and on Wednesday  it ran up to resistance to the March highs  and backed off just a little bit  Still  it had a wonderful day  up 1 74 to 6 30  or 38   on 6 5 million shares  If it continues  or if it forms a consolidation here  that may be a nice set up to take it up to the 8 1 2 9 1 4 range  It has 6 2 days to cover 
Lumber Liquidators Holdings  Inc   N LL  had another great day on Wednesday  After the pop on Tuesday  it ran again on Wednesday  up another 1 15 to 18 68  or 6 6   on 1 8 million shares  Still  it has about 7 days to cover  It looks like it may take a shot at running up towards 21 1 2 3 4  which is the next target 
SolarEdge Technologies  Inc   O SEDG  was highlighted on Tuesday because it broke out of a trend line above the moving average  On Wednesday  it popped another 3 76 to 25 75  or 17   on 3 9 million shares  That s big volume for this stock  It got right up to resistance and closed pretty well  The next target is 24  and if it can catch momentum  it could run up to the mid 30 s eventually  It has 2 7 days to cover

Random Thought Of The Week
You re probably hearing a lot of talk right now about how an overwhelming majority of earnings are beating estimates this season  We always do of course  Companies reduce expectations to a point where they are stepping over a low bar so they look good relative to the lowered expectations they created  I don t know why people still fall for it but you can be sure it will continue until it doesn t work and probably even after  Call it the Lake Woebegone effect 
What you probably haven t heard about is the quality of those earnings  When you hear the talking heads say that 70  of companies have beaten estimates they are referring to  operating earnings  or as I like to put it   earnings after the company strips out all the bad things that they claim are one time but probably aren t   The other type of earnings are  reported earnings  which are the earnings the companies are forced to report because they are in accordance with GAAP and because the SEC makes them  If you look at the current quarter  only 42  of companies are beating estimates on reported earnings  This is typical late cycle behavior we see every cycle  As you get closer to recession operating and reported earnings diverge with reported looking a lot worse than operating  What that means is the companies get increasingly creative with earnings as they become harder to come by 
Chart Of The Week
Good or bad  The dollar index appears to have completed its consolidation and is now taking another leg higher  There s good and bad in that  A higher dollar means lower commodity prices  earnings pressure for US multinationals and capital flowing to the US chasing dollar returns  It also puts pressure on companies and countries with dollar debts which become harder to repay  In the long run we are better off with a strong  stable dollar but a relentlessly rising dollar   just as a relentlessly falling one   is difficult to deal with

What are the best year end investments  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  I predicted that the market story would focus on the message from falling commodity prices  This thesis lasted for one day  as the market continued the multi week trading pattern of following crude oil prices  That was all  The rest of the week included a rally that most found inexplicable  Gains occurred in the face of terrorist actions  falling commodity prices  and a strong signal of an imminent increase in interest rates  The strong rally left most participants shaking their heads and reaching to invent explanations  To get the full story  let us look at Doug Short s weekly chart  Doug s full post shows the various relevant moving averages in a very negative week for stocks   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  

Doug s update also provides multi year context  See his  for more excellent charts and analysis 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
The economic calendar is normal  but all of the reports occur within three days  Friday s session is a half day  Many participants will be taking off and others will leave after Wednesday morning s data  TV producers will be reaching to find subjects  It may be the toughest week of the year to guess a theme  Volume will be low and surprise news could have a big effect  It is a bit too soon for the Santa Claus rally topic  but that is also possible 
My guess is that the discussion will focus on the surprising market resilience and what it means for investments 
People will be asking 
What are the best year end investments  
There will be a wide range of viewpoints  featuring the following 
Bonds  Stocks are over priced and dangerous 
Gold  Time to hedge against geopolitical and economic threats 
Safe stocks  emphasizing dividends 
Bets on an improving economy 
A shift to emerging markets 
Popular recent leaders 
There is an argument for each approach  Expect to see some new faces on TV and new sources featured in columns  As always  I have my own ideas  reported in today s conclusion  This week I have tried to give special emphasis to sources with specific stock ideas 
But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was a little good news  but most results were in line with expectations 
More dovish commentary from ECB head Draghi    
The Philly Fed beat expectations  While the index  1 9  did not show great expansion  the results have been getting wider attention   has the story and this chart showing the relationship with the more noted ISM index 

Bank lending strengthens   and a nice chart pack on credit 
Building permits rose 45K  in line with expectations  This continues a trend in this forward looking construction indicator  See  at Doug Short s site for more analysis and the expected great charts 
Builder confidence was reported as 62  a slight miss of expectations   that it is still a strong reading 


The Bad
Some of the economic data missed expectations  Feel free to add other suggestions in the comments 
Rail traffic is declining  Steven Hansen    gets beyond the noise of the weekly data and reveals the trend 

Housing starts missed forecasts   at Doug Short s site has a nice  detailed report 
Industrial production missed explanations  Steven Hansen    takes a deeper look at the data  explaining that it might be a little better than the headline indicates 
The Ugly 
Continuing terrorism  Just as those responsible for the Paris attacks were found  there was a new assault on a luxury hotel in Mali  As I write this  there is  to restaurants and cafes in Brussels 
This is  of course  a human story rather than one about markets  Many of us will be giving thanks this week for our own safety and that of friends and loved ones  Many will also support the victims and families in the way they best can 
I know that many are curious about why there was not a greater market impact   some explanations 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  Nominations are always welcome 
Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update  This week I have made some changes in our regular table  separating three different ways of considering risk  For valuation I report the equity risk premium  This is the difference between what we expect stocks to earn in the next twelve months and the return from the ten year Treasury note  I have found this approach to be an effective method for measuring market perception of stock risk  This is now easier to monitor because of the excellent work of   whose analysis of the Thomson Reuters data is our principal source for forward earnings 
Our economic risk indicators have not changed 
In our monitoring of market technical risk  I am using our  new  Oscar model  I put  new  in quotes because Oscar is in the same tradition as Felix and the product of extensive testing  We have found that the overall market indication is more helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks  More about Oscar next week  The score ranges from 1 to 5  with 5 representing a high warning level  The 2 4 range is acceptable for stock trading  with various levels of caution 
I considered continuing to report the Felix updates  but I already have a distinction between long and short term methods  I want to minimize confusion  Those who want this information can subscribe to our weekly Felix updates

The Week Ahead
There is quite a bit of economic data for a 3   day week  Wednesday is the big day  While I highlight the most important items  you can get an excellent comprehensive listing at Investing com  You can filter for country  type of report  and other factors 
The  A List  includes the following 
New home sales  W   Good concurrent read on an important sector for economic growth
Michigan sentiment  W   Good concurrent indicator of job growth and spending
Personal income and spending  W   Can people afford holiday spending 
Consumer confidence  T  Conference Board version is similar to Michigan s  also showing recent strength 
Initial claims  Th   Fastest and most accurate update on job losses 
The  B List  includes the following 
Core PCE prices  W   The Fed s favorite inflation indicator  Will not have much significance until there are a few hot months 
Existing home sales  M   Not as important as new home sales  but shows the state of the market 
GDP 2nd estimate  T   Backward looking  but probably revised higher 
Durable goods   W   Improvement expected in this volatile series 
Crude oil inventories  W   Focus on oil prices keeps this report in the spotlight 
All quiet on the speaking front  but breaking news might have an exaggerated impact in the expected low volume environment 
How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series  I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates  you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
Oscar continues Felix s neutral market forecast  but he is fully invested  There are often plenty of good investments  even in an expected flat market  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix and Oscar s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com  They appear almost every day at Scutify  follow   
The most dramatic lesson for traders comes from a rookie who did not accurately assess his risk  He held an overnight short position in a stock that was supposedly going bankrupt  The next morning he learned that his  37 000 account was wiped out and he owed his broker over  100 000  Shawn Langlois    has the story and this chart 

Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  Start with our  and follow the links 
We also have a page summarizing many of the   If you read something scary  this is a good place to do some fact checking 
Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important article  it would be  from Rupert Hargreaves at Value Walk  He reports on advice from Michael Mauboussin  a leading expert on investor behavior  Read the entire piece and check out the great links  but here is a key segment 


Over the past decade  the S P 500 has gained 7 7  per annum  but the average investors has only been able to achieve a return of 5 3  per annum  According to Michael Mauboussin  these figures are similar across most of the world s markets and can be explained by one key factor  we often fail to keep a cool head and end up we buying high and selling low 


As Mauboussin puts it  a human phenomenon is the desire to be part of a group  which gives a sense of security but it s not always a good thing 

Many investors have the skill and tools to do well  but not the emotional stability or discipline 
 that this affects asset allocation as well  The  retail  funds  ETFs  and stocks have done worse than those favored by institutions 
 on the  enormous long term cost  of holding cash

Professional investors and traders have been making Abnormal Returns a daily stop for ten year  The average investor should make time  even if not able to read every day as I do  for a weekly trip on Wednesday  Tadas always has first rate links for investors in this   There are several great links  but I especially liked this warning about non traded REITs from Micah Hauptman  financial services counsel for the Consumer Federation of America    

Nontraded REITs are rife with conflicts of interest both in how they are governed and how they are sold  Often  the entities that manage and sell nontraded REITS are closely affiliated and controlled by the same top executives who divvy up the high upfront costs investors pay  Further  the brokers who recommend these products are allowed to call themselves  trusted financial advisers  while they operate like salespeople seeking to earn a commission  These conflicted structures enable a systematic wealth transfer from retail investors  who need to make every dollar count  to the financial firms that create  manage  market and sell these products

Final Thoughts
For long term investors  the best sources of value require some confidence in economic growth  This is clearly a contrarian opinion  as you can see from the sources below 
One factor influencing stocks   especially those in the economically sensitive sectors   is the persistent belief that the economy is bad and getting worse  The results of Gallup polling show this effect  despite lower gas prices and an improved economy throughout 2015    

The article provides data showing the sharp contrast between this general poll and those that ask about individual circumstances 
 with a nice analysis on the factors behind the unhappiness of voters   an uneven recovery  misleading noise  and ignorance  each discussed nicely  The lesson he reaches for investors his one of my favorite themes  Be politically agnostic  Accept the reality of the policy environment and take advantage of whatever is offered  This advice will become more difficult to follow as election campaigns heat up 
By contrast   Davidson     explains as follows 
The most important knowledge of Value Investors  which lets them invest when others are racing to  high ground   is in understanding that throughout human history we have always recovered from self made disasters  Value Investors are primarily optimists and are virtually the only buyers at market recession lows  Geneticists  anthropologists  psychologists psychiatrists and neurologists have recently been coming to similar conclusions 
He elaborates nicely  showing how this applies to housing and shelter  Here is a key chart

148023,369539,BHC,Wall Street can t stop talking about this potential  baby Valeant ,news,Unarguably  the biggest disaster for Wall Street in the last year was Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   the drug company whose stock has lost about 90  of its value since October  Of course not everybody lost  Valeant was targeted by short sellers who made a bundle on the stock s plunge  And they re looking everywhere in the market for companies that may share Valeant s losing business strategy of using debt funded acquisitions to grow their product line  rather than R D   and then jack up the price of those acquired drugs   Enter Concordia International  a  1 6 billion Canadian drugmaker that Wall Street s short sellers are circling  trying to decide if it s a  baby Valeant   The stock is down 78  since this time last year  Some of the symptoms of Valeant s disease seem to be there  The company hiked   14 fold back in May  And then there s Donnatal  an irritable bowel syndrome drug from the 1940s that the company acquired back in 2014  In 2010  Donnatal cost  87  When Concordia acquired it  Donnatal cost  353  Concordia immediately increased the price to  602  It now costs  782 and generates 10  of the company s revenue  We ll get back to that  First  recall that once upon a time Valeant s strategy made it the darling of the hedge fund community  So there was a time when being compared to the company was something to brag about   He said his company was  an M A company very similar to Valeant     Valeant  when Mike  Pearson   LON PSON  took over the company was in a very similar position to what we are in now  He s done a very good job in terms of acquisitions  We have a very full pipeline and the objective is just to keep going  The wind is at our back so to speak and the opportunities are there   We should also note that Thompson was an associate general counsel and vice president for business development at Biovail  which merged with Valeant in 2010  Bear raid Of course  none of this necessarily makes Concordia a mini Valeant  and no company wants to be called that  anymore   So Concordia has gone very much on the defensive  Last week Charley Grant at  that Concordia is suing a semi retired short seller named Marc Cohodes for libel  This is what set Thompson and Concordia off   The management of Concordia  their past gig was at something called Biovail  which I was short a long time ago  and  was a complete and utter fraud  So  Mr   Thompson has a history of nonsense when he was at Biovail   Mr  Cohodes said in an interview with BNN back in April  Biovail was charged with accounting fraud and material misstatements back in 2008  It settled for  10 million neither admitting nor denying its guilt  Cohodes responded to the suit saying Thompson  believes that he can silence his and Concordia s critics  by hitting them with lawsuits  He does not sound like he had any intention of backing down  Cohodes isn t the only short seller Concordia has taken issue with  Back in March it  denying media reports that its fourth quarter financial results might be under review by PricewaterhouseCoopers   We categorically deny the claims being made in the report and our independent auditors stand by our results   said Mark Thompson  founder  chairman and chief executive officer of Concordia   Concordia has been the subject of an unrelenting and unscrupulous attack by a group of short sellers for several months  We will continue to monitor this situation and will act accordingly  However  we are extremely excited about the business we have built and the opportunity to deliver long term shareholder value   Not like Valeant There are ways in which Concordia is very different from Valeant  though those differences aren t necessarily great either  The FDA is currently reviewing Donnatal to try to figure out whether or not it s actually effective at all  RBC explained the issue a recent note to clients  The product is under review by the FDA and has been since 1975 until a hearing to determine whether it is effective occurs  There are no timelines for when or if a hearing is to be held  but the product represents  10  of the company s total revenues and would impact the valuation if it were not allowed to stay on the market  Continued weakness in the GBP following the recent Brexit vote could further impact Concordia s international business  These risks could impact Concordia s ability to meet our price target  valuation  and rating expectations  Of course  when something has been under review since 1975 it s hard to see why now  all of the sudden  it s going to become a priority   unless it just is  In January the House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee  checking in on its Drug Efficacy Study Implementation  DESI  program  In March  the FDA responded with a list of drugs that are currently on the docket  and Donnatal was first on the list   Fewer than a dozen DESI proceedings remain open or  pending   covering approximately 20 active ingredients   said the letter   FDA is actively working to close these proceedings  It has been FDA s policy to allow continued marketing of drugs that are subject to a pending DESI proceeding    about the DESI program as well  The presentation was given by the FDA s historian Suzanne Junod and Robert Temple  MD  Deputy Director of the Office of Drug Evaluation  In response to Business Insider s questions about the drug  a Concordia spokesperson said the following   There is no change to Donnatal s regulatory status  Our business is based on product launches  M A and product promotion     But even if Donnatal doesn t get completely taken off the market for being ineffective  it s facing intense competition  As RBC notes  since Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  put another IBS drug  Viberzi  on the market in December 2015 Donnatal prescription growth has slowed   not the healthiest news for a bouncing baby billion dollar company ,2016-08-02,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-can-039;t-stop-talking-about-this-potential--039;baby-valeant-039;-417998,417998

Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I predicted that the market story would turn to housing  the subject of most of the week s data  That proved to be one of my worst predictions  My discussion of the theme is intended as preparation for the media focus  not just my own opinion  My personal conclusion was that the housing story was important  but others did not think so  It did get reasonable attention  but earnings stories dominated  with secondary attention to Europe and China news  By Thursday  it was all about the market breakout and getting back to break even on the year 
To get the full story  let us look at Doug Short s weekly chart  You can clearly see the mid week turnaround   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  

While I take a weekly focus  Doug s update provides multi year context  See his full post for more excellent charts and analysis 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments

We have a huge economic calendar  with more important reports than we have seen in many weeks  Whenever the week includes a Fed meeting  we expect that to command attention  While most do not expect a policy change  it remains possible and could dominate market discussion until Wednesday afternoon  Much of the most important data will not be known  even by the Fed  until later in the week  This is a perfect setup for pundit pontification 
I expect a weeklong Fed focus  with everyone asking 
Will the Fed put the brakes on the breakout  
The question implies two parts 
Will Fed policy change 
Will Fed policy change Yes  A rate increase would merely move toward normal 
No  There is no sign of inflation and economies are weak    at Bloomberg View and  of Norther Trust  
No  It would create too much dollar strength    
It is too late  The Fed should have acted when the economy was stronger 

Does it matter Yes  The market strength rests upon worldwide liquidity  Changing this could halt the rally 
No  It is all about technical analysis and which wave we are in    at MarketWatch  
No  Fed policy has done little to help the economy  so gradual cuts will make little difference 
No  The economy is strong enough to deal with higher rates     CNBC  

There are sources taking each of these positions  I expect all to be cited in the week ahead 
As always  I have my own ideas  reported in today s conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
The news of the week was mostly good 
Government shutdown less likely  The apparent choice of Paul Ryan as House Speaker is a good signal on this front  Investors who join me as political agnostics should not care about the partisan issues  just the consequences  We know that the market hates the uncertainty brought on by a debate over raising the debt limit  so this is good news 
Jobless claims  The lowest four week moving average since 1973    
China GDP beats forecasts benefiting from stimulus    
Central bank policy  China took aggressive action  but ECB President Mario Draghi needed only words   captured the essence of the story in a few words 

First there was the Fed  which backed off a rate hike in September  and seems unlikely to implement one at all this year  Earlier this week  the ECB chimed in  with President  dropping tea leaves the size of tires that the bank could and would expand its stimulus program later this year  if needed  Lastly    The People s Bank made two powerful moves  it cut interest rates by 25 basis points  and cut the reserve requirement ratio for banks  The ratio dictates how much money banks need to keep on hand  Cutting it is viewed as a very blunt and powerful way to push money into the economy  They needed to do something  China s third quarter GDP report was its worst showing since 2009  and most people think the real growth picture is even worse 


Housing data were strong   reported updates and additional commentary on each report 
Existing home sales
Builder confidence
Mortgage applications

Earnings beat rate  77  of stocks are beating reduced expectations    
The Bad
There was some negative data  including some of the important earnings stories 
Earnings commentary  The data showed success versus the lowered expectations  but the accompanying messages suggested continuing economic weakness  The  is a helpful companion piece  They are using   which now includes over 100 000 earnings calls  This is a great service that I use on my stocks  You should  too 
Housing permits declined   has a good story  noting that the overall trend is intact  This is an important indicator 
Bearish sentiment is declining  a contrary indicator    and helpful charts 

Earnings are poised for a second consecutive quarterly decline  currently estimated at 3 8    

The Ugly 
Cheating in science and medicine  Faked data supporting academic articles with faked reviews and email addresses   The    Perhaps authors should not be counted upon to suggest the reviewers  Sheesh 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  despite the abundance of really bad analysis  I am thinking of starting a nominee section  This would include items that have obvious errors but which have not attracted any replies or refutation  Almost any two variable chart these days is a candidate

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage

 from professional gambler Cathy Hulbert  Many of the psychology and money management issues are similar for those who have a real edge in these activities  If you have no edge  you should simply move on 
An edge is not enough if you cannot manage your emotions  Here are some examples of amateur mistakes 
The reasons for unnecessary and avoidable losses of amateur traders can often be attributed to the following 5 points 
Revenge trading  you open a new position just after your stop is triggered  without seeing valid re entry signals 
Playing catch up  you want to make up for past losses  force trades and violate your rules 
You flip through your charts without really knowing what you re looking for and then take trades that don t meet your criteria 
You want to avoid losses and  therefore  widen your stop loss order or take it off completely 
You miss a trading setup and then jump in too late  although you should have stayed out by then 
It is always good to have positive suggestions as well as mistakes to avoid  Dr  Brett is a reliable source for such advice   he has three important points that you would not think of on your own  A careful read of this would be time well spent for any trader  I especially like this suggestion 

Spend as much time learning from your trading as you actually spend trading   The ratio of practice time to performance time is a great predictor of elite performance  whether among Olympic athletes or chess champions 

Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  Start with our  and follow the links

Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important article  it would be this thoughtful analysis from Chuck Carnevale     Chuck analyzes a problem that many investors currently share  You buy a stock based upon your methods  in which you have confidence  The stock declines  You feel like you made a mistake   buyer s remorse  That is when you are prone to making a bad decision  Chuck does a detailed description of his decision  Whether you agree about the stock or not  you will learn from the analysis  We have all been there 

My case supporting investing in IBM  N IBM  is totally predicated on its generous current yield and my view of the safety and sustainability of its business  There is no shortage of positive and negative articles or reports across numerous financial blogs on IBM  Some of them contain important facts  but in my judgment  most of them represent simply the opinions of others  Personally  I prefer facts over opinions 

By the way   those who cite Warren Buffett s rule about not losing money should definitely read this article  Mr  Buffett does not worry about paper losses when the market disagrees with his own valuation  Losing money happens when you sell  just as Chuck explains 
See also  on the difference between the methods used by traders and investors  using Valeant  N VRX  as an example 
Public Stock Picking is Difficult 
The problem is how to get paid for your work  Those who analyze and write about stocks are under constant pressure to generate  actionable investment advice   It is all about page views  Chief Pundit Cramer generates so many recommendations that he is a walking bulls eye for critics  One retired professor sought to achieve accountability when a Cramer article made some especially strong claims  While Cramer never accepted the friendly bet  the original challenge is a matter of public record  The picks did not fare well   and the accounting on the 49 stock picks in question

The 20  of brokers with the highest ex ante predicted probability of investor harm are associated with more than 55  of the investor harm cases and the total dollar investor harm in our sample  Our findings suggest that investors have access to valuable information that allows them to discriminate between brokers with a high propensity for investor harm from other brokers

Market Outlook and Portfolio Evaluation

Final Thoughts
Will the Fed alter policy  Will it matter 
On the first question there are conflicting signals from excellent sources   much better than the ill informed opinions that make up most of the news flow on this subject  It is interesting to note that both sources see a vibrant internal debate at the Fed  where the discussion is free and wide ranging  Both sources provide some  inside baseball  that you will not see elsewhere 
Dovish  A rate increase is not imminent  and is likely to be delayed until mid 2016  Tim Duy  a leading expert on Fed watching   from a speech to business economists by Fed Governor Lael Brainard  Prof  Duy raves about the implications of this    Only a true expert and policy wonk could reach that conclusion  but that is why we should pay attention   Brainard is a   with outstanding academic credentials  consulting experience  and award winning work for think tanks and government  His key takeaway  She may join with an important Fed coalition that is less committed to an early rate hike 
Hawkish  The Fed bank boards are more supportive of an increase in the discount rate  For some years this rate has been 50 basis points above the fed funds rate  so it is an indicator of opinion about a rate increase  The bank presidents are frequently more hawkish than the appointed Governors  and their voting rights on the FOMC go through a rotation  Even so  an excellent and experienced observer  Bob Eisenbeis     shows the dramatic shift in the positions of the bank boards 

My own guess is  no change  at this meeting  but I have not ruled out a December shift 
Turning to the question of whether a policy change will matter for your investments   it is not likely unless you are focused on short term returns  The stock market skeptics believe two things 
The entire rally has been based upon central bank policy and increased liquidity
Even a gradual withdrawal of policy accommodation constitutes  tightening  
This leaves us with the ongoing market dilemma   time frames  Are we trading or investing  The former is a matter of psychology  while the latter rests upon your determination of the actual value of each potential investment

148043,369559,BHC,Valeant  The Real Scandal,opinion,"The Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  saga is probably a long way from a resolution  Anyone that says they know how it will end is either delusional or looking to influence the stock  That said  there are a few lessons to be gleaned 

Organic growth is superior to growth by acquisitions    especially when growth by acquisitions is financed with large amounts of debt and even more especially when that debt is fueled by Wall Street bond offerings 
In industries that rely on intellectual property  research and development spending is critical for survival 
Accounting transparency is a big deal  I m not saying that Valeant is Enron Part II  but I will say that unscrupulous behavior is a lot harder to detect when its wrapped up in complicated financial arrangements 
The more a company works to highlight non GAAP  AKA crap  results  the more investors should focus on GAAP results instead  As Gretchen Morgenson pointed out last week in the New York Times  Valeant earned  912 million in 2014 GAAP profits  while its non GAAP reported cash earnings were  2 85 billion 

Who s In
None of these lessons is new  They re commonsense  investing 101  which leads one to wonder why so many successful money managers have risked huge amounts on such an inherently sketchy business  Sequoia Fund s stake in Valeant is a staggering 34 million shares  Bill Ackman s Pershing Square Capital owns 20 million  SF based ValueAct  15 million  NYC based Paulson   Co  9 million  NYC based Lone Pine  5 million  and Greenwich based Viking Capital  5 million  New York s Brave Warrior Advisors  managed by Glenn Greenberg  son of legendary baseball player Hank Greenberg  has reportedly tied up more than a third of its assets in Valeant  These are massive investments from some of the biggest  best known funds in the world    and that is exactly where the problem lies 
These outsized bets are a side effect of liquidity  As assets under management grow  liquidity constraints reduce the number of potential stocks and bonds where a manager might make a meaningful investment  Everybody in money management knows this  but few discuss or acknowledge it  The optimum asset size    if maximizing performance potential is a firm s primary goal as opposed to maximizing the amount it can earn in fees    is almost always less than  1 billion  But a sub billion fund usually doesn t bring its managers fame or notoriety    and it certainly won t earn them enough to pay for record breaking apartments overlooking Central Park    so a combination of ego  greed and amorality seduces fund managers to bring in as many investors as they can  It gets harder and harder to produce great risk adjusted returns  The only way to do so without engaging in insider trading or other illegal practices is to lever up or beta up  That increases the risk of a performance blowup  Years ago  a famous Bay Area money manager friend summed the issue up succinctly   Almost everyone who manages over  500M is someone who checks his ethics at the front door every morning  
Behind The Curtain
The Valeant story shouldn t just raise questions about the fund managers who placed giant wagers on the company  We should also examine the people who gave those managers the capital to do so  Why would any asset allocator trust a multi billion dollar fund that continues to solicit new investors  The sad truth is that many large endowments and pension funds are overseen by political hacks with a minimal understanding of the investment landscape  Some endowments invest in funds solely because the manager is an alum and or significant donor  and the investment comes with the unspoken understanding that the manager will keep his or her donations flowing  It s a corrupt system  so I guess we shouldn t be terribly surprised when it results in the funding of  allegedly  corrupt companies like Valeant
What really makes my blood boil is the fact that nobody questions why the realized gains from university endowments are tax exempt  Or why donations to those endowments are tax deductible  Or why  unlike every other tax exempt organization in the country  university endowments are not required to give away five percent or more of their assets each year  Or why tax exempt organizations supposedly devoted to education have been raising the costs of tuition at an astronomical rate often at schools that educate no more students than they educated 30 or 40 years ago  Forget one pharmaceutical company and its  allegedly  suspicious accounting practices  These are the real scandals that deserve our attention    and our outrage ",2015-11-06,Scott Fearon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-real-scandals-in-the-valeant-story-have-nothing-to-do-with-valeant-270448,270448

148048,369564,BHC,Valeant CEO cuts outlook for  distracted  company  shares plunge,news,"By Amrutha Penumudi and Rod Nickel
Reuters    Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  TO VRX  slashed its 2016 forecasts on Tuesday  as its new chief executive said he would focus on rebuilding the reputation of a  distracted organization  with a debt loaded balance sheet 
The maker of toenail fungus cream Jublia and anti depressant drug Wellbutrin  which has faced intense scrutiny for business and accounting practices  missed first quarter profit estimates on weakness in its dermatology business 
The Laval  Quebec based drugmaker expects full year adjusted earnings of  6 60  7 00 per share  compared with its previous forecast of  8 50  9 50  and revenue of  9 9 billion  10 1 billion  down from  11 0 billion  11 2 billion 
The Canadian drugmaker s U S  listed shares  N VRX  slumped to close down 14 6 percent to  24 64  paring earlier losses of as much as 22 percent 
 Negative external attention continues to adversely impact the business and our reputation with patients  physicians and all of you  our shareholders  as well as our distracted organization   Chief Executive Joe Papa  who took over in May  said during a conference call with analysts 
He did not directly answer a question on whether there had been takeover offers for Valeant 
Ruane  Cunniff   Goldfarb Inc  one of Valeant s biggest shareholders  cut its stake by more than half to 4 7 percent as of May 31  it said in a regulatory filing 
The investment firm that runs the Sequoia Fund  long known for its ties to Warren Buffett  was sued by shareholders who claim it recklessly took a huge stake in Valeant 
Papa said the results reflected  significant disruption  over the past nine months  It will take up to six months to stabilize the company  he said  including staff recruitment  improving relationships with doctors and drug payers  selling assets and repaying debt 
Papa did not specify which assets would be put up for sale  but said they do not include core businesses of dermatology  consumer products  Bausch   Lomb eyecare and Salix gastrointestinal drugs 
The company has repaid  730 million of its roughly  30 billion in debt this year  and is aiming for total repayment of  1 7 billion  Valeant racked up much of the debt through its aggressive pace of acquisitions under former CEO Mike  Pearson   LON PSON  
Papa called Valeant s problems  speed bumps   but doubts remain for others 
Valeant has  15 billion in debt due by 2020  and  if the business stays the way it is  or continues to deteriorate  we believe Valeant will be challenged in making those debt payments   wrote  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analyst David Maris  During the analysts  call  he questioned executives about a lack of transparency in how the company offered guidance 
Up to Monday s close  the stock had fallen nearly 90 percent from its August 2015 high of  263 81 
Valeant filed its 2015 financial report in late April  after missing an original deadline of March 15 due to an in house review of its accounting practices  allaying concerns about a possible default on its debt  The probe found problems dating back to 2014 
The company  which will hold its 2016 annual meeting of shareholders on June 14  filed its quarterly report on Tuesday with the U S  regulators  ahead of a July 31 deadline 
Papa said there are still challenges  including with U S  dermatology sales  which are reliant on a pact with pharmacy Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  O WBA   Dermatology sales dropped 43 percent during the first quarter compared with the same period in the previous year 
Valeant s net loss was  373 7 million  or  1 08 per share in the first quarter  compared with a profit of  97 7 million  or 28 cents per share  a year earlier 
On an adjusted basis  Valeant earned  1 27 per share  missing the average analyst estimate of  1 37  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S

148053,369569,BHC,Ackman s Pershing Square hedge fund cuts eight staffers,news,"BOSTON  Reuters    Billionaire investor William Ackman  whose hedge fund is having double digit losses this year  cut 10 percent of his staff this week when he laid off eight lower level employees  a person familiar with the matter said on Friday 
The people who were laid off worked largely in investor services and were cut as the firm has increasingly automated certain tasks like filling in paperwork for investors  the person said  No investment team members were let go 
New York based Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  managed  12 billion at the end of May  down from  20 billion a year ago  The activist firm makes roughly a dozen concentrated bets and has long had a smaller staff than many similarly sized hedge funds 
This year has been difficult for the firm with the Pershing Square International Fund losing 17 29 percent since January  making it one of the industry s worst performers this year 
Last year the fund dropped 16 6 percent  largely due to Ackman s bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   whose share price has tumbled 90 percent in the last 12 months 
News of the layoffs was first reported by the Wall Street Journal ",2016-07-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ackman's-pershing-square-hedge-fund-cuts-eight-staffers-412015,412015
148054,369570,BHC,Activist hedge funds dial it back in first half of 2016,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Activist hedge funds were choosier in throwing their weight around corporate boardrooms during the first half of the year as they managed a smaller cash pile and struggled to beat benchmark returns 
Activist investors  including billionaires like Pershing Square s William Ackman and Trian Fund Management s Nelson Peltz  mounted 75 activist campaigns  a 7 percent drop from the first half of 2015 when they mounted 81  according to new data to be released on Tuesday by London based research group Activist Insight 
This year s figure is the lowest since the first half of 2013 when 72 campaigns were waged 
Campaigns can include high profile battles for board seats  public statements about strategy and critiques of senior management s performance 
 This is the first evidence that activists are slowing down   said Josh Black  an analyst at Activist Insight  which tracks activist fund managers and their activities 
Campaigns sharply increased between 2011 when funds mounted 53 in the first half and 2012 when there were 71 in the first six months  according to the data 
Headline making fights are still being mounted  including Barington Capital s contest for two board seats at Chico s FAS Inc  where the retailer said in its June 6 proxy statement that it plans to spend  5 9 million to stop the hedge fund s effort 
Overall activist investing has become slightly less noisy this year as returns are off and investors have taken home some cash as strong stock market returns  often helpful to activists  have ebbed 
While activists were once able to push companies into buying back stock or making other changes swiftly  they have recently focused more on operations  which can mean joining a board and having less time for other fights  Black said 
Starboard Value s Jeff Smith joined Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  Inc s board while Ackman joined Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  International Inc s board this year 
The Valeant investment has hurt Ackman  and his Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Holdings fund has lost 21 percent so far this year 
Peltz  Trian Partners is roughly flat 
On average  activist funds lost 0 38 percent in the first half  according to data from Chicago based Hedge Fund Research 
Activists  cash pile is also smaller  with assets at  112 5 billion at the end of the first quarter  down about 8 percent from  122 9 billion on Dec  31  2015  according to HFR data  In the first quarter investors pulled out  4 3 billion  a shift from the record  14 billion they added in 2014 ",2016-07-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/activist-hedge-funds-dial-it-back-in-first-half-of-2016-412499,412499
148070,369586,BHC,Healthcare Sector Outperforms S P 500 For Last 3 Years,opinion,"In time we may all owe a debt of thanks to Martin Shkreli  CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals and a former hedge fund manager  Their 5 456  increase in Daraprim brought attention to the importance of regular price hikes in driving revenue growth at major drug companies  The Wall Street Journal later noted that almost 80  of the increase in the top line for the manufacturers of 30 top selling drugs came from raising prices versus increasing volumes  It strikes me that this may just become a political issue in the U S   especially heading into an election year  High drug prices affect millions of Americans and it s easy for the media to find some poor individual whose needed medication has suddenly tripled in price  Hillary Clinton s infamous  price gouging  tweet shows that the issue easily lends itself to sound bites  a necessary condition to retain media interest  Big pharma represents a fairly easy target  Congressional hearings no doubt loom for companies such as Valeant  N VRX   whose business model relies on testing the limits of the market s acceptance for price hikes  They operate as a ruthless capitalist in a market where the laws of economics routinely fail  since customers  patients  are rarely informed buyers and typically incur the expense not directly through paying the asking price  but indirectly through consequently higher health insurance premiums or ultimately higher taxes  One friend told me he holds an investment in health care stocks as a hedge against rising medical expenses for him and his wife  an unusual yet insightful approach 
A common refrain from drug companies is that high drug prices  and the relatively unregulated U S  market has the highest  allow money to be reinvested back into R D  This is a weak argument  If research has a high enough IRR  it can be funded through capital from the public and private markets  it doesn t have to be through retained earnings  It s just as likely that the ability to charge whatever they can dramatically increases the IRR on R D  High drug prices themselves makes the R D more worthwhile than it would be otherwise 
We don t invest in healthcare stocks  as might be apparent  Therefore  to the extent we run investment strategies that are benchmarked against the S P 500  we are effectively short the health care sector  which has outperformed the S P 500 for the last three years and remains on pace to do so again in 2015  The issue of drug pricing isn t likely to recede soon though  and maybe health care stocks will start receiving some of the opprobrium so routinely heaped on banks and oil companies  The energy sector is due for a break as most out of favor 
Martin Shkreli used to work at a hedge fund  and he would probably like the economics of the General Partner  GP  in the MLP sector too  Targa Resources Partners  N NGLS  is an MLP whose business is divided between the midstream activities of Gathering and Processing  G P  of crude oil and natural gas across the central U S   and downstream activities of Marketing and Distribution  NGLS recently provided guidance for 2016 that included flat distribution growth  reflecting the more challenging environment for some energy infrastructure businesses  However  as the hedge fund is to the hedge fund manager  so is NGLS to Targa Resource Corp  N TRGP   the GP of NGLS  The same guidance projected 15  dividend growth at TRGP  Flat returns for hedge fund clients rarely hurt the hedge fund manager  and so it is at TRGP whose Incentive Distribution Rights  IDRs  are at the 50  level  entitling it to half the Distributable Cash Flow from NGLS  the MLP it controls through its ownership of the GP and IDRs  TRGP currently yields 6 3  on its forecast  4 12 2016 dividend  and with a market cap of  3 7BN is of sufficiently modest size to be of interest to many potential acquirers

148071,369587,BHC,Valeant s Decline Reveals Dirty Secret Of Fund Management ,opinion,"How would you feel if your equity fund manager lagged the index by 5  in a year  Supposing that you hired the manager  or bought his fund  as part of the diversified equity part of your portfolio and he missed by 5  in a year  Let s say that you ve been patient  and then he underperforms by another 5  in the next six months  Would you fire someone who lags the market by 10  in 18 months 
Returns vs  business risk
I have met people who say that they love managers who hit the home run and loathe benchmark huggers  but investors get very nervous when their managers lag the market by as little as 5 10  in a relatively short  1 3 years  time frame  From the perspective of the manager  this level of risk tolerance brings up the issue of business risk  How do you maximize performance using your process  or  secret sauce   without taking on excessive business risk that sinks the entire firm 
Risk comes in all shapes and sizes  For an equity portfolio  common sources of risk are sector and industry risk  market cap risk and stock specific risk  To illustrate my example  consider the lowly issue of stock specific risk  which should be diversifiable  at least according to theory  
The recent case of price volatility in Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  TO VRX   is an instructive example in risk control  In the past few weeks  I have spoken to a number of Canadian portfolio managers whose performance was blindsided by specific risk from that one single stock  The outlook for VRX is highly divisive and talking about it is the equivalent of bringing up touchy topics like religion or gun control in polite company   Incidentally  I have no opinion on the stock  
The chart below depicts the price of VRX in the top panel and the TSX VRX ratio in the bottom panel  which shows what would have happened to relative performance had a manager had no position in VRX for the past few years 
  Despite the fact that the stock got hit yesterday  VRX has shown remarkable returns in the past few years  In the space of about 5 years  the stock has become a 10 bagger and anyone who didn t own it would have underperformed the index  bottom panel   Consider the following effects for a manager who did not hold VRX 
If he didn t own it at the end of 2013  the relative return shortfall would be over 8  when VRX hit its peak this year  For some investment organizations  that kind of shortfall could be a near death experience 
Even with the pullback  the relative performance shortfall would only be back to 2013 levels and would have not made up for the shortfalls in the previous years 
The art of business risk management
The analysis brings up a key question for the business risk for investment management operations  Yes  we would all like to have the courage to bet our investment convictions  but how much business risk is the practice willing to take  Supposing that an operation were to lose half its clients because of a single decision on a stock  what does that do to the bottom line  Revenues would go down by about 50   but there are fixed costs such as rent  salaries  systems  legals  etc  Profitability would plunge in such an instance  Is the investment management business willing to take that kind of risk 
If not  then there are a couple of steps a manager can do  First  he has to decide the appropriate level of stock specific risk he is willing to take against the benchmark  Supposing a stock has a 3 5  weight in the benchmark  would you hold a 0  if you ranked it a  sell    3 5  bet   a non zero weight  such as 2 5       1  vs  benchmark  or 1 5       2  vs  benchmark  
On the other hand  if you ve ranked it a  buy   would a 5 5  weight      2  vs  benchmark  be appropriate  What about 8 5       5  vs  benchmark  
Another way of approaching the problem would be to try and determine the median competitor weight in the stock  with techniques that I have written about before   Then set benchmark weight to be the median competitor weight instead of the index weight 
I show this example as just how a simple decision on a single stock can crash an entire investment management practice  I haven t even gone into all the other ways that risk can rear its ugly head  such as macro factor  sector  size and so on 
Asking too much of managers 
This post also illustrates the dirty little secret of fund management  Investors are asking too much of managers and managers are consequently reacting rationally by closet indexing 
Investors have to ask themselves  How much rope are you willing to give a manager to succeed  Is John Hussman flaming out  or is he a brilliant thinker going through a bad patch  Other well known managers like Bill Miller and Ken Heebner have had their ups and downs  how patient are you willing to be  If you have a low level of patience  then you are forcing managers to become benchmark huggers because you are not giving them enough room to win 
For managers  Given the realities of the market  how much risk are you willing to take so you don t crash your firm

148111,369627,BHC,Rolling Out Decisions  Evaluating A VRX Trade,opinion,"Rolling options is an important exit strategy choice when selling covered call and put options  Options can be rolled up and down in the same contract month or a future contract month  For the most part  we roll down in the same contract month and roll out or out and up in the next contract month  I recently wrote an article evaluating a trade executed by one of our members where an option was rolled up in the same contract month  an approach I rarely subscribe to  In this article we will evaluate another real life trade by one of our members  we have a great group   where an option was rolled out  The two month results were positive but could they have been better 


The initial trade with VRX  Month 1 

5 26 2015  Buy 100 NYSE VRX at  234 60
5 26 2015  Sell 1 x June  240 00 call at  4 50
6 17 15  Early on expiration Friday the stock was still trading near  234 60

Let s feed this preliminary information into the multiple tab of the Ellman Calculator 


VRX  Initial Calculations


We see a respectable 1 9  initial return with the possibility of an additional 2 3  from share appreciation  Because share price remained stagnant  the actual one month return was 1 9  or 23  annualized  Very nice so far 


The second trade with VRX  Month 2 

The option was rolled out to the next month  240 strike  This involved closing the June  240 00 contract  BTC  and opening the July  240 00 contract  STO   The option credit for these trades netted  0 20  Then  mid contract  the option was rolled down to the  235 00 strike  Here are the trades in month 2 

6 17 2015  Rollout to the July  240 00 strike for a net credit of  20 00 for the contract
7 8 2015  BTC  buy to close  the July  240 00 call at  2 35
7 9 2015  STO  sell to open  the July  235 00 call at  4 50
7 17 2015  VRX was trading at  240 00 level and shares were sold at  235 00


Calculating 2 month returns

The shares were purchased at  234 60 and sold for  235 00  a net credit of  40 00 for the 100 shares  less small trading commissions   There were option credits of  450 00    20 00  includes rolling option debit     450 00    920 00  There was an option debit of  235 00  The net option credit was  685 00  The total position credit was  685 00    40 00    725 00 which calculates to a 2 month return of 3 1  on a cost basis of  23 460 00  This annualizes to 18 5   On the surface  this looks pretty good  especially when we compare it to other investment choices we have these days 


Could the trade have been improved 

As Blue Collar Investors  we are always looking for ways to elevate our returns  even good ones  to higher levels  A 3 1  2 month return appears reasonable on the surface  but of that total  1 9  was generated in month 1  The remaining 1  was generated in month 2  so therein lies the weakness of this 2 month trade  It seems that the option from month 1 was rolled when there was no need to do so  The share price was much less than the strike   240 00   and so allowing the option to expire worthless was the prudent thing to do  take no action   That would eliminate any time value spent to close the near month option plus eliminate one commission  Since the shares would not be sold  the next month option could be sold on Monday  Let s make the reasonable assumption that the time value remaining on the near month option was  0 10 and so the next month  240 00 strike sold for  0 30  leaving a net credit of  0 20  Even if the option wasn t rolled  the initial return of the next month option   0 30 is our educated assumption  only generated 0 12  initial profit  far too little 


How to improve this 2 month trade

First  don t roll the option
Sell a lower strike if VRX was still maintained as an underlying security  probably the  235 00 strike  which was used late in the contract
Using the  235 00 strike would have generated a significantly higher time value return  especially if it was used early in the contract  It is reasonable to assume the return would be greater than the  4 50 originally generated in the near month trade  which had a higher strike of  240 00  
If the calculations for VRX did not meet our goals  sell the stock and use a different security

Discussion

Exit strategies like rolling options are absolutely critical to maximizing covered call returns  There are times when these strategies should and should not be used  Setting goals for initial monthly returns is one way we are guided to proper decisions  For example  if a trader sets a goals range for monthly returns of 2 4  as I do  a rolling return of 0 12  would never be given consideration  That said  the trade was an overall success and I commend our member for the way it was managed  Now  lets take that 18  annualized return and bump it up even higher

148112,369628,BHC,Clinton Takes Down Biotechnology ETF  Buy The News ,opinion,"The shot was heard around the world of biotech yesterday 

The reaction was immediate and sharp for iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Fund  NASDAQ IBB  as it lost 4 6  on the day on trading volume nearly 3x the 3 month average 
Hillary Clinton s tweet was enough to take down iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB   However  IBB has proven very resilient in the face of earlier strong selling pressures 
I doubt many of the quick trigger fingers bothered to read the NY Times article that was the source of Clinton s outrage  Here are some of the key paragraphs from the beginning of  

 Specialists in infectious disease are protesting a gigantic overnight increase in the price of a 62 year old drug that is the standard of care for treating a life threatening parasitic infection 
The drug  called Daraprim  was acquired in August by Turing Pharmaceuticals  a start up run by a former hedge fund manager  Turing immediately raised the price to  750 a tablet from  13 50  bringing the annual cost of treatment for some patients to hundreds of thousands of dollars 
Turing s price increase is not an isolated example  While most of the attention on pharmaceutical prices has been on new drugs for diseases like cancer  hepatitis C and high cholesterol  there is also growing concern about huge price increases on older drugs  some of them generic  that have long been mainstays of treatment 
Although some price increases have been caused by shortages  others have resulted from a business strategy of buying old neglected drugs and turning them into high priced  specialty drugs  

Missing from the article was a specific quantification of the scale of the problem  the cost to the health care system  and or an estimate of excess profits made by the industry  The article was mainly focused on specific cases of egregious price hikes and a fascinating examination of the background of Martin Shkreli  the founder and chief executive of Turing  Ironically  the article also note that two members of Congress wrote a letter in August to Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  to investigate sharp price hikes on two recently acquired heart medications  One of those Congressmen  independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders  is fiercely competing with Clinton for nomination from the Democratic party for President  Is it possible that Clinton is moving quickly to prevent Sanders from getting all the credit for going after evil drug companies 
None of these gaps and intricacies matter for now as sellers seek to get out first and ask questions later  If I traded this special situation  I would stand ready to buy as soon as Clinton announced released her plan  hopefully her plan at least fills in some of the gaps left by the article   The buy the news strategy gets more tempting the deeper the selling going into Clinton s announcement 
Certainly  risks to IBB have increased some unknown amount and perhaps IBB deserves to lose some of its premium  However  given the main business model of IBB constituent companies is NOT price gouging  Clinton s sabre rattling could very well end up tangential to IBB s prospects 
Moreover  there are multiple layers of uncertainty ahead  Clinton wins the Democratic nomination  maybe a Sanders nomination has the same impact for drug companies  but theoretically the market already got a chance to panic about the odds of a Sanders victory   Clinton wins the Presidency  Clinton gets Congress to pass a related bill  said bill survives a battery of legal challenges  In other words  there are many  many years between now and the time that we could even have a hope of knowing whether any kind of related regulation descends upon IBB  The present value of this uncertainty is probably just about zero  Thus  buying IBB on a bet that Clinton related losses will eventually reverse seems like a good risk reward bet 
Note also the past resiliency of IBB to past selling  From a technical perspective  IBB SHOULD have topped out already  Monday s high volume selling  September 21  2015  confirmed the 50 day moving average  DMA  as resistance and cracked the even more important 200DMA  The current close is just the third lowest close since the flash crash  In other words  the technical stakes are VERY high here

148113,369629,BHC, 1 Reason Stocks Are Declining  Is Hillary To Blame For Biotech Smash ,opinion,"In the wake of yet another big market selloff  biotechs down over 6  today   the Nasdaq 100 index down 2 87   and the S P 500 down 2 56   mainstream media parrots floated numerous reasons behind the selloff 
All of the parrots are wrong 
Lack of Inflation 
Bloomberg interviewed Jeff Korzenik  Fifth Third Bank s chief strategist in its piece  
In the accompanying video  Korzenik blamed the Fed and a  lack of visible inflation  
In the same video segment  Jamie Dimon bragged about the strength of the US economy and the health of the US consumer  As long as a bubble is expanding  things always look good 
Of course the idea that inflation is a benefit to stocks and the economy is preposterous  but that s what puppets have been trained to believe  and say 
China to Blame 
Reuters writer Noel Randewich says  

 U S  stocks finished sharply lower on Monday and were on track for their worst quarter in four years as investors worried about the health of China s economy and its potential impact on the timing of a U S  interest rate increase  

Is Hillary to Blame for Biotech Smash 
Reuters writers Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot say  

Democratic lawmakers on Monday attacked  massive  price increases of two heart drugs from Canada s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX   fueling a rout in drugmaker shares on worries of a government and insurer clampdown on U S  drug prices 
The Democratic House members also urged panel Chairman Jason Chaffetz  a Republican  to invite Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson  LONDON PSON  to testify at a hearing next week  That would put him in the same hot seat as Martin Shkreli  chief executive officer of privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals  who had already been called to testify 
Tiny Turing has been widely criticized for a price hike of more than 5 000 percent for its Daraprim treatment for a dangerous parasitic infection 
Clinton on Monday called on Turing to roll back the  750 price to its original  13 50 
Clinton last week unveiled a plan that includes a  250 monthly cap on out of pocket costs for prescription drugs  it would allow the Medicare plan for the elderly to negotiate drug pricing  and permit Americans to buy drugs more cheaply from other countries 
  Stock  selling hasn t really stopped since Hillary Clinton made her comments last week on Monday   said Jeff Jonas  a portfolio manager with Gabelli funds   The Democratic committee members would certainly continue that trend that Hillary started  

Biotech Sector Daily

That looks pretty ominous  But let s put a proper perspective on things 
Biotech Sector Weekly


History suggests the recent selloff is just a start of a correction  Charts like those above smack of bubbles  and bubbles typically do not deflate in an orderly manner 
 1 Reason Stocks are Declining
To paraphrase Bill  It s the economy  stupid  Clinton  I suggest  It s the valuations  stupid  
Valuations are well beyond absurd  Many biotechs won t ever make a dime  And it s not just biotechs  Most market segments have absurd valuations 
The market is starting to care  a reflection of a change in sentiment  Hillary s statements may have been a catalyst for a sentiment change  but most likely she merely goosed sentiment that had already changed 
Not to Blame 
China is not to blame 
Hillary is not to blame 
Fed hikes are not to blame 
To Blame
Rate hike discussion is not to blame 
However  the Fed itself is to blame for creating the loosey goosey conditions that fostered a bubble in equities and junk bonds 
The Fed will now have to deal with yet another asset bubble crash  they don t even see coming   Price deflation the Fed foolishly attempted to defeat  is now more likely than ever 
Price deflation never was  nor ever will be  an economic problem  Asset bubbles are always a problem  The Fed still has not figured this out  Thanks to group think  the Fed never will figure this out

WTI Oil
Crude oil prices fell more than 2  on Monday  reversing gains from late last week  amid mounting concerns that an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve will weigh on energy prices worldwide

Iran is reportedly hoarding 30 million barrels of crude ready for export shortly after a deal is implemented  It has been estimated that Iran could increase oil exports by as much as one million barrels per day within a year of the final approval of the agreement  So the deal is widely considered bearish for crude

148145,369661,BHC,Stocks Break Out Again But May Be Running On Fumes,opinion,"Despite low trading volume  a strong dollar  mixed economic and earnings reports  paralyzing weather conditions throughout much of the U S   and ominous global news events  stocks continue to march ever higher  The world remains on edge about potential Black Swan events from the likes of Russia  Greece  or ISIS  or lone wolf extremists   Moreover  the economic recovery of the U S  may be feeling the pull of the proverbial ball and chain from the rest of the world s economies  Nevertheless  awash in investable cash  global investors see few choices better than U S  equities 

In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 

Market overview 

Happy days are here again  or so the U S  stock market would have us believe  as all major indices are hitting or challenging new highs  The S P 500 long ago eclipsed the 2000 mark and is now holding above 2100  The Dow Jones Industrials is solidly above 18 000  Even small caps and mid caps have joined the new high party  The NASDAQ  which hasn t challenged its Internet bubble high of 5 048 in 15 years  managed to close Monday above 5 000 and seems determined to make its own new high    perhaps this week  As a reminder  next Monday  the bull market will reach its 6 year anniversary 

Stock buybacks and M A continue at a robust pace  even though these aren t the most popular uses of cash reserves among activist investors  who tend to prefer capital expenditures  hiring  and increased dividends  Nevertheless  the market has applauded some recent M A that involved some of our top stock picks  Last week  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX   which is in Sabrient s annual Baker s Dozen top picks list this year  spiked  14  after announcing it would acquire former Sabrient favorite Salix Pharmaceuticals  SLXP   which 16 months ago bought another of our former favorites Santarus  Then today  NXP Semiconductor  NXPI   which has been in three consecutive Baker s Dozen top picks lists  announced it will acquire Freescale Semiconductor  FSL   which is also highly ranked in our system  NXPI was up over  17  for the day 

Earnings season is winding down  and FactSet reported Q4 earnings growth to be  3 7  overall  which is pretty good  although revenue growth has been much more muted  Q4 GDP was revised downward to  2 2  and the ISM manufacturing index fell to 52 9  due in part to the West Coast port slowdown   but both are still pretty good  So  economic growth continues to slog ahead  and the Fed is expected to continue on its path toward normalizing monetary policy  Although there might be some short term hits to stocks when rates start bumping up  the consensus is that it would take a fed funds rate of over 3  before there would be any meaningfully negative impact on the economy  With inflation nowhere in sight  it is unlikely we will see fed funds rate that high anytime soon 

Overseas  China has again cut rates by 25 bps as its economy sputters  relatively speaking   inflation remains low  and credit continues to expand  And in Europe  Greece seems to be more willing to work out a deal than the new government s bluster initially suggested  Nevertheless  global demand for U S  Treasury bonds remains strong  and much of that demand is from Europe  Indeed  the U S  10 Year Treasury yield closed Monday at 2 08  as it consolidates after its February spike  and Bloomberg reported last week that institutions are piling into bond ETFs at the fastest pace on record  taking in  32 billion globally this year 

Given that the Fed is likely to start tightening later this year  does that necessarily suggest poor stock performance and widening credit spreads  Apparently not  Scott Minerd of Guggenheim points out that during the nine months leading up to first rate increase over the past six tightening periods since 1980  the S P 500 has returned an average of  23 5  while high yield bonds have outperformed investment grade bonds by 4 0  

The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a  fear gauge  closed Monday at 13 04 and remains below the 15 threshold  reflecting investor complacency 

SPY chart review 

The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 210 66 and continues to make new highs on modest volume  It is in a minor uptrend that appears to be setting up as a bullish ascending triangle  with higher lows  However  oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all somewhat overbought and look overdue for a more significant pullback    which would be healthy by testing support levels and recharging bullish conviction  Support resides at the 20 day simple moving average currently near 208  the 50 day SMA around 206  the 100 day SMA and the lower uptrend line  which are both near 203  and then the critical 200 day SMA that is now approaching 200  With blue skies overhead  a further rally could make it up to the upper trend line of the long standing bullish channel  which is approaching 215  Even with the overbought conditions and the need for a corrective pullback  the chart remains bullish in the mid and longer term 



Latest sector rankings  

Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 

In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 

Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  NYSE IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  NYSE IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  NYSE IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  NYSE IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  NYSE IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  NYSE IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  NYSE IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  NYSE IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

 Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 

1  Technology has moved back into first place with an Outlook score of 78  followed closely by Financial at 77  Technology displays the best return ratios  a good forward long term growth rate and forward P E  and among the best sell side analyst sentiment  i e   only minor net downward revisions to earnings estimates   Financial displays by far the lowest forward P E  reasonably good forward long term growth rate  and reasonably good sentiment among both insiders  buying activity  and sell side analysts  Consumer Goods Staples  Industrial  and Healthcare round out the top five  Notably  Utilities took the brunt of the net downward earnings revisions and fell pretty far down the rankings  while Industrial and Basic Materials have seen a solid improvement in their scores  which is bullish 

2  Once again  Energy continues to hold the bottom spot given the persistent weakness in oil prices and the ongoing downward earnings revisions  although the Wall Street onslaught has greatly diminished  Energy is among the worst in all factors in the model  with the exception of return ratios  Joining Energy in the bottom two is Telecom 

3  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy and Basic Materials display the top score of 59  followed by Financial and Technology at 58  Utilities scores the lowest at 46  The top bottom spread is 13 points  which is still somewhat on the low side but better than the tight spreads we were seeing several weeks ago  It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 

4  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities displays the highest score of 63 this week  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens on weak market days  Financial has the lowest score of 41  followed closely by Energy  The top bottom spread has widened to 22 points  which indicates low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations and a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 

5  Technology displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities is the strongest  followed closely by Healthcare  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Financial is the worst due to its low Bear score  Healthcare displays the most balanced performance overall 

6  Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings look a lot more bullish to me  with economically sensitive sectors Tech  Financial  Industrial  and all weather Healthcare in the top five and the emergence of Basic Materials  Pushed back down near the bottom are defensive sectors Utilities and Telecom  which also have some of the higher Bear scores  What would further enhance the bullishness of the rankings would be if Technology had a score above 90 and if Consumer Services Discretionary switched place with Consumer Goods  But overall  I would call this a bullish ranking for stocks  However  keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 

Stock and ETF Ideas 

Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   retains its bullish bias  and the model suggests holding Technology  Financial  and Industrial  in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based trend following standpoint when SPY is above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  

Other highly ranked ETFs from the Technology  Financial  and Industrial sectors include iShares Goldman Sachs Network  NYSE IGN   iShares DJSU Financial Services  NYSE IYG   and iShares DJ Transport Average Index  ARCA IYT  

For an enhanced sector portfolio that enlists some top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within the top ranked sectors  some long ideas from Technology  Financial  and Industrial sectors include CommScope  COMM   Brocade Communications Systems  BRCD   Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   Affiliated Managers Group  NYSE AMG   Union Pacific  NYSE UNP   and JetBlue Airways  JBLU   All are highly ranked in the  

However  if you prefer to maintain a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology  Financial  and Consumer Goods Staples  in that order  And if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Healthcare  and Consumer Goods Staples  in that order 

IMPORTANT NOTE  I post this information each week as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation  It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules based strategy in a real money portfolio  I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance  and I may or may not update the information each week  There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy  including monthly or quarterly rebalancing  perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish neutral defensive bias when warranted    but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this weekly article  The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks  or stock options  that are also highly ranked  but this introduces greater risks and volatility  I do not track performance of the ETF and stock ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio

148147,369663,BHC,Earnings  GDP Take Spotlight Off The fed,opinion,"As we get into the heart of earnings season and anticipate the GDP report for Q1  the investor spotlight has been taken off the Federal Reserve and timing of its first interest rate hike  at least temporarily  Even though Q1 economic growth will undoubtedly look weak  the future remains bright for the U S economy   even though many multinationals will struggle with top line growth due to the strong dollar   and any near term selloff resulting from weak economic or earnings news should be bought yet again in expectation of better results for the balance of the year  High sector correlations remain a concern  reflecting herd like risk on risk off behavior rather than thoughtful stock picking 
In this weekly update  I give my view of the current market environment  offer a technical analysis of the S P 500 chart  review our weekly fundamentals based SectorCast rankings of the ten U S  business sectors  and then offer up some actionable trading ideas  including a sector rotation strategy using ETFs and an enhanced version using top ranked stocks from the top ranked sectors 
Market Overview
Similar to Q1 2014  it appears that severe winter weather in the US is going to reveal its harsh impact on Q1 economic activity  which is likely to show economic growth near zero or even negative  GDP is scheduled to be released on April 29  Other negative factors include cutbacks in Energy sector spending  the West Coast port slowdown  and the strong dollar  Already  we have seen consumer spending flat or declining in December  January  and February  jobs growth has slowed  and U S  retail sales had its worst 3 month performance since 2009  Nevertheless  most economists are still forecasting positive growth  so investors might decide to sell first and let the dust settle if when bad numbers are actually released 
With the reduced expectation for corporate earnings  the S P 500 has a forward valuation that has reached about 17x  Moreover  the CAPE  cyclically adjusted P E  has reach about 28x  which is the highest since the pre meltdown years of 1928 and 2007 
Of course  the U S  10 Year Treasury was yielding around 4 5  in July 2007  whereas it closed last week at 1 95   so the equity markets can justify higher valuation multiples  Nevertheless  a poor GDP report could send equity investors scurrying for cover while the 10 year yield would likely retreat to its January low near 1 7   But I would take such circumstances as yet another buying opportunity in anticipation of better economic news going forward  given the milder weather  There is still underlying US economic strength and a cautious optimism of continued recovery  despite the strong dollar  With their general focus on the domestic market  small caps in particular should continue to thrive 
The Fed has had it ZIRP  zero interest rate policy  in place since December 16  2008  Today  given the tight credit spreads  which indicates optimism about continued recovery   low unemployment  near the Fed s target   and a strong equities market  that is still somewhat undervalued relative to bonds   some are predicting the first fed funds rate hike will finally arrive in June  However  given the absence of inflation and a strong  and strengthening  dollar  I think the Fed might choose to hold off until September  particularly if the Q1 GDP growth is weak 
The VIX  a k a  the  fear gauge   closed Friday at 12 58  which is now well below the 15 threshold between investor fear and complacency  Notably  ConvergEx reports that the average price correlation among the 10 S P 500 business sectors continued to be quite high at 82   although Energy stocks were 53  correlated   Moreover  EAFE stocks  in US dollars  also showed 82  correlation to the S P 500  while emerging market stocks showed 77  correlation  As for high yield bonds  they showed only a 57  correlation to the S P 500  Of course  it s much more preferable for there to be low correlations reflecting investor selectivity in their choices  rather than herd like risk on risk off behavior 
SPY Chart Review
The SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 210 05 after a strong week  Once again  it found reliable support at the lower uptrend line of the long standing bullish rising channel  bolstered by the 100 day simple moving average  Each test of support led to a successively smaller bull flag continuation pattern  and only time will tell as to whether the latest bounce will lead to a challenge of the February highs near 212  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all on a bullish trajectory  In last week s article  I predicted a strong move one direction or the other but with an expectation that it would be to the upside  We ll see whether the bulls can keep it going given the anticipation of market moving earnings and economic reports that will come out over the next few weeks  and of course the historically weak month of May lurking on the horizon  Below the 100 day SMA and the uptrend line resides the critical 200 day SMA  around 202  followed by round number support at the 200 price level 

Latest Sector Rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well  i e   safe havens  when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  NYSE IYF   Technology  NYSE IYW   Industrial  NYSE IYJ   Healthcare  NYSE IYH   Consumer Goods  NYSE IYK   Consumer Services  NYSE IYC   Energy  NYSE IYE   Basic Materials  NYSE IYM   Telecommunications  NYSE IYZ  and Utilities  NYSE IDU   Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 
 Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
Healthcare remains in first place with a solid Outlook score of 86  Healthcare displays good sell side analyst sentiment  net revisions to earnings estimates  and above average scores in most factors in the model  including return ratios  forward long term growth rate  and insider sentiment  buying activity   Financial takes second with a score of 81  with reasonably good analyst and insider sentiment and the lowest forward P E  Technology falls to third this week at 80 and still displays good factor scores across the board  including the highest return ratios 
The rankings have returned to their 3 tier bunching of Outlook scores  After Healthcare  Financial  Tech  and Utilities at the top  the middle tier has Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   Consumer Services  Discretionary Cyclical   Industrial  and Basic Materials  and at the bottom remains Energy and Telecom  Energy continues to hold the bottom spot with an Outlook score of 2 given the persistent weakness in oil prices and the ongoing downward earnings revisions from Wall Street  Energy is among the worst in all factors in the model  including a forward long term growth rate near zero and by far the highest forward P E 
Looking at the Bull scores  Industrial displays the top score of 62  followed by Healthcare  Notably  Energy saw its score rise quite a bit this week all the way up to 60  Telecom sports the lowest Bull score of 51  Once again  all scores are above 50  and the top bottom spread remains relatively narrow at only 11 points  which reflects elevated sector correlations  i e   broad risk on buying   It is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold 
Looking at the Bear scores  Energy displays the highest  i e   best  score of 49  which means that stocks within this sector have been the preferred safe havens  relatively speaking  on weak market days  Industrial is the lowest at 39  The top bottom spread remains a narrow 10 points  which reflects elevated sector correlations on particularly weak market days  i e   broad risk off selling   Ideally  certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off  so it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
Healthcare displays the best all around combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Energy is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Energy has surged to the top  followed by Utilities and Healthcare  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   while Telecom scores the worst 
Overall  this week s fundamentals based Outlook rankings have taken a slightly more defensive tone  given the move in Utilities and Consumer Goods  Staples Noncyclical   and the fall in Industrial  Thus  I would characterize the rankings as neutral  Keep in mind  the Outlook Rank does not include timing or momentum factors  but rather is a reflection of the fundamental expectations of individual stocks aggregated by sector 
Stock And ETF Ideas
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or defensive   has returned to a bullish bias and suggests holding Healthcare  Financial  and Technology in that order   Note  In this model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based trend following standpoint when  ARCA SPY  is above both its 50 day and 200 day simple moving averages  
Other highly ranked ETFs from the Healthcare  Financial  and Technology sectors include First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund  NYSE FBT    First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank Index Fund  NASDAQ QABA  and First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund  NASDAQ TDIV

If you prefer to maintain a neutral bias  the Sector Rotation model still suggests holding Healthcare  Financial  and Technology  in that order  But if you prefer a defensive stance on the market  the model suggests holding Healthcare  Utilities  and Energy  in that order

148153,369669,BHC,The new Valeant CEO s pay package is putting the company in serious danger,news,"If you blinked  you may have missed it   a lot of politicians did 
It s the part of incoming Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  CEO Joe Papa s pay package that makes it a dangerous deal 
 Wednesday that Papa agreed to a  67 million pay package 
But that s not the most important part here 
If Valeant s shares reach a price of  270  Papa will get stock equaling  500 million 
That s right  If Papa manages to get the embattled company s stock up by eight times its current level  he ll take home a staggering amount of money 
This news broke at the end of Wednesday s Senate hearing for Valeant  the former Wall Street darling under fire for buying up drugs and then jacking up their prices by  sometimes  triple digit percentages 
Claire McCaskill  D MO  had things to say about the package Thursday morning too 
 In terms of Mr  Papa s compensation package  it strikes me as tone deaf to incentivize the exact kind of raise the stock price at all costs mentality that drove Valeant s immoral and disastrous business strategy to this point   she said in a statement 
 I certainly hope I m wrong and that he has success in moving this company in a new direction  but the onus will be on him and Valeant to prove that  as they long ago lost the benefit of the doubt with the American public  
This is really a story about how a company incentivizes its CEO to care about stock price more than anything else   more than customers  employees  or products   and this is also a story about how that incentivization goes totally over Washington s head 
See no evil
See  McCaskill s colleague  Sen  Susan Collins  R Maine   also had a reaction to this news on Wednesday  She heard about the news just as she was closing the hearing  Collins  mic was still on  and it picked up her dismay just before cameras cut out on the hearing 
 Did you see this last thing  the pay   67 million  This is outrageous   she said 
Afterward  though  when reporters asked her about the issue  she said that billionaire hedge fund manager and Valeant board member Bill Ackman  who had been testifying  talked her off the ledge 
Here s what she said  emphasis ours  
Well  I just asked Mr  Ackman about that and he says that that is not accurate  My staff gave me a heart attack at the end of the hearing by handing me an email saying that the new CEO was being paid  67 4 million  That is not what was explained to us by Mr  Ackman  He explained a very complicated process where there is a base salary and then over a four year period  if the stock goes up  there are bonuses that would be given  But the stock has to go up considerably in order for those bonuses to be paid  There was nothing that added up to  67 4 million in one year  I would encourage you to ask him because he negotiated the deal  This was the first question I asked him when I learned of this 
It s a good question  Sen  Collins  but it s not at all the right one  The real prize here is the  500 million Papa would get for bringing Valeant s stock price back up  So the question isn t how much he s getting  but how he s getting it 
And given the setup in place  who do you think that  270 a share threshold will incentivize Papa to put first  his customers or the shareholders 
Hear no evil
During the hearing  outgoing Valeant CEO Michael  Pearson   LON PSON  said that he regretted making statements that made it seem like he only cared about shareholder interests 
 I have come to realize that because many of my public statements have occurred in the context of talking with shareholders   and those remarks naturally focused on shareholders  interests   my cumulative public comments have left the misimpression that shareholder interests were my only focus as CEO of Valeant   he said 
But it was never just Pearson s public statements that gave the impression that he cared about shareholders first  It was his actions   the company s aggressive business model  which he pioneered  It was Valeant s low budget for research and development and the high margins that came from buying drugs and then jacking up their prices  It was the growth model was made it attractive shareholders and dangerous for patients 
Now that this model isn t available anymore  Valeant has said it will have to rely on selling a large volume of drugs in order to make the profits it used to enjoy  That hasn t happened yet  and analysts don t think it will happen this year at all  In fact  the company has dampened expectations for 2016 
Plus  if the company stands by its commitment to lower prices    it could be a long time before it does  At the hearing  board member and billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said he would bring down prices 30   That isn t much for some drugs that have seen their prices increase by triple digits  but it s likely enough to keep Valeant s glory days out of reach 
Speak no evil
So what is incoming CEO Joe Papa  whose compensation is tied to the company s stock price  to do  Is he to try his best to make something out of a lower growth  lower margin business model and be happy with that 
Or should he go back to being aggressive about bringing up the stock price by any means necessary 
Papa is being brought over to Valeant from Perrigo  an over the counter drug maker  While he was there  Papa engaged in some of the same behavior as Valeant  For two examples  Perrigo  to avoid US taxes  like Valeant left for Canada   and Perrigo   like Valeant  even as it was fending off a hostile bid from Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  
Again  this is part of a model Valeant pioneered when it was profitable    even with all the lip service  and so far it s just that  lip service  that top brass have given to lowering prices  it will be hard for a new CEO not to go back to the basics that drove the stock price up to the triple digits 
McCaskill  for her part  does not seem convinced 
 Only time will tell if this amounts to meaningful  substantive change or if it s simply rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic in a desperate attempt to fool the business community into believing the company is headed in a different direction   she said in her statement

148157,369673,BHC,New Mexico public employees to exit Ackman s Pershing Square,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
NEW YORK  Reuters    New Mexico s public employees are taking their final chunk of money out of billionaire investor William Ackman s hedge fund Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management  the pension fund s chief investment officer said on Friday 
The  14 billion pension is asking the  12 billion hedge fund to return  13 million  the last remaining bit of a once larger investment  Jonathan Grabel  chief investment officer for the Public Employees Retirement Association of New Mexico told Reuters in a telephone interview 
Pershing Square was a top industry performer in 2014  when it delivered a 40 percent return  But more recently it has been close to the bottom  losing 20 percent last year 
Through April its Pershing Square International fund has lost nearly 15 percent while the average hedge fund is up 0 8 percent  according to eVestment  As one of the industry s biggest activist hedge funds with bets on Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd   Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ  and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX   it features prominently in many pension funds 
But Pershing Square locks its investors  money up for a long time    it takes them two full years to exit completely    and so Grabel said his pension fund had to move now or risk being stuck for a while longer 
 We didn t have a meaningful allocation anymore and so the redemption is more related to our asset allocation not their performance   Grabel said  The pension is overhauling its manager lineup and cutting its allocation to global stocks  which make up the bulk of Pershing Square s portfolio 
 I have to give Bill Ackman and his team credit  They are true to their mandate and they believe in it with conviction   he said  adding that the pension fund realized a profit of roughly  10 million from its investment with Ackman 
A Pershing Square spokesman was not immediately available to comment 
Over the last year  Pershing Square s fortunes have come under pressure as a bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals tumbled 85 percent amid greater scrutiny of the company s accounting and business practices  including sharp drug price hikes 
A new CEO started at Valeant on Monday  Ackman and Pershing Square s vice chairman are now directors on its board  which is expected to be significantly reshaped at the next annual meeting 
Despite the heavy losses in his portfolio late last year and early this year  investors have been largely loyal to Ackman  taking out only about 2 percent of the fund s assets in the first quarter ",2016-05-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/new-mexico-public-employees-to-exit-ackman's-pershing-square-400522,400522

148174,369690,BHC,Volcano Corp To Be Acquired Soon ,opinion,"Summary
In the area of acquisitions  we ve had a solid history of very accurate behavior based predictions 
Although many companies do an excellent job of hiding the progress of a potential acquisition  some clues can still give observant investors an indication that an acquisition is close 
However  it can be difficult to make accurate conclusions is that company officers are obligated to keep quiet about these details to obviously avoid insider trading and other SEC violations 
We believe we have identified one such company we believe is close to be acquired 
Written by Michael Kovar and Scott Matusow  The company we believe is close to being acquired for a nice premium is Volcano Corp   NASDAQ VOLC   Volcano Corp  designs  develops  manufactures and commercializes a broad suite of precision guided therapy tools including intravascular ultrasound and fractional flow reserve products  The company s intravascular ultrasound  IVUS  offerings are used by clinicians to measure the stage and severity of disease present in cardiac and peripheral vessels  IVUS is also used in post stent placement procedures to confirm adequate expansion of the stent and full apposition to the vessel wall  Volcano also provides functional measurement  FM  consoles and single use pressure and flow guide wires  which are used to gauge the impact of arterial plaque on blood flow and pressure  Currently  more than 3 900 Volcano s5 s5i IVUS and FM systems are installed worldwide  with approximately half of its revenues coming from outside the United States  The company is located in San Diego  CA and had sales in 2013 approaching  400 million  Volcano has been the focus of an activist investor who has had success in encouraging takeovers in the past  We will look at some of the clues that indicate a takeover may be close as well as comparing with other takeovers  mainly ones we have closely followed and written on  Toward the end of last year  a fund named Engaged Capital  LLC became vocal as well as announcing a 5 1  stake in Volcano  Glenn Welling  founder of Engaged Capital  said at the time  Volcano is a very attractive acquisition candidate for the large medical device players within the cardiac space  We don t believe they should sell themselves today  Once the stock is more fairly valued  and once they ve achieved some of the targets  Engaged pursues  constructive  activism  working with management to make changes that boost shareholder value  according to its website  Engaged Capital requested at the time that Volcano use some of its  500 million in cash to buy back its own undervalued stock  then priced around  20 share   In December of last year  Volcano announced that they are authorizing a  200 million share buyback program  Along with this measure  Volcano also restructured its business toward the end of 2013  spending about  20 million in one time costs  The market seems to have simply looked at the bottom line quarterly miss versus the details of why the company missed on earnings  To us  this  cleanup  or restructuring seems to be to preparation to be acquired  Another reason the stock has dipped perhaps  is management s less than attractive guidance in the recent earnings call  This prompted us to think back on the acquisition of both Solta and Obagi Medical  as their stock prices dropping to lower levels prior to their respective take over s    both on lowered guidance  We covered both Obagi and Solta  accurately predicting the acquisition of both companies  We believe the case for an acquisition to occur soon with Volcano is as strong  if not stronger than the prior acquisitions of Obagi and Solta  In Obagi s case  the management said they had no plans to hire an investment banker  which went against the activist s position of wanting a takeover  However  when looking back  it clearly seems Obagi was working on a deal quietly when we consider that there was a sale approximately six months after  Solta also appeared to become entrenched by stating it would be fine on its own and subsequently announced drastic cost reduction and restructuring plans in a quarterly earnings call soon before being acquired  The difference shown so far in the case of Volcano  is that the company appears to have taken most of the steps that the activist requested  Both Solta and Obagi were purchased by Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  in 2013  Valeant is a huge player which is evident by its most recent bid to buy Allergan  NYSE AGN  for  52 7 billion in cash and stock  This deal was rejected accompanied by some jabs from Allergan CEO claiming the bid doesn t offer sufficient value  Since the acquisitions of Solta and Obagi  Valeant stock has gone up considerably as it appears to be making good use of the companies along with typical great performance in other areas  What is also interesting to note  is that Volcano recently acquired AtheroMed for  115M  with an upfront cash price of  100M  and  15M reserved for future milestone payments  However  with no comments from Engaged Capital yet  it s possible this was by design and not against its wishes  So  this deal is likely to add value to Volcano without taking on debt along with making the company more attractive and a more complete asset to potential suitors  Volcano seems to have acquired AtheroMed mainly for its Phoenix device  which received 510 k  clearance last January  In addition  the device also has CE Mark designation in Europe  The Phoenix device is a peripheral atherectomy system which is designed to provide physicians with a safe  versatile  and user friendly primary therapy medium for treating PAD to restore blood flow to the ankle and foot  Volcano believes that this acquisition could place its company in position to grab a decent share of the global atherectomy market  which is valued in the range of  350  400 million with an annualized growth rate of 7   Additional comments by Welling concerning Volcano late last year included such remarks as  Constructive talks continue   so it remains to be seen if any negative feedback comes from the recent AtheroMed acquisition  However  we believe that Welling is receptive of this acquisition and believe the company is in the beginning process of being acquired  Of the  500 million in cash the company once had  spending  200 million for a buyback and about  100 million for the acquisition still leaves them with an abundance of cash  Lately  activists have been quiet  just as was the case with both Solta and Obagi Medical where soon thereafter their acquisitions occurred

One thing that seems common among other imminent buyouts such as Valeant s purchase of Obagi Medical is when SEC filings start to demonstrate change in ownership compensation clauses  Obviously  if directors and company executives start to suspect that a takeover may take place  they want to protect themselves or make it beneficial for them to stick around  Conversely  it is potentially in the company s best interest to provide these types of arrangements  sometimes referred to as golden parachutes  so that everyone doesn t just quit or start looking for other positions  If a potential deal fell apart or until a potential deal closed  the company would have a big problem if many employees fled  Also  even if the deal consummated  it s important to have people around who know the most about the operations of the company and how to access financial and other valuable information  In February of this year  an 8k SEC filing referred to compensation plans and included  for high level executives if change of control  occurred  A noteworthy section of this 8k is below with some areas in bold  Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreements with President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer The Amended Employment Agreements also provide that in the event of a qualifying termination  Messrs  Huennekens and Dahldorf will also receive 24 months accelerated vesting of any equity awards with time based vesting  Additionally  the Amended Employment Agreements provide Messrs  Huennekens and Dahldorf with100  accelerated vesting of all of their equity awards in the event of a qualifying termination that occurs within the period commencing 90 days prior to or ending 12 months following a change in control  The Amended Employment Agreements also provide that in the event of a termination of employment for any reason other than for cause  Messrs  Huennekens and Dahldorf will generally have a period of up to 12 months to exercise any vested options following the date of termination  Officer Change in Control Severance Benefit Plan On February 11  2014  the Compensation Committee approved our Officer Change of Control Severance Plan  the  Severance Plan    The Severance Plan provides for severance benefits to eligible officers whose employment is terminated within 90 days prior to and 12 months following a Change of Control  either due to a termination without Cause or a resignation for Good Reason  each  a  Covered Termination    The Severance Plan provides that upon a Covered Termination  and provided the eligible officer timely provides us with an effective release of claims  he or she will be entitled to receive as severance benefits    I   a lump sum cash payment equal to 100  of such officer s annual base salary and target annual cash incentive bonus   ii  payment for premiums for continued group health insurance coverage for a period of 12 months following termination  and   III   immediate full vesting of all then outstanding equity awards  The Severance Plan does not override any severance benefits provided under any individual employment agreement or severance agreement  but the benefits under the Severance Plan will be reduced by benefits under any such individual arrangement  The Compensation Committee will designate our officers  at or above the level of senior vice president  who are eligible to participate in the Severance Plan  Currently  each of our named executive officers is eligible to participate  Obviously  the high level executives at Volcano are doing what they can to gain protection and profit nicely if an acquisition does occur  This filing does not necessarily means that an acquisition of Volcano is imminent  but it does signal that upper management has added the correct corporate governance  in case an acceptable offer comes to fruition  One of the main issues with Obagi Medical was the fact that it failed in corporate governance    one of the main issues that activist firm Voce Capital complained about publicly  Volcano seem to have its  corporate governance squarely in line here with its  severence package 
Unusual Options Activity
A couple of weeks ago  there was one single options trade of approximately 3000 contracts purchased for the June  17 50 call when the stock was out of the money  The call price was half of what it is now  yet the trader has not yet closed out their position  This tells us that this trader wants to be assigned a position in the stock  rather than to take the massive profit they have now  The open interest stands at a little over 3200 call contracts for the month  which will expire on June 21    at the moment  these contracts are in the money 
Potential Suitors
Many large medical device companies would be very interested in Volcano Corporation  Three below are companies that would make sense to us  Boston Scientific  NYSE BSX  has a valuation close to  17 billion and develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices for use in various interventional medical specialties worldwide  One of its segments focuses entirely on cardiovascular devices  In this area  the company provides many products including stents  balloon catheters  wires  peripheral embolization devices  and vena cava filters to treat patients with peripheral disease  Additionally  it provides biliary stents  drainage catheters  and micro puncture sets to treat patients with non vascular disease  Volcano s product line would be a nice fit for Boston Scientific  Medtronic  NYSE MDT  is beginning to dwarf Boston Scientific a bit with a valuation around  61 billion  Its Cardiac and Vascular group s products include pacemakers  electrophysiology catheters  coronary and peripheral stents  heart valve replacement technologies  and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products  Medtronic is another industry giant that has a lot of leverage and looking to consolidate  and Volcano s assets would make for a nice integration here  Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  has a similar valuation to Medtronic coming in at about  60 billion  One of Abbott s segments specializes in vascular products and provides coronary  endovascular  vessel closure  and structural heart devices  However  the company has a very wide scope of products and segments  Abbott should have interest in a company like Volcano  but likely a bit less than the prior companies we mention above  Nevertheless  Abbott is another big company with plenty of leverage at its  disposal  It should be mentioned that Valeant might have an interest in Volcano  but is not a likely suitor due to the fact that its  management is looking to merge with larger companies this year  as it  numerous times last year  Volcano s product line would fit nicely into these three in particular as the companies are the leaders in the segment that Volcano does business in  All of the above companies have the necessary sale forces  leverage  and experience to get the most value out of Volcano  and could potentially increase sales by 30  or more  Additionally  while interest rates are at record lows and likely to increase next year per Fed guidance  we are seeing a large amount of merger and acquisition interest throughout the market  Larger companies are snatching up these smaller ones at record rates  Because of Medtronic and Boston Scientific s focus heavily on medical devices  we lean toward those two as the top candidates to pursue a deal with Volcano  Volcano s product line would fit nicely into these companies in particular  Because of Medtronic and Boston Scientific s focus heavily on medical devices  we lean toward those two as the top candidates to pursue a deal with Volcano  While Volcano is certainly taking the correct steps to bring itself a higher value and to make itself more attractive to potential suitors  as Engaged Capital asked for  we believe after its  recent acquisition of AtheroMed using 100  cash brings its  company value to what Engaged Capital is looking for  Also  as we mention  with interest rates being so low at the current time  a great window of opportunity is in the near term for Volcano  Therefore  we think an acquisition will take place here before the end of this year    before interest rates are likely to rise    in the hands of a company like Abbott Laboratories or Medtronic  Volcano s devices could be marketed as cost cutting products for cash strapped hospitals   If you look at where healthcare is headed in the United States and really around the world in terms of trying to improve outcomes and reducing the cost of therapy  this is right in that sweet spot   Denhoy said 
Conclusion and Price Opinion
With regards to the Valeant takeover of Solta Medical  we wrote in November of 2013 how the hiring of an investment banker indicated an imminent takeover  This ended up being about a month prior to the takeover taking place  On May 21st and 22nd  it was reported that Volcano   However  to date there has not been any admission by Volcano with regards to hiring an investment banker  and the company does not have to disclose if it has hired one  In both the Obagi and Solta cases  it was extremely quiet prior to deal as most would expect  Activists who were very vocal in the past were all of a sudden quiet  We haven t heard any further updates from Engaged Capital in months and feel this is hopefully a good thing for Volcano shareholders  With the worldwide scope of Volcano  it would be a good opportunity for any multinational company to immediately start generating a lot of additional revenue  The assets of Volcano would be used much more effectively with a strong sales and management team having access to more resources and large healthcare facility relationships  The company has generated pretty consistent and slightly increasing sales for several years which should give any buyer confidence that this would continue  With the growth stagnant compared to the industry however  companies such as Boston Scientific and Medtronic would seem like natural front runners that could benefit from Volcano s product line   23  25 share would seem like a good bargain while providing a fair premium  If a bidding war was occurring behind the scenes  it would be possible to escalate from there   23 share being on the low end of our price range would be approximately  1 2 billion for a company generating around  400 million in sales per year along with a potentially significant amount more with its recent acquisition of AtheroMed  which falls in line with that Engaged Capital has asked for  With companies such as Valeant and many others growing via mergers and acquisitions  we should see this trend continue  Additionally  we are seeing along of merger and acquisition activity this year throughout the broader market  This is likely occurring because of record low interest rates that are likely to be coming to an end sometime next year  Since the cost to lever an acquisition is tied to the low interest rate  it makes sense for companies that have their eyes on growing to take advantage of these rates now  rather than wait until next year where these deals would cost them substantially more capital  There is no question in our minds that Volcano is likely to be acquired before the end of this year  The ultra quietness here is actually is very  loud  to us  It would not surprise us that if behind the scenes  an actual deal is being worked on as we speak ",2014-06-13,Scott Matusow,https://www.investing.com/analysis/volcano-corp-to-be-acquired-soon-215881,215881

148176,369692,BHC, Cutting Through Valeant s Story,opinion,"Allergan  NYSE AGN   maker of Botox  continued its fight against the hostile takeover attempt by Valeant Pharmaceuticals  NYSE VRX  recently in a press release reiterating its belief that VRX s acquisition driven business model is unsustainable  The release contains quotes from notable hedge fund managers such as Jim Chanos and John Hempton that call VRX a roll up 
The most interesting quotes  however  come from e mails between Allergan and executives at Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   which was aiming to get hired to advise Allergan  In one e mail  an executive at Morgan Stanley wrote that one of his colleagues could  use his significant relationships with media and analysts to provide a clear and detailed articulation of why Valeant is a house of cards and your investors should not want to take the stock  
Want to take a guess at which prominent investment bank has since been retained by that  house of cards   Morgan Stanley reportedly is now advising Valeant on the acquisition despite the earlier misgivings of its executives 
Now  no one should be surprised that Morgan Stanley has switched sides on this deal  It s their business to make money off an acquisition like this one  and it doesn t matter which side pays them  Investors should view these e mails from Morgan Stanley as a reminder that lots of people stand to make money of an acquisition of this size  and executives have many reasons to stretch the truth 
In particular  Valeant has been guilty of some dubious assertions in its attempts to defend itself from claims that its business model is nothing more than a rollup scheme and that its stock is overvalued 
Dubious Claim  1  VRX is fairly valued
One example of Valeant s dubious storytelling comes from their Investor Relations page  On the  Advanced Fundamentals  tab  VRX compares its P E ratio to its industry  sector  and the S P 500  The table shows VRX s P E of 18 as comparable to the market as a whole and superior to its industry and sector 
What the table fails to mention is that VRX s P E is based off its adjusted  non GAAP earnings  which removes billions of dollars in what it classifies as  one time costs  related to its acquisitions  The P E for the S P 500  on the other hand  is based off of GAAP earnings that include these one time costs  and the sector and industry P E s appear to be based the non GAAP measures of each company in the sector or industry  Some of these non GAAP metrics remove the same items as VRX  others don t 
VRX is essentially lumping several different measurements under one label and pretending that these different metrics are comparable when they really are not  In addition to the fact that VRX excludes costs that other companies are including  its P E also neglects the significant amount of debt that the company has taken on in order to finance its acquisition spree 
Figure 1 compares VRX to its sector  industry  and the S P 500 on the basis of both price to economic book value  PEBV  and enterprise value net operating profit after tax  NOPAT   Both of these metrics use comparable measurements of profit and incorporate the impact of debt on a company s valuation 
Figure 1   True Valuation Comparison

Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
We can see that from an Enterprise Value NOPAT perspective VRX is significantly more expensive than its sector and nearly three times as expensive as the S P 500  Even more strikingly  we see that VRX has a negative economic book value  which means that the perpetuity value of its current cash flow is worth less than its debt  VRX looks very expensive on this basis 
Dubious Claim  2  VRX s past acquisitions are value creating 
More importantly  some of VRX s claims about the value creation of its acquisitions are dubious  Its track record over the past couple years at least don t support this claim  Since 2009  VRX has increased its invested capital from  2 3 billion  26 8 billion  a nearly 13 fold increase  Over that same time  after tax profit  NOPAT  has only tripled  As a result  return on invested capital  ROIC  has declined from 15  to 4   That trend shows value destruction not creation  Companies often use earnings growth to paper over value destroying acquisitions 
The situation may be even worse than it appears  as our calculations assume that VRX is putting one time expenses from its acquisitions in items such as  Restructuring  integration  and other costs   which we exclude  John Hempton of Bronte Capital has argued that the company may be misclassifying recurring items as one time charges in an attempt to boost its non GAAP earnings 
Dubious Claim  3  Allergan bid is about long term value  not short term revenue growth
Valeant CEO J  Michael Pearson has referred to the proposed merger as  strategically compelling and enormously value creating   Perhaps Pearson has a different definition of  value creating  than I do  as it s hard for me to see a way that this acquisition can create value for VRX shareholders 
In order to create value for shareholders  a company must earn an ROIC greater than its weighted average cost of capital  WACC   At the proposed  53 billion price  AGN would need to earn a NOPAT of just over  4 billion in order for the ROIC on the deal to exceed VRX s WACC of 7 6  
Even if we take VRX s optimistic assumption of  2 7 billion in cost savings as realistic  AGN would still come up just short of that  4 billion target  Any value creation from this deal would rest upon the assumption that VRX can strip AGN s research budget to the core  as it has done with other acquisitions  and still achieve long term profit growth  a questionable claim at the very least  If this acquisition works out as optimistically as VRX anticipates  it might just barely break even on an economic earnings basis 
If we look at the ramifications of this deal in comparison to VRX s valuation  a similar picture emerges  With the increase in shares and debt from this deal  VRX would need to grow NOPAT by 27  compounded annually for 12 years in order to justify its  118 share valuation  This would include a 218  increase in NOPAT in year 1 of the acquisition  These outcomes are not likely and reflect the value at risk here 
VRX s market value prices in a significant amount of growth for a company that is slashing R D budgets left and right  VRX may be correct in its assertions that R D spending in the U S  is inefficient  though some of their claims on that point are questionable as well   but eliminating research spending altogether is not a good solution  VRX s strategy of buying up companies to acquire new products is even less efficient per the trend in ROIC  and it can t last forever  as the company eventually will run out of cash for these acquisitions because they cost more money than they make 
Unlike VRX  AGN has a strong business  It currently earns an ROIC of 20  and its economic earnings are positive and growing  The price VRX proposes to pay for AGN is very generous  but the fact that much of that price would be paid in the form of risky  overvalued VRX stock should give investors pause  AGN is a strong company  and it should resist being pulled into the unsustainable business model of VRX

148193,369709,BHC,Washington s  unprecedented overreach  causing losses  asset manager Visium,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    Visium Asset Management  the approximately  7 billion investment firm led by Jacob Gottlieb  is blaming the U S  government for some of its losses this year 
The Visium Balanced hedge fund  which focuses on healthcare stocks  lost money in March on  Allergan Inc   NYSE AGN pa  when a planned merger with  Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE  collapsed because of concern the U S  Department of the Treasury would block the deal  along with other so called tax inversions 
 We did not expect the unprecedented overreach of the Treasury s authority and we incorrectly interpreted the Treasury as recognizing the limitations of its own powers   Visium wrote this month in a private letter to clients that was reviewed by Reuters  The letter said Visium had sold its Allergan shares following the news 
The fund also cited government concerns for losses on pharmaceutical company Endo International PLC  In its letter  Visium blamed the decline on concern that companies such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX   which acquire drugs and then raise their prices  could face increased regulation 
 Investors have been wary of buying into companies that are exposed to this pricing reform   the Visium letter said   We believe ENDP is purely collateral damage from the VRX decline  
It said Endo s lower stock price  presents an opportunity  as it is well positioned to recover from its recent price weakness  
The Balanced fund is down nearly 8 percent this year through April 15  according to a report by HSBC s Alternative Investment Group 
Visium also suffered losses in its largest hedge fund  Visium Global  which bets on a variety of industries  The fund is down about 5 6 percent for the year as of April 15  according to the HSBC report 
Among the fund s losing bets was one against energy stocks as oil prices rallied  according to a separate letter to investors  The losses erased gains from its holdings of Swiss telecommunications company Sunrise Communications Group AG and hotel groups  Starwood Hotels    Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc and Marriott International Inc 
A smaller fund called Visium Institutional Partners is also down nearly 13 percent for the year through April 15  An industry benchmark called the Hedge Fund Intelligence Americas Global Equity Index fell about 3 5 percent through March

148316,369832,BHC,Activist hedge funds wounded by market turmoil,news,"By Michael Flaherty and Svea Herbst Bayliss
 Reuters    Hedge funds wounded by recent stock market gyrations may struggle to pressure companies and reap the benefits of their activist campaigns  lawyers and bankers at Tulane Law School s corporate law conference in New Orleans said this week 
William Ackman  one of the world s biggest activists  sold a chunk of U S  snack maker  Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ  to make up for a hole in his Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  portfolio after Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX  lost half its value 
More hedge fund managers feel the need to de risk their portfolios  Avinash Mehrotra  co head of Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   M A shareholder advisory group  said at the conference  Funds facing the most pressure may be those that allow clients to get money out fastest 
 If you re running an activist strategy  you generally need two  three  four quarters to prosecute that strategy  If you have got a quarterly call     you have a mismatch on the asset side of your equation  which is your holdings  and the liability side  which is the call on your capital   Mehrotra said 
As a group  activists have already lost 6 52 percent in the first two months of 2016  far more than the average hedge fund s 2 percent drop  according to data from Hedge Fund Research 
Ackman s Pershing Square  battered by Valeant  is off 22 percent through the middle of March  while Nelson Peltz  Trian Fund Management lost 7 percent and Barry Rosenstein s Jana Partners fell 7 3 percent in the first two months of the year 
But the biggest fallout may be among the smaller funds that seized on the wave of assets that flowed into the sector  attracted by the outsized returns of brand name agitators such as Ackman and Carl Icahn 
For example  Jerome Lande folded his Coppersmith Capital Management into a bigger firm  Scopia Capital  where he is now in charge of special situations  people familiar with the matter said  speaking on condition of anonymity  Scopia  which had roughly  10 billion in assets last year according to the most recent available regulatory filing  did not respond to a request for comment 
Willem Mesdag s Red Mountain is locking up its investors  capital for longer after losses  essentially turning the activist hedge fund into more of a private equity type vehicle  the sources said  Red Mountain  which had around  500 million in assets in 2015  did not respond to a request for comment 
Daniel Lewis shuttered his Orange Capital this year  and the founders of LionEye Capital shut that hedge fund down last year 
 There will be a shake out among some of the ankle biters and some of the others   David Katz  a partner at Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen   Katz  said at the conference  referring to smaller activists 
However  the activism model is hardly in danger of extinction  bankers and lawyers said  Year to date  activists have launched 96 U S  campaigns  a high historical figure  though 34 percent below the pace set in the same period in 2015  
Even top activists  however  acknowledge that the old play book of pushing for stock buybacks or quick sales is outdated  Starboard Value s Jeffrey Smith said recently that simply calling for a company to buy back shares  is not a plan   adding   That does not create value  
The stock gains from such moves have already been squeezed  The S P 500 buyback index  which measures the performance of the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios  currently shows an 8 8 percent one year loss

148320,369836,BHC,Drugmaker Valeant CEO leaving as investor Ackman joins board,news,"By Caroline Humer  Reuters    Drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  TO VRX   N VRX  said on Monday its chief executive officer is leaving and billionaire investor William Ackman would join the board as it tries to clean up accounting problems and save its business  The Canadian company  whose operations include prescription drugs  consumer products  and Bausch   Lomb eye care  has lost nearly 90 percent of its value as it came under public scrutiny for its pricing and distribution practices  including investigations by Congress and various government agencies   Valeant blamed accounting issues on  improper conduct  by top finance executives  On Monday  shares rose as much as 17 percent in New York trading   Just three weeks after CEO Michael  Pearson   LON PSON  returned from a two month medical leave  the company said he will leave  Also  Ackman of Pershing Square  NYSE SQ  Capital Management will join the board  the second seat given to the activist investment firm in as many weeks  The firm held a 6 3 percent stake as of March 8  In addition  a board committee said its five month investigation into Valeant s dealings with pharmacy Philidor Rx Services found broad accounting problems dating back to December 2014  The committee s work is ongoing and more restatements may be needed  Valeant said   The committee traced the issues in part to the former chief financial officer  Howard Schiller  who had been interim CEO while Pearson was on leave  and is still on the board  The company said Schiller s and the corporate controller s  improper conduct  contributed to a misstatement of financial results because they provided incorrect information related to revenue recognition to auditors and the board committee  Valeant pledged on Monday to file its annual report on or before April 29 after missing a deadline last week  which opened the door to a default on part of its  30 billion debt load  Last week  the company s stock  hovering around  60  lost one half of its value as investors wondered if it could manage the debt  built up from a stream of acquisitions  Since August  it has lost  80 billion in market value  BTIG analyst Timothy Chiang said the moves announced on Monday looked to be the start of a clean up process that will take time  but the sooner the company can submit its 10K filing  the better   There s not much visibility   Chiang said  ACCOUNTING  CAREFUL AND REASONED  Valeant s prescription drug sales began to unravel last year as its history of large price increases drew sharp criticism and the attention of lawmakers as well as New York and Massachusetts attorneys general  which opened investigations   On Monday  Elijah Cummings  a U S  representative from Maryland who has investigated Valeant  said  It is clear that there are more than just  accounting problems  at Valeant  and company executives need more than new faces to fix them   The company s profitable dermatology franchise faltered as it stopped distribution through pharmacy Philidor due to investor and media scrutiny   In January  while Pearson was still on leave  the company said it would need to restate earnings from 2014 and 2015 due to revenue recognition issues   Valeant said on Monday it has started a search for a successor to Pearson  who joined the company in 2008 and built it on acquisitions and drug price increases  His first big stumble came when its hostile takeover attempt of  Allergan Inc   NYSE AGN pa   done with Ackman  failed  Investors had debated the merits of Pearson s return to the top job in recent weeks  but Valeant Chairman Robert Ingram said in the company statement that he would be missed and thanked him for staying until a new CEO is found  After the Philidor problems surfaced  Valeant s board began an investigation  which has identified revenue recognition and other accounting problems  the company said  The probe and the dismissal of its corporate controller led to the delay of the regulatory filing  Valeant said  The company said Schiller had been asked to leave the board and refused to do so  requiring another board member to step down to make room for Ackman  Schiller said in a statement he had not engaged in improper conduct  adding that accounting decisions were  careful and reasoned   BOARD RESHUFFLE Valeant had already begun making changes before Monday  It added a Pershing Square representative in a reshuffling two weeks ago that named three new members to the board   The company said last week it would not hit its 2016 earnings targets and would need to negotiate with lenders because of the delay in filing its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission   At the time  shares fell sharply  leading Ackman to lose more than  700 million in one day   Institutional investors  including TIAA CREF and CalPERS  filed securities fraud lawsuits against the company in New Jersey last year  accusing Valeant of inflating its share price by not disclosing the use of specialty pharmacies to prop up sales of high priced drugs  John Hempton of Bronte Capital  who has been shorting shares of Valeant  said on Monday he still believes Valeant shares will be worthless   Hempton said Valeant is currently forecasting  6 billion in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from just over  10 billion in revenue for 2016   If you believe a bunch of non patent protected drugs can do this in the face of a payer revolt against rigged prices  I will sell you some stock and the Brooklyn Bridge   Hempton said

At 16 37GMT or 12 37 ET  the Dow 30 lost 26 points or 0 15   while the S P 500 gave up 9 points or 0 45  and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite traded down 25 points or 0 52  
Tuesday s session accompanied the kick off of the Fed s two meeting with traders digging in ahead of the release of not only the U S  central bank s decision on monetary policy  but also the updated economic projections of its members and the following press conference with Fed chair Janet Yellen 
Markets do not expect changes to the federal funds rate at this meeting with most experts suggesting that June could be the first opportunity for a hike 
However  close attention will be paid to the economic forecasts and  especially  the dot plot that shows Fed members  forecasts for the future path of interest rates 
The FOMC statement will center attention as investors scour the document for language changes  only to be replaced in the headlines by remarks from the Fed chief herself who will further clarify the central bank s position on the economy  unemployment and the path of interest rates 
In this context  the data released on Tuesday gave markets food for thought with consumption indicators showing weakness and price data showing a recovery in inflation as it crept closer to the Fed s 2  target 
The focus was on February retail sales  which  although they dropped less than expected  still registered their largest two month decline in a year  underlining concerns over the economic outlook 
Business inventories also rose unexpectedly with the total business inventories to sales ratio hitting a seven year high  another indicator of a soft consumer demand in the economy 
Not all the data was worrisome as the March Empire State Manufacturing index made a surprising recovery and showed the first expansion in eight months thanks to growth in new orders and shipments 
But price side data continued to show a recovery  with the February producer price inflation  PPI  unchanged from a year ago  suggesting that the downward trend could be reaching its end 
The data point is relevant for inflation as producers tend to try and pass price increases onto consumers  so PPI could be considered a leading indicator 
With all this in mind  the Atlanta Fed cut its forecast for growth in the U S  economy for the first quarter of 2016 on Friday from 2 2  to 1 9  precisely due to Friday s retail sales report 
Additionally   Barclays   LON BARC  too became the latest of a string of experts to cut growth forecasts for the U S  economy in the first quarter as these experts dropped their estimate by half a percent to 1 9  
Individual Fed officials are expected to cut their own forecasts in the update to economic projections that will accompany the statement tomorrow and  along with the February CPI released on Wednesday  the data will probably center the debate on future policy moves at the heart of the U S  central banks 
Fed doves will be concerned about the need for maintain accommodative measures in order to protect the still fragile economy  while the hawks will point towards the recovery in inflation as they express worries over falling behind the curve 
Outside jitters over the next Fed move  crude continued to be a major market focus on Tuesday as it tumbled to more than a one week low on Tuesday after Iran dashed hopes that there would be a coordinated production freeze any time soon 
With that in mind  investors looked ahead to fresh weekly information on U S  stockpiles of crude and refined products  The American Petroleum Institute will release its inventories report later in the day  while Wednesday s government report could show crude stockpiles rose by 3 4 million barrels in the week ended March 11

148440,369956,BHC,Ackman acknowledges mistakes in 2015  details changes in portfolio,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss
BOSTON  Reuters    Sitting on a double digit loss that is the deepest in his firm s history  billionaire investor Bill Ackman on Tuesday told investors that he made mistakes last year in not cutting two big positions but said he sees plenty of new investment opportunities 
Ackman  whose Pershing Square  N SQ  Capital Management lost between 16 percent and 20 percent in its funds in 2015  said it was a  very costly  mistake that he did not sell drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  N VRX  when the stock price rose to  200 over the summer 
He also said that right along with Valeant s tumble  the rest of our portfolio went into free fall which continued up until the present   His Pershing Square Holdings portfolio has lost roughly 14 percent this year alone 
But Ackman said he could not sell when he became aware of a large potential transaction that the Canadian drug maker Valeant was working on  Valeant s stock price tumbled some 70 percent amid questions about its business and accounting practices  Now with hindsight  Ackman said  We should have avoided becoming restricted to preserve trading flexibility  
Pershing Square ended up selling some Valeant shares at year s end to take a loss for tax purposes 
Similarly  he feels the firm should have cut its stake in Canadian Pacific when it reached Canadian  240 per share and he said it was a mistake to buy more shares in Platform Specialty Products at  25 a share to help the company finance an acquisition 
Ackman said last year s sharp drop reminded investors that stocks can  trade at any price in the short term  which underscores why his firm shies away from using margin leverage   We expect that there have been many margin loan liquidations in recent weeks which have contributed to dramatic stock price declines  
Late last year  Ackman cut the firm s position in candy maker Mondelez by selling forward contracts representing 15 million shares at an average price of  44 a share  During the summer the firm built a large notional short position in the Chinese yuan to guard against weakness in the Chinese economy  But so far  he has made only a modest profit

148465,369981,BHC,Valeant says can contain hit to dermatology  projects 2016 growth,news,"By Caroline Humer and Carl O Donnell  Reuters    Drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  TO VRX   N VRX  on Wednesday said that fourth quarter profit was hit when it cut ties with pharmacy Philidor Rx Services  but that it could contain the damage next year and grow profit  The company said it would rebuild lost business through a distribution agreement with Walgreens pharmacies announced on Tuesday  and said the arrangement would also help sales of products like Xifaxin for irritable bowel syndrome and Addyi  a new sexual dysfunction treatment for women  The Canadian drugmaker forecast 2016 earnings would grow 30 percent to  13 25 to  13 75 per share off a lowered 2015 outlook  just below Wall Street s highest expectations  Valeant shares rose 8 percent to  118 75 in New York trading  gaining ground as Chief Executive Michael  Pearson   L PSON  led investors through a four hour meeting in which he defended the company s plan to rebuild its dermatology business  In October  shortseller Citron Research accused Valeant of having inflated revenue  and several news outlets including Reuters reported on how Philidor used aggressive tactics to try to increase insurer reimbursement  mostly for dermatology drugs  Valeant has denied the shortseller accusations and a board committee is investigating the Philidor situation  The news had knocked shares from an August high of  263 70 to a low of  69 34 on Nov  18  They have since recovered  helped in part as its largest investor  Bill Ackman s Pershing Square  N SQ  Capital Management  increased its stake  Pearson declined to give an update on the investigation  or comment on investigations by U S  prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts and by Congress over the company s history of price increases and its patient access programs   He denied that the company was considering a break up  a possibility raised by large investors as a way to recover value  and told investors that the Philidor situation was behind them  The company stopped using Philidor in October  losing 20 percent of its dermatology prescriptions and  250 million in sales in the fourth quarter  Pearson said  Valeant also rolled back all price increases it had planned during the quarter    We ve moved on from Philidor  We ended our relationship and now we have Walgreens  Walgreens is about as reputable as you can get   Pearson said  Valeant s announcement on Tuesday of the distribution deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  O WBA  boosted shares  but investors questioned how Walgreens could drive sales if pharmacy benefit managers still refuse to cover Valeant drugs  The two largest U S  drug benefit managers  Express Scripts Holdings Corp  O ESRX  and CVS Health  N CVS   do not pay for many drugs Valeant sells because they prefer patients use typically less costly generic versions   CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo told investors at its own investor meeting on Wednesday that the agreement between Valeant and Walgreens appeared to be an attempt to circumvent its policies meant to drive down costs for insurers and employers  He noted the government does not approve of these programs or allow them in healthcare plans like Medicare  2016 PROFIT OUTLOOK Valeant  which has been criticized for a business model that depends on growth through purchasing companies and making large price increases on their older drugs  said 2016 sales would be driven by volume and pledged to cut prices  Political pressure on price hikes  and a heavy debt load from buying Salix Pharmaceuticals as well as its stock decline  has forced Valeant to change strategy  It predicted no major deals next year but said it hoped to do some small purchases   That is a shift in strategy but it is one that is consistent with the way the world is going right now   Pearson said  The new Walgreens agreement  which starts in January  will be similar to the one with Philidor  he said  Valeant will allow customers to receive the prescription immediately and take the risk that it may not receive reimbursement from pharmacy benefit managers down the road  Pearson said that such payers would benefit from price cuts on more than 30 branded products to match generic prices  Customers would benefit from the patient access program  in which it offers coupons or zero co pays to cut the patient price   A poll of more than 200 investors by ISI Evercore recently found about 25 percent expected 2016 earnings of about  14 per share and 23 percent expected  13 per share  Valeant forecast that another closely watched metric  cash earnings  would be  6 9 billion to  7 1 billion in 2016  It said that was about  500 million lower than previously forecast because of the costs of setting up the Walgreens deal  about  75 million in retention payments it has planned for 700 employees  planned price cuts and restructuring charges  About 22 percent in the ISI Evercore poll expected cash earnings of  6 5 billion and 18 percent expected  6 75 billion  Valeant also said it will cut its debt by about  2 25 billion in 2016 and book revenues of  12 5 billion to  12 7 billion  compared with 2015 sales it estimated at  10 4 billion to  10 5 billion

148541,370057,BHC,Valeant s crisis fuels feud between Ackman and Australian fund manager Hempton,news,"By Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK  Reuters    Just before Bill Ackman gave a presentation on Friday to defend one of his biggest investments  Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX   from allegations of accounting and insurance fraud  he was taunted by John Hempton  who runs a small hedge fund from Australia  It was the latest act in a long running feud  In an email he sent Ackman  who is one of the world s best known hedge fund managers  was a link to Hempton s latest critique of the Canadian drug maker s potential problems  one of the most detailed produced by anyone yet   It concluded that while Valeant  TO VRX  had probably not been artificially inflating its sales numbers  its relationship with the specialty pharmacy firm Philidor RX Services  may well cause Valeant to collapse   taking its share price to zero   For Ackman s Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund that is a scary thought  Pershing s Valeant investment was worth as much as  5 1 billion at its peak in August  though it has now lost more than half of that  As of Oct  31  the fund has lost 19 percent this year  largely because of Valeant  though it did gain 40 4 percent in 2014   Hempton said in the email that he should have given Ackman an advance copy as  it would have helped you prepare for your call today    He signed off with  Love as always  John  It isn t the first time in recent weeks that Hempton has needled Ackman   Indeed  Hempton has been attacking Ackman since soon after Ackman launched a billion dollar short bet against nutritional supplement company  Herbalife  Ltd  N HLF  in 2012  While Ackman has a long position in Valeant and Hempton says his fund  Bronte Capital  is betting against it  the opposite has been the case on Herbalife  with Ackman short and Hempton long  In the world of finance  the contrast between the two almost couldn t be greater  The Adelaide University educated Hempton  48  runs less than  200 million of funds from a tiny office he sometimes sleeps in near Sydney s Bondi Beach  He looks more like the Australian public servant he once was   with large round spectacles  while sweaters and jeans are as often part of his garb as collared shirts and ties  The 6 ft 3 inch tall Ackman has distinguished silvery locks  He runs  16 5 billion at Pershing Square with its expensive mid town Manhattan offices  He has an MBA from Harvard  is big on New York s philanthropy circuit  and is impeccably groomed with perfectly knotted ties and expensive suits One investor who has knowledge of both said Ackman can be a  Master Of The Universe type  while Hempton behaves like an underdog who wants to get even  Both are  wound way too tight   the investor said  Ackman  who declined to comment for this story  has had major battles with other investors before  He got involved in a very public spat with fellow activist investor Carl Icahn over Herbalife in January 2013   On his call on Friday  Ackman did praise Hempton for good some good research on Valeant  before adding that he has  gotten a lot of things wrong   THE GRADUATE  Certainly  the tensions between the two have worsened in recent weeks   On Oct  15  only a few days before a story from an investigative journalist  Roddy Boyd of the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation  and a report from short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research  exposed Valeant s ties with Philidor and questioned the company s accounting and its behavior towards insurers  Hempton had teased Ackman in an email  In a riff off the famous exchange from the movie  The Graduate  Hempton wrote to Ackman  I just want to say one word to you  Just one word   Philidor    Ackman  who has never met the Australian  replied   Not sure I understand  Perhaps you could explicate further   according to an email released by Hempton  Philidor s relationship with Valeant had hardly ever been referred to publicly by either Valeant or its critics until then  Ackman conceded on Friday s call that Valeant may have made missteps but ultimately was a fundamentally sound company that would pay fines for any wrongdoing if necessary  He said he didn t see anything revealed so far that would result in its collapse   Hempton  who helped to reveal a number of accounting frauds among Chinese stocks listed in North America in 2010 2012 and writes a blog at brontecapital blogspot com  is very open about his distaste for Ackman  When asked last week if he had ever met Ackman he said he would prefer to  hang out with drug dealers and prostitutes   He says he felt fooled back in 2012 by Ackman s arguments that Herbalife was a  pyramid scheme  that caused  enormous harm  to  vulnerable communities around the world   Hempton s own research discovered a Hispanic community in New York and other cities that said the supplements had helped them lose weight and improved their lives   Ackman has firmly stood by his contention that many of the people who sign up as distributors of Herbalife products are exploited by the company and end up losing money  He argues that eventually this structure will implode   Hempton s recent campaign against Ackman has included questioning the way Pershing reports its performance and asking regulators to release documents about a probe it may have carried out into Pershing over Herbalife  A request that was declined  The struggles over Valeant and Herbalife may have taken a toll on Hempton s results  He says after some very strong years  Bronte has been generally flat  with some periods of gains and losses  since 2013   
But he contends it is a viable investment strategy to deliberately take the opposite path to Ackman   You can goad him and he makes his positions bigger   Hempton said   That is even better to trade against  It s not a personal obsession   it s a way of making money  ",2015-11-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/valeant's-crisis-fuels-feud-between-ackman-and-australian-fund-manager-hempton-369439,369439

148543,370059,BHC,Exclusive  U S  insurer caught on to odd billing at Valeant linked pharmacy,news,"By Carl O Donnell  Tim Reid and Caroline Humer NEW YORK LOS ANGELES  Reuters    OptumRx  a leading U S  pharmacy benefits manager  began to stop payments to a pharmacy closely linked to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  N VRX  more than a year ago after recognizing billing irregularities  former employees at the pharmacy and sources familiar with the matter told Reuters  Hatboro  Pennsylvania based Philidor Rx Services persisted in efforts to secure reimbursement for Valeant drug sales even after receiving a cease and desist order from OptumRx  one of its largest revenue sources  in September 2014  two sources familiar with the matter said  OptumRx is owned by UnitedHealth Group  N UNH   In response  Philidor submitted claims to OptumRx for Valeant drugs using the identification numbers of at least four other affiliated pharmacies  these sources said   Philidor s business practices are at the heart of fraud allegations posed in late October by Citron Research s Andrew Left  an influential short seller in Valeant stock  Valeant had already come under scrutiny for charging high mark ups on drugs made by companies it has acquired   Its ties to Philidor  which surfaced two weeks ago  have led investors to question Valeant s legal liabilities and future prospects  sending its shares down 45 percent  Valeant has denied Left s accusation that it used Philidor to inflate its revenue  But it prompted the drugmaker to disclose that it paid Philidor  100 million for an option to acquire the company in December  raising questions of what it knew of Philidor s practices  OptumRx s September cease and desist letter cited a breach of its contract with Philidor  the sources familiar with the matter said  It isn t clear what billing irregularities caused OptumRx to send the letter  the sources said  In the months that followed  OptumRx recognized that drug reimbursement claims filed with the identification numbers of four other pharmacies could be traced to Philidor  the sources said  Starting in January  OptumRx sent cease and desist letters to the pharmacies  which worked in a network run by Philidor  the sources said  Spokespeople for both Valeant and Philidor declined to comment   OptumRx works every day to protect the interests of our customers and members   said OptumRx spokesman Matt Stearns   That is why we began terminating Philidor from our networks months ago  and why we monitor closely the practices of all the pharmacies with whom we do business   OPTION TO BUY  Philidor primarily dispenses Valeant drugs directly to patients  and then presses payers like OptumRx to cover the cost  contributing nearly 6 percent of Valeant s total revenue so far this year  The company said last week it will sever ties to Philidor and set up an internal committee to review the allegations regarding Valeant s business relationships with Philidor  The Wall Street Journal reported that a Philidor training manual from a year ago instructed employees to use another pharmacy s identification number to file claims with insurers who don t have a contract with the pharmacy  In interviews with Reuters  former employees and sources familiar with the matter said that the practice was also applied to OptumRx  which had a contract on reimbursement to Philidor  It continued at least into early 2015  after Valeant had purchased the option to buy Philidor  giving it the right to name certain employees and be on a joint steering committee with its distribution partner   One former Philidor employee said he was informed by his manager in the fall of 2014 that OptumRx was not taking Philidor claims  The employee was told to bill the benefits manager using the National Provider Identification number   unique identifiers issued by the government   of West Wilshire Pharmacy in Los Angeles  By early 2015  Philidor was also using the NPIs of R O Pharmacy LLC in Camarillo  California  and of SafeRx in South Plainfield  New Jersey  to bill OptumRx    Our main approach was to use West Wilshire s NPI   said a second former employee   We would sometimes still try to do it with Philidor s NPI  but we were pretty much always turned down  at which point we would use West Wilshire s    Philidor asked its employees not to discuss its dealings with OptumRx in emails  and devoted special training sessions to how to successfully bill OptumRx after it began rejecting Philidor claims  the former employees said  A fourth pharmacy whose NPI was used to bill OptumRx was Orbit Pharmacy in Houston   Orbit referred questions to Philidor s general counsel  Gretchen Wisehart  Wisehart did not respond to requests for comment  Calls to West Wilshire and SafeRx went unanswered  West Wilshire was the first pharmacy to receive a cease and desist letter  in January  the sources familiar with the matter said  Shortly afterward  OptumRx conducted an unannounced inspection of R O Pharmacy in California where it determined that R O was working with Philidor and was in the process of being acquired by a Philidor affiliate  the sources said   OptumRx issued a cease and desist letter barring R O from doing business with the benefits manager  the sources said  R O has accused Philidor of fraudulently using its NPI to dispense drugs that R O doesn t stock

The Senate committee also said it wanted to hear more about Turing s Daraprim  an anti infective drug used to treat toxoplasmosis among other diseases  Earlier this year Turing raised the price on the drug overnight to  750 per pill from  13 50  Turing did not immediately comment on Wednesday s probe  In September Turing said it would cut the price of Daraprim  but has not yet done so  The New York state attorney general s office is also investigating Turing over whether its Daraprim price increases violated antitrust rules   The sudden  aggressive price hikes for a variety of drugs used widely for decades affect patients and health care providers and the overall cost of health care   Collins said in a statement  adding that the Senate committee is probing the increases given the potential harm to patients ",2015-11-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/senators-probe-pharmaceutical-drug-pricing-369640,369640
148545,370061,BHC,Valeant CEO feels heat as shares tumble to 2 1 2 year lows,news,"By Caroline Humer and Svea Herbst Bayliss NEW YORK BOSTON  Reuters    Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  TO VRX   N VRX  shares fell as much as 20 percent on Thursday to a level not seen since 2013  heaping new pressure on Chief Executive Officer Michael  Pearson   L PSON  after weeks of steep losses due to concerns about the drugmaker s business practices  The stock has plunged from  263 70 on Aug  5 to below  80 on Thursday on scrutiny over high price markups for its drugs and accusations it used a specialty pharmacy  Philidor Rx Services  to inflate revenue  Valeant has denied the allegations  but has not allayed investor concerns as new reports surface of questionable billing practices at Philidor  One new trigger for selling  said BMO analyst Alex Arfaei  may be a Wall Street Journal article on Thursday in which major Valeant investor Bill Ackman  of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management  told a Valeant board member that Pearson may have to go  Ackman s firm and its investors have lost roughly  2 3 billion from their 6 percent stake in Valeant since the bet was made early in the year  The size of Ackman s fund has shrunk to roughly  14 5 billion from  20 billion earlier in the year as Valeant  his biggest bet  has soured   Later Thursday  Ackman in an email to Pearson  seen by Reuters  expressed confidence in the CEO s leadership and willingness to take steps in the best interest of investors   You are one of the most shareholder oriented CEOs I know   Ackman wrote to Pearson   You have assured me that you and the rest of the board are considering any and all alternatives that would benefit shareholders and other stakeholders    A Valeant spokeswoman said Pearson retained the full confidence of the company s board of directors   Mike remains focused on running the business and has been meeting with physicians  partners and other stakeholders   Laurie Little said   The comments did not halt the slide in U S  traded shares  off 15 percent to  78 27 on Thursday after hitting a bottom of  73 37 earlier in the session  the lowest since May 2013  The latest selloff is pushing longer term investors who bought stock more than two years ago into the red  Tiger Ratan Capital Management  a smaller hedge fund  invested in Valeant 2 1 2 years ago and had 22 percent of its assets in the stock at the end of the second quarter  One large investor in Valeant who declined to be identified said Pearson is still the right man to be CEO   Why would you force out the guy who knows this operation better than anyone else in the middle of this crisis   he said  STEEP LOSSES Pearson  who grew up in Canada  took over at Valeant in 2008 after working as a pharmaceutical industry consultant at McKinsey   Co  He drove up Valeant s revenue sevenfold  mainly through a quick succession of acquisitions  including Salix Pharmaceuticals and Bausch   Lomb  Pearson has been widely criticized for eliminating jobs and cutting research and development for quick returns at companies that Valeant buys  The company is being investigated by prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts and been summoned to testify to Congress over its steep drug prices increases  But the steepest stock slide was precipitated by a report from influential short seller Citron Research on Oct  21  claiming the company was using an undisclosed relationship with Philidor to inflate revenue  Valeant has since cut off ties with the firm and said it was investigating its practices   They really possess very little in redeeming qualities in the eyes of the public   said Peter Mann  portfolio manager at Gluskin Sheff   Associates  which sold its small Valeant position in September   The market overall has probably reached its saturation point  with Valeant  Mutual fund managers  in particular  are feeling the pressure to tell clients and their own management they have steered clear of Valeant  something that is exacerbating the selling pressure   Weitz Investment Management said on Nov  2 on its website that it had exited its Valeant positions  Hedge fund Blue Mountain said it got out of the position in October but did not rule out getting back in  While Blue Mountain did not name Valeant in its letter  a source confirmed it was the drugmaker  Hedge fund Jana Partners has also exited Valeant  Other Valeant investors who bought the stock in 2013  including hedge funds Arrow Capital Management  Antipodean Advisors  Meru Capital and Hoplite Capital  would be feeling pain if they still hold the stock  Other big investors  including ValueAct and Viking Global Investors  have been with Valeant for longer and may still be sitting on gains   Valeant short sellers  however  are benefiting for now  John Hempton of Bronte Capital told Reuters he has increased the firm s short position  many times on the way down  all at prices over  100   Hempton was among the first investors to raise red flags on Valeant s business relationship with Philidor   Activity in puts betting on the shares dropping as low as  45 in the coming months suggested some investors were loading up on disaster insurance  On Thursday  options volume on Valeant surged to 237 000 contracts  or 3 4 times the daily average  with heavy trading in puts that protect against declines in the shares  Even so  bond traders have not written off Valeant  Valeant bonds dropped by as much as 4 points in early trading on Thursday before paring back nearly half of those losses

148583,370099,BHC,Hedge Funder Ackman Strongly Defends Valeant,news,"By   

On the same morning that Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX   stock opened down 6 5 percent on news that it had cut ties with a specialty pharmacy partner  hedge fund manager Bill Ackman mounted a lengthy defense of the embattled drugmaker  Though critical of the company s laissez faire approach to public relations  Ackman expressed confidence in Valeant s business and growth prospects 
 We don t think the business model is broken   Ackman said on the hours long call Friday morning  one week after he increased his stake in Valeant by 2 million shares as scrutiny intensified over Valeant s specialty pharmacy partners  In March  Ackman s hedge fund  Pershing Square Capital Management  disclosed a 5 percent stake in Valeant  when the stock was trading at around  200 per share  Valeant shares opened at  103 Friday 
Investors have grown increasingly wary of the Canadian drug manufacturer after its relationship with a little known specialty pharmacy  Philidor RX  was revealed  Former Philidor employees have told the press that they were trained to use questionable means to push insurers into accepting Valeant s drugs for treatments that could otherwise have been covered by cheaper generics 
It was only hours before the scheduled call that Valeant announced it had severed ties with Philidor  which together with related pharmacies represented 7 percent of Valeant s earnings for 2015   We understand that patients  doctors and business partners have been disturbed by the reports of improper behavior at Philidor  just as we have been   Michael  Pearson   L PSON   Valeant s chief executive  said in a statement 
Ackman defended the use of specialty pharmacies  but said Valeant s underinvestment in public relations and government outreach was a  meaningful mistake  
 I don t think Michael Pearson has walked the halls of Congress  maybe ever   Ackman said  Valeant is facing multiple federal investigations over issues surrounding patient assistance  drug pricing and market fairness 
The hedge fund manager also downplayed the cost to Valeant of the Philidor debacle  saying that the estimated  500 million in revenue that flow through Philidor s distribution channels represented just a small part of Valeant s business  The drugmaker has distinguished itself with decade long string of major acquisitions  including Pepcid maker Salix and eye care giant Bausch and Lomb 
Given the stock s current value    which has plunged more than 50 percent since its August highs    Ackman estimated that by 2019  Valeant s shares could be worth roughly double Friday s  100 price  An explosive short seller s report last week sent the stock plunging nearly 30 percent  where it has remained 
Since redoubling his investment  shareholders have grown dubious of the specialty pharmacy model  in which mail order operations like Philidor offer to discount patients  prescriptions and maneuver insurers into covering pricey drug costs  Critical reports in the New York Times and elsewhere have connected the model to eye popping price hikes in niche pharmaceuticals 
Ackman said that Valeant might be more careful moving forward with practices that  while legal  raise hackles in the public  citing what he called the New York Times rule   It might be a legit business practice  but it doesn t look good on the front page of the New York Times  
Still  Valeant s forays into the specialty pharmacy world still won Ackman s approval on the call   Specialty pharmacy is the future of the industry   he said 
Ackman and other Pershing Square partners were midway through the hundred plus questions submitted by investors when short seller Citron Research    whose somewhat unsubstantiated report last week helped tank Valeant s stock    tweeted that a story  dirtier than anyone has reported  was due Monday  Valeant stock immediately fell 3 percent on the announcement

148586,370102,BHC,Exclusive  Beyond Valeant  U S  payers scrutinize other drugmaker ties to pharmacies,news,"By Deena Beasley
LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Express Scripts Holding Co  the largest U S  pharmacy benefit manager  is reviewing pharmacy programs run by  AbbVie Inc   N ABBV  and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd after finding questionable practices at Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  International Inc s partner pharmacy  Philidor Rx Services 
Express Scripts and other big managers of prescription medicine benefits for health plans said on Thursday they would no longer work with Philidor as concerns mount that Philidor was improperly directing drugs made by Valeant to patients 
Valeant  which has headquarters in Quebec  has since said it was cutting ties with Pennsylvania based Philidor  and that the pharmacy was suspending operations 
A handful of other drugmakers operate their own pharmacies and ship drugs directly to patients  Many of the rest employ independent specialty pharmacies that can haggle with insurers and link patients to programs under which drugmakers cover their out of pocket costs 
Such tactics can allow drugmakers to work around reimbursement restrictions from Express Scripts and other insurers  which are directing patients to cheaper generic versions of widely used medicines to save costs 
Health insurers  faced with sharply rising drug costs  are increasing their oversight of prescription drug pricing  which has also become a key issue in the 2016 presidential election 
 We are reviewing and evaluating all similar captive pharmacy arrangements that we know of and will work to identify others   said Brian Henry  a spokesman for Express Scripts  He defined a captive pharmacy as one that derives the vast majority of prescription volume from one manufacturer or one product 
AbbVie said its wholly owned Pharmacy Solutions business aims to help patients and doctors verify insurance coverage in certain instances for drugs such as its widely used rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira  The company said the program accounts for less than 0 2 percent of its U S  sales 
 We believe that Pharmacy Solutions does provide a level of service  We don t see any change at this time   said AbbVie spokesman Greg Miley

CVS Health  N CVS   the second largest pharmacy benefit manager  also said it is continuing to investigate other pharmacies to uncover inappropriate billing and dispensing activities 
Erik Gordon  a professor at the University of Michigan s Ross School of Business  noted that independent specialty pharmacies provide an important service by dispensing expensive and complex products that require special handling  such as cancer treatments 
That is different from examples like Philidor  he said 
 Captive specialty pharmacies often are a vehicle for drug company parents to push their own products  especially products that are off patent and face cheaper competitors   Gordon said 
Shares of Valeant have lost more than half their value since mid September as the company came under fire on several fronts  such as evidence of extreme price hikes for several of its drugs and allegations that it used Philidor to inflate revenue and circumvent insurer controls on high cost prescriptions  Valeant has denied the accusations

148632,370148,BHC,Drugmaker Valeant raises detailed defense but doubts remain,news,"By Caroline Humer and Euan Rocha  Reuters    Drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  TO VRX   N VRX  laid out a detailed defense on Monday of its relationship with a little known specialty pharmacy  but its arguments failed to calm all investor concerns  Valeant shares have lost more than half their value in recent weeks as the company came under attack on several fronts   U S  prosecutors are investigating Valeant over drug pricing  an issue emerging in the U S  presidential campaign  The falling stock price  in turn  complicates Valeant s acquisition driven strategy  And those stock losses accelerated last week when short seller Citron Research  run by Andrew Left  published a sharply critical report on the company   The stock dropped another 2 percent in volatile afternoon trading in New York and Toronto  Laval  Quebec based Valeant said it has asked U S  securities regulators to investigate Citron s  completely untrue  allegation that the company used its ties with a specialty pharmacy to inflate revenue  and said it would conduct a review of its pharmacy network   About a dozen executives  directors  and a former chief financial officer   some of whom Chief Executive Mike  Pearson   L PSON  said were operating on little sleep   made up Valeant s defense team on a conference call with investors and analysts  The call included an unequivocal endorsement of Pearson by lead director Robert Ingram    Left s  motivation is the same as one who runs into a crowded theater and falsely yells fire  He wanted people to run   Pearson said   He intentionally designed the report to frighten our shareholders to drive down the price of our stock so he could make money for his short selling    Left disputed Pearson s comment in a statement   Yelling fire in a crowded theater is a lot different than walking into a theater  smelling smoke and yelling   Hey everyone  there could be a fire    Now the information is out  people have had an opportunity to inspect the theater and they have chosen to leave     maybe there is fire   Left said on Bloomberg TV that he had not been contacted by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  He refused to discuss his trading of Valeant  Valeant said it would set up an ad hoc committee to look into allegations related to the company s association with specialty pharmacy Philidor  The committee includes Mason Morfit  president of one of Valeant s largest shareholders ValueAct Capital  who is rejoining the board  Philidor said it welcomed formation of the committee and would cooperate with it  Peter Andersen  chief investment officer at Boston based Congress Wealth Management  a long time Valeant investor  said he was impressed with the directors and senior management  but sold his stake Monday because of uncertainty facing the company   They are an excellent example of modern corporate governance in terms of being open and available  I feel they discredited the short seller s allegations   he said  but added   The stock is going to be stuck in limbo   REBUILDING CONFIDENCE Valeant cleared the air somewhat  but not enough  said BMO analyst Alex Arfaei  in a note    There is still much more that needs to be done to rebuild investor confidence  which we argue has been significantly weakened   Arfaei said he wondered what other undisclosed business practices Valeant might be involved in that could undermine the stock   Valeant said in a filing Monday it received a subpoena in a U S  government probe of payments between its Bausch   Lomb division and medical professionals  Valeant should sever its relationship with Philidor so it can focus on its core business  said BTIG analyst Tim Chiang   But J P  Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note that concerns about Valeant s connection with Philidor were  overblown    Valeant said it paid  100 million in December 2014 for its option to buy Pennsylvania based Philidor Rx Services Llc  which also included contractual rights  such as influence over certain personnel hirings and a place on a joint steering committee  Philidor accounted for about 7 percent of its total revenue and EBITDA in the third quarter  and 44 percent of sales of Jublia  Valeant s toenail fungus treatment  Valeant said  but added it is not material for reporting purposes   Valeant described Philidor as independent  and said Valeant does not have legal liability for it   The company said a board review had found the company in compliance with the law on revenue recognition from drugs sold through Philidor   Valeant s link to Philidor came under scrutiny after a New York Times report said that Valeant and other drugmakers were using specialty drug distributors to circumvent barriers to raising prices   Valeant has said it properly accounts for sales through its pharmacy partners and only books revenue once one of its medicines reaches a patient   FOCUS ON SPECIALTY PHARMACIES Specialty pharmacies are designed to handle complex medications that have unique requirements for storage or administration  But Valeant has also used such pharmacies to sell more conventional medicines directly to patients  and work out reimbursement from insurers afterward  That may allow them to get past limits on a drug s use imposed by insurers or a retail pharmacy  In Valeant s case  the company has been under scrutiny for its ties to Philidor  which has been accused by one of its affiliates of improper billing practices  The Wall Street Journal reported that Valeant and Philidor are more interconnected than previously disclosed  and highlighted business practices that included a few Valeant workers who used alternative names  sometimes fictional ones  while working in Philidor s office  Valeant chief compliance officer Seana Carson said the company s ad hoc committee will also review that report   Pearson said Valeant will consider all options  including buying Philidor or severing ties with it  as well as using other specialty pharmacies

the contact lens business with its purchase of Bausch and Lomb in 2013 for  8 7 billion  At the time of the acquisition  Bausch and Lomb manufactured about 75  of the basic components of rigid gas permeable lenses  known as   buttons   said Kurtis Brown  who worked for Bausch and Lomb prior to Valeant s purchase  After manufacture  buttons are customized for individual patients  typically by laboratories specializing in that process   With the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences in May for an undisclosed sum  Valeant and Bausch and Lomb further consolidated their grip on the market  gaining control of more than 80  percent of the gas permeable button market  according to one of the sources familiar with Valeant s operations and the representative of an industry group  Rigid lenses comprise only about 10  of the contact lens market  and are popular among people who cannot wear soft lenses   The acquisition of Paragon also gave Valeant and Bausch and Lomb full control of the small market for Ortho K buttons  which are used to create one type of gas permeable lens  said Brown  now a marketing manager for lens manufacturer Menicon America Inc  Sales of Ortho K buttons and finished Ortho K lenses comprise only about  5 million in annual sales for Valeant companies   The U S  Federal Trade Commission is investigating the Paragon purchase as part of an anti trust probe  a source interviewed by the FTC told Reuters  Valeant disclosed on Monday that it had received a letter from the FTC on or about Oct  16 seeking more information about its acquisition of Paragon   On Tuesday  Valeant declined to comment on specifics of its strategy in the specialty contact lens market but defended its purchase of Paragon       Our acquisition of Paragon Holdings supports our mission to improve consumers  lives by bringing to market innovative  specialty eye care solutions  and we are cooperating with the FTC on its inquiry   the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters    Bausch   Lomb is now operated as a division of Valeant  and Paragon has been rolled into Bausch   Lomb  In recent months  Bausch and Lomb also has moved to acquire laboratories that turn the raw components   buttons   into finished lenses   The plan has encountered challenges  however  with at least four laboratories   including Alden Optics  Art Optical and Tru Form Optics   holding out  at least for now  against Bausch and Lomb s purchase overtures  according to one of the sources familiar with Valeant s contact lens operations and some of the labs themselves    In the months after it began trying to acquire laboratories  Bausch and Lomb increased button prices for its customers  which included more than 30 laboratories that customize lenses  according to Jan Svochak  president of the contact lens manufacturers association  an industry trade group  The price increases for buttons ranged from 15 percent to more than 120 percent  a source with direct knowledge of the price hikes said  Keith Parker  owner and president of Advanced Vision Technology  said that his lab was hit with a first price increase from Bausch and Lomb in mid September and a second one on October 1  all on overnight wear lenses    They were substantial   he said of the price increases   Some of them 100 percent  some of them more than 100 percent    The company also did away with volume discounts  he said  In response to the price increases  some labs have begun switching to other button suppliers  such as Contamac  according to at least three laboratories interviewed by Reuters  Contamac has not responded to a request for comment   Last week  Bausch and Lomb sent a letter to the optometrist community promising to  adjust down  some of the increased prices after complaints from laboratories    In the long run  Bausch and Lomb hopes to do more manufacturing and distribution of finished lenses directly to optometrists  This would enable Bausch and Lomb to bypass some of the laboratories now filling that role and thereby buttress its profits  according to one of the people familiar with Valeant s operations and several laboratories   According to the two sources familiar with Valeant s contact lens operations  Bausch and Lomb hopes a newly created division  to be called Advanced Vision Products  will bring in more than  100 million in revenue by the end of 2016 from sales of specialty contact lens products  including customized gas permeable contact lenses   Bausch and Lomb currently earns about  30 million annually from manufacturing gas permeable lenses and their basic components  the sources said    Valeant was already the subject of a U S  probe into price increases for its heart medications  and its stock price was battered last week after short seller Andrew Left accused it of using mail order pharmacies to fraudulently book revenues  
Valeant denied Left s assertions and laid out a detailed defense on Monday of its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor  the firm at the center of Left s accusations ",2015-10-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/valeant's-ambitious-plan-for-its-contact-lens-business-368585,368585
148635,370151,BHC,CVS  Express Scripts drop Valeant s Philidor  stock dives,news,By Michael Flaherty and Caroline Humer  Reuters    Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  Inc  sustained hits on several fronts on Thursday after CVS Health Corp  N CVS  and Express Scripts dropped Philidor from their networks in a sign the fallout from the drugmaker s connection with the specialty pharmacy is spreading  The moves by the nation s two largest pharmacy benefit managers whacked Valeant shares before the market close  and pushed them 10 percent lower to  99 after hours  After coming under pressure this summer  Valeant s stock plunged last week after short seller Citron Research said that the company was using its drug distributor  Philidor Rx  to inflate revenue numbers  About a dozen Valeant officials held a conference call on Monday to address the accusations  which helped ease pressure on the company s stock  Valeant said it properly accounts for sales through its pharmacy partners and only books revenue once one of its medicines reaches a patient  Valeant s stock recovered throughout the week than sank on the CVS and Express Scripts news  CVS  late on Thursday  said its Caremark program was dropping Philidor  CVS took the step following an audit of Philidor  citing  noncompliance  with its provider agreement  the company said  Shortly after the market close  Express Scripts said it too was ending its ties to Philidor   CVS did not explain the  noncompliance  further when contacted by Reuters  Bloomberg on Thursday said Philidor has altered doctors  orders to wring more payment out of insurers  according to former employees and an internal document  which details how to proceed with a prescription for certain Valeant drugs after they have been rejected   Valeant s drugs are provided to patients through many channels  including traditional retail pharmacies  specialty pharmacies  and directly from health care providers   said Valeant Spokeswoman Laurie Little in an emailed statement   Philidor declined to comment on Thursday   CVS and Express Scripts Holdings manage most of the prescriptions filled under health plans run by the nation s largest insurers  Express Scripts manages prescription benefits for 85 million people   The move by CVS and Express Scripts will have a direct impact on Valeant  though Philidor accounts for a small portion of the Canadian company s revenues  In Valeant s detailed presentation on Monday that spelled out its dealings with Philidor  the company said that the pharmacy accounted for about 5 9 percent of its total sales so far this year  The stock was trading as high as  260 per share in August  The next month  U S  Democratic politicians singled out Valeant for hiking drug prices on consumers  and a federal subpoena followed  With the stock under pressure  the Citron report last Wednesday sent it into a tailspin  TOP SHAREHOLDER SPEAKS The CVS announcement came after mutual fund manager Ruane  Cunniff   Goldfarb Inc   sent a letter to its own investors about the Valeant saga  The Sequoia Fund  which the mutual fund manages  owns 9 93 percent of Valeant and is the company s largest shareholder  While the letter is largely a defense of Valeant s practices  it says that the company needs to move faster with paying down its debt  It also points out that Valeant s aggressive business practices have  pushed boundaries   and that the company needs to better manage its image   We would stress the importance of taking a more systemic approach to managing business practices with an eye on the company s long term corporate reputation   said the letter dated Oct  28 and signed by Ruane  Cunniff   Goldfarb President Robert Goldfarb and Executive Vice President David Poppe  Separately  two of the five independent directors of the Sequoia Fund resigned over the weekend  the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday  citing the board s chairman  A person who answered the phone at Ruane  Cunniff   Goldfarb said the chairman  Roger Lowenstein  could not be reached  ACTIVISTS HIT Valeant s abrupt slide from a hedge fund darling to a drug company under fire has weighed heavily on two of the best known U S  activist funds  ValueAct Partners and Pershing Square  ValueAct has been an investor in Valeant since 2006  and played a significant role in instituting the company s strategy and its current CEO  Michael  Pearson   L PSON   Pearson took over in 2008 and built Valeant into a more than  40 billion company with over 100 transactions  ValueAct  with  19 billion under management  now has two directors on the company s board  and was the fourth largest shareholder as of June 30  William Ackman s Pershing Square  Valeant s third largest shareholder  has scheduled a call on Friday at

148670,370186,BHC,Valeant vows to refute  phantom sales  allegations,news,"By Euan Rocha and Ransdell Pierson TORONTO NEW YORK  Reuters    Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  International Inc  TO VRX  moved to reassure investors on Thursday after being accused of using specialty pharmacies to inflate revenue  and said it would refute them in detail on a conference call with investors  Valeant shares have lost more than 25 percent of their value since influential short seller Citron Research made the allegations on Wednesday  The company had already issued statements denying the claims   Valeant said at least 10 of its executives and board members would participate in a call on Monday  including Chief Executive Michael  Pearson   L PSON   its current and former chief financial officers  and board member Robert Hale  who represents key shareholder ValueAct Capital    We look forward to our call on Monday where we will address and refute recent allegations   Pearson said  Citron s allegations have heaped pressure on Valeant  which is already under scrutiny for extreme price hikes on drugs that it has acquired over the years  including investigations launched by federal prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts  Valeant has built a reputation for rapidly acquiring drugmakers and scaling up sales of their medicines  in some cases through steep price increases  The company has said a growing amount of its revenue comes through its specialty pharmacy partners  which will fill patient prescriptions even before they have secured reimbursement from their health insurers  Citron alleged that the pharmacies allow Valeant to create phantom accounts that boost its revenue  Valeant maintains it only books revenue once a drug is received by a patient  On Thursday  some of the company s greatest champions on Wall Street began to express doubt about its prospects  and a securities regulator in Quebec said it was keeping a close eye on developments regarding its pharmacy ties   Alex Arfaei  an analyst with BMO Capital Markets who had long held a  buy  rating on Valeant  downgraded the company on Thursday to  market perform   He questioned disclosures that suggest Valeant had operational control of one of its specialty pharmacies  whereas other drugmakers consider their affiliated specialty pharmacies fully independent   Valeant s structure may not be illegal  but we find it aggressive and questionable   Arfaei said in a research note  He added that concerns over Valeant s handling of the business would linger unless resolved by an investigation  Valeant s swoon this week has hurt major shareholders  including billionaire William Ackman whose Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund lost about  500 million alone in Wednesday s rout  Rival specialty drugmakers including  Horizon Pharma  Plc  O HZNP  and Endo International  O ENDP  also fell sharply  Valeant s secondary loan price fell for a second day on Thursday in volatile trading  pulling down trading levels for a range of other drugmaker loans  according to Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp   Valeant s five year credit default swaps have blown out 44 percent  or 195 basis points  to 637 5 basis points  according to Markit data  That means the cost of insuring  10 million of Valeant bonds against default has become  195 000 more expensive  The company s swaps are relatively new  however  and therefore not very liquid   But the company has also seen signs of support  Ackman bought additional Valeant shares during Wednesday s rout  Standard   Poor s also said it is sticking by its ratings on Valeant  saying speculation about potential fraud was unfounded  SPECIALTY PHARMACY CHANNEL Specialty pharmacies typically are used to deliver drugs that require special handling  or for patients with complex medical conditions like multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis  A New York Times story early this week said Valeant was using its ties with a pharmacy called Philidor to sell more conventional medications to get past health insurer barriers to reimbursement  Citron wrote that Valeant was also using Philidor accounts to inflate its revenue  Valeant has categorically denied the allegations  saying it only books revenue once its drugs reach patients  But Pearson surprised investors earlier in the week by disclosing the company had an option to acquire Philidor   On Thursday  the Autorit  Des March s Financiers  AMF   which regulates companies based in Quebec including Valeant  said it does not have an active probe into the drugmaker  The regulator is  watching very seriously the evolution of the situation   said Sylvain Th berge a spokesman for the AMF in an email  adding that the AMF is in communication with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission about the matter   Regardless of the accuracy of allegations  we don t see a quick end to unquantifiable headline risk   Susquehanna analyst Andrew Finkelstein said in a note   The brokerage firm suspended its ratings and estimates on the company  noting that a battle with short sellers means Valeant s shares are not likely to trade on fundamentals in the near term  Yet Pearson also had some social media backing from Martin Shkreli  the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals  a start up drug firm  which sparked outrage by raising the price on a decades old drug by 5 000 percent

148697,370213,BHC,Why You ll See No Ads For  Female Viagra ,news,"By   

American women who have lost their desire for sex can now walk into a doctor s office and ask for a pink pill called Addyi to resurrect it  But despite all the hype around the drug s market introduction  women won t be bombarded with television  radio  print or digital advertising from the drug s maker for at least 18 months  The company  Sprout Pharmaceuticals  has pledged to postpone all paid advertising for more than a year to temper the U S  Food and Drug Administration s concerns about the drug s safety 
Sales of Addyi launched nationwide on Saturday  and the Raleigh  N C  based company says the highly anticipated medicine is meant to help the estimated 16 million American women who suffer from a form of low sexual desire known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder  HSDD   Supporters have applauded the drug s arrival as the dawn of a new era for women s sexual health  and executives at Canadian pharmaceutical giant Valeant Pharmaceuticals  N VRX  found it intriguing enough to pay  1 billion for Sprout  in August 
The company s promise to regulators does not prohibit it from getting the word out about Addyi through other popular channels  however  and Sprout s willingness to engage potential customers through social media  interviews with media outlets and key influencers signals the upending of traditional pharmaceutical marketing strategy 
 I think what they re doing is pretty clever  actually   Dan Leinweber  president at a boutique PR firm called Leinweber Associates  says   This is a much less costly way to get their word out in a much more credible way  
Sprout won FDA approval of Addyi in August after a hard and long fight following two previous rejections  Selling a drug it cannot advertise in a brand new market is the company s next big challenge  Addyi is meant for women who struggle with HSDD  characterized by a sudden loss of sexual desire that cannot be explained by other factors such as anxiety or relationship problems  The drug is similar to an antidepressant in that it adjusts brain chemicals including serotonin that are thought to be associated with sexual drive 
Since Addyi is the first pill to treat any form of low sexual desire  most women don t know that such treatment is available  Viagra was also a brand new drug in a new class of sexual medicine when it debuted in 1998  Since then  Viagra has been one of the most heavily advertised drugs in the world and earned handsome profits for Pfizer  The company spent  232 million on advertising Viagra in 2014 alone  At its peak  Viagra brought in  2 billion in revenue in 2012 
Other pharmaceutical companies are spending more and more on consumer advertising as Sprout holds back  The U S  and New Zealand remain the only two countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD   a coalition of 34 advanced and emerging nations  to permit pharmaceutical companies to advertise medicine to consumers  Globally  drug companies spent  4 53 billion on such advertising efforts in 2014  up 18 percent from the year before 

A New Age Of Marketing
Sprout can still find creative ways to spread the word about Addyi without relying on traditional media buys  The company has already demonstrated its skill at drumming up grassroots support among potential customers  It sponsors a nonprofit called Even the Score that sent women to testify before the FDA and accuse the agency of sexism for failing to give Addyi a green light after approving drugs to treat common sexual problems in men such as erectile dysfunction 
Sprout will continue to promote Addyi through partnerships with groups such as Even the Score  though the group is careful to say that it does not support one single treatment over another  A day before the drug s first sales  Even the Score posted a flashback photo of women who spoke out in support of the drug to their Facebook  O FB  page  It also published a YouTube video that does not mention Addyi by name but mimics a Viagra advertisement soon after the new drug s approval 
Leinweber also says granting interviews to major media outlets over the course of the next 18 months could help the company spread the message about Addyi without spending a penny on radio or television ads 
 It ll get people talking about the brand  not just consumers but key influencers like physicians and people who would prescribe it   he says   In effect  this sort of online word of mouth will effectively function as non paid advertising and drive traffic to their website and then stimulate customer engagement and sentiment with Addyi  
CEO Cindy Whitehead appeared on many morning shows and news broadcasts in the days after Addyi s approval in August  Sprout also maintains a website for the drug and runs several social media accounts  though there was no mention of Addyi s launch on the company s Facebook page or sparsely used Twitter  N TWTR  account 

News of the new drug can also effectively spread by word of mouth   particularly with the help of outspoken supporters  of which Sprout has plenty  Amanda Parrish  a 52 year old woman from Nashville  Tennessee  participated in a clinical trial for Addyi and was so satisfied with her results that she began speaking widely about her experience with help from Sprout s media team  On Saturday  she posted an update titled  ADDYI is AVAILABLE  to her personal blog  which read  I ve got mine   do you have yours   
However  word of mouth could also backfire if those who try the drug find it to be underwhelming  In clinical trials  the daily pill boosted the number of sexually satisfying experiences that women had by 1 6 to 2 5 per month  There was a strong placebo effect detected in the trial  and only 9 to 15 percent of women experienced improvement in three outcomes above and beyond what could be explained by a placebo 
 I think a lot of people will maybe try it once and be like   Ok    I don t feel anything    Max Jacobs  a biotech analyst at Edison Investment Research  says   That s bad word of mouth

Since women can also learn about the medicine through their doctors  Sprout has hired and trained around 150 sales representatives which is common practice within the pharmaceutical industry  This group will visit doctors  offices nationwide and walk prescribers through a brief online course about Addy s risks that the FDA requires as an extra measure of caution for this medicine  Monday was the first day that the sales force hit the road  Representatives will initially reach out to obstetrician gynecologists before expanding to psychiatrists 
Still  Jacobs says he wouldn t count on Addyi generating more than  50 million in annual sales  which is far below some early projections that reached over  1 billion  He says Sprout faces an uphill battle in not only spreading the word to potential patients  but also in persuading doctors that the drug is safe and effective  The FDA issued a black box warning for the drug which prohibits patients from consuming alcohol while on it because some patients who drank alcohol and took the drug during clinical trials experienced a drop in blood pressure and fainted 
 I think it s going to be very difficult for a physician to say   Hey  I think you should try this  because there are all the safety risks and it s probably not going to work and the data just aren t very impressive   he says ",2015-10-19,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/why-you'll-see-no-ads-for-'female-viagra'-366898,366898

148794,370310,BHC,Valeant says may raise Allergan bid  beats on profit,news,"By Rod Nickel and Ashutosh Pandey  Reuters    Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX TO VRX N said on Monday that it may raise its bid for Botox maker Allergan Inc AGN N after the Canadian company posted a better than expected quarterly profit 
Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said a possible revised stock and cash bid would be worth more than  200 per share  assuming that Valeant s stock rises  and would include more cash  The current bid is worth about  52 7 billion or  176 per share 
Shares of Laval  Quebec based Valeant were up 3 percent at C 139 51 in Toronto on Monday  Allergan stock was up 1 7 percent at  180 45 
Valeant s third quarter results were keenly anticipated for their potential impact on Valeant s bid for Allergan  maker of anti wrinkle injection Botox  Unlike most quarters in which  according to critics  one time charges related to acquisitions obscure Valeant s performance  the company made few deals as it stalked Allergan 
 When people have time to reflect on our performance this quarter  it hopefully goes a long way of convincing the Allergan shareholders that our currency is actually a great stock to own   Pearson told Reuters 
He said Valeant is considering adding more cash to its bid  and could make a decision on it at any time 
 We have some money in our pocket   he said 
Pearson expects that once it becomes clear Valeant will win Allergan  Valeant s stock will rise  adding further value to the bid 
Valeant teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman in April to make a hostile offer for Allergan  which rejected Valeant s offer  Allergan did not immediately respond to Pearson s comments 
Allergan will hold a special shareholder meeting on Dec  18  when Ackman hopes to remove most directors  possibly leading to negotiations with Valeant 
Valeant s relationship with Ackman and his Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund is not strained as some have speculated  Pearson said 
 We re completely aligned   he said on an earlier call with analysts 
The company raised its full year adjusted earnings forecast to  8 22  8 32 per share from  7 90  8 10 per share 
The company raised its fourth quarter adjusted profit forecast to  2 45  2 55 per share on expectations of double digit same store organic growth

Valeant also raised its 2015 adjusted profit forecast to  10 per share from  9 65 per share  Analysts were expecting  9 58 per share

148825,370341,BHC,Ackman  other shareholders ask Allergan to call special meeting,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss and Caroline Humer
BOSTON NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors owning 31 percent of shares of Allergan Inc have asked the company to call a special shareholder meeting  activist shareholder William Ackman said on Friday  giving the hedge fund manager a victory in his fight to acquire the Botox maker 
Ackman  whose Pershing Square Capital Management is Allergan s largest shareholder  said 35 shareholders including some of Allergan s  longest standing  and  largest  investors handed in paperwork on Friday to compel Allergan to call the meeting 
Pershing Square and Valeant Pharmaceutical International Inc made a  52 billion hostile offer for Allergan in April  Since then Allergan has been fighting for investor support for its own stand alone plan that includes cost cuts and making an acquisition of its own 
Meanwhile  Ackman has been working to sign up enough shareholders and said that Allergan  under its bylaws  is required now to call the meeting no later than Dec  20 
Pershing Square also said on Friday that it filed a lawsuit in Delaware to require Allergan to schedule the meeting  anticipating that the company would likely fight doing so  Ackman and Valeant s cash and stock offer is now worth  49 billion 
Allergan said in a press release that it would review the requests from shareholders in connection with Pershing Square s meeting request and expects to report the results promptly after its review 
Allergan also said that Ackman and Valeant s offer undervalues the company
At the meeting  Ackman hopes to replace the bulk of Allergan board members with his own slate of directors who might agree to the takeover deal and to force Allergan to open discussions 
Ackman s lawsuit is the latest legal tussle for the companies and follows Allergan s insider trading suit against Valeant and Ackman filed in federal court in California on Aug  1 
DELIVERING THE PAPERWORK
Friday s move  in which Valeant and Ackman delivered the shareholder paperwork to Allergan s headquarters in Irvine  California  satisfies Allergan s bylaws that at least one quarter of its shareholders request the meeting  Ackman said 
The hedge fund manager  who called the task of filling out the paperwork  burdensome   said one shareholder  whose paperwork totals 174 pages  had to deliver 85 signatures 
T  Rowe Price Associates  The Vanguard Group  State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock Institutional Trust Company are the next largest shareholders after Pershing Square 
While some Allergan shareholders have sold holdings since the deal was announced  Ackman said many of the shareholders who back the meeting have owned Allergan stock since before he and Valeant Pharmaceuticals unveiled their takeover deal on April 22  More investors may still fill out the paperwork  he said 

Analysts had expected Ackman to gather more than 25 percent of the votes after two large proxy advisory firms urged investors to join Ackman in calling for the meeting

148827,370343,BHC,Valeant  Ackman get October 6 trial over Allergan special meeting,news,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON Del   Reuters    Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and activist investor William Ackman got their request for an expedited trial on Wednesday over the timing of a special meeting of Allergan Inc shareholders  a key to their  50 billion hostile takeover fight 
Delaware Court of Chancery Chancellor Andre Bouchard ordered a three day trial to begin on Oct  6  That start date is in line with their request for the court to order Allergan   after the trial ends   to call a special meeting by mid November 
That is about a month earlier than the Dec  18 date when Allergan has said it will hold the meeting at which Ackman and Valeant hope to elect new board members and open discussions on a deal 
The court order comes after Ackman s Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund and Canada s Valeant sued the maker of Botox anti wrinkle treatment on Friday  saying the company did not intend to call a meeting at all  Allergan subsequently set the meeting date 
In the lawsuit  Pershing Square  Allergan s biggest shareholder  alleged that Allergan was trying to avoid a special meeting to give it time to find an alternative deal 
In setting the expedited trial date  Bouchard said it was pretty apparent to him that  Allergan may not want a special meeting at all  
Since Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22  Allergan has consistently rejected the offer  saying it undervalues the company  It has also announced a series of cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions as it seeks to persuade shareholders they are better off if it stands alone 
Allergan s lawyer told Bouchard on Wednesday that it needed time to avoid a  bum rush  by Pershing Square and to determine if Pershing Square had violated federal securities laws in obtaining its 9 7 percent stake 
Ackman began accumulating his stake in February when it and Valeant started talking about buying Allergan together  He disclosed his stake on April 21  and the companies announced the offer on April 22  which instantly pushed Allergan shares higher and created  1 billion in paper gains for Ackman 
Allergan has sued both Ackman and Valeant for insider trading in federal court in California  saying that aspects of their unusual arrangement violated securities regulations 

Valeant shares fell  1 12  or less than 1 percent  to  115 98 and Allergan fell  1 59  or less than 1 percent  to  162 38

New York hedge fund manager Ackman  famed for aggressive moves including a  1 billion bet against US nutrition firm Herbalife  is currently engaged in a battle to broker a sale of Botox maker Allergan  N AGN  to Valeant Pharmaceuticals  TO VRX

148829,370345,BHC,Allergan reaches truce with suitors on special shareholder meeting,news," Reuters    Allergan Inc  N AGN  and its suitors Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc  TO VRX  settled their pending litigation before the Delaware Court of Chancery and agreed to hold a special shareholder meeting on the originally scheduled date  Dec  18 
Billionaire William Ackman s Pershing Square and Canada s Valeant sued the maker of Botox anti wrinkle treatment last month  alleging that Allergan was trying to avoid a special meeting to give it time to find an alternative deal  Allergan subsequently set the meeting for Dec  18 
Pershing Square  Allergan s largest shareholder with a 9 72 percent stake  and Valeant made a hostile offer for Allergan in April  Since then  Allergan has been fighting for investor support for its own stand alone plan that includes cost cuts and making an acquisition of its own 
To force the company to the table  Ackman has been pushing for a special meeting where he hopes to replace most board members with his own nominees  who he expects will be more receptive to Valeant s bid 
Allergan said late Monday it continues to believe that Valeant s unsolicited exchange offer is  grossly inadequate  and urged shareholders to reject the offer 
Allergan s shareholders of record Oct  30 will be entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Dec  18 meeting 
Allergan is pursuing an existing litigation in California but will no longer seek the invalidation of any special meeting requests or seek to postpone or cancel the meeting  Pershing Square said early Tuesday 
In August  Allergan filed a civil lawsuit in California  accusing Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared a takeover bid for the drug company 

 Valeant and Pershing Square believe that Allergan s claims and request for relief in the California litigation are entirely without merit and will ultimately be rejected   Pershing Square said in a statement

148860,370376,BHC,Allergan readies defense as it fights Valeant for votes,news,"By Caroline Humer and Deena Beasley NEW YORK and LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Allergan Inc  N AGN  may take on debt to buy back its own shares as part of a multi faceted plan to thwart a  53 billion takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  TO VRX   N VRX  and activist investor William Ackman 
The company is also considering making acquisitions of its own and more spending cuts to increase shareholder value  Chief Executive David Pyott said in an interview  outlining steps to build support for Allergan  best known for its Botox anti wrinkle injections  to remain a standalone company 
But Allergan  which is expected to unveil the plan when it releases second quarter results sometime in July  faces an uphill battle 
Valeant says it already has enough shareholders on its side to call a special meeting to replace Allergan board members with nominees who support its takeover proposal  To call a meeting  the acquisitive Canadian company needs support of the holders of at least 25 percent of the shares 
It is possible that Allergan can turn the tide  but it won t be easy  said Ronny Gal  an analyst at Sanford C  Bernstein 
 When I run my numbers  a buyback alone doesn t quite cut it   Gal said   A buyback plus another round of costs cuts  or the acceleration of the discussed cost savings  does  
An Allergan acquisition could help as well if it increases the company s profits  Gal said  In order to get near term investors on its side  Allergan needs to deliver another  10 per share of value in 2015 or  11 per share in 2016  he said 
 The question is  how big of a buyback and how big are the cost cuts   he said 
LEVERAGED BUYBACK
Allergan announced an initial round of spending cuts in May when it first rejected Valeant s offer  When it rejected Valeant s offer again on June 10  it said that it would unveil more cuts and capital measures when it releases its second quarter results 
In the interview   Allergan CEO Pyott was more specific   Pyott has met with investors to talk about the company s defense  which he said could include issuing new debt to buy back shares  He said Allergan could borrow up to  10 billion without affecting its investment grade rating  but he did not say how much the company might spend on the buybacks 
 Our goal now is to give them most of what they want   Pyott said  referring to Allergan shareholders 
A leveraged buyback would increase the amount of Allergan s debt  making its balance sheet less attractive to a would be acquirer  Allergan currently has little debt  one of the company features that appeals to debt laden Valeant 
A buyback would also reduce the number of shares outstanding  which would raise its earnings per share and increase shareholder value  An acquisition by Allergan could also increase earnings  he said 
THE VALEANT PLAN
Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in an interview last week that he believes Valeant and Ackman  who owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan through Pershing Square Capital Management  have the backing of enough Allergan shareholders to support the deal 
According to sources  Valeant and Ackman have won over a prominent hedge fund  Paulson   Co   which has bought more than 6 million Allergan shares 
The company has said it will cut about  2 7 billion in spending at Allergan and that it would rely less on internal research and development in the future  Allergan says that such cuts would limit the company s growth potential 
Valeant also might pay more to get a deal done  Pearson said  Valeant has already raised its offer twice but has held firm now for about a month 

 We have a walk away price for Allergan  I can t tell you what our walk away price is  but right now we don t have any reason to raise because we would be bidding against ourselves   Pearson said 
The offer  which includes  72 in cash plus 0 83 of a Valeant share  is currently worth about  177 per share  or  53 billion  The deal value is calculated based on 303 5 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31  and Ackman s holding of 28 878 638 shares

148863,370379,BHC,Republican lawmaker to grill U S  SEC over Ackman tactics ,news,"By Sarah N  Lynch WASHINGTON  Reuters    A U S  lawmaker will pressure the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to consider a raft of reforms  after William Ackman s aggressive efforts to take over Allergan Inc raised concerns about loose rules governing disclosure and shareholder voting 
Republican Representative Edward Royce of California plans to grill SEC Corporation Finance Director Keith Higgins at a House Financial Services hearing 
Among his top concerns is a rule that lets investors such as Ackman delay publicly reporting when they have amassed a large stake in a company for days 
 I am especially interested in the SEC s process when looking at novel or creative deals like the announced joint bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Pershing Square for Allergan   Royce said in a statement 
 Mr  Higgins  appearance before the committee is an opportunity to make sure that the Commission is making robust reviews of these sorts of deals to ensure strong investor protections and market transparency  
Saat Alety  Royce s spokesman  said that Royce is prepared to take legislative action if the SEC fails to fix the problem on its own 
UNUSUAL TACTICS
In recent months  Royce has been writing letters to the SEC to express concerns about some unusual maneuvers that Ackman s company Pershing Square Capital Management has used in its joint effort with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc to win a  53 billion hostile takeover of Allergan  which is headquartered near Royce s California district 
In one May letter  Royce said he was concerned about early efforts by Ackman to call a non binding shareholder vote outside of Allergan s typical election procedures as a way to pressure Allergan to negotiate a deal 
Royce said he feared this  shadow  election would make it tough for shareholders to  truly understand what is going on  
Pershing Square dropped plans for a shareholder referendum in May and has since pursued a more traditional proxy battle 
In a July 2 letter to Royce  SEC Chair Mary Jo White said that the Corporation Finance division will  continue to consider issues raised by the filing related to the abandoned shareholder referendum  and  issues raised by any future filings of a similar nature  
Ackman s tactics have raised a number of regulatory questions  both about his actions and about hostile takeover bids generally 
It has renewed calls to fix a SEC rule that affords large investors a 10 day delay before they must report when they have amassed more than a 5 percent stake in a company 
The 2010 Dodd Frank law authorized the SEC to shorten the reporting period  but so far the SEC has not taken up the measure 

Higgins  division is in charge of reviewing financial statements of public companies and corporate governance matters 
In that role  his division would oversee a rule writing on the reporting period and also review proxy filings and related regulatory matters 
Royce s questions on Thursday will touch on just one of what is expected to be a wide ranging list of topics at the hearing 
Lawmakers also plan to ask Higgins about other matters  from rulemakings required by the Dodd Frank and JOBS Act laws  to how the SEC oversees proxy advisory firms

148864,370380,BHC,Shareholder adviser ISS backs Ackman call for Allergan meeting,news," Reuters    Institutional Shareholder Services  ISS  is backing activist investor Bill Ackman s call for a special meeting of Allergan Inc  N AGN  investors that could topple the company s board and increase the chances of a takeover by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International  TO VRX  
ISS  recommendation on Wednesday follows a similar view from shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis on Monday  giving Ackman s Pershing Square Capital Management momentum as the hedge fund tries to muster support for the meeting  ISS is the largest proxy adviser for institutional investors 
Pershing  Allergan s biggest investor with a 9 7 percent stake  needs to garner shareholder support representing 25 percent of the California company  best known for its Botox anti wrinkle injections  Pershing wants to replace most of Allergan s board  which has refused to negotiate with Valeant  which is based in Laval  Quebec 
In a report  ISS said  there appear to be significant governance issues which could be addressed  in a special meeting 
Ackman and Valeant said they are pleased with the ISS and Glass Lewis reports 
 The ISS Report should cause Allergan shareholders to question the credibility of a Board that is pursuing frivolous litigation tactics and baseless attacks to delay or stop the right for shareholders to fix anti shareholder bylaws  elect shareholder friendly directors and to voice their concerns about Allergan s poor corporate governance   Ackman said in a statement 
Allergan said the advisory firms were merely stating that shareholders should have the right to call a special meeting 
 These recommendations do not change the fact that Valeant s offer is grossly inadequate  substantially undervalues Allergan  creates significant risks and uncertainties for Allergan stockholders and is not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders   Allergan said in a statement 
Allergan has been fighting the takeover bid since it was announced on April 22 
Valeant s cash and stock offer is currently worth about  49 billion  after its shares fell 12 percent since reporting disappointing second quarter earnings on July 31 
Pershing Square and Valeant officials could not be reached immediately for comment

148865,370381,BHC,California judge sets August 20 hearing in Allergan vs  Valeant case ,news," Reuters    The federal judge in California overseeing Allergan Inc s  N AGN  insider trading lawsuit against Valeant Pharmaceuticals  TO VRX  and activist investor William Ackman has set an Aug  20 hearing date to decide on a fast track schedule for the case  according to court documents 
Allergan  fighting a hostile takeover by Valeant and Ackman s Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund  filed the lawsuit on Aug  1  The Botox maker said in the complaint that Valeant and Ackman violated securities laws on tender offers when they teamed up on a  48 billion cash and stock offer 
The case could have implications for efforts by Pershing Square  which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan s shares  and Valeant to call and hold a meeting of Allergan shareholders to vote in new board members 
Under Allergan s bylaws  Ackman needs 25 percent of shareholders to ask the company to call a meeting  Pershing Square has been gathering investor support and has said that it plans to submit the request in mid August 
Those bylaws also say that Allergan cannot accept a special meeting request if there is a violation of securities rules  such as insider trading 
Ackman and Valeant offered to buy Allergan on April 22 and laid out a plan for spending cuts at the company  It later launched a hostile tender offer for its shares 
Allergan has mounted a defense that includes its own cost cutting plans  and has urged shareholders not to support the meeting or the deal 

Judge David Carter in U S  District Court  Central District of California  said in the documents that he would consider Allergan s request for an expedited schedule at a hearing rather than outside of  normal procedures   as requested

ValueAct likes a potential combination between Valeant and its takeover target Allergan  but said a drawn out bidding war for the Botox maker might be too distracting 
 A year on the sidelines waiting for  Allergan  to do a scorched earth sort of defense is a huge cost to Valeant   ValueAct Chief Executive Jeff Ubben told Reuters in an interview 
ValueAct has a stake of roughly 5 7 percent in Valeant  making it the company s third largest investor  according to Thomson Reuters data as of early May 
 Mike has other targets and other things to do with his low tax rate   Ubben said  referring to Valeant Chief Executive Mike Pearson 
In an emailed statement to Reuters on Monday  a Valeant spokesman said   We agree that Valeant has very attractive stand alone prospects  
Although Valeant still believes an Allergan combination would  create extraordinary value for both sets of shareholders   the spokesman said  Valeant also  has a rich pipeline of other business development opportunities  
Allergan is fighting a hostile  52 billion bid from Valeant teamed up with billionaire investor William Ackman  The company has accused Valeant and Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared a takeover bid for the drugmaker 
 We really believe in the stand alone plan  We do not need to do the Allergan deal   Ubben said  adding that he saw Valeant stock rising to  130 to  140 within a year s time 
Shares of Valeant were down 1 5 percent at  107 51 on Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange  The shares ended New York trading at around  126 on April 21  just before the takeover bid for Allergan was unveiled

148867,370383,BHC,Pershing Square sues U S  over Fannie Mae  Freddie Mac,news,"By Jonathan Stempel and Svea Herbst Bayliss  Reuters    Pershing Square Capital Management LP  the hedge fund firm run by William Ackman  has sued the U S  government  claiming that its stripping of Fannie Mae s and Freddie Mac s profit illegally short changes investors in the mortgage companies  common stock 
In a complaint filed on Thursday with the U S  Court of Federal Claims in Washington  D C   Pershing is challenging the government s  brazen  practice since 2012 of funneling virtually all profit from Fannie  OB FNMA  and Freddie  OB FMCC  into the U S  Treasury Department s coffers 
It said this will have by next month created a  130 billion  windfall  through the  confiscation of the entire net worth  of both companies  with an eye to winding them down 
 The net worth sweeps make plaintiffs   and all of the other common shareholders    shareholders  in name only   according to the complaint  which three retirees who own Fannie Mae stock have joined as plaintiffs 
Pershing accused the government of violating the Fifth Amendment of the U S  Constitution by taking private property for public use without just compensation  It seeks damages and other remedies 
The Treasury Department declined to comment  The Federal Housing Finance Agency  which is Fannie s and Freddie s conservator  did not immediately respond to a similar request 
Pershing s lawsuit adds to public battles being waged by Ackman  including a bid with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  TO VRX  for Botox maker Allergan Inc  N AGN   and a campaign against nutrition company Herbalife Ltd  N HLF   which he calls a pyramid scheme  a characterization the company denies 
Other investors  including hedge fund firm Perry Capital LLC and Bruce Berkowitz s Fairholme Capital Management LLC  have also sued the government over Fannie and Freddie  which were bailed out in September 2008 amid mounting mortgage losses 
But those lawsuits have often focused on the companies  preferred stock  which threw off 10 percent dividends before they were eliminated in 2012 
In contrast  Ackman s lawsuit focuses on common shareholders 
Pershing disclosed last November it had invested close to a half billion dollars for common share stakes of 9 98 percent in Fannie Mae and 9 77 percent in Freddie Mac 
Both companies  shares have risen by roughly one half since the week that Ackman revealed his stakes  and Berkowitz proposed that Fairholme and other investors recapitalize both companies 
In Thursday trading  Fannie rose 14 cents to  3 99  and Freddie rose 15 cents to  3 97 
The Court of Federal Claims handles lawsuits seeking money from the government 
It is also where former American International Group Inc  N AIG  Chairman Maurice  Hank  Greenberg is suing the United States over the insurer s  182 3 billion bailout  which he said illegally diluted the AIG stake of his Starr International Co

148868,370384,BHC,Top hedge funds flocked to Allergan amid bid backed by Ackman,news,"By Svea Herbst Bayliss BOSTON  Reuters    Billionaire investor William Ackman  who often says he is flattered when others follow him into a stock he likes  was joined by several prominent hedge funds that made new bets on takeover target Allergan Inc  N AGN  during the second quarter 
Regulatory filings released on Thursday give the first comprehensive look at Allergan s redrawn shareholder map since Ackman and deal partner Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc  TO VRX  made public their pursuit of the Botox maker in late April  And while the data  released in so called 13 F filings  is backward looking and could have changed in the 45 days since the end of the quarter  investors say that it gives at least a strong flavor for what savvy investors are thinking 
Ackman s Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed a 9 7 percent stake in Allergan at the time  By the end of June  John Paulson s Paulson   Co  Jamie Dinan s York Capital Management and Andreas Halvorsen s Viking Global Investors had also bought in  according to the documents released by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission 
The filings show that several large mutual fund firms that already owned Allergan made even bigger bets during the quarter  T  Rowe Price  for example  more than doubled its position  although it did not say exactly which funds owned the shares 
Paulson s moves have been tracked closely by investors since his winning bet against the overheated U S  housing market  He has publicly supported Valeant s bid for Allergan  now worth about  49 billion  But many other shareholders have been silent and it was not clear who else had gotten in or gotten out 
In the last weeks  the fight for Allergan has become even more bitter  Proxy advisory firms are urging its shareholders to support Ackman s call for a special meeting to consider a deal 
Yet one of Valeant s top shareholders  hedge fund ValueAct Capital Management  suggested that Valeant may not be able to afford a drawn out  damaging fight 
Allergan charged in a lawsuit filed earlier this month in California that Pershing Square broke insider trading laws when setting up its partnership with Valeant  Now U S  securities regulators are asking questions about the planned takeover  a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday 
Thursday s filings show that York Capital Management bought 2 4 million shares of Allergan during the quarter  York also bought put options on Allergan  Eric Mindich s Eton Park Capital Management said it owned 901 000 shares while Viking Global Investors reported owning 803 369 shares  Viking also raised its bet on Valeant by buying an additional 2 5 million shares 
Other new owners include Farallon Capital Management  founded by Tom Steyer and now run by Andrew Spokes  which said it owned 612 500 shares  Hoplite Capital Management also opened a new position and owned 625 850 shares 
Sachem Head Capital  run by Scott Ferguson who left Ackman s firm in 2012 to open his own shop  also bought in  opening a new position with 490 000 shares  Ferguson also opened a new position in Valeant with 419 500 shares 
Investors who exited or cut their positions include Capital Research Global Investors  which ranked as Allergan s second largest shareholder at the end of the first quarter but sold out its holdings during the second quarter  Hedge fund Jennison Associates cuts its position by more than half  selling 6 2 million shares while Montag   Caldwell sold 1 3 million shares  cutting its stake by 36 percent 
The decision to buy in at that time paid off big as Allergan s stock price surged 38 percent in the second quarter 
Since then the share price has come under some pressure  The spread on the deal   or the difference between the value of the two companies  shares and the ratio implied by the deal s terms   has widened slightly to about 5 2 percent from less than 3 percent earlier this week after a key Valeant shareholder questioned the deal s logic 
Some investors have said that Allergan s share price suggests the deal may have less of a chance of getting done now  But several investors told Reuters this week they expect that Ackman will succeed in attracting enough support to call the special shareholder meeting where shareholders will get their first chance to say what they think about the deal

148900,370416,BHC,US Drug Companies Take Merger Route To Ease Headaches,news,"By    U S  drug companies have a headache 
Pressed by expiring patents on Lipitor  Viagra and other recent wonder drugs that made companies like Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE  billions of dollars and challenged by foreign competitors facing smaller tax bills  several large U S  pharmaceutical companies are eyeing non U S  acquisitions  The search for foreign acquisitions is also reflects the fact that global healthcare spending is falling as consumers and nations balk at out of control costs  

Amid those factors Pfizer last month sweetened its bid for British rival Astrazeneca  LONDON AZN  to 58 8 billion pounds   98 9 billion  following earlier rejected offers for the company  Add to that the Novartis AG  SIX NOVN  plan to swap assets with GlaxoSmithKline PLC  LONDON GSK  and a recent buying spree by Canada s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc   NYSE VRX  and you have  175 billion of proposed deals  according to CMS Pharma CEO Andrew Bardot 
And U S  drug maker Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  said Friday it s buying Chile s CFR Pharmaceuticals to double its Latin American branded generics business for just shy of  3 billion 
Speaking last month to TerrapinBriefings com  Bardot said   Pfizer is chasing the next big acquisition  Military tacticians would refer to it as  carpet bombing  as opposed to a  precise strike  
He said the purchase would bolster Pfizer s drug development pipeline and cut costs  He added that that it would also   benefit from a tax inversion  and the cherry on the cake  
Obviously Pfizer aims to cut costs in the current environment and the Financial Times calculated last month that combined tax savings and synergies with AstraZeneca could be  38 billion 
The Pfizer deal epitomizes the high cost of deals these days  and that s one caveat Bardot says may cool activity   Valuations are too high  rendering many acquisitions unpalatable  Many will have to wait until the  biotech bubble  deflates   Bardot said 
Valeant made news earlier this year when it teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman to bid for Botox maker Allergan Inc   NYSE AGN   Their cash and stock offer  which includes a nearly  15 billion cash component  an SEC filing stated  values Allergan shares at  165 to  170 a share  according to reports  Ackman s Pershing Square  a New Jersey based hedge fund with assets of about  13 billion  spent about  4 billion to acquire a 9 7 percent stake in the Irvine  Ca  based Allergan and believes the company is undervalued 
 There is a logical thread in terms of combining a product portfolio for both companies by focusing on strong brands  such as Botox  in markets where patients or doctors themselves are making the buying decision rather than cost conscious healthcare payers   Bardot told TerrapinBriefings com 
He added that Valeant and Acman know how to cut costs  He said Valeant plans to cut research and development spending at Allergan to  200 million from  1 1 billion 
Swiss company Novartis last month unveiled maybe the most interesting recent big pharma deal when it agreed to acquire GlaxoSmithKline s cancer drug business for  14 5 billion and at the same time sell Glaxo most of its vaccine business for  7 1 billion plus royalties  The Swiss company also said it was selling its animal health division to Eli Lilly and Company  NYSE LLY  for nearly  5 4 billion 
Echoing the other dealmakers Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez said when he announced the deal that    The transactions  improve our financial strength  and are expected to add to our growth rates and margins immediately   
The deal impressed Bardot  who was prompted last month to say of the company   Novartis is the ballerina in the Bolshoi  An insightfully crafted series of transactions  each in itself worth of a Harvard Case Study as to how it addresses a weakness  a strength or just factor market realities  This would be the ultimate precision strike  taking home what you need and nothing more  minimizing collateral damage  i e  transactional risks and any subsequent integration risks   limiting cash outflow  maximizing cash inflows  Masterful in every way  ",2014-05-16,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-drug-companies-take-merger-route-to-ease-headaches-284825,284825

148930,370446,BHC,Valeant Pharma And Pershing Square Pursue Botox Maker Allergan,news,"By    Hedge fund manager William Ackman s Pershing Square  which picked up a nearly 10 percent stake in Botox maker Allergan Inc  NYSE AGN on Monday  is working with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  NYSE VRX  to acquire Allergan 
The cash and stock offer  which includes a nearly  15 billion cash component according to an SEC filing  is expected to value the deal between  165 a share to  170 a share  Bloomberg reported Monday  citing a source  Ackman s Pershing Square  a New Jersey based hedge fund with assets of about  13 billion  which spent about  4 billion to acquire a 9 7 percent stake in the Irvine  Ca  based Allergan and believes the Botox treatment maker is undervalued  is pursuing the acquisition in partnership with Canadian firm Valeant  according to Bloomberg 
 We firmly believe that combining Valeant and Allergan would create an unrivaled platform for growth and value creation in health care  and we look forward to finalizing and announcing the terms of our proposal shortly   Valeant reportedly said via e mail  according to Bloomberg 
Valeant  which acquired Bausch   Lomb for  8 7 billion in August and is expanding from the generic drugs segment into the specialty drugs category by building a presence in ophthalmology  dermatology and dentistry  generated   5 76 billion in revenues in 2013  Allergan s revenues for 2013 stood at  6 2 billion  registering a 12 4 percent growth  helped by leading product Botox  revenues for which grew 12 percent to  2 billion 
 I don t think it s any secret that a combination of Valeant and Allergan would make a lot of sense   Timothy Chiang  an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC said  according to Bloomberg  adding   The question has always been  it s not whether Valeant would be interested in buying Allergan  it s a question of would Allergan sell to Valeant  

On Monday  Allergan acknowledged the reports of an acquisition but said in a statement   Allergan has had no discussions with either Valeant or Pershing Square with respect to this matter  The Company notes that neither Valeant nor Pershing Square has put forward an offer or proposal with respect to any type of merger transaction involving the Company  and the public disclosure materials filed by those entities suggest that they have expressly reserved the right to terminate their business relationship should no such offer be forthcoming  
Valeant said in its filing that Barclays PLC NYSE BCS and Royal Bank of Canada NYSE RY have agreed to assist in the transaction  While Allergan s stock jumped more than 20 percent in after hours trading on Monday  Valeant s stock soared 10 31 percent on the New York Stock Exchange ",2014-04-22,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/valeant-pharma-and-pershing-square-pursue-botox-maker-allergan-278584,278584
