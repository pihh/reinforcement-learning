188254,409770,COP,December bump in oil prices not enough to salvage energy earnings,news,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors hoping a late 2019 rise in oil prices will buoy energy stocks are likely to be disappointed when a raft of companies report results in coming weeks 
Energy stocks were among the S P 500 s worst performers over the last decade  as concerns over an oversupply of oil hurt earnings and share prices 
December saw a brief reversal  as optimism over a U S  China trade deal boosted prices for WTI crude  by 10  to over  60 a barrel  Rising oil prices helped the energy sector rise more than 6  for December  its best monthly performance since June 
Still  the sector is expected to show a 41 2  decline in earnings growth from a year earlier  according to Refinitiv data 
The relationship between energy stocks and oil prices has been weak over the last few decades  the 90 day correlation between the Select Sector Energy ETF  P XLE  and WTI crude going back to 1999 stands at 0 49  according to DataTrek Research 
Correlation is measured from minus one to plus one  minus one implies the prices of two assets are moving in opposite directions  while a 1 shows them moving in lockstep 
 History very clearly shows this industry doesn t really move with oil prices   said Nicholas Colas  co founder at DataTrek Research in New York 
Many oil companies are unlikely to fully benefit from the oil price bump because they had curtailed production  said Stewart Glickman  energy analyst at CFRA in New York 
 To the degree that they had spot exposure  yeah that will probably help  but it won t be a huge impact   he said 
In a sign of the sector s challenges  oilfield service company Halliburton  N HAL  shares are down 31 2  in the past year  The company disclosed a  2 2 billion charge when it announced earnings this month and said in its conference call that U S  gas prices remain below breakeven levels 
ExxonMobil  N XOM    Chevron   N CVX  and Phillips 66  N PSX  are to report on Friday  with ConocoPhillips  N COP  due next week 
Some analysts believe underperformance has made the sector attractively valued  The sector is  cheap on cash flow  cheap on dividend yield  it is cheap on book value   said Stephen Massocca  Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco

For oil prices to climb much higher  there would have to be a stronger global economy or a supply shock 
 For energy to outperform  typically  you need to have a global economy that is growing at a decent rate  which is not the case   said Scott Wren  senior global equity strategist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Investment Institute in St  Louis  Missouri 
 Some of the fundamentals can look pretty good but the macro fundamentals don t seem to be that great  ",2020-01-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/december-bump-in-oil-prices-not-enough-to-salvage-energy-earnings-2072247,2072247
188255,409771,COP,Day Ahead  Top 3 Things to Watch Feb  4,news,"By Kim Khan
Investing com   Here are three things that cold rock markets tomorrow 
1   Disney  Reports  Market Anxious for China Update
Dow component Walt  Disney   NYSE DIS  will report earnings after the bell tomorrow 
The company is expected to report a profit of  1 46 per share on revenue of about  20 8 billion  according to forecasts compiled by Investing com 
All things being equal  investors woul probably be most interested in more updates and numbers from the Disney  streaming service as it takes on Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and others in the hot space 
But what the company has to say about any impact it s seeing and expects from the coronavirus could take the spotlight 
Disney temporarily shut down its amusement parks in China   Shanghai Disneyland and Disneytown     to limit the spread of the disease 
Last week  Needham lowered its quarterly estimates for the company  citing lower political advertising demand at broadcasting and lower box office  offset by lower marketing spending  
Before the bell  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  will issue its numbers 
Analysts are looking for earnings of 80 cents per share and revenue of about  8 2 billion 
Energy shares were hammered last week on earnings  particularly ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   and the landscape is looking grim at the moment  with oil prices pressured by worries of Chinese demand slumping on the virus impact 
2  Factory Orders  API Inventories on Tap
The economic calendar is fairly light tomorrow 
At 10 00 AM ET  15 00 GMT   the Commerce Department will release the latest figures on factory orders 
December factory orders are expected to have risen 1 2   reversing the drop of 0 7  in November 
For energy traders  the American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of weekly U S  oil inventories 
The API snapshot serves as a guide for the official figures out Wednesday  but the two sets of numbers often diverge 
Last week API reported a drawdown of about 4 3 million barrels in crude stockpiles 
Oil entered a bear market today  down 20  from recent highs  and WTI and Brent fell below important technical levels 
3  First Voting Round for Democrats
Investors will also have politics to contend with tomorrow  with the results of the Iowa Caucuses come out tonight  the first hurdle for Democratic presidential nominee hopefuls 
If candidates like Sen  Elizabeth Warren or Sen  Bernie Sanders do well  that could weigh on equities  Both have platforms that Wall Street sees as unfriendly  to say the least 
The caucus voting in Iowa starts at 7 00 PM ET  00 00 GMT  
Late Tuesday night  President Donald Trump will give his State of the Union speech at 9 00 PM ET ",2020-02-03,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-feb-4-2074963,2074963

also in our periodic filings with the SEC  We will also refer to some non GAAP financial measures today  and reconciliations to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure can be found in this morning s press release and on our website And with that I m going to turn the call over to Ryan Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Ellen and welcome again to all our listeners  While it s certainly early in the New Year and this sector is already off to another volatile start  Volatility can certainly be tough on an industry or company  if you re not built for it  Well  we re built for it  With clear resilience to lower prices  full upside to higher prices  and a shareholder friendly framework that works through the cycles  All of our usual results and outlook details can be found in today s published materials  But we re going to keep our prepared remarks pretty short Our main goal is to reinforce why ConocoPhillips offers an attractive way to invest in a cyclical business  that s the key theme  as we reflect on 2019 and we look forward to the future  2019 capped off a successful three year period  in which we transformed our business model  and significantly improve the underlying performance drivers across our entire business  Slide 3 summarizes those 2019 results  that contributed to this transformation In the financial column  we delivered strong earnings and we generated cash from operations of  11 7 billion  delivering free cash flow of over  5 billion  Our balance sheet got stronger  We ended 2019 with over  8 billion of cash and short term investments  and lowered our asset retirement obligation by almost 30   largely due to dispositions At our Northstar  return on capital employed was 11   We delivered on our volume projections for the year  with roughly 5  underlying growth  including 22  growth from the Big 3 unconventionals  The rest of our portfolio delivered strong base performance  and we progressed new projects and exploration opportunities across our regions Our world class portfolio keeps getting better  As part of our high grading efforts  we generated over  3 billion of disposition proceeds and we have another  2 billion of announced dispositions  that we expect to close in early 2020  But we re not just selling  we re also on the lookout for opportunities to add low cost to supply resources to the portfolio  like we did last year in the Lower 48  Alaska and internationally  And when reserves closed for the year  we replaced 117  of our production organically 2019 was another outstanding year for delivering on our disciplined  shareholder friendly strategy  We returned 43  of our CFO to our shareholders  that s essentially all of our free cash flow  We paid  1 5 billion in dividends  including a 30  increase in our quarterly dividend  and we repurchased  3 5 billion of shares  In today s announcement  you saw our Board approve an increase of our existing repurchase authorization by  10 billion to a total of  25 billion  This demonstrates our commitment to executing a consistent long term buyback program Finally  our execution focus goes beyond just the numbers  We continue to take a leadership role and environmental social and governance matters  through target setting  engagement  disclosure  advocacy and stakeholder alignment  We call this performance with purpose and it s an imperative So 2019 is over and we re in the starting gates for new year and a new decade  In November  we laid out a powerful 10 year plan that can deliver on all the elements  we believe investors want from this sector  A disciplined strategy framework  consistent execution  strong free cash flow  and compelling returns of and returns on capital  That s the path we set for ourselves in 2016  That s what we delivered in 2017  2018 and 2019  and that s what we re ready to do again in 2020  We re focused on executing a strategy that we believe is right for the future of our industry and certainly right for ConocoPhillips and our investors So with that let s go to your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions   And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America  Please go ahead  your line is open Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystThank you  Good morning  everybody  I appreciate the opportunity for a lengthy Q A session  So I ve just got a couple and I will let someone else jump on  I guess first of all  there is a number of headlines that have been circulating for quite a while now around Alaska tax  and that s obviously a little different from the last time you presented this back in November  So I m just wondering if you can offer your perspectives  as to how you think  what do you think is going on there  How do you think that plays out  whether they get the signatures and what the implications could be  as to how you respond to that And my second one is really on the production outlook for 2020  Obviously the Malaysia pipeline issue appears to be back on the table again  So I m just wondering if you could walk us through the cadence of how we should expect production to evolve through the year  and I ll leave it there  Thank you Michael D  Hatfield    President  Alaska  Canada and EuropeYeah  Thanks  Doug  this is Michael  I ll answer the first question about the Alaska tax  So you asked where we are in this process  The Division of Elections in Alaska is currently certifying signatures now  They were gathered as part of the initiative for this November ballot  We anticipate that the initiative will be part of the ballot So they are in the process of certifying those now As we showed in November  we re currently planning to invest about  25 billion of capital over the next 10 years in Alaska  These investments will increase the state s production and mitigate the current decline through TAPS  In fact in 2020 alone  our net capital and opex spend in Alaska  is expected to be roughly  3 4 billion  On a gross basis in 2020  total industry capital and opex spend in Alaska is expected to be about  6 billion  Now  if there is a negative change in the fiscal regime  our investment plans will change  But we ve been in Alaska for over 40 years  We know Alaskans understand the industry  It s the lifeblood of the state s economy  We believe Alaskans will understand that short term revenue gain is a risky and fleeting proposition  if it comes at the cost of billions of dollars of investment over the coming years  We ve had ballot measure challenges over the past few years  that would have negatively impacted our business and Alaska s economy  After understanding the issues  Alaska voters that voted no on all of them Now we re part of an industry group that will provide information to voters about the benefits of the current fiscal regime  the benefits that it has on jobs  investment  oil production  and long term revenue to the state  So the bottom line is  we re working hard to ensure Alaskans understand the significant benefits  that investment by this industry brings to the people and the state of Alaska under the current fiscal structure Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystSo as things stand right now  no change in your current plans  More of a wait and see type situation Michael D  Hatfield    President  Alaska  Canada and EuropeThat s correct  So in terms of our current plans  we re waiting to see  we re executing on our current plans  but we are gearing up to help Alaskans understand our view of the benefits that the current fiscal structure brings to the state and the people Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  thank you for that  And on the production cadence Matt Fox    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah Doug  this is Matt  I can give you an update on that  So the most significant update in our production guidance  as you mentioned  was associated with the KBB production in Malaysia  As you know  most of KBBs gas is sold through the third party Sabah  Sarawak pipelines to the Malaysia LNG plant and is exported from that plant  So in normal operating conditions for 2020  we have anticipated about 20 000 barrels a day being exported through MLNG via the Sabah Sarawak pipeline  But right at the beginning of the year  there was a significant operational issue with the pipeline  So our expectation for the year  given that we don t operate    our expectation is that might not be repeated at all through the year  So that s what we are assuming at the moment Now we re hopeful we might get access to some domestic gas offtake  but the magnitude of that and how long it might last is uncertain  So that s the vast majority of the adjustment to guidance  We also had some puts and takes across the business units  We also adjusted expectation for timing of dispositions  But the new range of 12 30 to 12  Phonetic  is our best guess at the moment of what we should expect for this year  and that s about a 4  growth on an underlying basis Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  Matt  I don t want to press the topic  but are there any particular dips in the quarterly cadence  as we go through the year Matt Fox    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerWell obviously  we have turnarounds as we go into middle of the year  We have one in the first quarter in Qatar  and then we have usual turnarounds in Alaska and elsewhere  as we go through the second and third quarter  So similar profile to previous years Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  thanks everybody  Appreciate it OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI  Please go ahead  your line is open Doug Terreson    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood morning  everybody Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Doug Doug Terreson    Evercore ISI    AnalystSo Ryan  you guys are one of the few  if not the only big oil or E P with higher rather than lower normalized returns on capital in recent years  and while your stock has been a top five performer in S P Energy three years in a row for this reason in my view  Your cash position is building  its strong  You have better valuation in your equity than a lot of peers  and so you re basically better positioned than your peers for strategic activity  At the same time  you guys outlined a pretty compelling multi year investment plan in November  which I guess  that you can a attain your returns profile  even without meaningful strategic action  So my question is  with the ongoing decline in upstream values that we ve seen in public and private E P one  have strategic actions become more appealing to you guys  Are they more compelling  And what affect on return on capital employed is needed for you guys to move forward in this area  So two questions Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell thanks  Doug  Yeah  I think we believe we are on the right track with what we re doing in terms of what you describe our return profile focused on shareholder distributions  focus on free cash flow generation and hyper focused on our return on capital employed  As I said 2019 was 11   that is our guiding northstar  as we think about how we re executing the business We have built a little bit of cash on the balance sheet We believe we needed for the volatility we re experiencing in the marketplace  Just look at the month of January alone  early in the month  I think people were thinking it was headed to  70 a barrel  and now people are thinking it might be going to  40 a barrel  So that s the kind of volatility we see in this business  and we re keeping the balance sheet  so we can execute our consistent programs  pay our capital  pay    fund the dividend  pay our buybacks back to our shareholders  So we re executing that consistent program  We believe in it  and that s what we re set up to do and that s what we described everybody in November  that it s not just a one or two year plan  This was a plan that s got a lot of legs and can go on for the next decade  We have the portfolio and the people to execute on that plan Now we have been in the bolt on acquisition game  We have had some assets that I described in my opening remarks  and we keep on the lookout for some of those kinds of opportunities  But we also  I think laid out a pretty consistent framework at our Analyst Meeting in November  about how we think about those kinds of opportunities  and I think as you and others have reported  there needs to be a consolidation in this business  but there is still a pretty big gap between buyers and sellers  is what we see in the business  So we don t have to do anything  as we have got a solid plan in terms of what we are going to do  and    but we not blind to what s going around in the industry either  So we tried to lay out a pretty consistent framework of how we think about resource adds  both organically through the exploration channel conversion within our resource portfolio  and inorganically  when we think about that piece of the business as well So we are happy with where we are at  but we obviously watch everything very closely Doug Terreson    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Good message  Ryan  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead  your line is open Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning team  and thanks for taking the time today  The opening question I had is around Venezuela as well  recognizing there are sensitivities around securing the cash flow that flew into the company  how should we think about modeling that on a go forward basis  and what are the steps you are taking to ensure that the cash can be collected Don Wallette  Jr     Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNeil  this is Don  I will address that question  I think  the first thing I would say is kind of a repeat of what I have said in the last six or seven quarters  which is we have never forecasted that we d be receiving those payments because of the risk involved  and so we would never encourage anybody else to build that into their forecasts as well We did manage to receive six or seven quarterly installments from PDVSA  but as of the fourth quarter  we received no payments and so  what we have done  as a result  is that in October and November  we issued default notices to PDVSA and as of today  they have not cured the breach  and as a consequence of that  we ve resumed our legal enforcement actions  Of course  we re not the only creditor out there  it s a competitive marketplace  and so I think you will understand that I can t go into any details at all about what those enforcement actions entail  But as you saw from us in 2018  you can expect us to vigorously pursue all legal remedies that we have available to us Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAnd we appreciate that  The follow up question is just around some of the demand issues in Asia  and I was hoping  Matt  and Ryan  you could put into context how we should be thinking about some of that demand weakness in the context of other demand checks that you ve seen  And just how does it affect the way you think about your business  if at all Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And Neil  you re talking about demand for oil  as opposed to say LNG Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystBoth would be interesting actually Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBoth  yeah  So we do see some    I mean we re factoring in some demand loss in the first quarter of this year  and that translates into some reduction in demand  as we go through the course of the full year  I think our estimate is still  as we look at the markets and look at the global economies  we re still projecting something on the order of 1 million barrels a day of demand growth  as we go through 2020  Now that s probably down 100 000 barrels or 100 000 to 200 000 barrels a day because of the current issues that we re facing with coronavirus in China  So we do see some impact of that  It will flow through to the storage side of the equation  So we ll see some building storage  We believe in the U S  and in the non OPEC countries around the world as well  So that will put obviously some pressure on prices  We see inventory draws though coming later in the year  and we still see pretty good supply growth  in terms of total liquids coming out of the U S   that probably eats up most of the demand growth that we see  coming from around So it s going to be another volatile year  and that s what we ve been preaching for for the last three to four years  because it s a oil supplied world  and any small changes in demand or changes in what OPEC or others might do for the supply side  will create that volatility that we ve seen in seen in  Indecipherable  here in January as well  We do see some weakness in the spot LNG market  It has had some pretty warm winters around the world  So demand has been    demand growth  we still see over the long term in the LNG markets  but we are seeing softness in the LNG side and  of course you know that lags in terms of    how it manifests itself in our cash flows for the company  But we still    our long term belief in the growth in the LNG market and and still participating that channel of the business Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystAll right  guys  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JP Morgan  Please go ahead  your line is open Phil Gresh    JP Morgan    AnalystHi  yes  Couple of quick questions  First  just looking at the quarter in the Lower 48  we saw some declines in the oil production quarter over quarter  NGLs and gas were up  I presume that was mostly mix effects in the Big 3  with The Bakken and the Eagle Ford down  But just any thoughts you could share around that  as well as    as we look out to 2020  and your guidance for 410 000 barrels a day there  Just any color you could provide around rig count and production cadence  specifically for the Big 3  Thanks Matt Fox    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah Phil  this is Matt here  Yeah so I think you probably saw our numbers for the production individually for the Big 3  In aggregate  it was relatively flat  There was    Eagle Ford was down a little bit  just because of the timing of when we re bringing wells on  and there was growth in the Permian  and the Permian production is a bit gassier than the Eagle Ford production  So that s why there was a slight mix shift  In terms of the activity  we averaged 12 5 rigs last year across the Big 3  seven in Eagle Ford  three in Bakken  and 2 5 in the Permian  and that was    those were supported by six frac crews  You ll have seen in our capital  that as we go into 2020  its pretty much the same level of activity in aggregate to the same capital costs for the Lower 48  as last year Phil Gresh    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  great  Second question for Don  The cash flows in the quarter looked a little bit light there  I think there is an other bucket that had some headwinds  if you could just elaborate what might have been in that bucket  and just generally  how will you think about cash flow for 2020  if there any moving pieces we should think about  whether it s distributions or other things you already talked about  PDVSA  anything else we should think about  Thanks Don Wallette  Jr     Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerPhil  I can point to a few items that may help explain the the cash flow in the quarter  The way we look at it  we take our ratable guidance items along with the cash flow sensitivities that we publish  and if you do that and nothing else  you come up with an estimate of about  2 9 billion CFO  And I think a lot of analysts came in at a number of similar to that  whereas our actual results were about  2 7 billion So to start  LNG realizations were about  100 million lower than what our sensitivities would have predicted  because we don t incorporate the three month lag to Brent pricing  Brent was up about  1 quarter on quarter  but JCC fell  5  and so that s what s causing that impact  In addition to that  our adjustable controllable costs for the year came in at  6 14 billion versus our guidance of  6 1 billion  so that s  40 million or about  0 03 a share on that  And that came through the SG A  And the items on    and you will have noticed that SG A was up quarter on quarter  and what drove that increase  was basically two things  about equally split  the mark to market on compensation  because of the good quarter that the stock enjoyed in the fourth quarter  And the other was due to an accrual that was made  related to employee based incentive compensation So those are the kind of the unusual items  and we also made a pension contribution to the U S  qualified plan  that was probably about  50 million higher than what our typical quarterly run rate was  And so I think if you look at those items and even though we don t    which I d encourage people not to include the PDVSA  90 million payment  and we know that some do  and so that may have been a contributing factor for some folks As far as 2020  I think we ve been pretty clear about what our distribution plans are   3 billion of buybacks  nothing has changed on that  Our dividend rate is what our dividend rate is  until we consider adjusting it probably toward the end of the year  so that won t have much impact  As far as CFO  you ve got some new sensitivities that have been updated for 2020 in the appendix of the materials that we published today  and I would say  as far as a benchmark and expectation on CFO at say current prices  around  50 WTI  we would expect about  8 5 billion to  9 billion of CFO Phil Gresh    JP Morgan    AnalystOkay  great  That s very helpful  Just one clarification  With the proceeds from distributions  the  2 billion  I assume that s gross  Is there a net amount that you might have for that  Thanks Don Wallette  Jr     Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI don t know that I can provide you a net on that  I know our Australia headline    Australia West headline number there is about  1 4 billion  and we would expect cash proceeds to be about  1 1 billion  based on our expectation of closing at the end of this quarter  And then Niobrara  the proceeds on that are going to be close to  400 million  about  380 million  But I haven t seen the estimates on cash on that  but I would expect it would be close to the proceeds  And then the remainder are just smaller assets that will do to round off to the  2 billion OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo  Please go ahead  your line is open Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystThank you and good morning and I think that was probably the shortest management introduction I ve been on a call  in at least the last several years  So congrats on that  Couple of questions to follow up on  one on Neil s question about the demand issues in Asia and maybe more specifically on LNG there  There have been some reports that some of the buyers in China made it clear  force majeure  and that s kind of a just in time market  so I get that  If they re not getting offtake  they re going to run into other issues  So I was curious direct exposure to China as you think about it  And then the second question on the LNG front  just an update on where we are with the Qatar expansion and everything W  L   Bill  Bullock  Jr     President  Asia Pacific   Middle EastHi Roger  it s Bill Bullock  I ll take this one  First  we ve heard similar concerns raised in the market about force majeure into Asia  But to date  we haven t had any force majeure declarations  So we are continuing to watch the market and see if we do  we ll be addressing those with spot sales or domestic sales in the market and managing appropriately  So nothing to date  but we have heard similar concerns With respect to Qatar  we continue to be very interested in Qatar  We continue to believe we re well placed  Qatar is a great location  with    serves the global market with low cost by resources  and is a strategic location that works well for both Europe and Asia  We are still in the process  That process is being managed by Qatar Petroleum and they are in control of that pace  We re moving along at pace as they provide  Really can t say any more on that at this time  What I can say  is that we re very hopeful if the opportunity is going to be a competitive cost of supply addition to our portfolio  and as we laid out in November  it needs to be a competitive cost of supply to be an attractive addition  So that s kind of where we re at for Qatar Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystThanks  Just a quick follow up  is there any reason to think anything material has changed in the projects  since kind of late last summer  when it picked up and certainly the Analyst Day in November W  L   Bill  Bullock  Jr     President  Asia Pacific   Middle EastNo  No QP continues to manage a very good project Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystGreat  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays  Please go ahead  your line is open Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning everyone  My first question is on ROCE  the 11   very strong for 2019  The 10 year plan calls for a 1  to 2  improvement per year  assuming you re  50 WTI with some inflation  So ROC about 16  in 2025  So in terms of what is contributing to this improvement  can you talk about the ROCE of the incremental production adds relative to what you re achieving today  So perhaps any color you may have on the absolute ROC of the Big 3  or may be some future Alaska projects or any other conventional projects Don Wallette  Jr     Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes Jeanine  this is Don  I will address the ROCE question  So yes  at the Analyst Day in November  we showed ROCE growing between 1  and 2  over the 10 year period  and that s being driven primarily by production growth  because we re working at  50 WTI real  So there is a little bit of contribution there  But the other thing that I would point to  is our capital efficiency  Our DD A is actually a very flat  while our production is going up  So I would point to those two being the primary drivers behind the improvement Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystOkay  thank you  That s very helpful  And my second question is on Alaska  and I think exploration  In the event that Alaska activity is either slowed or pushed further the right for either regulatory reasons or otherwise  can you talk about what other opportunities may move into the activity queue as a result  And I m guessing  these are mainly exploration activities  because we assume that the Big 3 in the Montney  all of those are already optimized for your 10 year plan Matt Fox    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerJeanine  are you referring to what we would do in Alaska or what we would do elsewhere in the globe Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystElsewhere in the globe Matt Fox    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  So this year  about half of our exploration capital is going into Alaska and half is going elsewhere  So the primary areas outside are Norway exploration program that we discussed and Michael discussed that at the November Analyst Day  We also have an exploration program going on in Malaysia  in the shallow water shelf of Sarawak  And we have exploration activity going on in Argentina  both in the south of the country and in the Vaca Muerta  Those are the primary new explorations activity outside of Alaska Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you very much Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would add Jeanine  that we set an allocation for exploration  and if we don t have the opportunities to compete for the cost of supply that we said  we d bring down that allocation  But today  we re spending  spending the  300 million on exploration that we ve allocated to that channel Jeanine Wai    Barclays    AnalystPerfect  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank  Please go ahead  your line is open Paul Cheng    Scotia Howard Weil    AnalystHi  good morning guys  I think first question maybe is for Matt  Matt in Permian  the fourth quarter we see a big jump sequentially  Should we look at it as just the normal lumpiness because of the well coming on stream  or that this is signaling a beginning of a accelerating development pace and that we should assume the growth starting in this year will be accelerating comparing to the last couple of years Matt Fox    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  thanks Paul  Yeah  we did have very strong growth quarter on quarter in the Permian  It was about 23  growth  But that is  as you sort of implied  there is real lumpiness  as we bring on new pads there  So we actually expect Permian to be relatively flat in the first quarter  and then growth will resume again through the rest of the year  We had an unusually lumpy fourth quarter production Paul Cheng    Scotia Howard Weil    AnalystMatt  when that you think Permian would take on a more accelerated growth  and when that you think you will have sufficient of the    delineation and the infrastructure in place for that to happen Matt Fox    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  So what we aid out in November was  we were running at about 2 5 rig pace  We will build over the next few years to about six rigs running in the Permian  but that will be a sort measured growth rate  as we get there  confidence the    much like we did in the Eagle Ford and Bakken and we re doing in the Montney  and make sure that we re    with the right spacing and stacking and completion design  So we re still in a bit of a learning mode there and we ll ramp up the rigs to be optimum  over the next two  three years So is there a significant growth coming in the Permian  but its    it will be    our pace is consistent with the pace of which we re learning and they have to optimize the completion and spacing and stacking Paul Cheng    Scotia Howard Weil    AnalystThank you  Matt  The second question is for I think Ryan  Ryan  over the last 12 months  the ESG all of a sudden become a far more active topics among investors  even the for the North American investor  And we are    also over the two or three years  we have seen some of the international integrated oil companies  Indecipherable  off that and move outside on making a lot of the investment  and those aren t into oil and gas for the transitioning of the low carbon fuel    are transitioning on low carbon  we are transitioning  From a ConocoPhillips standpoint  I mean  how you guys look at that and say that with the transitioning in the low carbon world  are you going to essentially stick to what you guys are doing in the oil and gas  or that you will be evaluating other opportunity set to supplement that Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Paul  I guess  right now we re focused on the E P business  that s the kind of company we are and that s what we re doing  We have a strong record on ESG in terms of transparency  how we think about that piece  how we manage the transition  We re focused on eliminating emissions from our operations  We ve done that    over 7 million tons over the last number of years  We re the only E P company I believe  that has an emissions target that is out there for business  So we re focused on doing that  When we get the external recognition for our climate stance  how we think about our Climate Action Report  how we think about our sustainability report and how we describe that    what we re doing in our business to make it a more sustainable Oil and Gas business So yeah  we re focused on being a low cost of supply and really taking care of our own business in terms of our emission footprint and what we re doing in our activities to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions  flaring fugitive emissions  methane  all the above  That s what we re about  that s what we re trying to do  and that s how we re managing this aspect of the company OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor Pickering Holt  Please go ahead  your line is open Jeoffrey Lambujon    Tudor Pickering Holt    AnalystGood morning  Thanks for taking my questions  My first one is on Alaska from an op standpoint  As you continue helping to inform voters on the potential ramifications of the ballot measure  can you just give us a reminder of what operations over 2020 will focus on in Alaska  And then any color on learnings from ongoing appraisal  will be helpful as well Michael D  Hatfield    President  Alaska  Canada and EuropeYeah  so as far as our base operations  we ve got a big operation that we continue to execute  both the Kuparuk and at Alpine  As Matt mentioned  we ve got some smaller turnarounds that we ve got to execute this year  We ve also got the ERD rig that s going to be starting up in the second quarter in Alpine  So we ve got a lot    and we ve got a lot of drilling that s going on Now in addition  you asked about our exploration program  and we re in the middle of that now  So we ve got four wells that we re going to drill at Willow  four appraisal wells and one flow test that we ll conduct  We spudded our first well at Willow at the end of January  So that s going on now  In addition  we re going to drill three exploration wells at Harpoon and we expect to spud the first well toward the end of February  So we ll be running two rigs between the Willow and Harpoon programs Now in addition  we have our Narwhal opportunity that we spoke to you about in November  where we had drilled the production well and we had tested that well and floated back through our central facilities  we produced up to 4 500 barrels a day from that production well and then that well was shut in  as we monitor the pressure buildup  Since that time  we ve also drilled an injection well that reached TD in early December  We flowed that well back to clean it up just recently  and we re quite encouraged with those results  In fact  our peak flowback was around 2 500 barrels a day  That well is now being prepared for an injection interference test  with the producer that I mentioned we previously drilled  So we re going to do an injection test and interference test  to see how those two wells are talking to each other  and that information is going to help us a lot  as we optimize future development planning  So we re quite encouraged with the results that we ve seen in Narwhal So in short  we ve got a big program that we re executing across our assets in Alaska  including at the non op asset in Prudhoe Bay Jeoffrey Lambujon    Tudor Pickering Holt    AnalystGreat  thank you for the detail on that  My second question just a follow up to the discussion on how you all look at inorganic ads and the potential for those to come into the portfolio mix  As you look at potential opportunities  compare them to the existing asset base  what would you say are the disconnects between what you think could fit and what clearly doesn t  Are you seeing quality packages with just different parameters on valuation  Is there a lack of availability of assets in areas where you look to potentially add exposure  And then lastly  are there any key differences between the domestic and international A D markets as you guys look at the landscape today  Thanks Matt Fox    Executive Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerHi Jeoff  I think I ll take that  This is Matt  You saw that last year we    on the inorganic front  we did about  300 million of inorganic additions in the Lower 48  Alaska  and internationally  The    and Ryan alluded to this a bit earlier  we have sort of very clear guidelines we hope and certainly clear internally  as to what it would take in order to make an organic addition to the portfolio attractive  and we ll say that has to have an all in cost of supply  including the acquisition cost of below  50 a barrel  and it has to have a development cost of below  40 a barrel  to compete for capital  So we ve been very clear on that  The criteria that we have to achieve  the same criteria for larger scale corporate activity  and for exploration program and for resource conversion within the portfolio So as we look around the portfolio  we can see some potential for incremental bolt ons  much like we did last year  but we re not at the stage of consummating any of those at the moment  But there  there are still opportunities out there that could be attractive additions to the portfolio  as we go through time  as long as they meet those two criteria that I mentioned a minute ago OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC  Please go ahead  your line is open Scott Hanold    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThanks  I think this one is for Don  can you discuss with the KBB pipeline down  how does that if the impact the financials  I mean what    on a relative basis  how does that generate cash flow relative to say  Conoco as a whole Don Wallette  Jr     Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Scott  for 2020 and as Matt said  we re not counting on the resumption of that Sabah Sarawak gas pipeline  So the financial impact that we re estimating is about  90 million of cash flow and about  60 million on net income  and that s OK    and that s built into the sensitivities in our    that we published this morning Scott Hanold    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  I appreciate that color  And turning really quickly back to Alaska again  how has the process or the progress gone with evaluating a sell down in 2020 on that asset  considering obviously the propositions that are out there  Do you find it s going to be a little bit more challenging in front of    you know the November ballot to get something done Don Wallette  Jr     Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Scott  So I ll take you back just for a second to November  at the Analyst Meeting when we provided our preliminary 2020 capital and production outlooks  and at that point we reflected that we would retain our current ownership level through this year so through 2020  And at this point  we only plan to sell down after the uncertainty related to the citizens initiative has been resolved  and after we fully interpreted the results of our 2020 exploration and appraisal program  and when we progress through Willow  through the concept select gate  So after we ve satisfied those three criteria  that s when we plan to execute this sell down  So that pushes the sell down most likely well into in the next year  We won t execute a sell down in a way that causes us to lose control of the investment pace  We re already confident that there is multiple quality parties that are interested in these great assets  We would be open to an equal value strategic transaction or a swap  rather than cash if that makes sense  So that s where we are in the process  We re going to resolve some of these uncertainties and then we ll approach the market Scott Hanold    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  very clear  Thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from Joe Allman from Baird  Please go ahead  your line is open Joseph Allman    Robert W  Baird    AnalystThank you  On Libya is    with the situation in Libya now  is production basically zero at this point  and do you have any thoughts on the outlook  And I know you don t guide for production in Libya  but what are you assuming in terms of your cash flow  What production level are you assuming for your cash flow guidance Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So you re right  we don t guide for production in Libya  Our guidance is excluding Libya right now  because of the disruptions associated with this conflict  Our Libya project company and the Libya National Oil Company have declared force majeure  and so we re just in the process of tapering down our production  We are not quite at zero now  but we expect to be fairly soon  So our hope is that these parties can resolve this conflict  then we can restart operations soon  But right now  we re tapering down toward not producing Joseph Allman    Robert W  Baird    AnalystIn terms of your cash flow guidance for this year  are you assuming that Libya is offline for an extended period  or are you assuming kind of flattish production from the fourth quarter level Ryan M  Lance    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we re assuming that it will just be offline then Joseph Allman    Robert W  Baird    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  And on the defined benefit contribution  my understanding is that it was around  100 million in the fourth quarter and that you re guiding for about  100 million each quarter through 2020  So beyond 2020  should we assume the same kind of quarterly contribution  or is this just kind of like a five quarter catch up  And could you talk about sort of the cash impact Don Wallette  Jr     Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Joe  this is Don  Let me  let me address that  So in the fourth quarter  our contribution to the U S  plan  was I believe close to  80 million  We probably rounded it up to  100 million  but we plan to continue contributions at that pace for the next three quarters  So quarter one  two and three in 2020  and so what s occurring here is  that we ve implemented a liability management strategy  that s intended to derisk the pension liability over time  So the contributions that we make this year  are going to allow us to shift more of our assets from equities and to fixed income  and that s how we re going to be derisking the plan  and hopefully reduce contributions as we go forward So after the third quarter  you should expect that our contributions will reduce significantly  and then hopefully  depending on asset performance and interest rates continue to be quite small  as we go into 2021 and beyond Joseph Allman    Robert W  Baird    AnalystOkay  that s very helpful  Thank you OperatorThank you  We have no further questions at this time  I would like to turn the call back over to Ellen Ellen DeSanctis

188275,409791,COP,Drilling ban proposals divide Democrats in U S  oil states,news,"By Valerie Volcovici CARLSBAD  New Mexico  Reuters    In the southeast corner of New Mexico  new houses  hotels and jobs are sprouting like flowers in the desert  Trucks hauling equipment and laborers jam once barren highways on the way to thousands of oil rigs  The Democrats who control the state s government have lofty plans for the billions of dollars in projected tax revenues from the drilling industry in the Permian Basin  the world s biggest oil field  starting with an overhaul of New Mexico s ailing public education system  The biggest threat to those plans  however  may be the presidential candidates from their own party  The top 10 Democratic contenders have called for ending new drilling leases on federal lands  Two front runners  Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders  go much further with calls to ban hydraulic fracturing   the technology driving the Permian oil boom   on both federal and private land   Such policies face resistance in western states with vibrant drilling industries  including New Mexico and Colorado  where Democrats also control both the governor s office and the legislature  That could open up a rift within the party and an inroad into such states for Republican President Donald Trump   the nation s chief fossil fuel booster   in 2020 election   Without the energy effort in this state  no one gets to make education the top priority   New Mexico Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham told the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association conference in Santa Fe on October 8   If Trump loses next year s election  she said in an interview  she would request the Democratic president provide her state a waiver exempting it from any drilling ban  to allow us to continue to produce in New Mexico   Nationwide  states received some  9 billion from public lands leases last year  with much of it going to their education systems  according to Department of Interior data  New Mexico was the top recipient with  2 4 billion   an amount that doubled its 2017 revenues  Colorado brought in about  500 million  Conor Cahill  press secretary for Colorado s Democratic Governor Jared Polis  did not comment on Democratic candidates  proposals to limit drilling  saying only that the governor looks forward to a  robust debate  about the issue  Democrats hope their tough anti drilling stances will help them win their party s nomination by attracting progressive voters in state primary elections  But such rhetoric represents a risk in the general election against Trump  About two thirds of Americans want  aggressive  action to combat climate change   but only if it doesn t hit their pocketbooks  according to a recent Reuters Ipsos poll    The campaigns of Democratic front runners Joe Biden  Elizabeth Warren  Bernie Sanders  Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg  did not comment when asked how they would weigh the concerns of western states against their promises to ban or limit drilling  They have all said they can soften the economic impact of fossil fuel cutbacks with government programs to retrain workers for clean energy jobs   BRIGHT SPOT  Carlsbad is a hub of the New Mexico oil boom   a  bright spot  in one of America s poorest states  said Carlsbad s economic development chief John Waters  On the fringe of the Chihuahuan Desert  the fast growing city of about 28 000 people has become the regional headquarters for oil majors such as ConocoPhillips  N COP  and home to the busiest regional office of the U S  Bureau of Land Management  About two thirds of New Mexico s drilling takes place on federally controlled land   Last September  a lease sale in the area broke BLM records  generating nearly  1 billion  Meanwhile  BLM officials in Carlsbad have struggled to keep up with drilling permit applications  The bureau received 2 444 last year and approved 1 388  Sarah Cottrell Propst  the state s top energy official  said she expected the boom would last for years if there s no drilling ban   The industry is making huge investments in the Permian Basin   she said  Oil revenues have helped repair an education system after years of underfunding  Last year  a district court ruled New Mexico had violated its constitution by failing to provide students a  uniform statewide system of free public schools sufficient for their education   More than  1 billion of the state s  2 4 billion in oil and gas revenue goes to public schools  according to the nonprofit New Mexico Tax Research Institute  Expecting another windfall this year  state lawmakers approved a 16  increase in school spending to  3 3 billion  to pay for a longer school year  higher teacher salaries  and increased support for low income districts   Governor Lujan Grisham also announced plans for a scholarship program  funded largely by oil and gas revenues  that would make the state s colleges free for anyone with a 2 5 grade point average   an estimated 55 000 students  Jessica Sanders  a science teacher in Rio Rancho  sees the impact in her classroom  which until the recent improvement in funding lacked basics such as enough writing implements  projectors and computers for students   When people talk about shutting down the oil and gas industry  I don t think people are seeing how that will affect me and my students   she said  WHOSE SIDE  Some in New Mexico worry that the environmental consequences of the oil boom outweigh the benefits    The companies say   We are giving you all the money   Well  I m sorry  that doesn t matter when you are poisoned   said Stephanie Harmon  a Carlsbad resident who works as the chaplain for a retirement home  Recent reports by environmental groups including the Clean Air Task Force and Earthworks  both of which oppose fossil fuels development  found air pollutants around drilling sites  including from flared or vented methane   have contributed to respiratory illness   The Environmental Defense Fund  another environmental group  estimates New Mexico s oil and gas sites release more than a million tons per year of methane  the climate equivalent of 22 coal fired power plants  It is a trend repeating itself in other drilling states like North Dakota and Colorado  The Lujan Grisham administration says it can be both an oil producing state and environmental steward  She said the state was investing to diversify its economy away from oil and was seeking to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement by cutting overall emissions by 45  by 2030 from 2005 levels  Her administration is also working on regulations to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry   The data we are looking at today strongly suggests we can clean up 80  of the methane problem   Lujan Grisham said  Her support for both drilling and cutting carbon emissions  however  has put her in a complex position among her constituents  During her speech at the Santa Fe oil conference in October  she told industry representatives that the state s regulators  work for you   while outside  more than two dozen protesters chanted  Whose side are you on   One of them  21 year old college student Ruby Lopez  said Lujan Grisham s free college program would only prolong the state s dependence on fossil fuels   We should not be beholden to oil and gas for our education   she said  Democrats swept New Mexico in the 2018 mid term elections  winning control of the governorship  the state legislature and the congressional delegation  The state has not supported a Republican presidential candidate since 2004  Trump sees an opening to change that in 2020 because of Democrats  climate rhetoric  During a rally in New Mexico in September  he vowed to win the state and told his crowd that Democrats want to  annihilate  the New Mexico economy with their anti fossil fuels proposals  Trump has also said he is targeting Colorado  Political analysts say a Trump victory in New Mexico is unlikely  But Lujan Grisham s predicament  they say  reflects the dangers Democratic presidential hopefuls face nationally in balancing environmental and economic

188277,409793,COP,Conoco Plans Share Buyback That s Almost 50  of Market Value,news," Bloomberg     ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  announced a 10 year plan to buy back  30 billion of shares  equivalent to about half of its current market capitalization  as the oil producer attempts to distance itself from the troubled U S  shale industry 
The company also said it will pay dividends of about  20 billion over the period and limit average capital expenditure to about 10  above current levels 
Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance told investors and analysts at a presentation in Houston on Tuesday that the long term plan sets the company apart from its peers amid a fight to regain the interest of shareholders in U S  oil and gas  one of the worst performing sectors this year 
 The industry faces a flight of sponsorship by investors   Lance said during the presentation  There s a  struggle for relevance unless the industry can create value on sustained basis  
After being forced into a painful dividend cut during the 2014 2016 oil price crash  the third largest U S  oil producer has regrouped under Lance and has built a reputation of being one of the more dependable producers  differentiating itself from other shale operators that have disappointed on production and earnings  Energy stocks have shrunk to less than 5  of the S P 500 Index  less than half the level a decade ago  after shale producers burned through nearly  200 billion of cash in pursuit of surging flows of oil and gas 
With investors focused on returns rather than output expansion  Conoco is busy morphing into a low growth but high cash generating company that s built to withstand low crude prices and peak oil demand  which the International Energy Agency says could happen around 2030 
Conoco s plan  shows sustainability over a long period  and a business model  that can deliver competitive returns and appeal to a wide range of investors   Scott Hanold  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC  said in a note 
Conoco was 1 1  higher at  57 31 at 11 44 a m  in New York trading  The stock has dropped 8 1  this year  while the Standard and Poor s 500 Energy Index has advanced 1 6  
Investors have delivered stinging rebukes to energy companies this year for paying substantial premiums for acquisitions  such as Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY   s  37 billion deal for Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   Chief Operating Officer Matt Fox admitted that the  elephant in the room  is the possibility Conoco will use its cash hoard for a major deal 
 Obviously we can t and we shouldn t rule that out  but we can rule out doing a bad acquisition driven by the wrong reasons   Fox said during the presentation   We re not going to do something that undermines our financial framework  
Conoco also has conventional production in Alaska  Europe and Asia  while also operating in shale basins  Though Conoco aims to avoid the pitfalls of rival shale producers  the sector will provide much of the company s growth and account for about 60  of its capital expenditure over the next decade  Its shale production from the Permian Basin  Eagle Ford  Bakken and Montney in Canada will more than double to 900 000 barrels a day by 2029 
Conoco said it will stick with about 20 drill rigs and won t try to chase higher production in times of high crude prices  which tends to destroy shareholder capital  Fox said 
 Unfortunately  we know this because we did it   he said

188278,409794,COP,Explainer  Australian minnow Far battles Woodside over West African oil spoils,news,"By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE  Reuters    A long running dispute between two Australian partners in an oil field off Senegal is set to be resolved this month  just as the companies look to sign off on a  4 2 billion plan to develop the West African nation s first oil project 
Oil minnow Far Ltd has been mired in a bitter row over the acquisition by Woodside Petroleum of a 35  stake in the Sangomar oil field from ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  for  350 million in 2016 
Far went to the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris in June 2017 seeking arbitration to resolve the dispute  A ruling is due by Dec  28 
WHAT S AT STAKE 
For Woodside the Sangomar project  formerly known as SNE  is key to boosting its output from 2023  ahead of two mega projects in Australia 
For minority partner Far  which discovered the field in the largest oil find of 2014  the development is set to be a company maker 
Far contends it was not allowed to exercise its right to pre empt the sale of Conoco s stake in the joint venture  If it had  Far would have been able to increase its 15  stake for what was considered a relatively cheap price  Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman has called the claim  frivolous  
WHAT COULD HAPPEN 
In the worst case for Woodside  the arbitrator would find that Far had a pre emptive right and Woodside would need to sell all or part of its Sangomar stake to Far 
Analysts see a selldown as highly unlikely given Woodside is deeply involved in the project and has a key role as operator 
Even if the arbitration did clear the way for Far to buy Woodside s stake  the minnow  with a market capitalization of A 289 million   196 million   would be hard pressed to stump up the cash for the stake 
If Far wins  analysts say the mostly likely outcome would be some form of compensation  That could include a cash payout from Conoco or Woodside  some agreement by Woodside to help fund Far s share of the capital cost of the project  or a combination of those 
WILL THIS AFFECT THE PROJECT 
The Sangomar partners  including Cairn Energy and the Senegalese state oil company  submitted plans to the government on Monday to proceed with the project  paving the way for final investment decisions later this month 
Resolution of the dispute should help clear the way for the minority partners to line up project finance by giving lenders more certainty about Woodside s role in Sangomar  say analysts 
Far s share of the capital cost of the project is estimated at  480 million  It has lined up a  350 million debt facility with Macquarie Bank and is looking to put in place a second debt facility 
WHAT IF FAR LOSES 
If the arbitration finds that Far had no pre emptive rights  then it would be status quo for the partners 
Far s share price has dropped by nearly a third this year amid speculation it will have to sell new shares to fund its share of the project 
Filing of the development plan boosted its shares as much as 3 3  on Tuesday  while the energy index was down 1 5  
Far declined to comment ahead of the ruling  Woodside had no immediate comment  Conoco declined to comment on the arbitration ",2019-12-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/explainer-australian-minnow-far-battles-woodside-over-west-african-oil-spoils-2032208,2032208

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  6 17   A quarter ago  it was expected that this energy company would post earnings of  0 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 82  delivering a surprise of 5 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times 
ConocoPhillips  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  posted revenues of  8 14 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 98   This compares to year ago revenues of  10 36 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ConocoPhillips shares have lost about 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 6  
What s Next for ConocoPhillips 
While ConocoPhillips has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ConocoPhillips was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

188317,409833,COP,Retirees Should Know These 3 Facts About Required Minimum Distributions   February 06  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
In addition to these considerations  it is essential to take into account the RMD that applies to most retirement accounts  Basically  this is an IRS requirement that you withdraw a certain amount from your qualified retirement accounts once you reach age 72 
Why does the IRS require you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
What types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When does it become necessary to begin taking distributions  Your first distribution must be taken by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you turn 72  for most accounts   Also  if you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year after the calendar year in which you retire 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the amount  Ann is 71 and will take her first RMD in the year following the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance at the end of the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is how much Ann is required to withdraw for her first RMD

188318,409834,COP,Is Exxon Mobil s Dividend Safe After Cash Burn ,opinion,"As momentum gathers behind the seismic shift that s promising to radically transform energy markets  it s become crucial to closely evaluate the long term viability of investing in big oil stocks  such as  Exxon Mobil   NYSE XOM  
Betting on top oil stocks has never been without risks  The biggest challenge investors face when evaluating energy stocks is correctly predicting the direction of oil markets  This  of course  is an almost impossible task given the extremely volatile nature of the commodity 
Even if you re a long term energy bull  picking the right stock from among the energy  supermajors  has become more complicated given the uncertain  long term  demand supply outlook in the context of the ever increasing use of renewables  electric cars and the global push to curb climate change 
The performance of Exxon Mobil shares reflects this challenging operating environment for oil giants  The stock has fallen 11  this year when the S P 500 has delivered 3  returns  During the past five years  the performance of this once most valuable firm on earth has been more disappointing  Its shares plunged 34  during that period  while the S P 500 surged about 60   They closed yesterday s session down 1 4  at  61 88 
Given this dismal performance  it s important to ask this question  will Exxon Mobil be able to provide dividend growth which is the only plausible reason for investors to buy this stock in this environment 
Exxon has been a generous dividend payer  hiking its shareholder payout every year for the past 37 years  With its 5 5  annual dividend yield the most since the mid 1990 s Exxon stock has become one of the highest yielding blue chip stocks on the S P 500 
Negative Headwinds
But the company s recent financial performance is raising concerns about its ability to fund its dividend payments  In the fourth quarter  Exxon s cash from operations failed to cover capital expenditures and it was the fifth quarter in a row in which the company relied on asset sales or borrowing to cover its dividend payments 
As the future of Big Oil becomes uncertain  some of the world s largest research firms are becoming more open in advising investors to stay away from these stocks 
Morgan Stanley said in a note this week that Exxon is  most exposed  to negative headwinds in the industry  including oversupply in oil  natural gas and liquefied natural gas  Goldman Sachs  at the same time  downgraded Exxon to  sell  and slashed its price target to  59 from  72 
 We do not see a compelling case to own XOM relative to other energy stocks with more attractive returns profile   Goldman analyst Neil Mehta wrote 
One big reason that investors have started to stay away from Exxon stock is the company s quite radical approach to creating value  At a time when other oil firms are focusing on strengthening their cash positions by avoiding large ticket investments  Exxon is spending big on new initiatives 
Despite bleak oil demand forecasts  Exxon CEO Darren Woods believes the oil and gas industry needs trillions of dollars of fresh investment to meet global demand for energy products by 2040  With this in mind  Exxon is investing in low cost mega projects that will help maintain the company s dominance in oil and natural gas markets for decades 
That approach  though not investor friendly  is showing some success  Exxon s output from the Permian Basin has gained 79  since 2018  And the company has discovered more than 8 billion barrels of oil in Guyana   a find that led Rystad Energy to name Exxon its explorer of the year in both 2018 and 2019 
 We believe strongly that investing in the trough of this cycle has some real advantages   Woods told analysts during a conference call last week   We have a very healthy balance sheet  which was built for times like this  
In the short term  however  this impressive growth plan has been a major drag on the company s shares and stability of its dividends  In November  Moody s Investors Service lowered Exxon s outlook on its top notch debt to negative due to a  substantial  cash burn to fund growth 
 The company s high level of growth capital investments cannot be funded with operating cash flow and asset sales at projected levels given Exxon Mobil s substantial dividend payout   according to Moody s 
Bottom Line
At a time when other integrated producers such as  Chevron   NYSE CVX     ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  are returning more cash to investors and energy markets  long term outlook remains weak  Exxon stock doesn t look like a winning preposition  despite its attractive dividend yield  In addition  the company s heavy investment outlay makes it a more risky bet among the oil stocks ",2020-02-07,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-exxon-mobils-dividend-safe-after-cashburn-200505560,200505560

188342,409858,COP,New Colorado environmental law stalls oil investment,news,By Laila Kearney and David French  Reuters    New environmental regulations in Colorado have chilled investment in the state s oil and gas fields as companies grapple with how local officials will respond to a law giving them more power to restrict energy production  Colorado now ranks fifth among U S  states in oil production at about 500 000 barrels per day  bpd   up from just 90 000 barrels in 2010  That boom  however  has come just as state politics has shifted to the left with an influx of urbanites who tend to oppose fossil fuel development   The Colorado law is one sign of pushback to the oil boom in the United States  which last year became the world s leading producer  overtaking Saudi Arabia   New Mexico  the state ranked third in production volume  has also sought to rein in energy development with new rules targeting emissions from hydraulic fracturing  California  another top producer  is considering legislation that would sharply curb oil drilling  Many states have opposed Trump administration efforts to expand offshore drilling near their coastlines  and environmentalists nationally have blocked or slowed new pipelines with protests and lawsuits  Colorado is  ground zero for a combination of oil and gas production  environmental stewardship and urban sprawl housing development   said Jack Hamlin  a board member for the Rocky Mountain Pipeliners Club  which is made up of about 3 000 energy industry workers in the region  All three interest groups  he said  are  fighting for the same space     Graphic  Oil production and population growth grow in Colorado link     Colorado s new law will allow counties and municipalities to make rules governing the distance oil wells can be from homes and schools and to regulate drilling impacts such as noise  traffic and pollution   Previously  local officials relied on the state and federal governments to regulate energy  The resulting uncertainty over how local authorities will use their newfound power has nearly halted energy deal activity  including acreage purchases  There were only five land transactions of negligible value in the Denver Julesburg Basin in the nine months ended Mar  31  down from nine deals worth  2 billion in the same period of 2016 17  according to consultancy Drillinginfo  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  tried to sell its Colorado acreage for more than  1 billion late last year but failed to find a buyer  according to three sources familiar with the deal  Conoco Phillips declined to comment  Adams County in northeast Colorado  where drillers produced 3 6 million barrels of oil last year  has already launched an effort to examine  health and safety and welfare  from the local energy industry  The county  will need to look at air and water quality  preventing explosions and accidents  spills and truck traffic   said Steve O Dorisio  a commissioner for Adams County  northeast of Denver  DODGED BULLET While some oil firms are fretting over the new law  others are relieved that another  more restrictive ballot initiative failed to pass in November   That proposal would have effectively put most of the state s land off limits for oil production by imposing bigger buffer zones between energy development and most occupied buildings  Companies engaged in Colorado energy production expressed a range of opinions about whether and how much the new law would impact their businesses  Hamlin  a Colorado native who owns an energy engineering company  opened a Wyoming office to guard against an exodus of energy companies from Colorado  More than 90 percent of his business has been done outside of the state in the months before and after the legislation s passage  he said  Oil firms  have no idea what impact it s going to have   Hamlin said of the law   Businesses  they just don t invest in uncertainty   Extraction Oil   Gas Inc plans to remove acreage in Boulder County from its inventory of anticipated drilling sites because of the regulatory uncertainty  said acting CEO Matthew Owens on the firm s first quarter earnings call  Owens stressed  however  that the firm could keep up its drilling pace by tapping fields in three other Colorado counties  SRC Energy  a Denver based oil producer that produces about 45 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  offered cautious optimism in its first quarter earnings call  While the firm  does not support all parts of the bill   and acknowledges regulatory risks  the company plans to move forward with current operations  said Chairman and Chief Executive Lynn Peterson   Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  and Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY  are currently competing to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   which holds more than 400 000 acres in Colorado  Executives from both firms have said they do not expect the new law to pose an obstacle   We have no worries about what s happening in Colorado   Vicki Hollub  Occidental s chief executive  said on an analyst call announcing her firm s bid for Anadarko  Notably  Weld County  which produced more than 157 million barrels in 2018   more than every other Colorado county  combined   said it would not adopt stricter rules  But that doesn t bar municipalities in the county from creating their own regulations  UNCERTAIN PATH AHEAD The next steps for the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission  the state oil regulator  involve amending its own rules to align with the increased focus on health and safety required in the new law  That process  which producers fear could curtail their drilling  should be completed by July 2020  said Chris Arend  a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Natural Resources  The commission will also be amending criteria for flagging permit applications for additional review when they raise specific concerns  such as a location near a school or a flood plain   The process will be applied to the 6 400 energy permit applications now in the pipeline as of February  many of which were filed by companies rushing to get ahead of the expected tightening of regulations  That compares with 2 600 pending permits in the same month the previous year  Cities and counties have no set timeline for enacting new rules that might curb drilling  Some  such as Adams County  slapped a temporary moratorium on new permits while they decide what to do  Broomfield  a city northwest of Denver  will likely vote on its own moratorium later this month  said Broomfield City Councilman Kevin Kreeger   Colorado Oil and Gas Association President Dan Haley called the new law  the beginning  not the end  of a new process for regulating the industry

188345,409861,COP,Australia s Gas Industry Faces Climate Test Despite Election Win,news," Bloomberg     Australia s gas industry is in a relative sweet spot  Its ideally placed to serve Chinese buyers avoiding tariff laden U S  LNG and the surprise re election of its center right government means producers face less immediate pressure to cut emissions 
None of that alleviates growing investor scrutiny over the sector s contribution to climate change  Industry leaders who meet Monday at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association conference are sure to debate domestic gas prices and a supply glut  but activists and executives agree how companies tackle climate change is perhaps the most urgent topic 
 While the election outcome will reshape the domestic carbon policy agenda  the industry and technology dynamics which investors are responding to remain unchanged   said Emma Herd  Chief Executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change   Investors continue to engage with the oil and gas industry to understand how they are positioning for a net zero emissions global economy  
While the nation s coal industry garners most of the public s attention  other fossil fuels are also under pressure for their contribution to climate change  The theme for the four day event in Brisbane   Navigating the Future  couldn t be more apt for the world s largest liquefied natural gas exporter by capacity 
APPEA s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Andrew McConville  the host of the conference  said the country s energy industry must work harder to engage with climate groups 
 We have to do more  Whether we agree with these views or not  they are the views that these particular groups hold on climate change   he said in a phone interview   For us as an industry  their perception is our reality  So we need to understand that and work to try and address the concerns  
The industry group has come under criticism in the past from activist groups 
The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility earlier this year sought to file climate resolutions at the annual meetings of Woodside Petroleum Ltd  and Santos Ltd   one of which asked them to review their membership of industry lobby groups  including APPEA  who it said  have sought to obstruct climate policy for more than a decade   The resolutions weren t accepted by either company 
How Australia s energy producers pursue growth amid a global effort to transition to a less carbon intensive economy will play a key role in investor perception of how companies are tackling climate change 
The country s gas industry is gearing up for its next phase of expansion  with final investment decisions from Woodside on its Scarborough project and a joint venture including ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Santos on the Barossa development both due in 2020 
Herd  who s group represents some of the nation s biggest pension funds with total funds under management of more than A 2 trillion   1 4 trillion   said energy companies tend to focus on technology solutions to mitigating pollution caused by their activities  however   Investment in R D needs to significantly scale up if technology is genuinely going to be part of the solution  
Conference chatter is also likely to focus on the price of domestic gas  The development of three LNG terminals in Queensland in the past decade means that local manufacturers now compete with the export market for gas supply  pushing prices higher  Terminal owners including Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc and Origin Energy Ltd  are under pressure to offer gas to domestic users at better rates amid calls for more government regulation 
The industry sees boosting supplies as the best answer to the problem  Santos  Narrabri project in New South Wales is often held up as the touchstone and if approved  the company estimates it could supply up to 50  of the state s gas needs  However  it has been delayed by a strong anti fracking protest movement and government approvals 
 At the end of the day we all want the same thing   said McConville   We all want a low cost  low carbon  stable  secure energy future  The reality is we are going to need to transition to that and we think we can play an important role  ",2019-05-27,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/australias-gas-industry-faces-climate-test-despite-election-win-1879351,1879351

188375,409891,COP,Here s Why You Should Hold ConocoPhillips In Your Portfolio ,opinion,ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   is well poised for growth on the back of production possibilities and strong financial flexibilities  However  rising operating costs continue to be a concern Headquartered in Houston  TX  ConocoPhillips is primarily involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas  Considering proved reserves and production  the company is the largest explorer and producer in the world Let s take a closer look at the factors that substantiate its Zacks Rank  3  Hold  What s Favoring the Stock The bulk of acres that ConocoPhillips holds in the three big unconventional plays   namely Eagle Ford shale  Delaware basin and Bakken shale   is rich in oil  The company is planning to spend almost  4 billion per annum on the shale plays and operate around 20 rigs across four major fields  This is expected to ramp up production from the regions from more than 400 000 barrels a day to more than 900 000 barrels by the end of the next decade From the three unconventional plays  ConocoPhillips projects a compound annual production growth rate of more than 25  from 2017 through 2019  Notably  significant existing opportunities for ConocoPhillips in the Eagle Ford shale  wherein it owns about 3 400 undrilled locations  could lend the company an access to almost 2 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves  Notably  it has a humongous resource base of around 15 billion barrels of oil equivalent  which has a supply cost of less than  40 per barrel ConocoPhillips   which had recorded  16 3 billion and  7 3 billion in free cash flow  FCF  in 2017 and 2018  respectively   expects to generate around  50 billion FCF during the 2020 2029 time period  It assumes WTI Crude price at  50 per barrel during this period  Notably  the company generated  6 billion FCF in the first three quarters of 2019  with WTI Crude price averaging  57 04 per barrel The upstream companies are under pressure from investors  who are no longer supporting drilling programs and expansions in the absence of strong cash flows  Investors want explorers to reduce costs  improve internal efficiencies  raise share repurchases and increase returns  As such  ConocoPhillips  target of paying dividends of  20 billion and making  30 billion of share repurchases over the coming decade can cheer investors The company s balance sheet is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to  At the end of third quarter 2019  the company had a debt to capitalization ratio of 30   lower than the industry average of 35 6   Currently  it has nearly  7 2 billion in cash and cash equivalents  Importantly  in 2018  ConocoPhillips had managed to reduce debt burden to reach its target of roughly  15 billion  much earlier than planned Hurdles in Growth PathConocoPhillips  expectation for higher production costs and operating expenses is likely to hurt profits  For 2019  the firm projects total production and operating expenses of  5 4 billion  indicating an increase from  5 2 billion in 2018  Production and operating expenses rose to  4 020 million in the first three quarters of 2019 from  3 851 million in the comparable year ago period  Also  exploration costs rose to  592 million in the first nine months of 2019 from  267 million recorded in the corresponding period last year For fourth quarter 2019  ConocoPhillips projects production in the range of 1 265 1 305 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBoe d   suggesting a reduction in sequential volumes from 1 366 MBoe d  The lower production volumes will result in reduced profit levels Crude price volatility amid low energy demand outlook is concerning  With oil contributing 52  to the company s production mix  weakness in commodity prices is likely to hurt the explorer s bottom line in the coming quarters To Sum UpDespite significant prospects  ConocoPhillips  increasing costs and oil price volatility are concerning  Nevertheless  we believe that systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long term growth Which Way are Estimates Headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 earnings per share is  3 63  which witnessed three upward estimate revisions and one revision in the opposite direction in the past 60 days Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked

188395,409911,COP,Political stumbles  savvy activists knock Canada s oil sector to its knees,news,"By Rod Nickel and Julie Gordon WINNIPEG  Manitoba VANCOUVER  Reuters    A decade ago  Canada s oil sector was growing so fast it was predicted to become a global energy superpower  but a series of political missteps and formidable environmental activism has created a dysfunctional system requiring OPEC style government intervention to move its oil to market   Canada produces 4 9 million barrels per day  bpd   more than any country other than the United States  Saudi Arabia and Russia  but the world s fourth largest producer has had to nationalize a pipeline and the province of Alberta is exploring buying trains to handle a glut of oil sitting in storage   Canada s crisis coincides with big producers taking market share away from OPEC members  mostly clustered in the Middle East  Global oil demand is expected to surpass 100 million bpd in 2019  The United States has driven exports to record highs on growing demand from China  India and other developing countries   But Ottawa has failed under two governments to effectively counter the strategy of environmental activists to attack the oil sector s heart by choking its arteries   pipelines  Roughly 35 million barrels  twice the normal amount  of Western Canadian crude used to produce diesel  gasoline and jet fuel is stuck in storage  The energy sector accounts for nearly 11 percent of Canada s gross domestic product  However  Canadian oil trades at a fraction of global prices  costing the economy C 80 million per day  the Alberta provincial government said  Alberta took the unusual step this month of temporarily curtailing 325 000 bpd starting in January   in the aftermath of a retreat from the oil sands by global companies including ConocoPhillips  N COP  and Statoil ASA  OL STL    It s become dire now because the writing is clearly on the wall  The issue is market access   said Jihad Traya  manager of energy advisory service HSB Solomon  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s government  facing an election next year  offered the oilpatch this week C 1 6 billion in aid  In May  Ottawa agreed to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline in hopes of pushing through an expansion to nearly triple capacity as other proposed lines languished  POLITICIANS AND ACTIVISTS In 2006  then Prime Minister Stephen Harper boasted Canada would soon become an  energy superpower   Canada was producing 2 6 million bpd  which moved smoothly to U S  refineries through pipelines  Since then  production has nearly doubled  but pipeline growth has stalled  Both Conservative Harper and Liberal Trudeau squelched opportunities to complete pipelines just as opposition to more lines multiplied  Two projects were killed  and legal setbacks have stymied the development of TransCanada Corp s  TO TRP  Keystone XL and the government owned Trans Mountain expansion   A year after taking office in 2015 Trudeau proposed a bargain aimed at satisfying both environmentalists and the oil industry   a national carbon pricing plan to reduce Canada s emissions while approving pipeline expansions   The strategy has inflamed both sides   When a court overturned Ottawa s approval of the expansion of Trans Mountain in August  the deal was off and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley yanked support for Trudeau s carbon plan just hours later   Indigenous and environmental opposition to pipelines has forced Trudeau to push for tighter regulations on future pipelines  The changes are necessary to  depoliticize  the system  Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said   We need to fix the broken system that we have now so we are able to build the pipeline capacity that is so necessary   But Trudeau has already shelved Enbridge s Northern Gateway proposal  which would have run through northern Alberta to the Pacific coast  and the National Energy Board in 2017 toughened its review of TransCanada s Energy East pipeline while it was underway   Both projects are now dead  Alberta is seeking to buy rail cars to reduce the glut  and earlier this month  the province ordered producers to cut output after its oil fell to a discount of  52 per barrel from U S  oil in October  Notley told reporters on Tuesday that people in Alberta can make profits from oil and gas   but they need Ottawa to take the handcuffs off  We need rail  We need long term support for getting that pipeline built   ENVIRONMENTAL OPPOSITION Alberta s oil sands  a mixture of sand  water  clay and thick  heavy oil  became a compelling target for environmentalists as production expanded dramatically in the early 2000s  The mining process scrapes away trees and vegetation across huge tracts of land  leaving a path of destruction captured in aerial images  while a different production method using steam consumes huge amounts of natural gas   Clayton Thomas Muller  an indigenous activist  said environmentalists grew frustrated trying to stop the industry s expansion through the Alberta Energy Regulator  but found a new strategy of opposing the pipelines  They built wider coalitions  tapping into anger of Nebraska ranchers and drawing the attention of Hollywood celebrities such as director James Cameron  Opponents of TransCanada s Keystone XL began protests at the White House in 2011  seeking arrest and attention  Then U S  President Barack Obama finally rejected the project in 2015   Full credit to climate change advocates  they kicked the snot out of Corporate Canada   said Tim Powers  a Conservative political strategist  He said Canadian resource companies have been too focused on the regulatory process  while climate change advocates  laid out a better  more compelling narrative  to win public opinion   FEARING CONSULTATION U S  President Donald Trump resurrected Keystone XL in 2017  But both KXL and Trans Mountain remain in regulatory limbo after courts ruled in recent months that the U S  and Canadian governments failed to properly do their jobs  The cases that overturned approvals for Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain led companies to question investment in Canada  The end result is a Canadian oil patch in retreat   My main fear is that other nations will continue to produce at market price and Canada will be left behind   said Duncan Au  chief executive of CWC Energy Services Corp  The well drilling company has cut about 70 employees  or nearly 10 percent  since the beginning of 2018

188396,409912,COP,Here s What to Expect From Oil in 2019,news," Bloomberg     Oil had a tumultuous 2018  with prices rising to a four year high in October before plunging more than  30 in the following months  Oversupply and demand worries are high on the concern list for the industry  making volatility a buzzword this year as well 
There are other power dynamics at play  OPEC s Viennese waltz in early December was a perfect example of a shift  with Russia brokering a deal to curb output and sharing the reins with traditional leader Saudi Arabia  President Donald Trump s tweets demanding lower oil prices and U S  shale producers pumping out unprecedented volumes of crude  threaten to undo all of OPEC and Russia s years long work 
There are  major uncertainties  and forecasting trends in 2019 is  even more hazardous than usual   said Neil Atkinson  head of oil markets at the International Energy Agency  Geopolitical uncertainty is a serious risk to the industry  according to Ryan Lance  chief executive officer of ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   Still  there is likely to be a lack of  shock and awe  in OPEC policy  which could temper volatility  said Greg Sharenow  a portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co 
So  what will be the state of oil in 2019  Executives  money managers and analysts weigh in 
Ryan Lance  CEO of ConoccoPhillips
 We expect oil markets to remain volatile  in part driven by flexible North American shale production that can ramp up and down quickly in response to changes in investment levels 
In order to thrive in this environment  given the short cycle nature of shale  we believe it s necessary to run an exploration and production business for sustained through cycle financial returns  which is necessary for attracting investors back to the sector  Ours must offer investors both resilience to lower prices and participation in higher prices  and we re doing that via an approach that rations capital across a low cost of supply portfolio  competes on per share versus absolute growth  and pays out a significant portion of cash from the business to shareholders 
From the resource and production standpoints  North American shale continues to be a bright spot in the global energy industry  Shale has transformed the industry and will enable the U S  to stay positioned as the world s No  1 producer of both liquids and natural gas  We believe shale can drive the industry s growth for many years 
Among the most serious near term risks we see to the energy industry are geopolitical uncertainty and factors that could reduce global economic growth and energy demand  
Greg Sharenow  portfolio manager  Pimco
 There will be a stark change from the past four years for commodity investors  as one big driver of balance and prices will be notably diminished  Specifically  OPEC has moved from competing for market share in 2014 and contributing to materially lower prices to then reversing course two years later  dropping output sharply and contributing to rising prices  But 2019  in many respects  might be notable for the lack of shock and awe OPEC policy as it shifts to an approach of limiting any surplus or deficit  This has some meaningful implications for markets and expected realized volatility 
OPEC s decision should lead to a gradual stabilization of Brent prices and  dare one say  a return to a lower volatility environment  That said  there are known unknowns that could upend the best laid plans  such as

Whether the U S  is able to continue to exceed production expectations 
Whether the slowdown in the global economy devolves into something worse  or if policy makers can help change the trajectory 
And how effective additional U S  pressure on buyers of Iran crude will be  with the current set of waivers set to expire late in the second quarter of 2019  conveniently just after the next OPEC meeting  

In addition  at the end of 2019  the International Maritime Organization is set to restrict sulfur content in marine fuels  offering additional potential support to lighter  lower sulfur crude oils such as Brent  Currently  we see these risks as roughly balanced around our baseline and quite manageable for OPEC  
David Lebovitz  VP and global market strategist  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM 
 Will we see more responsible behavior from producers in shale as we go into 2019  It does seem like they are becoming more disciplined in how they pump  how they invest and so the chances of a supply glut like we saw a few years back are not our base case 
Obviously what happens to OPEC  and the decision by Qatar to remove itself from OPEC and focus more on natural gas  is an interesting smoke signal that perhaps not all is alive and well  and you could perhaps see more fragmentation  It just feels like there is a bit of divergence in interests among that group  And my guess  given the state of politics globally  this is a situation or backdrop that could deteriorate going forward 
So in a world where hopefully the U S  has some pumping discipline and OPEC isn t as effective in curbing production as they have been  all eyes will be back on the U S  as we make the transition 
It will require a psychological adjustment on the part of both consumers and policy makers  Because as we ve seen  when the oil patch comes under pressure  employment comes under pressure and investment spending comes under pressure  So while we are still a consumption driven economy with 70 percent of GDP coming from the consumer  we need to be sensitive that an increasing number of consumers have a more direct tie to the oil industry than previously  
Neil Atkinson  IEA s head of oil markets
 Forecasting trends in the oil market for the new year looks to be even more hazardous than usual  There is a long list of uncertainties on the demand and supply side of the balance 
As the new year progresses  the implementation in 2020 of new marine fuel regulations by the International Maritime Organization will draw closer  We will learn whether the shipping and refining industries are prepared for this major regulatory change without serious disruption to the fuel market 
For supply  there are many complicating factors  the recent agreement by OPEC countries and 10 non OPEC producers to cut oil production will  if it is successful  help to re balance an oil market that was becoming over supplied  We will see what the U S  decides with respect to the second round of waivers for Iran s oil customers  Will we see a significant further decline in production from Venezuela  Will Libya manage to maintain production or will it fall victim to more regular interruptions 
These are major uncertainties  What the IEA hopes is that the market is able to operate in 2019 without the very high volatility we saw in 2018  It was not good for consumers to see oil prices above  85 a barrel as we did in early October  But nor is it good for producers for prices to fall to  55 a barrel as this will inhibit investment in much needed new production capacity  ",2019-01-02,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/heres-what-to-expect-fromoil-in-2019-1735632,1735632

188400,409916,COP,Oil Companies To Remain A Force Despite Low Prices  Renewable Energy Threats,opinion,"Oil and gas companies are posting their third quarter earnings this week and next  So far  the results are varied despite dismal market sentiment on demand growth and generally low oil prices 
 

BP  NYSE BP  posted  2 3 billion in profits  beating expectations from analysts by  0 3 billion  Still  net profit dropped by 41  this quarter  which was enough to push shares down by 3 8   The main reasons BP cited for the decline were lower oil prices  maintenance and  weather impacts   







On the other hand  Total  NYSE TOT  posted  3 02 billion in profits this quarter  which is an increase from its Q2 profits of  2 9 billion  As well  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  reported  3 1 billion in earnings  a significant rise from the  1 6 billion posted in Q2 
The message here is that low oil prices are not an excuse for poor earnings  In fact  many companies were able to increase their profit on their downstream refining operations  which are  in fact  aided by lower oil prices  Even when oil prices are low  earnings will not necessarily be bad for the big international oil firms 
 

Earnings are forecast to be bleak for many U S  shale oil drillers  but if they manage to overshoot analyst projections  the damage to share prices may be limited   
 
 

The prospects for oil companies in the longer term are likely better than the current trend indicates  At an investment conference in Riyadh  the outgoing U S  energy secretary Rick Perry explained that batteries are the Holy Grail of  this whole energy thing  and it is imperative to find a way to store energy for long periods of time in commercial ways  

Admitting something rarely heard from the political scene  Perry essentially said that battery technology for example  used in electric vehicles or proposed as storage for wind and solar power is not yet advanced enough to effectively replace hydrocarbon fuels  
While this sentiment is not popular at a finance and technology conference  it indicates that international bureaucrats know deep down that there is no immediate future for renewable energy to replace oil and gas 
The move to non carbon energies is predicated on the ability to improve battery technology  especially capacity and storage  Because this is such a big if  and we don t know when or how it may come about  oil  gas and even coal  to some extent  could remain an essential part of transportation and power generation for longer than the current models predict ",2019-10-31,"Ellen R.

188401,409917,COP,Oil Market Outlook  Demand Expectations Remain Under Pressure,opinion,"The corporate and economic calendars are looking a little bit light for the week ahead now that the the big releases such as the U S  and Eurozone GDP reports and China s manufacturing PMI are behind us  They brought little support for the oil market  showing a further slowdown in the developed economies and a blip higher in the Chinese manufacturing sector for smaller  and medium sized companies 
The corporate and economic calendars are looking a little bit light for the week ahead now that the the big releases such as the U S  and Eurozone GDP reports and China s manufacturing PMI are behind us  They brought little support for the oil market  showing a further slowdown in the developed economies and a blip higher in the Chinese manufacturing sector for smaller  and medium sized companies 

In the week ahead  China s export data for October will provide an insight into the toll taken by the unresolved trade conflict with the U S  In September  exports stood at  14 4 billion  China s Services PMI on Tuesday will also be of interest  not in terms of direct demand for crude oil  as the services sector is not a major user  but as an indicator of how well China s white collar sector is doing and the implications of future consumer demand in China 
In contrast  Germany s and the Eurozone s Manufacturing PMI data on Tuesday are not expected to bring any good news for oil demand as both continue to struggle  weighed down by slowing local GDP growth and contracting exports 




Similarly  on the corporate front most of the big news is now out of the way after BP  NYSE BP   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  all reported lower earnings for the quarter  directly linked to weaker oil prices  In the week ahead there will be a sprinkling of results mainly from smaller U S  producers including  Marathon Oil   NYSE MRO  and  Devon Energy   NYSE DVN  
Trade talks will need a new date Now that violent anti government protests have forced Chile to cancel the APEC summit  the U S  and China will have to look for a new date and place to continue their trade discussions  Before the cancellation  the U S  Administration had nearly finished putting together the paperwork for a partial trade agreement and President Donald Trump as good as committed to sign it at the summit  The Administration will now have to look for a different venue to continue the process  Look out for news of where and when  as well as for details on which part of the contentious trade talks have been agreed  In the current climate of slowing Chinese economic growth  progress   any progress   on the trade talks will be interpreted as a future boost to Chinese oil demand  




COUNTRY UPDATE   NIGERIA
OPEC has been unwittingly keeping and exceeding its output cut targets over the last month because of disruptions in Saudi Arabia  but one of the countries that has been consistently lax with sticking to the targets has been Nigeria  OPEC has recently pulled the country back into the fold by raising its OPEC target  but the West African nation continued to pump above its target  However a recent change in legislation could unwittingly do more for the country s compliance than any government commitment  Nigeria has just introduced a new bill increasing taxes on the oil industry which makes inward investment in deepwater production less cost effective and could lead to a 20  decline in deepwater output over the next five years 

In the week ahead  China s export data for October will provide an insight into the toll taken by the unresolved trade conflict with the U S  In September  exports stood at  14 4 billion  China s Services PMI on Tuesday will also be of interest  not in terms of direct demand for crude oil  as the services sector is not a major user  but as an indicator of how well China s white collar sector is doing and the implications of future consumer demand in China 
In contrast  Germany s and the Eurozone s Manufacturing PMI data on Tuesday are not expected to bring any good news for oil demand as both continue to struggle  weighed down by slowing local GDP growth and contracting exports 




Similarly  on the corporate front most of the big news is now out of the way after BP  NYSE BP   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  and ConocoPhillips NYSE COP   NYSE COP  all reported lower earnings for the quarter  directly linked to weaker oil prices  In the week ahead there will be a sprinkling of results mainly from smaller U S  producers including  Marathon Oil   NYSE MRO  and  Devon Energy   NYSE DVN  
Trade talks will need a new date Now that violent anti government protests have forced Chile to cancel the APEC summit  the U S  and China will have to look for a new date and place to continue their trade discussions  Before the cancellation  the U S  Administration had nearly finished putting together the paperwork for a partial trade agreement and President Donald Trump as good as committed to sign it at the summit  The Administration will now have to look for a different venue to continue the process  Look out for news of where and when  as well as for details on which part of the contentious trade talks have been agreed  In the current climate of slowing Chinese economic growth  progress   any progress   on the trade talks will be interpreted as a future boost to Chinese oil demand

188412,409928,COP,PDVSA in talks over second sea borne oil transfer operation  sources,news,"By Marianna Parraga  Reuters    Venezuela s state run oil firm PDVSA  PDVSA UL  has begun talks with shipping firms to set up a second ship to ship  STS  operation off the country s eastern coast in an effort to increase sagging crude exports  according to three people familiar with the matter  PDVSA this year began sea borne oil transfers off its western coast  mainly to move crude and fuel oil to Asia  after its ports clogged with tankers waiting to load and its Caribbean terminals faced seizure  PDVSA s STS activity has expanded recently  but not enough to expedite operations at its main oil port of Jose  according to Refinitiv Eikon data   The country s crude exports fell 21 percent to an average 1 126 million barrels per day  bpd  between January and October  according to Refinitiv Eikon data  At the end of the first half  PDVSA s contractual obligations totaled 2 19 million bpd   PDVSA has not yet chosen a firm to handle the new STS operation  Among the companies being considered is a unit of Dubai based Stalco Shipping Co  according to one of the people  PDVSA declined to comment  and Stalco did not respond to a request for comment   Certified captains and mooring masters are being recruited for the project   one person familiar with the matter said  TWO AT A TIME  The new STS operation would be installed near La Borracha island  about 16 kilometers  10 miles  off Puerto la Cruz  one of Venezuela s main coastal cities  one of the sources said   PDVSA plans to use some of its larger vessels  including Suezmaxes and very large crude carriers as mother ships  to build the operation  Up to two tankers could simultaneously load oil through this system  according to the sources  Sea borne transfers are risky to tankers and the environment  require additional insurance  equipment and specially trained crew and masters to oversee the exchanges  PDVSA has sought approval to conduct the transfers from INEA  Venezuela s water authority  one of the people familiar with the matter said   But it was unclear if authorities have given PDVSA permission to conduct the operations in an ecologically sensitive area  at Mochima National Park   Venezuela s Ecosocialism ministry did not respond to a request for comment   Most PDVSA owned tankers used for exports have been anchored in Venezuelan waters since U S  producer ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  moved to seize Caribbean export assets last spring to enforce a  2 billion arbitration ruling  It reached a payment agreement this fall  but the seizure risk remains as other creditors could employ a similar strategy  PDVSA also was forced to close one of three docks at its Jose terminal for almost 90 days following a tanker collision in August  complicating its efforts to increase crude exports   The idea is to change as many contracts as possible to FOB  free on board    one of the people said  requiring product to be delivered at the seller s port and buyers to make logistical arrangements

188413,409929,COP,Big Oil digs North Sea s  final frontier ,news,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla LONDON  Reuters     Little hope of THIS rock ever producing oil    BP   LON BP  geologist Bill Senior scribbled in 1977 on a note assessing a recent oil discovery in a distant corner of the North Sea  That same rock is today the heart of BP s prized Clair field in the West of Shetland region  which this week started its second phase of production  The giant bridge linked Clair Ridge platforms are among the projects that have given new life to this area of the North Sea  one of the oldest offshore basins  which was once predicted to run dry by the 2020s   Consultancy Wood Mackenzie predicts West of Shetland will be the only North Sea zone with growing output between now and 2025   With its deep waters  waves as high as 40 meters  brutal gales and thick fog  West of Shetland is hugely inhospitable   The contrast between today s confidence and the scepticism of the 1970s is a result of big technological leaps  such as 3D seismic imaging and super computers  and better drilling equipment that opened up new areas and gave a clearer picture of the rock lying miles under the water  BP  like rivals such as Shell  LON RDSa   France s Total and Norway s Equinor  plans to invest billions in West of Shetland projects while scaling back in the mature areas of the North Sea   Forty years after its discovery  BP says Clair  which first produced oil in 2005  has another 40 years of production in it  thanks to its vast resources  The huge oil and gas deposits in the region mean that as expensive as projects are  they can still compete with those in other basins around the world like the U S  onshore shale development  which require a much smaller initial investment and are much less complex  The Oil and Gas Authority  Britain s industry regulator  estimates the region held 1 3 billion barrels of oil and gas equivalent in recoverable reserves as of the end of last year    Graphic  West of Shetlands     MASSIVE ACCUMULATION  Clair is a massive oil accumulation with over 7 billion barrels of oil in place  That s why we see Clair Ridge being out there for 40 years   BP s head of North Sea Ariel Flores told Reuters   We will learn and continue to push the limits to what we believe is economically recoverable   he added  Clair Ridge is expected to produce 120 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at its peak and will involve drilling several new wells   BP is today planning the third phase  Clair South  and with its partners   Royal Dutch Shell   Chevron   NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP    will decide on whether to go ahead with the project in 2019 or 2020  Flores said  Elsewhere  new reserves continue to be discovered in the region  Total announced in September a major new discovery in the Glendronach area  which it estimates holds one trillion cubic feet of gas    We re only just scratching the surface of some of the gas plays and some of the other oil plays in the region   said Phil Kirk  chief executive of private equity backed Chrysaor  His company holds a stake in BP s 130 000 bpd Schiehallion field in West of Shetland and one of the world s largest floating production  storage and offloading  FPSO  vessels  Shell and BP are also developing the Alligin field which will involve linking two wells to the Glen Lyon FPSO  which will lower the project s costs  Equinor is expected to develop the Rosebank field  which it acquired from Chevron earlier this year and is estimated to cost  6 billion  according to Wood Mackenzie  The Norwegian oil and gas firm is aiming to simplify the field s plans in order to reduce its costs  but that will probably lead to a delay in the start of development into 2020 at least  a source involved in the project said  Private equity backed Siccar Point drilled a test well at the Cambo field this summer in the area  and is expected to decide next year on its development together with its partner Shell    The West of Shetland is vital to the future of the UK oil and gas industry   Wood Mackenzie analyst Kevin Swann told Reuters  With many fields in other regions facing closures in the coming years  we expect projects in the West of Shetland to account for more than 70 percent of total UK development spend in the mid 2020s   he added  The region is also under explored compared to other parts of the North Sea  with only 160 exploration wells drilled so far    Graphic  West of Shetlands fields     NEW WAYS Clair Ridge is a reminder however of lax practices seen in the oil and gas industry earlier in the decade  when oil prices soared and project costs ballooned with them  The project was approved for development in 2001 with a budget of  4 5 billion  Its final cost reached  4 9 billion and production started years later than planned   The collapse in oil prices in 2014 forced companies to slash costs and simplify projects in order to survive in a world where a barrel of oil traded at  40  compared to today s prices of around  62 a barrel   The North Sea  and West of Shetland in particular  has learnt to adapt better than other regions  Flores said   While Clair Ridge required a hugely complex construction process  the next phase  Clair South  will involve simpler and lighter designs  cheaper equipment requiring fewer crane lifts and technology including subsea robots that will radically reduce costs  he said   In a sign of confidence in Clair  BP increased its share in the field in July to 45 1 percent in a swap deal with ConocoPhillips  from around 29 percent  The region could get a further boost if programs such as Hurricane Energy s Lancaster project  which targets fractured basement rock formations  open up deeper  untapped layers of rock

188424,409940,COP,PDVSA Prepares to Make  949 Million Payment on Citgo Backed Bond,news," Bloomberg     Petroleos de Venezuela SA s plan to make a  949 million bond payment would mark a rare exception for Nicolas Maduro s regime as it tries to hold on to the crown jewel of its U S  assets 
Venezuela s state run oil company is preparing to make the coupon and partial principal repayment that s due Oct  29 on the 2020 notes  according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter  The socialist state is behind on almost  7 billion in debt payments owed to investors  but this bond is backed by a majority stake in Citgo Holding Inc   meaning a non payment would allow holders to lay claim to that asset 
The payment has been anticipated by investors  The  2 5 billion of notes traded as high as 92 75 cents on the dollar this week  far above most Venezuelan bonds  which hover near 25 cents  Analysts from JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    Torino Capital and Eurasia Group have also said the Maduro government would pay because of its desire to hold on to Citgo  although there are doubts about how much longer PDVSA can service the debt 
 The government s strategy with regards to various creditor obligations seems to be to avoid or delay paying wherever possible but pay or settle when valuable external assets are in jeopardy   Risa Grais Targow  a senior analyst at Eurasia Group  wrote in a note Monday   There are limits to this strategy  as the government still faces meaningful cashflow constraints owing to declining cash generating oil exports  
Calls and emails seeking comment from PDVSA s vice president of finance  Iris Medina Fernandez  weren t returned  A representative for Venezuela s oil ministry declined to comment  The person with knowledge of the situation asked not to be named because the matter is private 
Even with the payment  Citgo s fate remains in flux  The 2020 notes fell by the most in nearly two months on Wednesday amid a broader sell off across risky assets  Here are some of the other hurdles that Venezuela needs to navigate to maintain ownership of the company 

Citgo Petroleum and its parent Citgo Holding have more than  3 billion of their own debt outstanding  At least some of that might need to be repaid if the company changes ownership through a foreclosure or a sale 
PDVSA pledged a 49 9 percent stake in Citgo Holding as collateral for loans it received from Rosneft in 2016  If it defaults on those loans  the Russian state controlled oil company could seek to seize the shares 
A small Canadian mining company  Crystallex International Corp   was awarded the right to collect on an arbitration award by taking shares of PDV Holding  the U S  parent of Citgo Holding   a verdict Venezuela is appealing 
PDVSA is due to pay  500 million to ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  in November as the first installment of a  2 billion settlement the two companies reached this summer  If it misses the payment  Conoco could seek to attach PDVSA assets  including Citgo 
Separately  an  8 billion bondholder group advised by Guggenheim Securities has said it s  exploring options  to ensure that the nation s overseas assets are available to satisfy its claims 

So far  PDVSA has shown it is determined to hold on to Citgo  even as U S  sanctions prevent the refiner from distributing dividends back to Venezuela  Citgo plays a key role in facilitating the export of Venezuelan crude    the country s main source of foreign exchange    and also provides Venezuela with much needed refined products 
 It is not about the value of the equity  which may not be much   said Richard Cooper  a partner at law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen   Hamilton LLC  who has advised holders of Venezuela s debt   Citgo remains an incredibly important asset for PDVSA  ",2018-10-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/pdvsa-prepares-to-make-949-million-payment-on-citgobacked-bond-1658248,1658248

188430,409946,COP,PDVSA Bewilders Bond Analysts by Making  949 Million Payment,news," Bloomberg     Venezuela just forked over almost  1 billion to stay current on a bond backed by shares of its U S  refiner Citgo 
The question is why 
Yes  the payment ensures that Venezuela s state run oil company PDVSA gets to hold onto Citgo Holding Inc  for now  but many analysts think it s just a matter of time before it has to forfeit the company 
 It is hard to visualize a scenario in which Venezuela does not sooner or later lose Citgo to one of its defaulted creditors   Francisco Rodriguez  chief economist at brokerage Torino Capital  wrote in a note on Monday 
With Venezuela starved for cash and already in default on many of its foreign bonds  the line of creditors that could lay their hands on Citgo is very  very long  Russia  from collateral for loans from state run Rosneft   Canadian miner Crystallex International Corp  and U S  oil giant ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   both of which won international arbitration cases against Venezuela   Citgo s own bondholders  from collateral on debt   and the PDVSA bondholders who were paid Monday 
Given this backdrop  most analysts have struggled to come up with a clear cut explanation for why the payment was made  Here are a handful of the most plausible theories that they put forward 

Citgo s strategic value for the Venezuelan government is so great that the payment may be worth it even if the company will be lost to creditors in coming months  Citgo is a reliable buyer of PDVSA crude abroad and also provides the company with additives that make Venezuela s heavy crude easier to export 
Venezuela is appealing a U S  ruling that awarded Crystallex the right to collect on an arbitration award by taking shares of PDV Holding  the Delaware corporation through which PDVSA controls Citgo  By staying current on the collateralized PDVSA bonds  Venezuela can buy time as it awaits a verdict  Attempts by PDVSA to stop a sale of Citgo have so far failed  A key hearing is scheduled for Dec  20 
A default on the collateralized PDVSA bonds could complicate Venezuela s relations with Russia  If holders of the bonds foreclose on the 50 1 stake in Citgo that represents their collateral and force a sale of the company  Rosneft  that has a claim to the remaining 49 9 percent  could be sidelined in that process 
Citgo may have achieved symbolic value for President Nicolas Maduro even if the socialist regime has considered getting rid of the unit in the past  Losing Venezuela s most valuable asset abroad could be seen as a defeat for a government that is already deeply unpopular at home and has made of standing up to hostile foreign powers a key part of its rhetoric 
For now the 2020 bond is trading over 91 cents on the dollar with investors eyeing the next payment in April ",2018-10-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pdvsa-bewilders-bond-analysts-by-making-949-million-payment-1666351,1666351

188448,409964,COP,Trudeau s Grand Bargain Under Attack After Trans Mountain Ruling,news," Bloomberg     Canada s precarious relationship with its vast oil riches flared up again Thursday after a federal court struck down Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s regulatory approval of a key pipeline  reviving fears about the country s ability to get its resources to market 
Indigenous groups and the City of Vancouver mounted the legal challenge to the Trans Mountain pipeline  and while the government pledged to press ahead the ruling highlights the extraordinary political  legal and social battles that a divided Canada has faced for years in developing the world s third largest crude reserves 
Trudeau s Liberals have staked much of their legacy on forging a grand bargain on resources  The prime minister s Conservative predecessor  Stephen Harper  was seen as overly deferential to the oil industry and dismissive of opponents  Trudeau  however  has sought to win backing for resource development by being more pro environment and supportive of indigenous concerns    seeking what he calls a  social license     while also purchasing the troubled C 4 5 billion   3 5 billion  project from  Kinder Morgan  Inc  NYSE KMI   to make sure it gets built 
 Some of our reputation as a place to invest has been quashed  by the court ruling  former Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall told BNN Bloomberg television  The decision raises questions of  what is enough  and  what is the process  for project approvals 
Growing Frustration
Finance Minister Bill Morneau was defiant  Speaking on BNN Bloomberg television after the ruling  he said the government remains committed to the pipeline   We are going to be here as long as it takes to make sure the project gets done   Morneau said  He declined to comment on how much of a delay the court ruling would cause 
Frustration with the political and regulatory process around pipeline approvals is beginning to boil over  The price for Western Canada Select crude fell to a  31 a barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate futures this year  the biggest gap since 2013  Three projects that could support prices aren t scheduled to be fully operational until the next decade  including Trans Mountain  Enbridge Inc  s Line 3 and TransCanada Corp  s Keystone XL 
And for Canadian oil sands producers that are already weary of setbacks for massive projects like Keystone XL  deciding when to bank on a pipeline actually getting built is getting trickier  said Tudor Pickering Holt   Co  analyst Matt Murphy 
 Certainly everyone was pretty hopeful that these projects would come sooner than later  but they ve all been approaching it with caution   he said   I think what they were waiting for was not approval  not shovels in the ground  but getting steel in the ground  
The Federal Court of Appeal ruled Thursday the regulatory review of the Trans Mountain expansion was  impermissibly flawed  because it excluded project related tanker traffic  In addition  the court also found the government failed to fulfill its legal duty to consult indigenous people 
A redo of consultations could mean the restart of at least an 18 month process  analysts say  The government has discretion to impose a timeline on the revised approval process 
 What s likely to come next are significant timing delays and cost overrun  that will no doubt increase uncertainty around the ultimate fate of TMX   Danilo Juvane  an analyst at BMO Capital Markets  wrote in a research note  He added the decision is a  decided negative  for the oil sands industry 
On top of the legal challenge the federal court ruled on Thursday  British Columbia is seeking a provincial Court of Appeal opinion on whether it can restrict the transportation of crude oil within its borders  Trudeau s government argues the Pacific coast province is overstepping its powers 
Oil Sands Exodus
As a result  confidence is waning in an energy sector that has faced a slew of headwinds    including an easing of regulatory restrictions and lower taxes in the U S     in addition to pipeline bottlenecks  The pinch has contributed to an exodus of foreign capital from the sector in recent years as international majors like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  sold Canadian assets 
The numbers show an industry that was once a magnet for capital is losing its appeal  Foreign companies withdrew a net C 8 2 billion from Canadian energy and mining assets over the past five quarters after piling in about C 130 billion during the previous decade 
Thursday s ruling threatens to exacerbate those issues and rekindle fears that regulations have killed the sector s ability to compete  according to Tim McMillan  president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers   It reinforces a negative impression that the world has of us  when even the government and the regulator aren t able to understand our complex regulatory system   he said ",2018-08-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trudeaus-grand-bargain-under-attack-after-trans-mountain-ruling-1593392,1593392

188460,409976,COP,Oil   Gas US Integrated Industry Outlook  Prospects Gloomy,opinion,The Zacks industry comprises companies that are mostly involved in upstream and midstream energy businesses  The upstream operations entail oil and natural gas exploration and production in the prolific shale plays of the United States The integrated energy companies are also engaged in midstream businesses through their gathering and processing facilities along with transportation pipelines networks and storage sites  Moreover  the domestic integrated firms sell chemicals and refined petroleum products through downstream operations Overall  the upstream business is positively correlated to oil and natural gas prices  The produced commodity volumes are then transported through midstream assets  generating fee based revenues  Notably  the health of the firms  downstream operations relies typically on the demand for the end products Here are the three major industry themes The bearish outlook for oil price has been denting upstream businesses of the integrated energy players in the United States  With the widespread fear of global economic recession hurting oil demand  explorers and producers will find little incentive to ramp up upstream operations and will continue to lower the count of rigs in the domestic plays  The midstream businesses of integrated companies are being hurt by the prevailing pipeline bottleneck problem  Owing to the transportation capacity constraint  the companies are failing to capitalize on the opportunity to generate additional stable fee based revenues  With recession on the horizon and possibilities that the largest economy will find it difficult to beat worldwide economic slowdown  the outlook of the companies  downstream operations is weak  This is because demand for refined petroleum products and chemicals might take a beating Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Cloudy ProspectsThe Zacks Oil   Gas US Integrated industry is a 12 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  188  which places it in the bottom 26  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bearish near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts do not have faith in this group s earnings growth potential  In the past year  the industry s earnings estimates for 2019 have declined 37 7  Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider despite headwinds  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture Industry Lags Sector and S P 500The Zacks Oil   Gas US Integrated industry has lagged the broader Zacks Oil   Energy sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year The industry has lost 40 5  over this period  underperforming the S P 500 s decline of 0 2  and the broader sector s fall of 23 4  One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt laden  it makes sense to value them based on the EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio  This is because the valuation metric takes not just equity into account but also the level of debt  For capital intensive companies  EV EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses On the basis of the trailing 12 month enterprise value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  ratio  the industry is currently trading at 3 58X  well below the S P 500 s 10 7X  It is also lower than the sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 4 68X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 10 35X  as low as 3 58X  with a median of 7 44X Trailing 12 Month Enterprise Value to EBITDA  EV EBITDA  RatioBottom LineThe integrated energy companies  midstream operations are unlikely to benefit in the near term  since most of the fresh pipelines are expected to come online next year to capitalize on the pipeline bottleneck  Moreover  possibility of a global economic slowdown which might hurt the U S  economy doesn t bode well for the companies  downstream businesses One should

188466,409982,COP,Venezuela dodges oil asset seizures with export transfers at sea,news,"By Marianna Parraga and Mircely Guanipa HOUSTON PUNTO FIJO  Reuters    Venezuela s state run oil company PDVSA has limited the damage from an unprecedented slump in crude exports by transferring oil between tankers at sea and loading vessels in neighboring Cuba to avoid asset seizures  But the OPEC member nation is still fulfilling less than 60 percent of its obligations under supply deals with customers  Venezuela has been pumping oil this year at the lowest rate in three decades after years of underinvestment and a mass exodus of workers  The state run firm s collapse has left the country short of cash to fund its embattled socialist government and triggered an economic crisis  PDVSA s problems were compounded in May when U S  oil firm ConocoPhillips  N COP  began seizing PDVSA assets in the Caribbean as payment for a  2 billion arbitration award  An arbitration panel at the International Chamber of Commerce  ICC  ordered PDVSA to pay the cash to compensate Conoco for expropriating the firm s Venezuelan assets in 2007  The seizures left PDVSA without access to facilities such as Isla refinery in Curacao and BOPEC terminal in Bonaire that accounted for almost a quarter of the company s oil exports  Conoco s actions also forced PDVSA to stop shipping oil on its own vessels to terminals in the Caribbean  and then onto refineries worldwide  to avoid the risk the cargoes would be seized in international waters or foreign ports  Instead  PDVSA asked customers to charter tankers to Venezuelan waters and load from the company s own terminals or from anchored PDVSA vessels acting as floating storage units   The state run company told some clients in early June it might impose force majeure  a temporary suspension of export contracts  unless they agreed to such ship to ship transfers   PDVSA also requested the customers stop sending vessels to its terminals until it could load those that were already clogging Venezuela s coastline  Initially  customers were reluctant to undertake the transfers because of costs  safety concerns and the need for specialist equipment and experienced crew  But PDVSA has managed to export about 1 3 million barrels per day  bpd  of oil since early July  up from just 765 000 bpd in the first half of June  according to Thomson Reuters data and internal PDVSA shipping data seen by Reuters  That was still 59 percent of the country s 2 19 million bpd in contractual obligations to customers for that period  and some vessels are still waiting for weeks in Venezuelan waters to load oil  There were about two dozen tankers waiting this week to load over 22 million barrels of crude and refined products at the country s largest ports  according to Reuters data   We are not tied to one option or a single loading terminal   PDVSA President Manuel Quevedo said on Tuesday of the company s exports   We have several  terminals  in our country and we have some in the Caribbean  which of course facilitate crude shipping to fulfill our supply contracts    CUBAN CONNECTION PDVSA has also used a route through Cuba to ease the impact of the Conoco seizures  That route is for fuel rather than crude  The Venezuelan company has used a terminal at the port of Matanzas as a conduit mostly for exporting fuel oil  according to two people familiar with the operations and Thomson Reuters shipping data  Venezuela s fuel oil is burned in some countries to generate electricity   Two tankers set sail from the Matanzas terminal for Singapore between mid May and early July  Reuters data showed  Each ship carried around 500 000 barrels of Venezuelan fuel  Reuters data shows  In recent months  Venezuela has been shipping fuel to Matanzas in small batches  according to the data  PDVSA and Cuba s state run oil firm Cupet have used Matanzas to store Venezuelan crude and fuel in the past but exports from the terminal to Asian destinations are rare   That is in part because vessels that use Cuban ports cannot subsequently dock in the United States due to the U S  commercial embargo on Cuba  Cupet did not respond to requests for comment  PDVSA has also used ship to ship transfers to fulfill an unusual supply contract it has with Cuba s Cienfuegos refinery  The refinery dates from the 1980s   when Cuba was a close ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War   and the facility was built to process Russian crude   PDVSA typically uses its own or leased tankers to bring Russian crude from storage in the nearby Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao to Cienfuegos  But it is now discharging the imported Russian oil at sea in Cayman Islands  waters via these seaborne transfers  ConocoPhillips last month ratcheted up its collection efforts by moving to depose officials from Citgo Petroleum  PDVSA s U S  refining arm  arguing it had improperly claimed ownership of some PDVSA cargoes  Citgo declined to comment   
ConocoPhillips is also preparing new legal actions to get Caribbean courts to recognize its International Chamber of Commerce arbitration award  If it succeeds in those efforts  it would be able to sell the assets to help satisfy the ruling ",2018-08-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/venezuela-dodges-oil-asset-seizures-with-export-transfers-at-sea-1563916,1563916

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  2 88   A quarter ago  it was expected that this energy company would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1  delivering a surprise of 8 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
ConocoPhillips  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  posted revenues of  8 38 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15 34   This compares to year ago revenues of  9 24 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ConocoPhillips shares have lost about 6 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for ConocoPhillips 
While ConocoPhillips has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ConocoPhillips was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Revenues are expected to be  9 61 billion  up 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9 98  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ConocoPhillips 
For ConocoPhillips  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ConocoPhillips will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ConocoPhillips would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1  delivering a surprise of  8 70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ConocoPhillips doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-conocophillips-cop-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200443283,200443283
188494,410010,COP,Re elected  Venezuela s Maduro faces global criticism  U S  sanctions,news,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Roberta Rampton CARACAS WASHINGTON  Reuters    Critics at home and abroad on Monday denounced the re election of Venezuela s socialist President Nicolas Maduro as a farce cementing autocracy  while the U S  government imposed new sanctions on the crisis stricken oil producing country  Maduro  the 55 year old successor to late leftist leader Hugo Chavez  hailed his win in Sunday s election as a victory against  imperialism   But his main challengers alleged irregularities and refused to recognize the result  In response to the vote  U S  President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting Venezuela s ability to liquidate state assets and debt in the United States  the latest in a series of sanctions that seeks to choke off financing for the already cash strapped government  Venezuela s mainstream opposition had boycotted the election  given that two of its most popular leaders were barred  authorities had banned several political parties  and the election board is run by Maduro loyalists   Maduro won 68 percent of votes   more than three times as many as his main rival Henri Falcon  Turnout was a low 46 percent  significantly down from 80 percent in 2013 s presidential vote   The revolution is here to stay   Maduro told cheering supporters outside the presidential palace in Caracas  He has not outlined firm policies  but has promised to prioritize economic recovery after five years of crippling recession that has seen many struggle with chronic shortages of food  medicines and other basic necessities  His dwindling but often still fervent supporters  many of whom remember the generous welfare policies of the Chavez years  want to give him another shot   We believe in the process and we re giving President Maduro another chance   said 45 year old social security worker Maira Garcia   He s going to fix the country s economy     we re going to return to being as we were before  or even better   she said  wearing a t shirt with a big  M  on the front as she celebrated Maduro s victory in the poor Caracas hillside neighborhood of 23 de Enero   Venezuela election   U S  DENOUNCES  SHAM  VOTE U S  Vice President Mike Pence called the election  a sham   neither free nor fair   In a statement sent from the White House  U S  President Donald Trump called for Maduro to  restore democracy  hold free and fair elections  release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally  and end the repression and economic deprivation of the Venezuelan people   In recent months  Washington has imposed a series of sanctions on companies and individuals with ties to the Maduro government  Trump s order on Monday prohibits involvement in the purchase of any debt owed to the Venezuelan government  including accounts receivable  particularly related to oil sold by the OPEC member   The action appears to target in part Venezuelan owned but U S  based oil refiner Citgo  PDVSAC UL     Today s executive order closes another avenue for corruption that we have observed being used  it denies corrupt Venezuelan officials the ability to improperly value and sell off public assets in return for kickbacks   a senior administration official told reporters in Washington  While the order applies only to U S  citizens and residents  the official said the Trump administration had had  fairly pointed discussions  with China and Russia over the issuing of new credit to Venezuela  Maduro has counted on the support of China and Russia  which have provided billions of dollars in funding in recent years   What these sanctions are seeking to avoid is that countries outside the Western hemisphere come rescue Maduro financially so that he can consolidate an autocracy   said Venezuelan opposition lawmaker and economist Angel Alvarado   Venezuela s Information Ministry and state oil company PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment   Other countries also hinted at sanctions  with Spain leading European Union criticism of the election  And the 14 nation  Lima Group  of countries in the Americas  from Canada to Brazil  said in a stinging statement it did not recognize the vote and would downgrade diplomatic relations  The group deplored Venezuela s  grave humanitarian situation   In contrast  Venezuela s regional leftist allies  such as Cuba and Bolivia  sent congratulations   In Beijing  foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed Venezuela could handle its own affairs and the choice of the people should be respected  MORIBUND ECONOMY The Venezuelan government used ample state resources to get voters out on Sunday and public workers were pressured to vote  Falcon called for a new election  complaining about the government placing of nearly 13 000 pro government stands offering  prizes  close to polling stations nationwide   The main political opposition said its boycott had worked  but the disparate group did not appear to have a plan going forward other than calling for new elections   a non starter given the pro Maduro electoral council  Major protests  like those seen last year and in 2014  seem unlikely  given widespread disillusionment and fatigue   Demonstrators did barricade some streets in the southern city of Puerto Ordaz  drawing teargas from the National Guard  witnesses said   Maduro  a former bus driver whose second term in office starts in January  faces a colossal task turning around Venezuela s moribund economy  The bolivar currency is down well over 99 percent over the past year and annual inflation is at nearly 14 000 percent  according to the opposition led National Assembly  Venezuela s multiple creditors are considering accelerating claims on unpaid foreign debt  while oil major ConocoPhillips  N COP  has been taking aggressive action in recent weeks against PDVSA  PDVSA UL   part of a claim for compensation over a 2007 nationalization of its assets in Venezuela  U S  crude hit its highest level since 2014 on Monday amid rising concerns that Venezuela s oil output could fall further following the election and sanctions   Trading of

188495,410011,COP,OAS Sees Tougher Venezuela Sanctions After Criminal Report,news," Bloomberg     A report charging Venezuela s government with crimes against humanity will be sent to the International Criminal Court on Wednesday as the head of the Organization of American States said he expects increasingly tougher sanctions to target President Nicolas Maduro s regime soon 
Luis Almagro  the OAS secretary general  said he expects at least one country to sponsor his organization s report    which would trigger a formal investigation by the ICC    within a month  He declined to say which country would likely sponsor the effort  though he said four countries have signaled an interest in doing so 
An indictment by the ICC would put Maduro s government on a par with regimes including Omar al Bashir s Sudan and Libya s late Moammar Al Qaddafi 
 We expect justice  for the Venezuelan people  Almagro said in an interview Wednesday on Bloomberg Television  one day after a panel of experts convened by the OAS concluded that Maduro s government was involved in multiple murders and at least 12 000 cases of imprisonment and arbitrary detention  It also accused the authorities of torture  rape  political persecution and enforced disappearances

Almagro said Maduro and his allies are increasingly sealed off from the day to day economic and humanitarian plight of the country  which has been wracked by hyperinflation  shortages of food and other basic goods as well as the decline of Venezuela s oil industry  Top regime officials now depend more on income from illicit activities  such as drug smuggling  than legal ones  he added 
 Nobody could do worse  at governing Venezuela  Almagro said  calling for the country to have a democratic transition  Canada  the U S  and the European Union are all likely to keep ratcheting up sanctions on Venezuela in the coming weeks and months  he said  adding that the goal is  make sanctions as hard as possible to bring them to the negotiating table  
On Wednesday  Canada imposed sanctions against Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores and 13 key government and ruling party figures in response to  illegitimate and anti democratic  elections held May 20  The sanctions freeze assets and prohibit Canadian citizens from dealing or providing financial services to those listed 
If the government does fall  its successor will have to work hard to rebuild the oil industry  which has long been the linchpin of the country s economy  Almagro said he expects the situation in Venezuela to deteriorate quickly in the next month 
13 000  Inflation
In a statement Late Tuesday  Venezuela s permanent OAS mission  categorically rejected  the report  saying it was prepared by  anti Venezuelan activists  and was based on the testimony of  criminal fugitives  
The report is part of a  propaganda campaign against the Venezuelan state  whose sole objective is to overthrow the Constitutional Government of President Nicolas Maduro   the diplomats said in a statement 
Despite having the world s largest crude reserves  Venezuela is confronting billions of dollars in debt payments that are coming due while creditors like ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  are seizing the assets of the state oil company  Hyperinflation could accelerate to 13 000 percent this year  and the International Monetary Fund forecast a 15 percent economic contraction 
Since November  Venezuela has skipped payment deadlines on nearly  4 billion in bonds  raising concern among creditors about the  65 billion outstanding from the nation and its state run entities  Existing sanctions prohibit Americans from receiving new bonds in a restructuring 
 Sham Election 
Less than a week after winning a second six year term  Maduro said his government isn t  doing things well  and needs to boost oil output by 1 million barrels a day  His government has typically blamed the nation s ills on the private sector  U S  sanctions and an  economic war  against Venezuela 
Despite the crisis  Almagro declined to forecast how long Maduro s government could remain in power  saying he didn t want to get into  futurology   But he cited the historic ability of Caribbean governments  such as Cuba  to survive despite dire economic circumstances  And one advantage Venezuela has over Cuba  he added  is that people can migrate out of the country without taking to the sea 
The government is effectively trying to relieve political pressure by letting people go into exile  Almagro said   What they are doing is transferring pressure to neighboring countries   he said

Maduro won reelection earlier this month in a vote the Trump administration derided as a  sham  after the opposition s biggest parties and most popular candidates were banned from the ballot 
In the report published Tuesday  the panel of experts said Maduro s administration has pursued a  massive assault on the rule of law in Venezuela   Moreover  widespread attacks on the judiciary have prevented any  genuine legal proceedings to investigate the crimes against humanity  
 It s all incomprehensible that this continues to occur in our continent   said Manuel Ventura Robles  one of the panelists and a former judge of the Inter American Court of Human Rights

188499,410015,COP,Exclusive  Venezuela eyes first ever refining of foreign oil   documents,news,"By Marianna Parraga HOUSTON  Reuters    Venezuela is considering producing fuels from foreign crude oil for the first time  according to planning documents seen by Reuters  as the country struggles to meet its obligations despite having the world s largest crude reserves  State run oil company PDVSA may process up to 57 000 barrels per day  bpd  of foreign crude in June at the country s largest refinery  according to a monthly refining plan which was viewed by Reuters on Wednesday  The output would help fulfill fuel contracts for Russian  Chinese and other customers and reduce purchases of fuels for domestic use  the documents showed  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment  PDVSA has been falling short on fuel exports in recent years due to a lack of lighter crudes to refine  a shortage of spare parts  poor maintenance  and management upheaval at its domestic refining network  PDVSA also lost access in May to inventories produced in Curacao  where it operates the Isla refinery   Declining revenue resulting from falling oil production and exports have driven Venezuela into a severe economic recession  and led to a loss of skilled workers  and widespread food and medicine shortages  Some energy experts say further production declines could contribute to a global crude shortfall  U S  based ConocoPhillips  N COP  last month seized some of PDVSA s assets in the Caribbean seeking payment for a  2 billion arbitration award  reducing PDVSA s ability to deliver fuel and crude exports to Asian customers and regional allies  Venezuela  an OPEC member country  has never before imported foreign crude oil for its domestic refineries  although it has blended African  Russian and U S  crudes with its extra heavy oil to make exportable products  It also has purchased foreign oil for Caribbean refineries and to supply allies  including Cuba  DECADES LOW OUTPUT In May  the country produced 1 53 million bpd of crude  according to numbers delivered to OPEC  but other sources put the figure at 1 39 million bpd  which would be the lowest monthly output since the 1950s   If PDVSA chooses to refine the imported crude  one of two scenarios outlined in documents showing its production  supply and contract requirements  the imports would alleviate a lack of domestic lighter crudes needed at the refineries  which have been running at about a third of their capacity  It could use Russian  Iranian or Angolan crudes  according to the documents    The larger processing of crude would increase our fuel availability  It would also decrease the requirements  to import  of vacuum gasoil and diesel   said one of the documents prepared in May  The alternative  not using imported crude  would mean the shortfall in fulfilling contracts to supply fuel would increase  the document showed  Most of these fuel contracts cover oil for loans with Chinese and Russian companies   As of June 13  two tankers holding Russian Urals crude were waiting in Venezuelan waters to discharge  according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data  One of the two  the Advantage Atom  is waiting near its Amuay refinery  Venezuela in January started routine imports of Urals crude to supply Cuban refineries  spending nearly  440 million on the purchases for its Caribbean ally  The Urals cargoes had been discharged in Curacao for transfer to Cuba  but since Conoco began seizing PDVSA s Caribbean assets  tankers arriving from Russia have been diverted to Venezuela s Paraguana Refining Center  CRP   which includes its Amuay and Cardon refineries  NOT ENOUGH FOR ALL To meet its domestic demands and PDVSA s fuel supply contracts  Venezuela would have to produce some 850 000 bpd of fuels  the documents show   Neither of the June alternatives show it getting close to that level  If PDVSA decides to process the foreign crude  it would produce 606 000 bpd  and less if it does not  From January through March  PDVSA s refineries supplied 78 percent of the 365 000 bpd of the fuels demanded by Venezuela s domestic market  which forced the company to import finished products including gasoline and diesel  Under the plan excluding foreign oil imports  PDVSA s domestic refineries this month would work at about 36 percent of their total capacity  or 473 000 bpd of Venezuelan crude  according to the documents  reflecting an acute lack of spare parts and delayed maintenance projects  On Wednesday  PDVSA s 310 000 bpd Cardon refinery restarted a vacuum distillation unit that was waiting for spare parts to be repaired  Last week  the 645 000 Amuay refinery restarted one of its crude distillation units  Those repairs are just some of the many still pending  according to the documents  At Venezuela s smallest refineries  Puerto la Cruz and El Palito  the lack of medium and light crudes has kept several distillation units out of service for months  The insufficient fuel production is affecting China s CNPC  CNPC UL  and its subsidiaries the most as PDVSA would have to ship 258 000 bpd of fuel oil and jet fuel to these companies for repaying Chinese loans extended to the Venezuelan government in the last decade  but it typically delivers less than 100 000 bpd  
Russia s Rosneft  MM ROSN  this month is entitled to 80 000 bpd of fuel oil  jet fuel and natural gasoline under oil for loan contracts  while Cuba and members of Petrocaribe should receive at least 108 000 bpd  according to current contracts ",2018-06-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-venezuela-eyes-firstever-use-of-foreign-oil-for-contracts--documents-1492032,1492032

This energy company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11 42  
For the most recent quarter  ConocoPhillips was expected to post earnings of  0 92 per share  but it reported  1 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 70   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 99 per share  while it actually produced  1 13 per share  a surprise of 14 14  
Price and EPS Surprise

For ConocoPhillips  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
ConocoPhillips has an Earnings ESP of  4 41  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 30  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

188548,410064,COP,Commodities Week Ahead  Oil Bulls Count On Gasoline  Gold USD Wrestle Over Brexit,opinion,"What tidings will this summer bring for oil  With Memorial Day flagging off the annual U S  driving spectacle  all eyes will be on gasoline stats from here on  to see if fuel consumption keeps up with the American Automobile Association s lofty expectations for the start of summer road travel 
The AAA says that despite pump prices of gasoline closing in on near  3 a gallon in some regions  U S  citizens have hardly cut back on driving 
It forecasts that a record 37 6 million of them took to the road this Memorial Day  although the absolute number traveling by all modes of transport    43 million    would only be the second highest since 2000 
Oil Bulls Looking For Rebound After Last Week s Narrative
That s an interesting observation because weekly numbers from the U S  Energy Information Administration tell a different story  Last week s data  particularly  was hardly inspiring  with the EIA reporting total gasoline inventories up by 3 7 million barrels during the week ended May 17  versus forecasts for a drop of nearly 816 000 barrels  And U S  refinery runs have been surprisingly muted in the run up to Memorial Day  staying at just under the key 90  to capacity mark  Doing longer than expected plant maintenance and processing less crude than anticipated week after week  refinery owners have become a new source of frustration to oil bulls already reeling from stubbornly highly U S  crude production 

After oil s worst week for 2019  those long the market will be hoping for a bullish overdose that could bring U S  West Texas Intermediate crude back above the key  60 per barrel support and U K  Brent back above  70  WTI lost nearly 7  last week and Brent 5   after an unexpected 5 million barrel build in U S  crude stockpiles for a second week in a row 
Trade War The Bigger Problem  Morgan Stanley  StanChart Stay Bearish
A strong rebound for oil this week will be contingent on the market overcoming growing concerns about the U S  China trade war 
That might not be so easy  Beijing has indicated it ll never give in to U S  demands to change its state run economy  CNBC reported  saying U S  complaints about the structural aspects of Chinese economy were regarded as unacceptable to the  core interests  of China 
At least two investment banks Morgan Stanley and Standard Chartered have less than optimistic outlooks on oil 
Analysts at Morgan Stanley said  deflationary forces are gathering momentum  in oil despite recent geopolitical tensions in the Gulf  amid Saudi allegations of Iranian sabotage of its oil infrastructure and a U S  military buildup in anticipation of a Tehran attack 
Morgan Stanley attributes the deflationary momentum largely to the potential of shale to create another glut  despite its slower growth this year and the tendency of oil bulls to downplay U S  crude s impact on the global market 
Said Morgan Stanley 

 With 200  billion  barrels of resource with breakevens in the  40 45 bbl range  there is an increasingly credible scenario that shale could grow  1 mb d per year out to 2025  

Shale drillers were also squeezing the most out of the so called fracking process  using the latest of digital technologies  which ensure maximum output for the lowest cost per barrel  The end result  A global impact on crude drilling costs and prices 
StanChart said its proprietary  bull bear index  read  100 this week  was  the weakest  such  data in the past six years   as the EIA reported inventory growth in all categories except residual fuel oil  which resulted in a gross increase of 16 33 million barrels 
Hedge funds are bailing out of oil too  slowly pulling the hot speculative money that had been the bedrock of the year to date gain of nearly 30  in both WTI and Brent   This is a very flows driven market right now   Scott Shelton  a broker at ICAP  LON NXGN  in Durham  N C   was quoted saying by the Wall Street Journal  After a series of supply outages and tension in the Middle East  oil failed to break higher  likely leading to a shift in sentiment  Shelton said  adding   You just threw everything bullish you basically could at the market  and nothing happened  
ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  CEO Ryan Lance appeared to have a similar view  saying 

 If we see  80  we kind of tell people  Be prepared  you might see  40 or  50 on the back end  Cycles are getting shorter  the peaks and troughs are getting significant  

New British PM s Brexit View To Lead Gold
Gold also enters a new phase of uncertainty on its role as safe haven  after the U S  dollar made a return last week as a preferred hedge against the U S  Sino trade war  The greenback s supremacy to the pound has also made it a better alternative than gold for investors seeking a hedge to Brexit  This was particularly visible after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced her decision to resign on Friday  raising fresh questions about Britain s divorce from the EU 
Gold s direction in the coming week would be decided by May s replacement  and whether the candidate will continue pushing for Brexit  which would further weaken the pound and boost the yellow metal 
Spot gold  reflective of trades in bullion  last traded at  1 284 87 per ounce  down 0 1  on the week 
Gold futures for June delivery  traded on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange  settled at  1 283 60 per ounce  up 0 1  
The Dollar Index  which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies  fell 0 3  to 97 44  The pound settled the week nearly flat at  1 2672 
Fawad Razaqzada  analyst at FOREX com  said

188569,410085,COP,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  Diamondback And Marathon Petroleum Report Q1 Earnings,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices settled lower but natural gas futures posted a gain 
On the news front  Permian pure play Diamondback Energy  Inc    NASDAQ FANG   reported better than expected first quarter earnings  Meanwhile  refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   swung to a surprise loss   
Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell a marginal 0 5  to close at  61 66 per barrel  natural gas prices rose 2  for the week to finish at  2 619 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here   
The U S  crude benchmark was pressured by the escalating trade dispute between China and the United States  The recent setback in relations with China is threatening to dampen global growth and affect oil demand  This was partly offset by the Energy Department s latest inventory release showed that stockpiles recorded a larger than expected weekly decrease 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices gained slightly after a government report showed in line increase in supplies  However  the injection was higher than the five year average as the mild spring weather continues to limit heating and air conditioning demand  While the fundamentals of natural gas consumption continue to be favorable  record high production in the United States and expectations for explosive growth through 2020 means that supply will keep pace with demand

188570,410086,COP,Why Canada is the next frontier for shale oil,news,By Nia Williams CALGARY  Alberta  Reuters    The revolution in U S  shale oil has battered Canada s energy industry in recent years  ending two decades of rapid expansion and job creation in the nation s vast oil sands  Now Canada is looking to its own shale fields to repair the economic damage  Canadian producers and global oil majors are increasingly exploring the Duvernay and Montney formations  which they say could rival the most prolific U S  shale fields  Canada is the first country outside the United States to see large scale development of shale resources  which already account for 8 percent of total Canadian oil output  China  Russia and Argentina also have ample shale reserves but have yet to overcome the obstacles to full commercial development  Canada  by contrast  offers many of the same advantages that allowed oil firms to launch the shale revolution in the United States  numerous private energy firms with appetite for risk  deep capital markets  infrastructure to transport oil  low population in regions that contain shale reserves  and plentiful water to pump into shale wells  Together  the Duvernay and Montney formations in Canada hold marketable resources estimated at 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas  20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 4 5 billion barrels of oil  according to the National Energy Board  a Canadian regulator   The Montney is thought to have about half the recoverable resources of the whole oil sands region  so it s formidable   Marty Proctor  chief executive of Calgary based Seven Generations Energy  told Reuters in an interview  Canada s shale output stands at about 335 000 bpd  according to energy consultants Wood Mackenzie  which forecasts output should grow to 420 000 bpd in a decade  The pace of output growth could quicken and the estimated size of the resources could rise as activity picks up and knowledge of the fields improves  according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers  Seven Generations and Encana Corp  also based in Calgary  are among leading producers developing the two regions  Global majors including Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP    who pulled back from the oil sands last year   are also developing Canadian shale assets   Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  announced its first ever Canadian shale development in the Duvernay in November  Spokesman Leif Sollid called it one of the most promising shale opportunities in North America  ConocoPhillips sees potential for the Montney to deliver significant production and cash flow to the company  executive vice president of production drilling and projects Al Hirshberg said in November  Shell will invest more money this year in the Duvernay than any other shale field except the Permian Basin in West Texas  the most productive U S  shale play  spokesman Cameron Yost said   We may learn something in the Permian that becomes applicable in the Montney  and vice versa   Yost said  The oil sands boom dates back two decades  when improved technology  rising crude prices and fears of global oil shortages sparked a rush to develop the world s third largest reserves  But in the last five years  much of that investment has migrated south as U S  shale firms pioneered new drilling techniques and flooded global oil markets with cheaper to produce crude  The oil sands currently account for two thirds of Canada s 4 2 million barrels per day of crude  They will continue to contribute heavily to Canada s energy output because oil sands projects  once built  produce for decades   But the era of oil sands mega projects will likely end with Suncor Energy s 190 000 barrel per day Fort Hills mining project  which started producing this month  Canadian energy officials are now counting on shale  also known as  tight  oil  to lure new investment   Increasingly we are going to see light tight oil and liquids rich natural gas forming a key part of Alberta s energy future   said Margaret McCuaig Boyd  energy minister for the province where the oil sands and much of the nation s shale reserves are located  A FUTURE IN FRACKING Oil sands development drove Alberta s economic growth at a rate of 5 5 percent annually between 2010 and 2014  about twice the national rate  But the oil price crash in 2014 sent the region into a recession and has since prompted producers to scrap at least  32 billion in planned projects  Oil sands capital spending fell for a third straight year in 2017 while other oil and gas investment rose 40 percent from 2016 to about C 31 billion  according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers  Spending outside the oil sands is expected to grow again this year to C 33 billion  nearly three times the amount predicted for oil sands investment   For a graphic detailing capital spending in Canada s oil sector  see     Hydraulic fracturing of shale oil and gas can yield quicker returns on smaller investments than extracting tar like bitumen from the oil sands  Shale production is also less carbon intensive  addressing a major concern among international investors reluctant to finance what environmental groups deride as the  tar sands    The last decade has been dominated by conversations about the oil sands  and people have maybe missed the opportunities  in shale fields  Encana Chief Executive Doug Suttles told a conference in British Columbia in November   All these things have a much lower carbon footprint than the average barrel refined today    ABSOLUTELY HUGE  POTENTIAL The Duvernay in central Alberta is a shale play  while the Montney  straddling northern Alberta and British Columbia  is technically a formation of siltstone  a more porous rock  Drilling and extraction techniques are the same  however  and many in the industry use the term shale for both  Drillers face challenges in both fields because of their distance from key markets  but the high potential of their reserves is unquestioned  The Duvernay is comparable to the Eagle Ford shale field in South Texas  The Montney is unique  with its enormous gas resources and extremely thick rock formation containing several different levels at which oil and gas can be drilled  said Mike Johnson  technical leader of hydrocarbon resources for the National Energy Board  Weak prices in an oversupplied natural gas market have hampered development  along with added costs of shipping from the far flung fields and limited capacity on pipelines  That makes it harder to compete with producers in shale gas plays such as the Marcellus in the northeastern United States  Meanwhile  proposed Canadian liquefied natural gas export terminals on the west coast  which were expected to provide a huge source of demand  have been canceled or stalled due to weak prices  Such obstacles  however  have not stopped producers from staking claims in the region  Last year  Alberta oil and gas land sale prices reached levels not seen since 2014 because of a rush to buy land in the Duvernay East Shale Basin    The potential is absolutely huge   said Mark Salkeld  president of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada   The only thing holding us back is access to market and the cost

188573,410089,COP,Veteran commander vies for power in Libya s shifting sands,news,By Aidan Lewis TUNIS  Reuters    When Khalifa Haftar flew to Tunis in September  the veteran commander and possible future leader of Libya brought masked troops armed with automatic rifles and grenade launchers in a show of force that drew censure from U N  experts  In France  Italy and Tunisia  he also shook hands with ministers and presidents in gilded reception rooms  projecting a different image  that of a man preparing to convert the military gains of his Libyan National Army  LNA  into civilian power  Haftar casts himself as the person who can bring stability to Libya after years of conflict  ridding the OPEC member of Islamist militants and reining in migrant smuggling to Europe   Some of those who have worked with him describe him as a divisive military man with little time for politics  who could try to reinstate authoritarian rule and bring more violence to a country where armed groups jealously guard local fiefdoms  A former ally of Muammar Gaddafi  Haftar  75  returned to Libya seven years ago from the United States  to join the Nato backed revolution that ended four decades of one man rule  After a protracted military campaign in Libya s second city  Benghazi  he has promised to  liberate  the capital Tripoli  split from the east since 2014  Elections  which the United Nations says could be organized by the end of the year despite major obstacles  may provide another route to power  Haftar seems to be hedging his bets  The LNA  he said last month  has  sleeper cells  it could activate to take full control of Libya while prioritizing a political solution to avoid bloodshed   But our patience has limits   he said in the interview published in French magazine Jeune Afrique  before adding that Libya was not  ripe for democracy    Mohamed Buisier  a U S  based engineer who served as an advisor to Haftar from 2014 2016 before falling out with him  said Haftar wanted absolute power   He wants to get to one of the big palaces in Tripoli and rule Libya   that is it   he said  Haftar s office said he did not immediately have time for an interview    ARC OF HISTORY  Among the officers who supported Gaddafi when he seized power from King Idris in 1969  Haftar was disowned by Gaddafi after he was captured leading Libyan forces in Chad in 1987  He settled outside Washington D C  in Virginia and returned to Libya only as the revolt against Gaddafi was gathering pace   He was there at the beginning with Gaddafi   he was abandoned by Gaddafi  he left Libya for decades  He would like to see the arc of history corrected   said Jonathan Winer  a former U S  special envoy to Libya who met Haftar in 2016  After Gaddafi was overthrown and eventually killed  Haftar dropped from view  resurfacing in February 2014 with a televised statement pledging to rescue a country mired in instability  In May that year  he launched  Operation Dignity  in Benghazi  merging his irregular forces with army troops and pitting himself against both Islamist militants whom he blamed for a wave of bombings and assassinations in the port city  and an armed alliance that took control of Tripoli soon after  An internationally recognized parliament relocated to eastern Libya and appointed Haftar army chief in 2015  but it was not until early 2016  amid reports of support from foreign states including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates  that Haftar started gaining the upper hand in his Benghazi campaign  TRIPOLI GOVERNMENT REJECTED Haftar has rejected the United Nations backed transitional Government of National Accord  GNA  set up in Tripoli in 2016 as fighting raged in Benghazi  dismissing it as unelected and beholden to the capital s militias   I m reaching out to General Haftar once every week to ask him for a meeting   former U N  Libya envoy Martin Kobler said in an interview in July 2016   But it takes two to dance a tango   The GNA stalled amid political splits and Haftar gained ground from the east  seizing and reopening several key oil ports southeast of Benghazi in September 2016  and replacing elected mayors with military appointees  By 2017  his international profile was firmly on the rise  In January he was given a tour of a Russian aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean  In July  two weeks after appearing on TV in a starched white uniform to declare victory in Benghazi  newly elected President Emmanuel Macron hosted him in Paris alongside GNA head Fayez Seraj  Senior Western officials began regular visits to Haftar s base at Rajma  near Benghazi  Oil output  mostly of it from fields under LNA control where foreign firms including  Hess Corp   NYSE HES    Marathon Oil  Corp  NYSE MRO   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   Eni  OMV  and Wintershall have holdings  rose above 1 million barrels per day  bpd   Giant posters of Haftar in Benghazi declared   I promised and I delivered   Supporters launched a petition calling on Haftar  now a field marshal  to take national power  and claimed to have gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures  LIMITS OF CONTROL On the ground  however  things were more complicated   The oil ports were briefly retaken by Haftar s rivals and fighting in Benghazi dragged on for months after the victory declaration  The International Criminal Court  ICC  indicted Mahmoud al Werfalli  a special forces commander attached to the LNA  for allegedly overseeing the summary execution of several dozen prisoners  Derna  about 250 km  155 miles  northeast  remains under the control of a coalition of Islamists and other local fighters  despite LNA encirclement and air raids  Rivalries have surfaced between the special forces  mainstream army units  local youths who fought alongside the LNA  and ultraconservative Salafist brigades that have gained power and influence under Haftar  said Mohamed Eljarh  an analyst based in eastern Libya   These people don t see eye to eye   he said   After Benghazi has been declared liberated  basically the common enemy has gone  So now  these differences are coming alive   Foreign support for Haftar has also wavered  Western diplomats say  Russia has printed money for him and hosted him in Moscow  but has also built ties with his rivals in western Libya with an eye on energy and arms contracts lost in 2011  U N  monitors said in a confidential report seen by Reuters that Haftar s display of armed muscle in Tunis amounted  a serious violation of the arms embargo  on Libya  Western officials say he has the formality of Soviet trained officers of his generation and question his engagement with politics   His script is basically security comes first  politics comes later   said one foreign visitor who was received several times by Haftar  and spoke on condition of anonymity  Some diplomats suggest the promise of national polls could contain Haftar  even though with a lack of a unifying candidate or updated election laws  it is far from clear how they can be held  But they also doubt his commitment to civilian rule   He is not a convinced democrat   said one foreign envoy  adding that Haftar had told him that he intended to run   He accepts elections as an acceptable way to do it  provided he will be the winner   Buisier said Haftar has surrounded himself with ultra loyal advisors and relatives  including two of his sons  Saddam and Khaled  who were given military ranks and a brigade to command  Some of the commander s inner circle accused Busier of supporting Saif al Islam Gaddafi  the late leader s most prominent son  whose whereabouts are unclear but is viewed by Haftar as a potential rival  the former advisor said  Several other Haftar allies have defected  including a former spokesman and the GNA s defense minister  Ahmed al Mismari  the LNA s spokesman  said 90 percent of the force was made up of regular soldiers  denied reports that it was dependent on foreign support  and asserted that the armed escort brought to Tunis was for personal protection and was cleared with Tunisian authorities  The LNA supported elections  and had declared its  full readiness to secure them   he said ,2018-02-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/veteran-commander-vies-for-power-in-libyas-shifting-sands-1310625,1310625
188574,410090,COP,How unstable is Libya s oil production ,news,"By Aidan Lewis TUNIS  Reuters    Two of Libya s largest oilfields with combined production of nearly 400 000 barrels per day  bpd  have suffered shutdowns in quick succession  casting fresh doubt on a partial recovery in the OPEC member s oil output  Libya s national output has been sustained at about one million bpd for months  and most recent closures have been quickly resolved  A shutdown that began on Sunday at El Sharara  Libya s biggest field  lasted less than 24 hours   For a graphic on Libya s oil facilities click    But the latest disruptions   caused by guards at El Feel field complaining about pay and benefits  and by a property owner who said he wanted rubbish cleared from his land   highlight continuing risks to output in a country without centralized security forces or political control   WHAT IS LIBYA S POTENTIAL  Libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in Africa  and has been a key supplier of light  sweet crude to Europe   Around 1970 it produced more than 3 million bpd  and before the NATO backed uprising in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed seven years ago  it was pumping more than 1 6 million bpd  Last year the state owned National Oil Corporation  NOC  outlined plans that would raise production to 2 2 million bpd by 2023  but said this would need around  18 billion of investment  Foreign oil companies including Italy s Eni  MI ENI    Total   PA TOTF  of France and U S  firms ConocoPhillips  N COP  and Hess  N HES  have production stakes through joint ventures with the NOC  WHY DID OUTPUT DROP AFTER 2011  Since Libya s 2011 uprising  power in the sparsely populated nation has fragmented and local groups have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands  Armed factions across the country have cut off production at key fields and ports  including a long blockade of terminals in Libya s eastern oil crescent from 2014 2016  Prolonged and haphazard shutdowns have reduced pressure at oil wells  As Libya s revenue fell due to production disruptions and lower oil prices  demands for salaries  local development and jobs that feed into blockades became more widespread  Islamic State militants attacked oilfields and ports in 2015 2016 before being driven back by local forces  Their destruction of storage tanks at two of Libya s biggest terminals  Es Sider and Ras Lanuf  has yet to be repaired  Fields including Mabruk and Ghani remain closed   After disputed elections in 2014 led to rival governments being set up in Tripoli and the east  eastern based factions tried to sell oil independently  They failed  but the split added to uncertainty in Libya s oil sector  WHAT ARE THE CURRENT RISKS  The causes of recent shutdowns include economic protests by guards  armed groups pushing for the release of jailed members  and apparent political maneuvering in the east  Sometimes shutdowns are triggered in remote fields or at terminals  sometimes by people with access to gearboxes that control pipeline valves  Production at the key Sharara field has repeatedly been cut on the long pipeline leading to the coast by groups near Zintan  a western town that became militarily powerful in the 2011 uprising  The internationally recognized Government of National Accord  GNA  in Tripoli  which lacks authority over armed groups even in the capital  often has little means of ending blockades   Oil installations are meant to be protected by the Petroleum Facilities Guards  PFG   But as with other parts of Libya s security forces  their official status is effectively self declared and their actions are governed by local interests rather than any central authority  Even as longer blockades ended from mid 2016  financial constraints have been an underlying drag on Libya s production rebound  The NOC has had rocky relations with the GNA  and has complained repeatedly that budget allocations have been held up  The GNA says its own resources are limited   A bigger political risk also looms  Factions in the east  where most of Libya s oil wealth is located  are opposed to the GNA and say it has not disbursed sufficient oil income to eastern regions  Some eastern hardliners have threatened to cut oil production although for now the eastern based Libyan National Army  LNA   which has good relations with the NOC in Tripoli  has kept fields and ports open   Security is still volatile  In December an explosion at a pipeline in eastern Libya caused an outage of up to 100 000 bpd  though it was quickly repaired  International companies are working offshore but still have a limited presence onshore  keeping exploration and development programs mostly on hold   WHAT ABOUT OPEC  Along with Nigeria  Libya has been exempted from OPEC led production cuts that seek to bolster crude prices and have been extended until the end of 2018

188579,410095,COP,How Australia East Timor treaty unlocks  65 billion gas fields,news,By Henning Gloystein and Sonali Paul SINGAPORE MELBOURNE  Reuters    East Timor and Australia this week signed a treaty at the United Nations setting their maritime boundary for the first time  and striking a deal on sharing an estimated  65 billion in potential revenues from the Greater Sunrise gas fields in the Timor Sea  For impoverished East Timor  with a population of just 1 3 million  development of the fields is crucial    its main source of revenue since 2004  the Bayu Undan gas field  is set to run out of gas by 2022  The treaty signing in New York on Tuesday marked the first conciliation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  UNCLOS    a process UN Secretary General Ant nio Guterres said could offer other countries a path toward resolving contentious maritime boundary disputes  At current market prices  the Greater Sunrise reserves would be worth more than 23 times East Timor s annual Gross Domestic Product  GDP  of  2 8 billion   Graphic on East Timor GDP   Development of the reserves has been held back by the maritime border dispute between Australia and East Timor  a former Portuguese colony that gained independence from Indonesia in 2002   The treaty is an important step that opens the way for developing a rich  shared resource  the Greater Sunrise gas fields  We know this resource is crucial to Timor Leste s development   said Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop  who signed the treaty in New York on Tuesday with East Timor s Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister for the Delimitation of Borders Hermenegildo Augusto Cabral Pereira  However  the Greater Sunrise joint venture  led by Australia s Woodside Petroleum  AX WPL   which has been a key party in the long running negotiation  said it was disappointed that the treaty did not contain a full development plan for the gas reserves   It is disappointing that this process has not resulted in an alignment on a development concept   the Sunrise joint venture said in a statement on Wednesday  The Sunrise partners did not specify what they felt was missing in the agreement  but it is likely that Dili insisted on the gas being processed in East Timor for overseas sale  while the joint venture would prefer to pipe the gas to Australia  Graphic on map of Greater Sunrise gas fields   Under the terms of the deal  East Timor will get 70 percent of revenues if processing takes place in East Timor  and 80 percent should the gas be piped to Australia  That compares with an equal share under a 2006 agreement between Dili and Canberra   HOW MUCH GAS IS THERE  The Sunrise and Troubadour gas fields  collectively known as Greater Sunrise  lie beneath waters 100 to 600 meters deep  making them shallow to medium deepwater developments  The fields were discovered in 1974 and  according to Woodside  hold around 5 13 trillion cubic feet of gas  the equivalent of more than a third of current annual global LNG consumption  At current market prices  the LNG would be worth almost  50 billion  Like most gas fields in the wider region  including Papua New Guinea s and Australia s huge liquefied natural gas  LNG  exports facilities  Greater Sunrise also contains significant amounts of condensate  an ultra light form of crude oil  Its 225 9 million barrels of condensate reserves at current market prices would be worth over  15 billion  WHO GETS WHAT  Woodside and its partners have long said they would prefer to develop the fields using a floating liquefied natural gas  FLNG  platform  considered the most cost effective option  as the fields are 150km away from East Timor and 450km away from Darwin in Australia  However the agreement signed on Tuesday lays out just two options    piping the gas either to East Timor or Australia  Dili has long pressed for the gas to be processed in East Timor  looking to generate thousands of jobs in construction and  once developed  in the lucrative oil and gas processing  storage  transport and petrochemical industries  Australia  however  has existing gas infrastructure and an experienced workforce  making it the industry s preferred location  WHO IS INVOLVED  The partners in Greater Sunrise are Australia s Woodside  U S  firm ConocoPhillips  N COP   Anglo Dutch Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  and Japan s Osaka Gas  T 9532   Even with the new agreement  development could be years away  Woodside said last May it may only develop Greater Sunrise after 2027  Energy markets are just recovering from years of oversupply that depressed oil and gas prices and deterred development of new gas projects  Asia s LNG markets  which Greater Sunrise would serve  are expected to remain oversupplied into the early 2020s as production rises in Australia  North America  Papua New Guinea and also Qatar  It s likely the Sunrise partners will bide their time before committing billions of dollars to develop such a large project

188590,410106,COP,ConocoPhillips  COP  To Report Q1 Earnings  What Lies Ahead ,opinion,ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  the upstream energy company s earnings of  1 13 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents  aided by higher oil realizations and strong volumes from unconventional assets  ConocoPhillips beat estimates in the trailing four quarters  delivering average positive earnings surprise of 15 7   In the to be reported quarter  the company is expected to report earnings of 92 cents per share ConocoPhillips Price and EPS Surprise   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Which Way are Estimates Trending Let s take a look at estimate revisions to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company before the earnings release The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings of 92 cents has witnessed five upward revisions and two downward revisions by firms in the past 30 days  This estimate is indicative of a 4 2  decline from the year ago reported earnings of 96 cents The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is pegged at  9 2 billion  suggesting an improvement of 2 2  from the year ago reported figure Factors at PlayThe West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude price in first quarter 2019 was lower than the year ago period  In January  February and March  WTI averaged  51 38   54 95 and  58 15 per barrel respectively  per the   In comparison  WTI averaged  63 70   62 23 and  62 73 per barrel  respectively  in the first three months of 2018  ConocoPhillips has an oil heavy portfolio and the year over year decline in crude price may hurt the company s upstream businesses The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter total production is pegged at 1 340 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBOED   indicating a rise from the year ago reported figure of 1 269 MBOED but decline from the last reported quarter s 1 357 MBOED The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter crude production is pegged at 713 thousand barrels per day  MBD   implying a rise from the year ago reported figure of 636 MBD but decrease from the last reported quarter s 717 MBD The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter natural gas output is pegged at 2 752 million cubic feet per day  MMCFD   suggesting a decrease from the year ago reported figure of 2 828 MMCFD and the last reported quarter s 2 785 MMCFD The Zacks Consensus Estimate for natural gas liquids production is pegged at 107 MBD  pointing to growth from 96 MBD in the prior year period and 105 MBD in the last reported quarter Hence  ramp up in year over year crude oil and natural gas liquids production is expected to boost first quarter earnings  However  lower crude prices and natural gas output compared with the year ago period may play spoilsport in the to be reported quarter What Our Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that ConocoPhillips is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter to be reported  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  this is not the case here as elaborated below Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  ConocoPhillips has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 92 cents You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  ConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank of 2 increases the predictive power of ESP  a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult  You can see  We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative

188612,410128,COP,Is A Beat Likely For TechnipFMC  FTI  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"TechnipFMC plc   NYSE FTI   is set to release first quarter 2019 results after the closing bell on Apr 25  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is a profit of 30 cents on revenues of  3 2 billion The oilfield services provider reported fourth quarter 2018 adjusted loss of 9 cents a share  lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 37 cents  Weaker contribution from the subsea segment due to high impairment charges led to the underperformance  Coming to earnings surprise history  the company has a dismal record of missing estimates in each of the last four quarters  resulting in average of 45 86  However  the trend is expected to reverse in the to be reported quarter as our proven model predicts that TechnipFMC is likely to beat on earnings this time around Which way are top and bottom line estimates headed The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter earnings has moved up a penny in a month s time to 30 cents per share  This indicates an increase of about 7  from the year ago reported figure of 28 cents  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  3 163 million  suggesting an improvement from  3 125 billion reported in the prior year quarter TechnipFMC plc Price and EPS Surprise
    Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proprietary model shows that TechnipFMC is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to be reported quarter  as it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  7 90   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate for earnings is pegged two cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents a share  A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise Zacks Rank  TechnipFMC currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  A Zacks Rank  3  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us confident of an earnings beat Conversely  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Factors to ConsiderFollowing the oil crash toward the end of 2018 that caught everyone off guard  WTI crude popped up to  60 55 a barrel in the March quarter of 2019  witnessing the fastest rate of oil price increase since a decade  Crude prices rebounded 30  in the first quarter  underpinned mainly by OPEC  supply cuts and U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran  which boded well for oilfield services companies like TechnipFMC  Ramped up upstream operations  attributable to favorable oil price  may result in greater number of contracts in the first quarter  As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for TechnipFMC s total inbound orders is pegged at  4 325 million  implying a rise from the year ago reported figure of  3 487 million Increasing onshore activities amid crude uptick and gradually improving offshore drilling bode well for its upcoming earnings release  Evidently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s first quarter backlog for Onshore Offshore segment is pegged at  8 563 million  signaling an increase from the prior year reported figure of  7 492 million  Further  first quarter revenues for Subsea and Surface Technologies segments are estimated at  1 258 million and  397 million  pointing to growth from the year ago reported figure of  1 180 million and  372 million  respectively While TechnipFMC may feel the pressure from competitively priced backlog and reduced day rates  the firm will likely tide over the hurdles on the back of increasing upstream activities and inbound orders in the wake of crude recovery in first quarter 2019 Other Stocks to ConsiderTechnipFMC is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season  Here are some other companies from the same space  which according to our model also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter Cabot Oil   Gas Corporation   NYSE COG   has an Earnings ESP of  4 43  and a Zacks Rank  1  The firm is expected to release first quarter earnings on Apr 26  You can see  ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   has an Earnings ESP of  1 55  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is anticipated to release quarterly earnings on Apr 30 Encana Corporation   NYSE ECA   has an Earnings ESP of  44 83  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is anticipated to release first quarter earnings on Apr 30 Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See how you can more effectively safeguard your retirement with a new Special Report   4 Warning Signs Your Investment Advisor Might Be Sabotaging Your Financial Future  ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-a-beat-likely-for-technipfmc-fti-this-earnings-season-200409066,200409066
188615,410131,COP,Earnings Preview  ConocoPhillips  COP  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 92 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 2  
Revenues are expected to be  9 16 billion  up 2 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 21 56  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ConocoPhillips 
For ConocoPhillips  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ConocoPhillips will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ConocoPhillips would post earnings of  0 99 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 13  delivering a surprise of  14 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

188627,410143,COP,Oil to Open  18 Stuck Between Thirst to Grow  Wary Investors,news," Bloomberg     Investor exhaustion with poor returns from the oil and gas industry may mean less financing to expand the U S  shale boom next year  and less of a drive for consolidation 
After nearing a record in 2016  equity issues from U S  oil and gas companies are on pace for an eight year low this year  amid doubts about the stability of the rally in global crude prices  Mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings got off to a strong start but petered out as the year wore on 
While explorers including Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  have preached the need for fiscal discipline  investors remain skeptical  said Bobby Tudor  chairman of Houston based investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt   Co  That s tightened the flow of new money into the industry  and it s likely to chill deal making as buyers and sellers alike wait for stock prices to rebound 
 You ve had a decoupling  where the companies have not followed oil prices higher  and the investor apathy has been stunning   Tudor said in a telephone interview   What investors are saying is that as soon as oil peaks its nose above the parapet of  60 a barrel  the switch will go on and all those drilling rigs will go back to work  
West Texas Intermediate crude futures steadied just above  57 a barrel Tuesday  up almost 7 percent for the year  as traders digested last week s decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to extend supply curbs through 2018  Still  as prices rise  so do investor fears that shale drillers    companies used to emphasizing growth above all else    will refocus on boosting production 
The S P 500 Energy Index is down 7 5 percent for 2017  It s a sign of the skepticism that has rippled through capital markets all year 
U S  energy stock issues topped  41 billion last year  as explorers including Anadarko   Devon Energy  Corp  NYSE DVN   and Concho Resources Inc  looked to shore up finances amid weak oil prices or to fund expansion into new shale plays  This year  offerings are down by half  at  19 9 billion as of Monday  The number of issues is down as well  from 110 last year to 63 so far in 2017 
The industry has turned instead to debt financing  with high yield energy bond issues almost doubling this year to more than  50 billion  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  The bond numbers were inflated somewhat by a series of refinancing deals by top drillers  as well as a bevy of issues by pipeline companies 
Initial public offerings by U S  oil and gas companies climbed in 2017  dominated by spinoffs of pipeline and infrastructure divisions by the likes of  Hess Corp   NYSE HES   and  BP   LON BP  Plc  Still  IPOs trailed off in the second half of the year  with only one new issue so far in the fourth quarter    by Houston based oilfield water management business AQTWM Inc 
M A followed the same pattern  surging early on as explorers shelled out billions for acreage in shale plays like the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico  Activity tailed off as pessimism spread among investors  Would be buyers found their stock prices no longer an attractive currency to finance deals  and sellers were unhappy with the offers they received  although private equity backed transactions picked up some of the slack 
That s unlikely to change any time soon  said Tudor  With equity markets now focused on share buybacks  dividends and other returns  there s less appetite for acquisitions that simply grow a company s inventory of wells to drill  he said  Investors will need to see two to three quarters of fiscal discipline and growing cash flows before the climate shifts  he predicted 
 The equity window is closed   Tudor said   The market is basically saying   No  I d rather you grow less and actually give me back some money

188645,410161,COP,Low Oil Prices Dim GOP Bid for Budget Bonanza in Arctic Drilling,news," Bloomberg     Congressional Republicans counting on a  1 billion windfall from selling oil drilling rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to help pay for tax cuts may be in for a disappointment 
Data from previous Arctic oil lease sales suggest the U S  is likely to collect less than a fifth of that billion dollar goal over the next decade   about  145 5 million    from auctioning off territory in the sprawling northeast Alaska refuge where caribou calve and polar bears roam  
Oil companies may be scared away by the controversies and costs of drilling in that remote and fragile terrain  Even if they aren t  crude prices would have to be some  15 more per barrel than they are today to make the effort pay off at all 
The potential revenues from drilling on Alaska s north coast are in the spotlight because a Senate passed budget resolution instructs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to come up with  1 billion in deficit reductions over the next decade to help offset the costs of a  1 5 trillion tax cut package  The panel is scheduled to hold a hearing on drilling in ANWR on Thursday 
 It s pure fantasy that the Arctic refuge is going to generate anywhere close to the kind of revenues that are being spouted about right now   said Adam Kolton  executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League  which opposes ANWR drilling   This is a dry hole in the budget  
The idea of tapping the 19 million acre preserve for its potential oil bounty has long been debated in Washington  pitting energy industry advocates who see it as a way to revive production on Alaska s North Slope against environmentalists who argue the activity would jeopardize a pristine wilderness with arctic foxes  polar bears and caribou herds 
Read More  Republican Tactic Aims to Open Eastern Gulf  Arctic to Oil Rigs
For decades  industry allies argued ANWR drilling was necessary to boost energy security and to create jobs  Now  after a shale drilling boom made the U S  the world s largest producer of oil and gas  proponents argue it s essential for the state and federal budget 
Republicans are using congressional budget rules to advance both Arctic drilling and a planned tax overhaul  Legislation following the budget resolution s instructions is immune from the kind of Democratic filibuster that has blocked previous bids to drill in ANWR  making the prospects for drilling there more likely than it has been than at any time in the last four decades  
Selling ANWR oil leases could yield significant royalties down the road  But that would only come after successful discoveries and construction of production facilities    not to mention near certain lawsuits along the way 
By contrast  congressional revenue projections are built on a 10 year time frame  counting only the government s possible haul from selling drilling rights    not royalty checks tied to possible later oil production 
It s not clear how many energy companies would actually pursue the opportunity 
A 2005 U S  Geological Survey review based on decades old data said the refuge might hold between 4 3 billion and 11 8 billion barrels of undiscovered but technically recoverable crude  That would rival the size of the mammoth Prudhoe Bay field that sparked the Alaskan oil rush four decades ago  
But the government analysis did not project the commercial viability of ANWR development  Oil prices would have to be about  70 per barrel to justify production there  analysts say  The benchmark U S  price was less than  55 Monday  Drilling in Alaska typically costs three times as much as in the Lower 48  according to industry researcher IHS Markit Inc 
 The coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge does not have promising oil bearing rock formations   says Christopher Lewis  a retired petroleum geologist who worked for  BP   LON BP  Plc on the Prudhoe Bay field and was a member of the American Petroleum Institute s exploration committee   There is not great interest in developing the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  There are safer bets  
Oil companies eager to maintain North Slope production and find new resources to fill the Trans Alaska Pipeline System are more likely to turn to the National Petroleum Reserve  a 23 5 million area in northwest Alaska explicitly set aside for energy development  It s closer to existing infrastructure and less controversial 
ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  already has operations in the petroleum reserve  but says that if ANWR were open for leasing   we would consider it against other opportunities in our portfolio  
 That being said  we see tremendous potential in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska and remain focused on our projects and exploration plans there   spokeswoman Natalie Lowman said

To tackle ANWR  oil companies would have to navigate  costly logistics  lengthy permitting and opposition from environmental groups   the research firm Wood Mackenzie said in a report last year  And all of that could be undone by the next presidential election  
 A future shift in the political landscape could put development of a potential discovery at risk   the firm wrote  Studies show ANWR s coastal plain holds  the largest undeveloped conventional oil resources to be found in the U S    and they  could be developed in an environmentally responsible way   said Erik Milito  a director with the American Petroleum Institute 
But the cost and complexity of operating in the Arctic magnify concerns about  regulatory uncertainty that discourage investment of the large amounts of capital required for projects in the Arctic   he said 
Matt Lee Ashley  a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress  said companies that do step up to the auction block probably would discount their bids because of the policy and legal uncertainty    and the bad publicity

 If you re a CEO  that s the X factor    how much do we put in a pot of litigation   said David Murphy  an assistant professor of environmental studies at St  Lawrence University who has analyzed North Slope lease sales 
Aside from those risks  the average bid for North Slope leases  both offshore and onshore  since 2000 is  194 an acre  according to an analysis Murphy prepared for the Alaska Wilderness League  Bids on ANWR s coastal plain would need to be more than six times that     1 333 an acre    with every single acre drawing a bid in order to raise  2 billion  The U S  and state of Alaska would likely split the proceeds  so that would make the net for the U S  Treasury  1 billion 
 You re counting in assumption after assumption after assumption   Murphy said  At a certain point   you re just making stuff up about what the future might hold  
Even a 2008 Chukchi Sea lease sale    in which Royal Dutch Shell stunned observers by spending  2 1 billion snapping up offshore leases    had an average price below the necessary threshold  amounting to  977 per acre 
Doug Reynolds  an energy economist at the University of Alaska  says the Trump administration s projections on ANWR related revenue over the next decade sounds ambitious  but that shouldn t deter lawmakers from allowing drilling there 
 No one really knows what s in ANWR   he said   Why not open ANWR as an oil security back stop  It can help national security and possibly save American lives  
To argue against the move  environmentalists have been appealing to unlikely allies  fiscal hawks in Congress 
 Counting on any kind of revenue from leasing in the Arctic refuge    let alone the numbers that are being thrown around    is the height of fiscal irresponsibility   said Niel Lawrence  Alaska Director for the Natural Resources Defense Council  This  is a way to increase the federal deficit  not decrease it  ",2017-10-31,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/low-oil-prices-dim-gop-bid-for-budget-bonanza-in-arctic-drilling-761074,761074

stakes in the same The Keystone XL pipeline permit would not only create jobs  but also boost the economy as well as energy security  It is believed to provide the much needed respite from takeaway constraints in the safest and most efficient manner Past Challenges GaloreThe  8 billion Keystone XL pipeline  with a capacity of 830 000 barrels  was designed to improve oil extraction from Alberta s oil sands and the Bakken region  The initial phase of the pipeline project was completed in 2011  A proposal was made to add another 1179 miles to the 2100 mile long pipeline The proposed extension was strongly opposed by environmentalists and politicians  owing to the risk of emitting greenhouse gases in transporting bitumen and crude to the United States  In November 2015  president Obama rejected TransCanada s application to construct the Keystone XL pipeline on fears that it would weaken United States  position in international climate change negotiations  However  in 2017  the project was cleared by President Trump as he was of the opinion that the development of such pipelines can revive the economy The pipeline cleared a major regulatory hurdle in November 2017 when Nebraska commissioners approved the Keystone XL project  although on an alternative route to the one proposed by the company  The alternate route will likely balloon costs and further delay the disputed pipeline project  The alternate path calls for a 63 mile detour  and attempts to add 5 miles of pipeline along with additional transmission lines  and pumping stations Last November  U S  federal judge Brian Morris stalled the pre construction work on Keystone and issued a decree to conduct a fresh environmental evaluation of the pipeline  Morris was of the view that under the alternative route that is likely to be longer  the pipeline would run across different countries and water bodies  posing environmental risks to indigenous communities and marine life  The decision was also upheld by the Ninth U S  Circuit Court of Appeals Can the Permit Put an End to All Worries Well  the recent presidential permit replaces the one granted in 2017 and attempts to remove the roadblock related to the pipeline s construction  The move is likely to boost the development of the project  which will transport tar sands from Canada to the U S  Gulf Coast   Notably  a spokesman from the White House has stated   Specifically  this permit reinforces  as should have been clear all along  that the presidential permit is indeed an exercise of presidential authority that is not subject to judicial reviews under the Administrative Procedure Act  While Trump s clearance should have eliminated all the uncertainties associated with the Keystone project  the green campaigners are still very much against the pipeline s construction  and have vowed to continue the legal fights and prospects  Although the presidential permit seeks to bring the 10 year environment review to closure  we believe that the project is still likely to face hurdles The project continues to face challenges in Nebraska  pursuant to a lawsuit currently pending before the state s Supreme Court  Further  TransCanada needs various water permits in South Dakota  Needless to say  there s bound to be opposition from the environmentalists  Hence  while the move has paved way for commencing the pipeline s preliminary work  we believe that the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company needs to overcome a few other challenges that might complicate the construction of this hotly contested pipeline  You can

188667,410183,COP,Can ConocoPhillips  COP  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   This company  which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this energy company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 15 19   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  ConocoPhillips was expected to post earnings of  0 99 per share  but it reported  1 13 per share instead  representing a surprise of 14 14   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 17 per share  while it actually produced  1 36 per share  a surprise of 16 24  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for ConocoPhillips  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
ConocoPhillips has an Earnings ESP of  50 94  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-conocophillips-cop-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200403184,200403184

188684,410200,COP,4 Solid Reasons To Invest In ConocoPhillips Stock Right Now,opinion,ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   looks compelling at the moment  Given the company s strong fundamentals  it seems like this is the right time to add the stock to your portfolio In terms of production and proved reserves  ConocoPhillips   headquartered in Houston  TX   is the largest oil and gas exploration and production player in the world  The company s operations are spread across 17 countries  including the United States  Colombia  Chile  Norway  the United Kingdom and many other nations  Recently  ConocoPhillips received afavorableruling from the World Bank s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for the seizure of its assets by the Venezuelan government in 2007  Per the ruling  Venezuela has to pay  8 7 billion to ConocoPhillips  making it one of the largest arbitration settlements ever Notably  the company currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which means that it is poised to outperform the market Let s delve deeper toanalyzethe factors that make this upstream energy player an attractive investment option at the moment Strategic U S  Acreage PositionThe bulk of acres that ConocoPhillips holds in the three big unconventional plays that include Eagle Ford shale  Delaware basin and Bakken shale plays are rich in oil  The company is planning to operate 10 11 rigs in these prolific plays through 2019  From the three unconventional plays  ConocoPhillips projects compound annual production growth rate of more than 25  in the 2017 2019 time frame  Notably  significant opportunities are left for ConocoPhillips in the Eagle Ford shale  wherein it owns about 3 400 undrilled locations that could lend access to almost 2 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent estimated potential reserves Efficient ManagementConocoPhillips is focused on divesting non core assets  so that it can allocate the funds for growth projects and acquisitions  Notably  the company generated  1 1 billion from its divestment program  which will be used for efficient capital allocation Moreover  ConocoPhillips  2019 capital spending is projected at  6 1 billion  marginally lower than 2018 levels  However  production is expected between 1 300 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBOED  and 1 350 MBOED  representing 5  growth on a pro forma basis  The production growth is anticipated on the back of consistent ramp up of unconventional production in the Lower 48 and conventional production increases in Alaska Strong Balance SheetThe balance sheet of ConocoPhillips is significantly less leveraged than the industry it belongs to  Importantly  in 2018  ConocoPhillips managed to reduce debt burden to reach its target of roughly  15 billion  much earlier than expected  The company has a debt to capitalization ratio of 32   lower than the industry average  As of Dec 31  2018  the oil giant  with a market capitalization of around  75 billion  had  6 2 billion in total cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash Increasing Shareholder ValueThe upstream energy player is strongly committed to returning cash to its shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases  In fact  investors would be thrilled to knowthat ConocoPhillips is planning to buy back  3 billion of shares through 2019  as it did last year  After raising dividend by 15  through 2018  the company is planning to grow its dividend further this year Wrapping UpA clear picture is derived from the above mentioned growth drivers  which differentiate ConocoPhillips from peers  The upstream giant has a strong acreage position in the United States  which is reflective of tremendous growth potential  The efficient management of the company can ensure that the targets are achieved within the expected time period and well within budget  A strong balance sheet  which its peers lack  provides management with financial flexibility to achieve its goals  The company has gained 26 2

188705,410221,COP,Qatar shows mettle  offers compromise as Gulf states prepare meeting,news,"By Tom Finn and Rania El Gamal DOHA  Reuters    Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas  LNG  production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbors  but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement  Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran  Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider   What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution  based on dialogue  we believe should be sufficient  to show  we have carried out our duties from our side   Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani told a news conference in Doha   There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front  countering terrorism financing     but of course there is always room for improvement   he said  describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism   The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond  Western states fear a lengthy dispute  besides threatening political instability  could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties    We hope others will respond in a similar spirit  Qatar says it is ready to meet any  reasonable  demands   But the Gulf state  with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia s 31 million  may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base   matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty  Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday  when the state owned Qatar Petroleum  QATPE UL  announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent  Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia  the United States and Russia vie  LNG is natural gas liquified at low temperatures to reduce its volume  thus allowing it to be transported by tanker where pipelines are not feasible  Qatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field  which it shares with Iran  by 20 percent after new gas development  In April  Qatar lifted a self imposed ban on development of the North Field  the world s biggest natural gas field  and announced a new project to develop its southern section  increasing output in five to seven years  That new project will raise Qatar s total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year in five to seven years  Kaabi said  The decision will have international ramifications  With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia  the Qatari move means U S  producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors  So far only Cheniere  A LNG  exports U S  LNG  but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes year  Energy sales have driven Qatar s rapid rise as a regional player  with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbors  The Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar  speaking at a news conference  said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end  in the coming hours  with the Qatari response to demands   We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses   he said   We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region    If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures   IRANIAN QUESTION The LNG glut has already driven down prices  Asian spot LNG prices LNG AS have fallen more than 40 percent this year to  5 50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014  So far  the majority of LNG is supplied via long term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes  With supplies far outpacing demand  analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded  Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions  Kaabi  alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha  said the company s operations would not be affected by the crisis   Qatar Petroleum will continue working   If some companies decide they don t want to work with QP that s their choice  We will find other foreign companies to work with   he said  Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market  mainly from Australia  the United States and Russia   It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field  which means they can up production from their side of the field  North Field  without destabilizing the geology of the field   said Oliver Sanderson  gas analyst at Thomson Reuters  Some experts say that  while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran  their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field   Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before  I don t believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran  if in the long term the  political  situation stayed same as now   said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei  president of London based ENEXD  a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East    Also  major  oil  companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi UAE and Egypt  otherwise there be sanctions against them  That s why I don t think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before  politically not financially   he added  Qatar Petroleum s Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field  but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field  While QP owns a majority stake  energy firms including Total  Mitsui   Co  T 8031  and ConocoPhillips  N COP  also possess small stakeholdings  RasGas is a 70 30 percent joint venture between QP and  Exxon Mobil   N XOM    Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world  It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world   said Ajay Singh  special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell  LON

188723,410239,COP,Exxon says Qatar LNG not affected by Arab states tension,news,"By Ernest Scheyder
 Reuters     Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  said on Tuesday that production and exports of liquefied natural gas from Qatar have not been affected by rising diplomatic tensions in the Middle East 
Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  Bahrain and Egypt on Monday cut ties with Qatar  accusing the country of supporting extremism  Qatar denies the allegations 
The growing diplomatic rift has raised concerns about global access to Qatar s LNG  especially after some regional ports in the Persian Gulf said they would not accept Qatari flagged vessels 
Commodities traders have grown concerned Qatar s LNG could be barred from Saudi Arabia or from traversing Egypt s Suez Canal  though so far no limitations have been imposed 
Maersk  CO MAERSKb   the world s biggest container shipping line  said on Tuesday it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar in the wake of the diplomatic rift 
Qatar and Exxon have had development agreements for more than a decade  with Exxon helping Qatar to become the world s largest LNG exporter  Exxon  working with government controlled energy company Qatar Petroleum  QATPE UL   has invested in LNG processing plants  transport ships and related infrastructure 
The pair  which earlier this year were awarded a contract to explore for gas off the coast of Cyprus  also control the Golden Pass LNG facility in the United States with ConocoPhillips  N COP  
Despite the diplomatic tension with other Arab States  a key Qatari gas export pipeline to the United Arab Emirates is still operating  Exxon said its production and export of LNG from Qatar have not been affected 
 As a matter of practice  we don t comment on matters between governments   Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement to Reuters 
Exxon has said that a large portion of its Qatari LNG production is under long term supply contracts  meaning the company must supply gas from Qatar or some other source  Exxon does have a large LNG operation in Papua New Guinea 
Qatar has reassured clients in Japan and India that LNG shipments will not be affected by the tension

188727,410243,COP,ConocoPhillips  COP  Q4 Earnings Surpass Estimates,opinion,"ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 13 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 99 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 45 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14 14   A quarter ago  it was expected that this energy company would post earnings of  1 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 36  delivering a surprise of 16 24  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
ConocoPhillips  which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  posted revenues of  10 36 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 22   This compares to year ago revenues of  8 74 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
ConocoPhillips shares have added about 5 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 7  
What s Next for ConocoPhillips 
While ConocoPhillips has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for ConocoPhillips was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

188742,410258,COP,ConocoPhillips  COP  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 96 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  113 3  
Revenues are expected to be  10 16 billion  up 16 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 50 16  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ConocoPhillips 
For ConocoPhillips  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 91  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ConocoPhillips will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ConocoPhillips would post earnings of  1 17 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 36  delivering a surprise of  16 24  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ConocoPhillips doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/conocophillips-cop-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200378905,200378905

The vast offshore field  which Qatar calls the North Field and Iran calls South Pars  accounts for nearly all of Qatar Petroleum s gas production and  60  of its export revenue 
Ending its self imposed moratorium on new gas projects and earmarking new volumes for exports means Qatar would be poised to reclaim the top spot among exporters of liquefied natural gas it expects to cede to Australia 
The move also signals Qatar s confidence in the longevity of gas demand and its ability to remain a low cost supplier in a market that has slumped amid a glut driven by output from U S  shale and Australia

capital expenditures for 2018 Total budget allocated to the Lower 48  Alaska  Canada  Europe and North Africa  Asia Pacific and Middle East as well as Others regions is about 51   20   8   11   8  and 2   respectively About  3 1 billion will be invested in Lower 48 in 2019  flat from 2018 levels  The amount will be used to operate 10 11 rigs across the Eagle Ford  Bakken and Delaware  Big 3  unconventional plays  Provisions have also been made to carry out multi well pilots of new completion designs that are expected to boost future resource and are relevant for other unconventional plays  Additionally  investments will be made for exploration and appraisal in areas such as the Louisiana Austin Chalk play as well as base maintenance and conventional drilling across Lower 48 Alaska has been allocated about  1 2 billion  up 33 3  from  0 9 billion in 2018  The upside can be attributed to higher activity and higher working interest in existing fields including the recently approved GMT 2 Exploration activities for evaluating the successful Willow discovery will be offset by the roll off of spending on GMT 1  The budget also includes an amount for the earlier announced Kuparuk transaction  which is expected to close by the end of 2018About  0 5 billion or about 8  has been allocated to Canada  up from about  0 3 billion in 2018  The increase was led by ongoing appraisal and development activity in the Montney unconventional program  in which ConocoPhillips considerably raised 100  owned and operated position in the liquids rich window of the play in 2018  Operations are currently underway to drill a multi well pad and install processing capacity to evaluate this position  The upside also includes Surmont upgrades to boost diluent flexibility and improve profitability Europe and North Africa have been apportioned about  0 7 billion  or about 11  compared with expected amount of  0 9 billion in 2018  The cutback reflects the earlier announced disposition of partial interest in the Clair field in the United Kingdom  which is likely to close by the end of 2018  North Sea plans include further development in the United Kingdom and Norwegian sectors Asia Pacific and Middle East have been allocated about  0 5 billion or about 8   up fromestimated 0 7 billion in 2018  In the region  ConocoPhillips is progressing with plans to backfill the Darwin natural gas

other activities in 2019  including corporate programs  up from  0 2 billion estimated expenditures in 2018 In 2019  ConocoPhillips expects production between 1 300 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBOED  to 1 350 MBOED  This excludes Libya and does not reflect potential impacts from probable dispositions in 2019 or mandated production cut at Surmont  The projection represents 5  production growth on a pro forma basis  In 2019  production growth is anticipated on the back of consistent ramp up of unconventional production in the Lower 48 and conventional production increases in Alaska In 2019  ConocoPhillips anticipates to boost payout to shareholders to more than 30  of cash from operations from 20 30   The share repurchases are estimated at  3 billion  representing a payout to shareholders  including dividends  of about 50  of cash from operations  Moreover  at 2018 end  resource base is expected at 16 billion BOE at less than  40 per barrel WTI cost of supply The 2019 production views were released amid oversupply in the global oil markets  This compelled producer group OPEC and other key exporters to agree on reducing crude output from January  However  ConocoPhillips along with Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   and Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   have increased their production estimates for 2019  The companies intend to focus on implementing a

COP s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  4 53 per share and revenue of  38 74 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  655  and  18 89   respectively 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for COP  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Within the past 30 days  our consensus EPS projection has moved 4 66  lower  COP is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

188781,410297,COP,Amidst Market Carnage  Precious Metals Push Higher ,opinion,"The much awaited and hoped for Santa Claus rally turned into a complete rout today as the broader markets continued to sell off to new lows this month  The Dow Jones plunged a stunning 653 points today  the worst in the in the 122 year old history of the index   Furthermore  the Dow is on track for its biggest December loss since the Great Depression 
The Dow Jones was trading at nearly 26 000 at the beginning of December and just closed at 21 792  That is a 16  decline so far this month  The Dow Index had a critical support level of 24 000 and reached a high of 26 000 at the beginning of 2018  It has been trading up and down off the 24 000 support level for the entire year  The index actually hit another record high of nearly 27 000 at the beginning of October 
When the Dow finally closes below the 24 000 on a monthly basis  it can get very ugly  We still have three full trading days and a half day on New Year s Eve for the Plunge Protection Team to do their magic and push the Dow back above the 24 000 level  but I doubt they will be able to do so  If the Index was down 500 1 000 points from the 24 000 level  then it might be possible  However  the Dow is down 2 200 points from that level 
Here is my updated Dow Jones Index with the monthly support and resistance levels 

You will notice that the present Dow  monthly  candlestick is the biggest decline ever  It s even larger than the 3 000  point drop in October 2008  shown by the RED ARROW  However  if you look at that candlestick  it recovered from its lows that month  According to the data  the Dow Jones opened on October 2008 at 10 847  fell to a low of 7 773 and closed at the last day of the month at 9 325  That is why it has that large wick at the bottom of the candlestick 
That could also happen to the Dow for the remainder of December  We might see a nice rally  so traders won t get too nervous about the market in 2019  Either way  I believe the Dow will still drop to the 50 MA  BLUE LINE  at 20 470 and then we might see a nice correction higher before the continued BEAR MARKET 
If the market behaves similar as to what took place in 2007 2009  the Dow Jones Index will likely fall back below the 14 000 level by the summer  fall in 2019  or even sooner  Yes  of course  the Fed might get nervous and stop raising interest rates and start QE money printing again  That would change the dynamics of the market as we would then be entering the beginning stages of hyperinflation  If the Fed continues to raise interest rates as it says two more times in 2019  then we are going to see a continued sell off in the broader markets 

It was very interesting to see just about everything trade deeply in the RED today except for the precious metals  Gold is up nicely by  13  and silver gained nearly 1   Even the U S  dollar index fell 33 points  I was quite surprised to see the oil price fall that much on Christmas Eve after it has been down 40  since the beginning of October  The West Texas Intermediate Oil price fell  2 91 to a new low of  42 53  That is very bad news because it is now below the very critical 400 Month MA  PINK LINE  of  43 83 

With the oil price now trading at  42 53  even more of the U S  Shale Oil producers are now hemorrhaging losses  I have since updated the chart by Art Berman to include to the oil price line below 

With the current oil price of  42 53  only one company  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  is making money  Even though the average oil price for Q4 will be much higher than the present spot price  these companies will likely be facing  40  45 for Q1 Q2  If the oil price does remain that low in the first half of 2019  watch for serious fireworks in the U S  Shale Oil Patch 
Finally  I am glad that I am a precious metals investor because 2019 is going to be one memorable year

188790,410306,COP,Obama bans new oil  gas drilling off Alaska  part of Atlantic coast,news,"By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Barack Obama on Tuesday banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans  in a push to leave his stamp on the environment before Republican Donald Trump takes office next month  Obama used a 1950s era law called the Outer Continental Shelf Act that allows presidents to limit areas from mineral leasing and drilling  Environmental groups said that meant Trump s incoming administration would have to go court if it sought to reverse the move  The ban affects 115 million acres  46 5 million hectares  of federal waters off Alaska in the Chukchi Sea and most of the Beaufort Sea and 3 8 million acres  1 5 million hectares  in the Atlantic from New England to Chesapeake Bay   Trump  who succeeds Obama on Jan  20  has said he would expand offshore oil and gas drilling  A recent memo from his energy transition team said his policy could increase production in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas  as well as the mid  and south Atlantic  A Trump representative did not immediately comment on the announcement  Even if Trump tries to fight the move  few energy companies have expressed a desire to drill anytime soon off the coasts thanks to abundant cheap shale oil in North Dakota and Texas   Exploratory drilling in the Arctic is expensive and risky  Shell  LON RDSa  Oil ended its quest to explore in harsh Arctic waters in 2015  after a vessel it was using suffered a gash and environmentalists uncovered a law that limited its drilling  The American Petroleum Institute oil industry group disagreed about the permanence of the ban and said Trump could likely use a presidential memorandum to lift it   We are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this decision as the nation continues to need a robust strategy for developing offshore and onshore energy   said Erik Milito  API s upstream director   JOINT ACTION WITH CANADA The White House and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jointly announced their move to launch  actions ensuring a strong  sustainable and viable Arctic economy and ecosystem    Obama said in a statement that the joint actions  reflect the scientific assessment that  even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place  the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region s harsh conditions is limited   Canada will designate all Arctic Canadian waters as indefinitely off limits to future offshore Arctic oil and gas licensing  to be reviewed every five years through a climate and marine science based life cycle assessment  The law under which Obama is acting enables a president to withdraw certain areas from leasing or drilling  for any public purpose   such as to limit the impacts of climate change  according to a legal briefing by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Earth Justice  Under that law  a president is not authorized to  undo  a previous withdrawal  making it more difficult for Trump to target without a lawsuit    No president has ever tried to undo a permanent withdrawal of an ocean area from leasing eligibility   said Niel Lawrence  Alaska director and attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council  The provision has been used by six presidents from both parties over the past 65 years  including to withdraw as much as several hundred million acres at a time  he said    SMART BUSINESS DECISION  In 2015  just 0 1 percent of U S  federal offshore crude production came from the Arctic  At current oil prices  significant production in the Arctic will not occur  according to a Department of Interior analysis  There is currently no crude oil production in the Canadian Arctic  A number of companies including  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Imperial Oil hold exploration licenses  but all three have put their drilling plans on hold  partly because of weak global oil prices  On the U S  Atlantic coast  local groups have opposed offshore drilling and would fight the Trump administration s attempts to open it up   The people of the Atlantic coast have refused to allow their way of life to be compromised   said Jacqueline Savitz  senior vice president of Florida based ocean conservancy group Oceana

188791,410307,COP,Oil business seen in strong position as Trump tackles tax reform,news,"By David Morgan WASHINGTON  Reuters    Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports  given that President elect Donald Trump s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices   Trump s emerging leadership includes  Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state  former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator  Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector   And in Congress  both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties  including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady  a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs  House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U S  corporate overseas profits   But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy  Though intended to boost U S  manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax  the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports  Because U S  oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline  diesel and other products  analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth  Integrated oil companies such as Exxon   Chevron  Corp  N CVX    BP  Plc  L BP   Royal Dutch Shell Plc  L RDSa  and ConocoPhillips  N COP  could also be hit  depending on whether they are net importers   But the industry s allies would likely move to soften any rough edges  analysts say    I don t see this mix of leadership figures in the House  Senate and the White House  doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices   said Peter Cohn  an energy analyst with Height Securities  a Washington based investment firm  The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries  including retailers and automakers  which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income  Such a knock on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected  1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade    We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully   Chet Thompson  president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group  said in a statement  Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and  listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out    Moreover  some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs  saying the dollar s value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports  Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude  they predict   This argument by the oil industry is  frankly  all wrong   said Douglas Holtz Eakin  former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  who now heads the American Action Forum think tank   Refiners are going to be basically held harmless  They ll have a lower dollar price of oil  Net cost is the same  And they go about their business  I m unsympathetic   he added  Height Securities  Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers   Trump doesn t want to have refineries closing on his watch    Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan  But they stand to gain more than they will lose  For instance  an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent  Under the congressional Republicans  plan  the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent  under Trump s plan  to 15 percent  Similarly  companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments   
Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries  Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether  while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate ",2017-01-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-business-seen-in-strong-position-as-trump-tackles-tax-reform-450815,450815
188795,410311,COP,Big Oil back on the acquisition trail as outlook brightens,news,"By Ron Bousso LONDON  Reuters    The world s top oil companies are back in acquisition mode  targeting smaller exploration and development firms to boost oil and gas reserves rather than the mega mergers that followed previous slumps in crude prices  Since late November  major oil companies have announced 11 deals worth more than  500 million each with a combined value of  31 billion  the clearest sign yet that oil executives are more confident a recovery is underway  When crude prices collapsed in the second half of 2014  large oil firms slashed spending on exploration and production and offloaded assets to reduce debt so they could cope with lower revenue from oil and gas sales  But with crude reservoirs declining at a rate of 10 percent a year in some cases  major oil companies are now looking to snap up assets to start growing again and there are plenty of smaller firms burdened with debt looking to sell   You re seeing the majors sharpening their pencils after a long while and actually flipping around from disposals to acquisitions   said Tony Durrant  chief executive of British energy firm  Premier Oil   L PMO   which is looking to sell several stakes in its North Sea operations   Total  acquisitions of oil and gas fields  known as upstream assets  tripled to  31 billion in December from a month earlier  when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output for the first time in eight years  according to data from consultancy Energy Market Square  NYSE SQ   Deals in the last month of 2016 alone accounted for nearly a quarter of total activity during the year     MAJOR DEALS   BP   L BP  announced a string of investments in the last two months of 2016  including a  1 billion partnership with Dallas based Kosmos Energy  N KOS  in Mauritania and Senegal in West Africa  as well as acquisitions in Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan  The British company also spent  375 million on a 10 percent stake in Eni s  MI ENI  giant Zohr gas field in Egypt while Russian oil giant Rosneft  MM ROSN  bought 30 percent stake of the same field for  1 575 billion  France s Total  PA TOTF  and Norway s  Statoil   OL STL  bought into Brazil s lucrative sub salt deepwater oil fields while ExxonMobil Corp  N XOM  bought assets in Papua New Guinea to meet growing Asian demand for liquefied natural gas  The trend continued in January with Total boosting its stake in Uganda s Lake Albert oil project by snapping up most of Tullow Oil s  L TLW  stake for  900 million   ExxonMobile and  Noble Energy   N NBL  also struck deals worth nearly  10 billion combined for a larger slice of the Permian Basin  the largest U S  oil field  While deal making outside the United States almost ground to a halt at the start of 2016  acquisitions in North American shale basins have continued at a steady pace  In the Permian Basin  for example  the time it takes to produce oil and gas after an initial investment is far quicker and cheaper than developing conventional fields over three to five years  ONLY CHOICE More deals are likely this year as the large overhang of crude oil in the world that has weighed on the market since 2014 continues to clear and oil prices rise   When you can cut capex  capital spending   two and a half to three years later you see production decline and reserves depleting and you have one choice only and that is going after high quality resource   said Sachin Oza  co manager with Stephen Williams of the Guinness Global Oil and Gas Exploration Trust   If you ve not spent any time filling your hopper with these opportunities that take five years to build up  there is only one choice  you have to buy them   said Oza  The Guinness Trust is a fund that invests in firms in the early stages of exploration or development of energy resources which it believes will attract investment from oil majors  Investors reckon large firms will focus on underdeveloped basins in east and west Africa  Romania and Albania  as well as nascent Latin American reserves in places such as Colombia  all areas where the growth potential is seen as greater than in established regions such as North America and the North Sea  While slides in oil prices typically unleash a wave of takeovers  companies emerging from the current downturn are generally shunning outright acquisitions and instead looking at specific deals for specific fields  After a prolonged period of low oil prices in the late 1990s Exxon merged with Mobil  Total merged with Elf Aquitaine and Petrofina   Chevron   N CVX  bought Texaco  BP snapped up Amoco and ARCO and Conoco  N COP  and Philips merged  This time round  the only stand out acquisition has been Royal Dutch Shell s  L RDSa  takeover of BG  which was announced in April 2015 and completed in February a year later for  53 billion  BUYER S MARKET As large oil firms are wary of increasing their debt burden at this point  investors say corporate acquisitions are likely to be limited in numbers and scope but oil field assets are very much in the crosshairs  Oil majors are opting for joint ventures to develop specific fields in complex deals  such as share swaps or deferred payments  to lower their risk and limit the amount they need to spend upfront following two years of budget cuts   The international  ex U S   asset market is a buyer s market  as sellers continue in balance sheet preservation mode   said Charles Whall  energy portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management   European majors  which already have large dividend commitments  are unwilling to use equity for assets without immediate cash flow     Most of these asset deals are structured to minimize the debt impact in the near term   he said  Such deals also mean the sellers can retain a stake in the assets as their value rises with oil prices  said Oza and Williams at the Guinness Trust  Analysts say for much of 2015 and 2016 there was subdued activity because buyers and sellers were too far apart on price  Buyers hunting for bargain basement deals were frustrated by sellers holding out for better terms but as oil prices have started to stabilize there has been more convergence  According to Martijn Rats  equity analyst at  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   most of the deals announced in recent months have been based on a long term oil price of about  60 a barrel to  65 a barrel  
While that is significantly lower than before the collapse in oil prices from a 2014 peak of  115 a barrel  it is still above current long term oil price forecasts  Rats said ",2017-01-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/big-oil-back-on-the-acquisition-trail-as-outlook-brightens-454192,454192

center of Fort McMurray began to restart operations on Tuesday after an out of control wildfire forced a week long shutdown  Top provincial and industry officials said production in much of the region should ramp up soon  Facilities north of Fort McMurray that had been shuttered largely because of heavy smoke rather than fire were seen as likely to come back on line in a matter of days in many cases  While the fire continued to grow on Tuesday  officials said it was moving to the south and east  away from the area s largest oil production facilities and into sparsely populated areas  A handful of smaller facilities remained under fire threat  however  and some could not yet be reached for damage assessments  Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc became the first company to resume its operation in the center of Canada s oil sands region  Enbridge Inc began inspecting its facilities and prepared to restart operations shuttered during the blaze   While thousands of lives will never be the same  we can take small steps to getting back the rhythm of northeast Alberta   Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told reporters after meeting with executives from companies including Suncor Energy Inc  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  Canada and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers   For many in Fort McMurray  that means rolling up the sleeves  and returning to work doing what they love  which is working in the energy sector   she said in Edmonton  Steve Williams  chief executive of Suncor  said the industry has plenty of housing available at project sites north of the city  Despite last week s mass evacuation  gathering a sufficient workforce would not be a barrier to restarting operations    We have a huge capability for moving significant numbers of people   Williams said at the press conference   In that sort of 48 72 hour period immediately following the evacuation     we were able to evacuate significantly more than 20 000 people    The meeting came a day after Notley led an inspection tour of Fort McMurray  which found that the town was less damaged than initially feared with about 90 percent of its buildings surviving the blaze  But its 88 000 residents  who last week were hurriedly evacuated as far away as the provincial capital Edmonton  380 km  235 miles  to the south  will not be able to return to their homes for weeks   Energy industry officials have been grappling with transportation problems for staff because the specialists who run the oil production sites were also among the residents displaced by the blaze   Shell said it will fly staff in and out of the region  while Imperial Oil Ltd said its Kearl oil sands mining project will remain shut until the company worked out the logistics of moving people and materials to and from the remote site  But Notley said some movement of goods and materials by road through Fort McMurray had resumed earlier on Tuesday  Syncrude restarted power generation at its oil sands mine in Aurora  about 80 km  50 miles  north of Fort McMurray  as it began planning to resume operations  a spokeswoman said  Cenovus Energy Inc said that it would start bringing non essential staff back to work at its Christina Lake oil sands operation on Thursday  a week after it evacuated all but essential staff under the looming threat of the fire  TOWN STILL SMOLDERING The blaze grew moderately on Tuesday to 229 000

under threat was Hangingstone  about 60 km  36 miles  south of Fort McMurray  and home to at least two smaller facilities run by Athabasca Oil Co  and Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd  Both are shut  but between them account for only about 17 000 barrels per day of output  a fraction of the roughly 1 million barrels a day that has been lost to the fire  half of Canada s daily production  Notley said she believed facilities at Hangingstone were intact  but the area was not yet accessible due to the fire threat  The largest producing oil projects in the Fort McMurray area are about 20 km  12 miles  north of the town and not in the fire s current path  Suncor s Williams said those facilities had not incurred damage and were closed due to smoke  not fire  He said Suncor would not suffer any material losses from the blaze  The inspection of Fort McMurray revealed blocks of homes reduced to blackened foundations  front steps and metal barbecues  Notley said 2 400 structures had burned within the city while almost 25 000 were saved  Officials warned it was not safe for residents to return to the town  with parts still smoldering and large areas without power  water and gas  Notley said repair crews will need weeks to make the city safe  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons he would go to Fort McMurray on Friday  Canada s labor minister told reporters on

188834,410350,COP,Cooler weather welcomed in Canada s fire stricken energy heartland,news,"By Eric M  Johnson and Nia Williams
CALGARY  Reuters    Firefighters battling a massive blaze in Canada s energy heartland were aided on Friday by a second day of light rain and winds that held flames back from oil sands facilities  as producers signaled a gradual increase in operations 
The wildfire in northern Alberta has blackened more than 500 000 hectares  1 2 million acres  of land  six times the size of New York City  since it erupted earlier this month 
It also triggered a prolonged shutdown that has cut Canadian oil output by a million barrels a day 
The footprint had already exceeded the total area burned during Alberta s entire 2015 fire season  and it jumped Thursday into the neighboring province of Saskatchewan 
The fire s growth slowed on Friday as firefighters were helped by colder  damper weather that began a day earlier and vastly improved air quality  provincial authorities said 
 We expect to hold this fire in place over the weekend   Alberta Wildfire Manager Chad Morrison told a news conference 
Morrison said that fire crews hope to use the improved conditions to advance further against the blaze  Authorities plan to roughly double the number of firefighters over the next two weeks to about 2 100 personnel backed by bulldozers and aircraft dumping flame retardant 
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC
The weather  which included winds pushing flames away from key oil sands assets  offered hope for crude operations with Statoil saying on Friday its Leismer project was producing 13 000 bpd  up from 9 000 bpd two days prior 
Imperial Oil has said it had restarted limited operations at its Kearl site  with a capacity of 194 000 bpd 
ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  Canada said it was  cautiously optimistic  but gave no time frame on restarting operations 
Many operations remained shut due to the blaze  which comes on the back of a two year slump in global crude prices  Syncrude told customers to expect no further crude shipments for May  trading sources said on Thursday 
On Friday  officials said the Suncor and Syncrude oil sands sites remained under mandatory evacuation orders along with 19 work camps north of Fort McMurray 
COULD BE COSTLIEST DISASTER IN CANADIAN HISTORY
Insurers say the fire could be the most expensive natural disaster in Canadian history  costing up to C 9 billion  The federal government in Ottawa is responsible for covering 90 percent of all eligible costs 
Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau  though  played down the damage the blaze would have on overall growth prospects 
 We expect the economic impact to be largely contained to this quarter  and  to be relatively modest   he told reporters on a conference call from Japan 
 Importantly  the kinds of investments we ll be making in the next couple of quarters will help us to rebound from that economically   he said 
Some of the 90 000 evacuees who fled as the massive blaze breached Fort McMurray earlier this month may be allowed to return as soon as June 1  if air quality improves and other safety conditions are met 
Officials warned residents with asthma or heart conditions that medical care will be limited in the early days ",2016-05-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/cooler-weather-welcomed-in-canada's-fire-stricken-energy-heartland-403424,403424
188835,410351,COP,Wildfire sparked evacuation orders lifted at all Canadian work camps,news,"By Eric M  Johnson and Ethan Lou
CALGARY TORONTO  Reuters    Authorities in Canada lifted evacuation orders on Monday for all work camps and some additional oil facilities that had been shuttered when a massive wildfire threatened the nation s energy hub  a significant step for companies eager to restart production 
Municipal authorities for the oil town said a  phased re entry  was authorized for the remaining camps  including those for Suncor Energy Inc s Baseline and MacKay River camps north of the fire ravaged oil town of Fort McMurray  There were no remaining camps under evacuation order in Alberta 
 The phased re entry for all oil sands camps in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo is now under way   said Robin Smith  a spokesman for the municipality   They are cleared to return to operations as soon as possible  
South of the city  sites belonging to Athabasca Oil Corp and Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd  JACOS  were slated for re entry  authorities said in a statement  though they did not make clear which ones 
Both Athabasca and JACOS operate sites in the Hangingstone area southwest of Fort McMurray  The oil companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
The facilities were shuttered early last week as the huge wildfire surged toward the area around Fort McMurray  prolonging a shutdown that has cut Canadian oil output by a million barrels a day 
Fort McMurray itself still sits largely empty after its entire population of nearly 90 000 was evacuated when the fire hit earlier this month 
The lifting of evacuation orders means that workers can return to lodging sites as soon as the facilities are deemed safe by provincial forestry and health authorities  a process likely to be completed in the coming days  said municipality spokesman Smith 
By Monday  the inferno had charred more than 500 000 hectares  1 930 square miles  across northern Alberta  though its footprint remained unchanged since Friday and it was not expected to grow due to damp  cold weather  wildfire information office Laura Stewart said 
News of additional camps set to re open came a day after authorities announced a similar plan for camps near Nexen s Long Lake and ConocoPhillips s Surmont facilities  both of which had stopped production due to the fire 
Camps were also due to re open near Enbridge Inc s Cheecham terminal  which the company has said was returning to full service 
An Enbridge spokesman said the company s Cheecham terminal and its pipelines were operational  and they would be ready to ship oil as producers  come back on line   He declined to comment on the facility s current volume 
ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  said it started a staged re mobilization plan at Surmont  and by Friday expected to have 350 people back on site  though there was no immediate indication of its schedule for restarting production  a spokesman said on Monday

188844,410360,COP,Oil majors experiment with technology to weather crisis,news,By Karolin Schaps and Jessica Jaganathan LONDON OSLO  Reuters    Oil majors including  Statoil   Shell and  Chevron   NYSE CVX  are experimenting with various technologies  from drones and drill design to data management  to drive down costs and weather a deep downturn   Crude prices have more than halved since mid 2014  forcing companies to cut billions of dollars in costs  Determined to shield dividends and preserve the infrastructure that will allow them to compete and grow if the market recovers  they are increasingly looking to smarter tech and design to make savings   French oil and gas major  Total   PA TOTF  said it was now using drones to carry out detailed inspections on some of its oil fields following a trial at one of its Elgin Franklin platforms in the North Sea   Cyberhawk  the drone company that led the trial  said this kind of work was previously carried out by engineers who suspended themselves from ropes at dizzying heights  It said the manned inspection used to take seven separate two week trips with a 12 man team that had to be flown in and accommodated on site  The drones do the work in two days and at about a tenth of the cost  according to the Britain based firm s founder Malcolm Connolly  who said it had also worked with ExxonMobil  N XOM   Shell  L RDSa   ConocoPhillips  N COP  and  BP   L BP    Total declined to comment on how long the manned or drone inspections took  or specify how much money was saved  Statoil s  OL STL  giant Johan Sverdrup field  the largest North Sea oil find in three decades which is due to start production in 2019  is a leading industry case study for cutting costs in the era of cheap oil  The Norwegian company has cut its development costs for the first stage of the project by a fifth compared with estimates given in early 2015  to 99 billion crowns   12 2 billion    The savings have largely been made by focusing on the most efficient technology and designs from the beginning  Statoil s head of technology Margareth Oevrum told Reuters in an interview   Executives say the growing attention on technologies that have been around for some time shows how wasteful the global industry had been in the years before the downturn when   with crude at above  100 a barrel delivering bumper profits   oil companies  had little incentive to develop fields efficiently  For example  simply finding a more efficient route for the oil pipeline that would carry the crude from the Sverdrup field to the onshore refinery cut 1 billion crowns  Statoil said  ROBOTS  FOAM Statoil has also developed a drilling  template  that is acting as a guide for the first eight wells to be drilled at the field  It said it had reduced the overall drilling time by more than 50 days  saving about 150 million crowns per production well compared with what it would have cost with 2013 techniques   By far the biggest driver  of savings  has been simplification   said Oevrum   To think much simpler and start from the bottom  or the bare bone  and then rather add to that  instead of starting very big   The company could not give a figure for its group savings made from improved technology and design  But it said that  partly because of such innovations  projects set to start production by 2022 would be able to make a profit with an oil price at  41 a barrel  down from  70 in 2013   Global upstream   exploration and production   oil and gas spending has fallen by more than  300 billion across the industry in 2015 16  according to the International Energy Agency  IEA   roughly equivalent to the annual GDP of South Africa  Around two thirds comes from cost cuts  rather than cancelling or shelving projects  it said   Shell  for example  has developed a new type of pipe  called a steel lazy wave riser  to carry oil and gas from its deepwater Stones field in the Gulf of Mexico for processing  It bends to absorb the motion of the sea and the floating platform  which the company says boosts production at extreme depths   The Anglo Dutch major could not say how much the pipes contributed to increased efficiency  but said innovations at Stones had played a significant part in cost savings of  1 8 billion in its projects and technology division last year   equivalent to the 2015 core profits in its upstream division  The fall in oil prices has led to the introduction of other new engineering and maintenance techniques   Chevron is using a robotic device to clean and check the inside of pipelines on their Erskine field in the North Sea more quickly  The improvement has helped raise the field s daily production rate to the highest in two years   Oil services firm  Amec  Foster Wheeler  L AMFW   working for BG Group which is now part of Shell  has applied a new technique to remove the pillars of an old platform  a procedure that is often dangerous because corroded elements can slip off   It pumped in expanding foam to hold the pillar s elements together  allowing workers to safely cut the metal away  This work took just over seven weeks instead of the 22 weeks typically needed using traditional methods  Alex Brooks  oil and gas equity analyst at Canaccord Genuity  said tech innovation in the industry was about  100 tiny things   adding   The bottom line is you end up with a much lower cost   The downturn has presented opportunities for some services firms that can offer cost saving innovations  Inspection drone firm Cyberhawk  for instance  said its revenue from oil and gas had doubled from mid 2014 to mid 2016  while the wider inspection market had shrunk   VAST DATA Another way oil companies are looking to cut costs is by using their vast amounts of data to better predict their needs  Since the price slump  companies including Shell  ExxonMobil and Statoil have started using software that can better manage their data to cut wastage in the ordering of construction materials   Stuck with excess material  some companies suffered huge losses because the resale value was much lower and in some cases they even took to burying unwanted material  according to Intergraph  a unit of Swedish tech firm  Hexagon   ST HEXAb  that develops such systems for oil industry clients   Previously  it was industry standard to order 3 5 percent more materials than needed  which in a billion dollar project is a lot of money   said Patrick Holcomb  executive vice president at Intergraph   Better managing data has helped oil firms understand exactly how much material is needed and when it will be delivered  cutting excess to one or two tenths of a percent  he added   Gunnar Presthus  Nordic energy lead at consultancy Accenture  who advises oil majors and national oil companies  said the downturn had led to the industry waking up to the potential of the data they store    The oil industry  to some extent  is one of the most digitalized industries   he said   Companies are now able to use this wealth of data to make changes that will save money

188845,410361,COP,The Energy Report For May 14  2018  Shale To The Rescue,opinion,"Oil prices are pulling back from 3 and a half year highs after a leap in the U S  oil rig count and a relatively calm weekend when it came to geopolitical tensions  Drillers added 10 oil rigs and 3 gas rigs bringing the total oil rig count to 844  the highest level since March 2015  according to Baker Hughes 
Despite the U S  pullout from the Iranian nuclear deal and Iran s ill fated attempt to lob missiles into Israel s Golan Heights  the Iranians figured perhaps that the aggressive behavior might lose them support from China  France  Russia  Britain and Germany who want to stay in the Iranian nuclear accord 
Yet  the U S  is warning that any company  foreign or domestic  that deals with Iran may be subject to actions from the U S  The Guardian reported that John Bolton  US President Donald Trump s national security adviser  predicted that  the Europeans will see that it s in their interests to come along with us  rather than continue with the 2015 deal  under which major European corporations have signed billions of dollars of contracts in Iran 
This come as companies are seizing assets back from Venezuelans as the country is in total collapse  The Wall Street Journal Reports that ConocoPhilips  NYSE COP  seized all of Venezuelan Oil Assets in Curacao and that a rush of creditors trying to seize assets has disrupted Venezuela s oil exports at a time when they already are plunging 
The Journal says that Conoco has moved to take control of PDVSA facilities in the Caribbean after winning a  2 billion legal judgment tied to Venezuela s seizure of its assets in 2007  That move alone hurts Venezuela because that storage and refining infrastructure is needed to blend the country s heavy crude with lighter varieties and make it suitable for sale abroad  Energy economist Philip Verleger estimates the issue could cut off exports as much as 500 000 barrels a day out of the 1 4 million Venezuela produces  Coupled with renewed sanctions on Iran  the cutback could push oil prices above the current multiyear highs 
Oil prices are staying strong and while they are overbought there seems to be a period of consolidation which signals we should retest the highs again  Despite the best efforts of shale producers  U S  refiners are dealing with the tightest supplies they have seen in years  While supplies in Cushing Oklahoma are on the rise  the Gulf Coast gas has been draining and we are in an area that is giving the buyers of crude a wakeup call  Don t count on our friends in OPEC looking to make up the difference  Reuters OPEC is more focused on identifying the right level of oil inventory at its next meeting  than the impact on supplies of new U S  sanctions on Iran  the United Arab Emirates said 
Gasoline prices are at 4 year highs as strong demand and the summer blend switchover is keeping them high  Jet fuel and diesel fuel prices are soaring as the shale oil is not yielding enough of those products  We are undersupplied which means refiners can t max out gasoline  We have warned time and time again to remain hedged and while we may see some price relief in a couple of weeks after refinery maintenance season  the truth is there are still risks for price spikes all summer ",2018-05-14,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-051418-200315968,200315968
188846,410362,COP,Can Anything Stop Oil Prices From Going Higher ,opinion,"With the price of Brent pushing toward  80 per barrel  market watchers are beginning to wonder if there is anything that can stop rising oil prices this spring  This is a far cry from last spring and summer when Brent prices barely broke the  55 per barrel mark  Now   is even talking about seeing oil prices rise to  100 per barrel 

There are three major factors influencing rising prices right now 

US President Donald Trump s decision to reinstate sanctions on Iran
The collapse of Venezuela s oil industry and
The OPEC Non OPEC production cut agreement


1  Iranian Sanctions
Even though it s not clear whether the countries and companies that have been purchasing  transporting and insuring Iranian oil will all comply with US sanctions  many are taking the Trump administration seriously and have begun   or  for alternative sources of oil 
The CEO of ENI  MI ENI   the Italian oil company  expressed dissatisfaction with President Trump s decision to pull out of the Iran deal  However  he clarified that even though ENI had been in talks to potentially develop oil and gas fields in Iran  it currently has no interests there and does not plan on making any  in Iran  Notably  the CEO said ENI was not interested in investing in Iranian energy development because of unfavorable terms offered by Iran  not because of President Trump s decision to reinstate sanctions 
Uncertainty over the fate of Iranian oil exports continues to push oil prices up  The biggest player in Iranian oil imports is China  which is responsible for about 24  of Iran s total oil exports 
We are likely to see some sort of negotiation going on between the US and China to try to push the Chinese to reduce their Iranian oil imports  If the Trump administration succeeds in convincing China to reduce its imports of Iranian oil then we can expect oil prices to trend higher  If China continues to import Iranian oil at the same rate or increases the amount it imports from Iran then oil prices may start to trend downward as the price premium from the Iran deal announcement fades 

2  Collapse of Venezuela s Oil Industry
The impact of Venezuela s collapsing oil industry cannot be overstated  During the past week ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  successfully expropriated Venezuelan oil in the Caribbean through a legal judgment to pay a debt  PDVSA  the Isla refinery in Curacao and  purchased crude oil on the market to exchange with Cuba for goods  These are all further signs of the continuing collapse of Venezuela s entire oil industry  The crisis will likely be reflected in further production declines in coming months 

3  OPEC Non OPEC Production Caps 
The OPEC Non OPEC production cut agreement continues to support higher oil prices  Although Saudi Arabia has indicated that it intends to increase production to prevent market dislocation that could be caused by geopolitical events in Iran and Venezuela  Saudi Arabia has not yet made any actual moves  It seems that the market will have to wait for official word from OPEC when the organization meets in a little over a month 

Possible Constraints on Rising Prices
There are some signs that could stop  or at least slow  climbing oil prices  One of these is Mexico s annual oil hedging process  The price point for these hedges is not yet known  but the process increases market volatility and has been known to cause sharp declines in the price of oil in the past 
US shale oil production is another wildcard  Production levels have exceeded predictions  but prices are still up 
On the other hand  limits on infrastructure and personnel in shale oil areas may be forcing some producers to sell oil at a discount  In fact  the WTI Brent spread   8 per barrel on Tuesday  a three year high 
Although more North American pipelines are being built  until they come online  WTI will continue to be sold at significant discounts and this will constrain rising WTI prices ",2018-05-16,"Ellen R.

It is to be noted that the oil and gas explorer has inked a Drilling Program Order  DPO    included in the MSA   with the offshore drilling contractor  Per the DPO  ConocoPhillips will likely be operating a semi submersible rig of Ocean Rig for drilling an offshore well in Norway  with options for additional two wells  The well is expected to be drilled by Leiv Eiriksson over a period of roughly 90 days 
In the Norwegian regions of the North Sea  ConocoPhillips has significant presence  Most importantly  the company is among the largest players in the continental shelf of Norway 
Headquartered in Houston  TX  ConocoPhillips is the largest oil and natural gas explorer in the world  in terms of output of commodities and proved reserves  The company has an excellent earnings surprise history  In three of the last four quarters  ConocoPhillips surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the average positive earnings surprise being 226 9  
Over the past year  the stock has rallied 46 7   outperforming the  8 5  gain

188862,410378,COP,As Big Oil shrinks  boards plot different paths out of crisis,news,"By Ron Bousso and Terry Wade LONDON HOUSTON  Reuters    As oil and gas companies cut ever deeper into the bone to weather their worst downturn in decades  boards have adopted contrasting strategies to lead them out of the crisis  Crude prices have tumbled around 70 percent over the past 18 months to around  35 a barrel  leading to five of the world s top oil companies reporting sharp declines in profits in recent days   Executives at energy firms face a tough balancing act  they must cut spending to stay financially afloat while preserving the production infrastructure and capacity that will allow them to compete and grow when the market recovers  Companies have opted for differing approaches to secure future growth  often choosing to narrow focus to their areas of expertise and the geographic location of their main assets  American firms  Chevron   L CVX  ConocoPhillips  N COP  and  Hess Corp   N HES  are withdrawing from more costly deepwater projects to focus on shale oil fields on their home turf  for example   Britain s  BP   L BP  is betting on offshore gas in Egypt  while Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  has opted for an alternative route as it seeks to safeguard its future  the  50 billion takeover of BG Group  L BG    In the five years before the downturn began in mid 2014  when crude prices held above  100 a barrel  big energy firms had raced to expand production capacity  including buying stakes in vast  costly fields sometimes located thousands of meters under the sea  and miles from land  Over the past year however  companies have slashed their overall capital expenditure  scrapping plans for mega projects that cost billions to develop and take up to a decade to bring online    Companies want to strike a balance between long and short cycle investments while maintaining a robust balance sheet to fund their way through the down cycle   said BMO Capital analyst Brendan Warn  Focusing on a specific set of expertise and geographies allowed them to offer investors a  unique value proposition   he added   U S  SHALE  EGYPT GAS Chevron  the second largest U S  oil firm after  Exxon Mobil   N XOM  by market value  last week outlined plans to target spending on  short cycle  investments   lower cost projects that can take months  rather then several years  to come online  In particular  it is focusing on its big presence in shale oil fields in the U S  Permian basin at the expense of high cost  complex deepwater projects after cutting its 2016 capital expenditure  or capex  by 24 percent   In terms of longer cycle projects  we aren t initiating  We aren t initiating any     You are going to see us preferentially favor short cycle investments  and if they don t meet our hurdles  we won t invest   Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson said in an analyst call  Even though developing shale wells can be more costly than some deepwater projects on a per barrel basis  a much shorter development cycle and lower execution risks mean that companies can reap benefits quicker   The short term investment strategy is driven in part by the fact that  unlike for example BP  it already has a pipeline of longer term projects   it is currently developing some of the world s largest liquefied natural gas  LNG  projects such as the Gorgon and Wheatstone plants in Australia   Smaller firms ConocoPhillips and Hess have also shifted away from deepwater projects to onshore shale production including in North Dakota s Bakken Shale   BP was one of very few companies that approved a major project last year  with its  12 billion investment decision in the West Nile Delta gas project in Egypt  The strategy is partly based its plans to see a large part of its future production growth come from gas off the coast of the North African country   But the company  which reported its biggest ever loss last week  also does not have the line up of long term projects boasted by the likes of Chevron  the development is also driven by the fact it sold more than  50 billion of assets after the deadly 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill  leading to a significant decline in output  according to analysts   BP aren t digging themselves through a hole  They are investing a little bit through the cycle   said Warn  DEALMAKING Shell  by contrast  opted at an early stage of the downturn to acquire Britain s BG Group in the sector s largest deal in a decade  It will make it a leader in LNG and offshore oil production in Brazil and increase its energy reserves by about a fifth   The Anglo Dutch group  which posted its lowest annual income for 13 years last week  expects to complete the deal this month  U S  giant Exxon may need to take a leaf out of Shell s book and seek a major M A deal after it surprised many in the market last week by slashing its 2016 spending by a quarter to  23 billion  said Anish Kapadia  analyst at Tudor  Pickering  Holt and Co   The capex cut signals the company   which reported its smallest quarterly profit in more than a decade   is not planning to invest in many new projects  he said   That is a signal that Exxon doesn t have an attractive enough project queue to invest in and is not willing to invest in upstream  so if it wants to grow it will have to make an acquisition   added Kapadia      In this environment with the potential for higher oil price  Chevron are doing the right thing  They can survive over the next few years and have the option to grow  Exxon is at the bottom of the pile  It looks the most expensive but it is hard to justify given the lack of growth outlook   Tudor  Pickering  Holt and Co  has a  buy  recommendation on Chevron and Shell  a  hold  on BP and  sell  on Exxon   
Norway s  Statoil   OL STL  and France s  Total   PA TOTF   meanwhile  appear to be sitting in the middle ground  both have indicated they will not invest in new projects this year but they also have big projects coming on stream in the coming years that will counter production declines ",2016-02-07,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/as-big-oil-shrinks,-boards-plot-different-paths-out-of-crisis-383623",383623

188864,410380,COP,Oil Faces A Day Of Reckoning,opinion,"A Day of Reckoning 
Oil prices face a day of reckoning as the U S  decides whether it will remain in the Iranian nuclear accord  and the realization is that due to underinvestment in oil it might be difficult to replace Iranian oil if it is taken off the market  What also is clear the market is going to be more sensitive to disruption as the biggest oil glut in mankind s history is now just a memory  The breakout  70 a barrel is not a fluke  but has been building as global demand exceeded exceptions and the false mantra of lower for longer oil prices turned out to be a fantasy 
It is also unclear whether Saudi Arabia will act to make up for the loss of Iranian oil supply  It is being reported by Bloomberg that Saudi Arabia s former price doves on oil now want prices near  80 a barrel and former Price hawk Iran want staple prices in the  60 a barrel range  We have heard this before  but it comes at a critical time as the showdown with the U S   and the high likelihood that there will be new sanctions on Iran  means that the global oil market will be caught short  Saudi Arabia is really the only country with sufficient spare capacity to make up for the loss of Iranian oil and they might not be in a hurry to act because they want  80 a barrel 
If you look at OPEC  compliance is the best it has ever been  It was reported last week that OPEC compliance hit a new record high of 162 percent as the cartel pumped 32 12 million barrels per day this month  the survey found  down 70 000 bpd from March  The April total is the lowest since April 2017  according to Reuters surveys 
In April  the biggest decrease in supply came from Venezuela  where the oil industry is starved of funds because of economic crisis  Output dropped to 1 50 million bpd in April  the survey found  a new long term low 
Production in Angola  where natural declines at some fields are weighing on output  slipped and the country is pumping over 260 000 bpd less than its OPEC target  Nigerian exports  which have risen this year  slipped in April  Production in Libya  which remains unstable due to unrest  edged lower after a suspected act of sabotage briefly stopped flows from Waha Oil Co  s fields  industry sources said according to Reuters 
Even though some of the decline was due to unintended problems  the reality is that the market badly misjudged OPEC s resolve to erase the world of the oil glut  Like I said before  this is not your daddy s OPEC  Venezuela is collapsing  helping that compliance number  Reuters reports that U S  oil firm ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  has moved to take key Caribbean assets of Venezuela s state run PDVSA to enforce a  2 billion arbitration award  actions that could further impair PDVSA s declining oil production and exports 
Shale oil production is on the rise  but shale producers do not have the ability to quickly erase production  Logistics and bottlenecks make that impossible  Even as we saw the U S  rig count surge  Baker Hughes reported the number of active U S  rigs drilling for oil rose by 9 to 834 this week  The oil rig count had logged gains in each of the last four weeks  The total active U S  rig count  which includes oil and natural gas rigs  climbed by 11 to 1 032  according to MarketWatch 
U S  gasoline and product prices will also rise  Make sure your hedges are in place  Natural gas is under pressure as U S  production surges ",2018-05-07,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-050718-200313659,200313659

188870,410386,COP,4 Country ETFs That Should Be Beneficiaries Of  70 Oil ,opinion,"Looks like the dark days in the oil patch is over  The liquid commodity jolted higher in recent trading to near  70  barrel  hitting the highest level since November 2014  Troubles in Venezuelan oil company PDVSA as  U S  oil major ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  moved to take Caribbean assets of Venezuela s state run PDVSA to enforce a  2 billion arbitration award  mainly caused this spike 
Venezuela  which has one of the world s largest proven oil reserves  has been registering a decline in crude production in recent years  Venezuela s oil production has halved since the early 2000s  In the first quarter  PDVSA exported 1 19 million bpd of crude from its terminals in Venezuela and the Caribbean  marking a  year over year  per Thomson Reuters data 
Also  chances of United States  re imposition of sanctions on Iran worked wonders for oil  If Trump imposes sanctions on Iran  its oil could be reduced by   per analysts at RBC Capital Markets 
Moreover  there are chances of an extended output cut deal for the coming  thanks to the initiative between OPEC member nations and Russia  As per sources  OPEC top brass and the biggest exporter Saudi Arabia wants oil to push to the level of   This indicates Saudi s intension of making no changes in the ongoing output cut deal that started in January 2017  read    
If this  70 oil stays for long  it will definitely put some country stocks and ETFs in focus  These are the key oil producing and exporting countries with revenues earned from oil accounting for a major share of their GDP  These country ETFs bled when oil slid but could be on high gear if oil prices stage a sustained recovery  Below we highlight four such country ETFs 
Global X MSCI Norway ETF 
Norway is among the top 10 nations famous for oil exports and with its comparatively low population  oil forms a key part of the country s GDP  As per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   Norway is the  oil driller in Europe   
The most popular way to play the country is with NORW  The product tracks the MSCI Norway IMI  LON IMI  25 50 Index  charging investors 50 basis points a year in fees 
The ETF is concentrated on energy stocks  as these make up for nearly 30  of the portfolio  In fact  Norwegian oil giant Statoil  OL STL  accounts for 18 4  of the portfolio alone  suggesting heavy concentration  Thanks to a surge in oil prices  NORW may see solid trading ahead 
iShares MSCI Canada ETF   AX EWC   Canada is also among the world s top 10 oil producers  The oil  gas and mining sector makes up for about  economy  The best way to invest in Canada is through iShares MSCI Canada ETF  The fund holds just under 100 stocks in its basket  Energy makes up a huge chunk of assets accounting for over one fifth of the total 
Market Vectors Russia ETF 
Oil is seemingly the main commodity of Russia  About half of Russia s exports in terms of value come from oil and natural gas as the country has the  oil reserve in the world and the biggest natural gas reserve  This makes it clear why Russia s economy is highly dependent on oil price movement 
RSX is the most popular fund in the Russia ETF space  The energy sector accounts for about 40  of RSX  which charges 67 basis points as net expenses  read    
Global X MSCI Colombia ETF 
Oil exports in Colombia account for about 20  of government revenues  But the amount declined to  during the prolonged global oil price rout since 2014  Though the Colombia ETF GXG is heavy on Financials  47 25    the energy sector has about 16 63  exposure  As a result  a spike in oil prices will definitely ease some revenue pressure  The fund charges about 61 bps in fees overall

188871,410387,COP,ConocoPhillips Looks To Seize PDVSA s Oil Cargo In Curacao,opinion,"ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   is trying to gain control of Venezuela s key offshore operations in the Caribbean in order to recover  2 billion from a decade old row with the nation  per the sources ConocoPhillips has requested a court in the Dutch Antilles for control of facilities run by Venezuela s state run oil firm PDVSA  Notably  PDVSA largely depends on facilities in the islands of Curacao  Bonaire and St  Eustatius  These facilities are used for the processing and storing of Venezuela s heavy crude before dispatching it to the three major global markets   the United States  China and India Once an oil rich country  Venezuela is now embroiled in political and economic issues for nearly two decades under a socialist leadership  In late April  an arbitration panel instituted under the International Chamber of Commerce found that Venezuela under the leadership of then President Hugo Chavez had unlawfully seized investments from joint venture operations with ConocoPhillips  Thus  the company sought compensation at a local court for the fraudulent behavior  The demand made in the petition has not been made public  The  2 billion award corresponds to more than 20  of the cash strapped government s foreign currency reserves The facilities on two of the islands are leased by PVDSA  Thus  ConocoPhillips cannot take control over them  even with a court order  However  it could seize Venezuela s oil stored in them and any state owned ships that dock there  per experts Over the weekend  the oil tankers that left Venezuela s shores turned around before reaching the Caribbean islands  The storage facilities on two of the islands have the capacity to store crude valued  900 million  about 50  of Venezuela s monthly production Per Reuters  ConocoPhillips  action could impact PDVSA s exports of about 400 000 barrels per day from the Caribbean  or about a third of its total exports These legal actions will deal a big blow to PDVSA s already waning oil revenues and in turn Venezuela s economy  which is in deep recession with widespread shortage of medicine and food Price PerformanceDuring the past three months  ConocoPhillips  shares gained 25 4  compared with the  s 12 1  rally

188872,410388,COP,The Energy Report 05 08 18,opinion,"Nuclear Meltdown
Oil prices surged closing at above  70 a barrel for the first time in three and a half years  only to have a nuclear meltdown in aftermarket trading  WTI further set a record 2 7 million contracts of open interest  but fell hard after President Donald Trump tweeted that he would announce his decision on the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday at 2 p m  ET 
That tweet caused a selling frenzy taking a dollar off the price of crude in a very short period  It could have been a simple case of  buy the rumor and sell the fact   but it also can be because some fear that perhaps the President had a change of heart  Yet  overnight it seems clear that the U S  more than likely will pull out of the deal and that will impact global oil supply  Many countries  who want to deal with the U S   will shy away from buying Iranian oil  Even if Europe finds a way to stay in the deal  the most likely outcome is that Iran will have to give a big discount on their oil to move it 
We also have more fears that Venezuelan oil exports will continue to fall  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  say they will take Caribbean assets of state run PDVSA to enforce a  2 billion arbitration award  The move is going to make it difficult for PDVSA s to do business 
On top of that Bloomberg News is reporting that  Military officers are joining the exodus of Venezuelans to Colombia and Brazil  fleeing barracks and forcing President Nicolas Maduro s government to call upon retirees and militia to fill the void  High desertion rates at bases in Caracas and the countryside are complicating security plans for the presidential election in 13 days  which by law require military custody of electoral materials and machinery at voting centers  
Yet oil traders would do themselves a disservice if they focused on geo political risk alone  While some believe risk is the only reason for prices rising it is only part of the oil bull market story  Demand is the real story and it is demand mixed with underinvestment that helped erase the biggest oil glut of all time  The U S economy is doing great  Even the critics of the Trump tax cuts are now acknowledging the benefits to all Americans  The Washington Times reports that April was the best month in history for the U S  budget  according to Congressional Budget Office figures  The federal government took in a record tax haul in April in route to its biggest ever monthly budget surplus  the Congressional Budget Office said  as a surging economy left Americans with more money in their paychecks   and thus more to pay to Uncle Sam  All told the government collected  515 billion and spent  297 billion  for a total monthly surplus of  218 billion  That swamped the previous monthly record of  190 billion  set in 2001 
China demand has been surging as well  Platts reported last week that China ended the first quarter of 2018 with robust apparent oil demand growth of 6 8  year on year  as stronger than expected GDP growth boosted consumption from the industrial and construction sectors and outweighed concerns over rising oil prices  S P Global Platts calculations based on latest official data showed 
Platts says that the apparent oil demand growth number for Q1 not only reflected a recovery in demand in China  but it also sent a signal that the rally in crude oil prices    Brent crude has risen nearly 11  in 2018    has so far failed to make a dent on demand in Asia s biggest energy consumer  The 6 8  year on year GDP growth aided China s overall oil demand to rise to 12 36 million b d in Q1  much higher than the 4 1  growth seen in Q1 of 2017  For the whole of 2017  demand growth was at 5 5  year on year  
Rising shale oil production in the U S  has not kept pace  Of course  that means a golden age for shale producers  As the world looks to shale to fill the void of years of short sighted underinvestment they should flourish if they don t get too greedy 
Despite the nuclear meltdown  oil breaking  70 a barrel opens a move towards  73 a barrel  U S  refiners must ramp up and with the supply of heavier products in tight supply they will favor heavier crude  Gasoline demand will stay strong as the weather warms up and farmers are finally getting in the field  Now add some geopolitics to the mix and we are set up for a potential upward spike

188877,410393,COP,A Crowded Tale Of The Tape,opinion,"Global equity markets reveled in their most favorable showing since early March after clement CPI figures led to hopes of a Goldilocks economy in the US  But as senescent as this view is becoming  with the Federal Reserve Board looking to remove emergency accommodation  it s perhaps not the best narrative to hang one s long term investor cap 
The combination of a lower than anticipated inflation print and a less crowded long EUR USD positioning  saw the USD backpedal into weeks end  However  interest rate differential still favors the USD  suggesting the recent dollar wave of appreciation while bruised  is not broken  Implying it s far too early in the cycle for the USD to resume its more protracted downtrend  None the less  on the benign inflation print  traders might turn short term agnostic on the USD ahead of the vital Retail Sales data  acknowledging we could be in for a period of consolidation 
However  before bringing out the   Snooze Pillow   there will be some conversations to engage in the global growth narrative as dealers pivot to US Retail Sales data  Also  FX markets will focus on Fed speakers taking to the airwaves  Fed members perspective always increases in importance after any critical inflation metric  In this case  traders will be keen to hear their opinions on the tepid CPI print as US inflation remains MIA  The significant Fed event will be Tuesday s Senate confirmation hearings of Richard Clarida and Michelle Bowman to join the Board of Governors as vice chair and the community banker Governor seat respectively 
Given that risk appetite along with movements in the USD is very much echoing the underlying developments in US yields  The US Retail Sales data and Fed speakers should provide reasonable signposts for global capital markets as the trading activity should remain intrinsically tethered to the trajectory US interest rate policy and 10 Year UST yields over the near term 
As well  look for oil prices will continue to have their far reaching implication in inflation and US yields 
On geopolitical font  US China trade negotiations are expected to recommence this week with a potential visit from China Vice Premier Liu He  But the diffusing tension was the President took to Twitter overnight announcing he has instructed the Commerce Department to reverse its sanctions on China s ZTE  HK 0763   which should be interpreted as a significant concession in the trade negotiations  However  a scheduled hearing on Section 301 of the trade act could keep the mood edgy 
Finally  the Middle East powder keg will remain a key focus with displays of aggressive warmongering between Israel and Iran on the rise 
Oil Markets
The Middle East geopolitical escalation and fragile supply demand dynamics continue to tighten on the prospects of an ongoing collapse in Venezuelan output and the impact of US sanctions on Iran which will be realised toward the end of 2018  While the Iran curiosity should remain front and centre  Venezuelan production could nosedive further after ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  clawed about US 650 million in assets belonging to PDVSA not only choking off their ability to export but also leaving Venezuela s cash strapped government in futile search of precious US dollars 
ConocoPhillips has won court orders allowing it to seize PDVSA assets on Caribbean islands  including Curacao  in efforts to collect on a  2 billion arbitration award linked to the 2007 nationalisation of Conoco assets under late leader Hugo Chavez 
Heading into the weekend a combination of position squaring ahead of weekend headline risk and the rise on rig count saw WTI Crude Oil prices fall 1 4   from the weekly high water mark 
On the Baker Hughes tally not unexpectedly with WTI surging on the back of Iran sanctions  US shale producer added ten oil rigs in the week to May 11  bringing the total count to 844  the highest level since March 2015  But on the flip side  frackers remain well off their heyday numbers suggesting drillers are in no rush to let loose a supply oil gusher while hoping for higher and more prolonged returns 
However  with the bulls clearly in charge and the price floor appearing well entrenched for the remainder of the year  best to be cognizant of downside risk as complacency in oil trading has been the downfall of many  The one possible concern is the developing indications that point Saudi Arabia alleviating the effect of the sanctions by increasing output to counter the Iran disruption  But that also raises the spectre that other OPEC countries will follow suit which could put the current OPEC supply deal in jeopardy 
Gold Markets
Gold continues to be driven by the US dollar and rates causing the markets continue to consolidate at the low end of the year range due to the stronger USD  But with US yields testing the 3   level in 10 Year UST  rates are also weighing on on Gold sentiment  despite wobbly equity markets and the abundance of geopolitical headline risk  And predictably appetite has been dwindling on the futures markets with the latter s CFTC data running at about one third of their all time high level  The failure to see any significant top side momentum along with the resurgent dollar has seen hedgers pare back positions while putting their money to work on riskier bets 
But the combination of geopolitical headline risk and long term negative outlook on the USD continues to advocate the gradual build of position on dips  However  the market is overly cognizant of the Fed rate hike in June and the fear of the Fed could dents sentiment near term and demand continues to consolidate 
Gold bulls will be left to grind it out over the next few weeks until the worm eventually turns on the US dollar which could trigger a significant move higher on gold if the long term negative USD trend emerges  Treat gold trade as a marathon not a sprint over the near term 
Around the Currency Horn 
USD  The combination of a lower than expected CPI and less extend long EUR USD positioning has temporarily taken the wind out of the dollar sail  The next USD trigger will be the US Retail Sales release  where the USD dollar downside could be exposed on weaker print but how far this could induce a dollar sell off is not so clear cut  Given the dovish display by other central banks  the lonely Federal Reserve Board appears to be the last man standing as speculation about interest rate rises and policy normalisation in the eurozone  Japan and Britain get kicked down the road  Suggesting the dollar should remain rented at the minimum over the next few weeks  none the less the politically challenged greenback is building a convincing argument for some longer term views  But overall it remains testing to see just how much the EUR USD can fall given the inflationary aspect of the weaker EUR not to mention the enormous rally in crude oil over the past two months which could reignite inflation on the continent 
EUR  Short term views will continue to be driven by economic surprise indexes which continued to favour an extended bullish USD position over the near term  But just how much more juice can be extracted from the differential play remains a question  EUR USD YTD lows should form a significant base 
JPY  The yen echoes the broader market sentiment that continues to ebb and flows without any real conviction on the back of equity risk plays and US Yields 
GBP  BoE vote split was dovish  The sizeable down move could be viewed as overextended  The BoE next policy move is higher  but as we say in the business   its hard to argue the direction  
NZD  This has been a favourite topic of discussion amongst my circle  New governor Orr was dovish noting symmetrical risks around next move but its unlikely they will cut rates so 69 should remain firm given that there was limited follow through after the initial knee jerk last week 
AUD  Despite the short covering rally  with ongoing weak data and dovish RBA suggests the AUD remains prone  Aussie short positions are much cleaner  to dealers will be quick to re engage Aussie shorts on USD dollar strength 
CAD  USD CAD remains exceptionally volatile as confidence continues to decline and accelerate on NAFTA talks  But there may be too much CAD bullishness baked into the May BoC meeting  The BoC is finding themselves in the same position faced by RBA where tapping the brakes to curb excessive borrowing can have serious adverse side effects with household debt skyrocketing 
TRY  A fair bit of vol last week as the Lira recovered somewhat on speculation policy makers may take action to defend the lira  but traders are all too knowing that such types of interventions seldom produce long term effects and the market is back selling the Lira into week s end  The TRY could continue to trade from a weak hand this week ",2018-05-14,Stephen Innes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-crowded-tale-of-the-tape-200315836,200315836

188888,410404,COP,Big oil to cut investment again in 2016,news,By Karolin Schaps and Ron Bousso LONDON  Reuters    With crude prices at 11 year lows  the world s biggest oil and gas producers are facing their longest period of investment cuts in decades  but are expected to borrow more to preserve the dividends demanded by investors  At around  37 a barrel  crude prices are well below the  60 firms such as  Total   PA TOTF   Statoil  OL STO  and  BP   L BP  need to balance their books  a level that has already been sharply reduced over the past 18 months  International oil companies are once again being forced to cut spending  sell assets  shed jobs and delay projects as the oil slump shows no sign of recovery   U S  producers  Chevron   N CVX  and ConocoPhillips  N COP  have published plans to slash their 2016 budgets by a quarter  Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa  has also announced a further  5 billion in spending cuts if its planned takeover of BG Group  L BG  goes ahead  Global oil and gas investments are expected to fall to their lowest in six years in 2016 to  522 billion  following a 22 percent fall to  595 billion in 2015  according to the Oslo based consultancy Rystad Energy   This will be the first time since the 1986 oil price downturn that we see two consecutive years of a decline in investments   Bjoernar Tonhaugen  vice president of oil and gas markets at Rystad Energy  told Reuters  The activities that survive will be those that offer the best returns   But with the sector s debt to equity ratio at a relatively low level of around 20 percent or below  industry sources say companies will take on even more borrowing to cover the shortfall in revenue in order to protect the level of dividend payouts  Shell has not cut its dividend since 1945  a tradition its present management is not keen to break  The rest of the sector is also averse to reducing payouts to shareholders  which include the world s biggest investment and pension funds   for fear investors might take flight   Exxon Mobil   N XOM  and Chevron benefit from the lowest debt ratios among the oil majors while Statoil and Repsol  MC REP  have the highest debt burden  according to Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel  FEW LARGE DECISIONS With only a handful of major projects approved in 2015  including Shell s Appomattox development in the Gulf of Mexico and Statoil s giant  29 billion Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea  2016 is also likely to see few large investment decisions  Projects that could be green lit include BP s  L BP  Mad Dog Phase 2 in the Gulf of Mexico  which the company now expects to cost less than  10 billion  around half the original estimate  and Chevron s expansion of the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan  according to Gammel  Industry wide  costs will be cut by reducing the size of projects  renegotiating supply contracts and using less complex technology   After rapidly expanding in the first half of the decade when oil prices were above  100 a barrel  companies are now expected to focus on the most profitable activities  said Brendan Warn  oil and gas equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets    Companies want to reduce their range of activity and pick those with the highest returns on capital   Warn said  Shell  which plans to complete its  54 billion acquisition of BG in February  intends to focus on the attractive liquefied natural gas  LNG  market and on deep water oil production  especially in Brazil  both areas in which BG is a leader  With similar priorities in mind  BP is increasingly focused on the Gulf of Mexico and Egypt  where it approved a  12 billion development in 2015  While tens of thousands of jobs have already been cut in 2015  more redundancies are expected this year as companies narrow their focus  Warn added   On top of reducing spending by scrapping and delaying projects  oil majors will see costs come down as contractors agree to further price reductions  For example  the annual cost of hiring a drilling ship fell to an average of  332 000 in 2015  compared with  405 000 in 2014  according to Rigzone  which collects industry data   The drop in investment bodes badly for services and contractor companies  which are seeing their work dry up  HOLD YOUR NERVE But with fewer projects approved  fewer fields developed and less maintenance work undertaken  companies are putting their growth at risk   You ve got to hold your nerve  If you cut too deeply  it is very  very difficult to take advantage of the price rebound when it comes   a senior official at a European oil major told Reuters  Tumbling oil prices have cut billions of dollars from oil companies  revenue streams  although strong profits from refining have softened the blow for most  And while their in house oil and gas production growth comes under pressure  companies might opt to acquire rivals with less resilient balance sheets  as with Shell s proposed acquisition of BG   In the second half of 2016  if we see price stabilization  I expect companies will be looking to replace reserves inorganically  by making acquisitions   Warn said

188920,410436,COP,Only Road To Alaska s Largest Oilfield Is Frozen Shut,news,"By    

Kristi Krueger drives three hours north from Fairbanks  Alaska each morning to stand near mile 58 on the Dalton Highway next to where a crew is scooping out contaminated soil from an oil spill  Her job is to hold up a sign that signals to truckers when they can safely pass  But for the last week  traffic along the highway  which serves as the only artery from the state s cities to the northern oilfields  has all but stopped  Krueger hasn t had all that much to do   It s eerily quiet right now   she says   We have walkie talkies and so we chitchat on those   Alaskans refer to the Dalton as  the road to the bank  because the vast majority of the state s revenue comes from taxes on oil produced at the end of the highway  A runaway river has caused massive flooding to form a giant ice sheet over the only route to the state s lucrative northern oilfields  threatening the supply chain that companies rely on to support workers and daily operations   On a typical day  at least 100 truckers would make the 15 hour drive from Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay to carry fuel  food  equipment and other supplies to workers who are staffing oilfield operations for  BP   LONDON BP   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   ExxonMobil and a host of other companies  On Sunday  Krueger said she had only directed about 15 trucks over the past few days  The shallow  braided Sagavanirktok River flows alongside the highway that Krueger flags for the road s final miles  But over the past few weeks  ice has uncharacteristically formed along its bottom and pushed the river s flow up from the channel and on to the road  The overflow runs several feet thick in some places and in other spots  it immediately froze into a thick mass of ice    The sudden flooding has made one of the state s most critical highways virtually impassable  The road has been closed for most of the past week  forcing Governor Bill Walker to declare a state of disaster to loosen up funds and permitting requirements so the state s Department of Transportation could double down its efforts to carve a roadway out of the mess  The agency has already exhausted its emergency funds and plans to request federal money to cover the remaining costs  while Alaska s Senate Finance Committee has committed  5 million to the cause     You re standing on a road that is three feet of ice   Meadow Bailey  public relations officer for the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities  says   It almost looks like you re on a glacier    everything is very blue  it s white and blues for as far as you can see   Trucks that continued to drive the route as conditions worsened sloshed through several feet of water and at times drove alongside a rushing river that ran higher than the road itself  video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player A crew of 28 state employees and private contractors has been working around the clock with 26 pieces of equipment to stop the overflow  The crew is building berms along the road from snow and digging culverts through the ice to divert the water  Next week  crop planes will begin dropping large batches of black sand on the river to absorb heat and melt the ice so its flow may return to normal    In the meantime  truckers with hundreds of loads destined for the oilfields have been waiting in Fairbanks and along the road   There are probably 100 to 150 trucks sort of stacked up along the roadway   Aves Thompson  executive director at the Alaska Trucking Association  says  Two communities and the dozen oil and gas companies they serve wait at the other end  in Deadhorse  a town of roughly 2 000 people and Prudhoe Bay  a community of around 5 000 whose name is synonymous with oil     Oil Keeps Flowing Amid low oil prices that have already gutted the state budget  a road closure that threatens to compromise oilfield operations is unwelcome news  About a dozen energy companies are pursuing oil in the region  which is home to America s third largest oilfield  Though not all of them are currently drilling for crude  even surveyors must be fully supported on the North Slope where all supplies for daily life are flown or trucked in   We need to be sure that the oil keeps flowing   Thompson says   We just want to do everything we can to be sure there is no interruption    Crude oil is transported from Prudhoe Bay through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System  a 800 mile pipeline  to a port in Valdez  Alaska  Though the pipeline runs parallel to the Dalton  its flow is not directly jeopardized by the flood or the road s closure    The Dalton Highway s natural disaster comes at a bad time  There is a narrow window between January and May when trucks can access remote sections of the oilfields by driving over temporary ice roads to places that typically are only accessible by barge or airplane  One of those areas is Point Thompson  where ExxonMobil has invested  2 billion to build a natural gas plant  BP and ConocoPhillips have both said they are using fuel and supply reserves to continue operations as normal while conserving the resources they have on hand    It s been a problem for the better part of a month and those reserves are only going to last so long  says Josh Kindred  environmental counsel at the Alaska Oil and Gas Association   They ve looked into alternative methods of getting fuel up there  which are of course more costly   Some companies have started to fly fuel in or hire machines called rolligons which use giant tracks to gently roll over the frozen tundra  to reach trucks with supplies that are stuck along the road    Caitlin Jelle  project engineer at Peak Oilfield Service Company in Prudhoe Bay which operates a fleet of 14 rolligons  says it takes the machines 15 hours to make the 40 mile round trip from Deadhorse to pick up the stranded loads  She says the approach is working so far  though slightly warmer springtime temperatures make the trek a challenge   We re being very careful  It s not an ideal time to put in a tundra route   she says   We are definitely typically parking our rolligons this time of year  not bringing out every one we have   So far  oil production has remained stable despite the closure of the Dalton and Kindred says he doesn t expect that to change     Transportation Woes Meanwhile  Thompson estimated that 700 to 800 loads were waiting to be transported from Fairbanks to the North Slope by truck on Tuesday  For drivers who make a living on the road  a closure can wreak havoc on schedules and bottom lines    The drivers on a company payroll are being paid  Some of the owner operators are having to absorb that cost   he says   It s costly for everybody  It s been very  very disruptive   Some truckers dropped off loads at staging areas alongside the highway so they could return to Fairbanks and pick up more cargo in an attempt to stay productive during the wait  The worst conditions remain between miles 390 and 405 of the 414 mile highway  so truckers can get most of the way to Prudhoe Bay before hitting the closure  A typical trip up the  haul road  from Fairbanks takes 10 to 15 hours  so they save significant time by only retracing a fraction of that distance  Truckers who regularly drive the haul road are no strangers to inclement weather   their struggles against frigid temperatures and freak blizzards have been chronicled in the History Channel series  Ice Road Truckers    but Thompson says a closure of this length is extremely rare   There will be times when there s a snowstorm so you have to wait out the snowstorm for maybe a few hours but in this case  it s a once in a lifetime event   he says  While truckers are feeling the pinch  Everts Air  an airline with a base in Fairbanks that specializes in hauling cargo to remote locations throughout Alaska  has added four to 12 flights a day on its largest aircraft to Deadhorse and other airstrips that directly serve the oilfields  The company typically runs three to six flights a day but business has picked up substantially since the overflow began  Robert Ragar vice president of contractual business  says  Slow Progress Earlier this week  the Department of Transportation temporarily opened the Dalton to small convoys of about 30 trucks carrying critical loads to drive a single open lane in either direction at a time  Though the road remains closed  the department announced on Tuesday that it had allowed 204 vehicles to pass through by the end of the day  Krueger  stationed along the highway with her flag  had started to notice a slight uptick in traffic    Though the problem has not been fully resolved  opinions about whether the overflow will continue to impede normal operations are mixed  At Everts Air  Ragar is bracing for the long haul   This particular road closing on the Dalton has not been experienced in anybody s memory   never   he says   There seems to be a belief that this is going to go on for awhile

188930,410446,COP,Exclusive  Iran sweetens oil contracts to counter sanctions and price plunge,news,"By Parisa Hafezi and Jonathan Saul ANKARA LONDON  Reuters    Iran is sweetening the terms it offers on oil development contracts to draw the interest of foreign investors deterred by sanctions and low crude prices  as its pragmatic president seeks to deliver on his promise of economic recovery   Tehran is engaged in talks with world powers about its disputed nuclear program as it tries to strike a final deal to lift the sanctions that have halved its oil exports to just over 1 million barrels per day since 2012 and hammered its economy  To prepare for any agreement  it has already circulated new draft oil contracts to foreign firms to attract business once the restrictions end  Iranian oil officials and Western diplomatic sources said  Such deals would involve helping Iran revive aging fields and develop new ones  they added   But there is no certainty about the outcome of the nuclear negotiations  The contracts offer far more favorable terms than those offered pre sanctions as many companies would be hesitant to sign even a preliminary deal which U S  and European governments could regard as jumping the gun  Companies may also require greater persuasion to invest in Iranian fields due to low crude prices  which have more than halved since June  and the turbulent relationship Iran has had with foreign firms in the past  especially after the 1979 Islamic revolution   The new contract is more competitive than other oil producers  It provides higher potential profits and lower investment risks   said a senior Iranian oil ministry official who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter  The contract offered a favorable rate of return and joint venture options with local Iranian firms  he added   The new contracts will offer long term durations of up to 25 years  oil officials say   A spokesman for Iran s oil ministry declined to comment on the nature of the contracts   Previously  foreign investors have only been involved in exploration and development of oil fields  They operated under buy back contracts  whereby they were paid a fixed rate of return and did not own the assets and were contractors without rights to the fields  Analysts and industry sources said companies had failed to cover their costs under this mechanism  which offered no long term guarantees of income  The situation has changed  however  President Hassan Rouhani  who won power in 2013 with pledges to improve the economy  is seeking to end a malaise that has seen prices of food  water and electricity rise beyond the reach of many Iranians as high unemployment and low wages take their toll   CONTROL The new oil contracts will allow investors to be involved in production  giving them far greater control and certainty over long term revenue in a country where foreign ownership of oil resources is banned    The Iranian petroleum contracts are more relaxed to encourage major investors     For example in previous contracts  the commerciality was decided by an Iranian committee but under the new contracts it has been changed in a way to accommodate the foreign party   the oil ministry official said   Another oil ministry official said   The major incentive for an international oil company  IOC  is the possibility to book the reserves  something that was not possible in the past     One of the terms  on offer  is the long term joint venture between the IOC and the Iranian operator    The investors will have no rights over the reserves but     after exploration is completed  they can report output they receive as payment   the official added   Iran s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh has met with Western oil executives at recent OPEC meetings in Vienna  including Italy s Eni  Royal Dutch Shell and Austrian oil and gas group OMV  Iranian sources declined to identify which companies had seen the draft oil contracts  There has been oil industry speculation that Shell and ConocoPhillips could be among parties to have been courted       Shell declined to comment  ConocoPhillips said it acted in full compliance with U S  law and was  not engaged in business dealings with Iran    One Western diplomatic source said the interest in oil dialogue with foreign companies was  one sided and mostly coming from Iran s side     Iran is looking a lot less interesting and desirable from the perspective of Western oil companies  There s too much oil on the market so the last thing they want is for Iran to come back on line

London  which was due to have taken place in February to reveal its new contracts  until November  An Iranian official said  the U S  urged Tehran to hold off  until a final nuclear deal was penned  Washington has reiterated it continues to enforce sanctions  Iran and six world powers are trying to meet a self imposed deadline of the end of June to resolve the nuclear standoff over Iran s nuclear work  which the West fears is aimed at developing a weapons capability   a charge Iran denies  saying it is for peaceful  civilian purposes   When contacted  a British Foreign Office spokesman said the government did not support the London oil conference     It would be premature in the absence of a comprehensive nuclear deal   the spokesman said  adding that encouraging trade with Iran  would send the wrong signal    The UK government does not encourage trade with Iran  Until we have a nuclear agreement that fully restores international confidence in the nature of Iran s nuclear activity it will be necessary to maintain consistent pressure on Iran through sanctions   he said      Analysts say Iran is still not open for business  Mehdi Varzi  a former official at the state run National

Warren Buffett   s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRK A   NYSE BRK B  has dumped its  3 7 billion share of Exxon Mobil Corporation NYSE XOM amid the decline in crude oil prices  The investing conglomerate also exited its diminishing position in ConocoPhillips NYSE COP  according to an SEC filing this week 
Global oil companies are curtailing spending and eliminating thousands of jobs after crude prices plunged by 50 percent over six months  to below  50 a barrel  Surging U S  production and steady output from Saudi Arabia helped create a supply glut just as global demand was weakening  Oil prices have recovered slightly from their January lows  though analysts aren   t projecting more than  60 a barrel crude on average this year 
Berkshire Hathaway  the world   s fourth biggest company  held 41 1 million Exxon Mobil shares as of Sept  30  2014  and no shares as of Dec  31  2014  the firm disclosed in the Tuesday regulatory filing  Berkshire Hathaway was Exxon Mobil   s sixth largest shareholder  and the stake was the eighth largest in the Buffett run portfolio  Forbes notes 
Quarterly profits for Irving  Texas based Exxon Mobil fell by 21 percent due to weak oil prices  the energy giant said earlier this month  Oil and natural gas production fell 3 8 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous period 
Exxon Mobil stock dipped slightly Tuesday morning to  92 30 a share before inching back up to  93 05 by closing 
Berkshire Hathaway   s shares in ConocoPhillips dwindled to zero by the end of last quarter  down from about 472 000 in the third quarter  or less than 0 1 percent of the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio  Forbes notes  The Buffett company had been steadily shedding its position for the past several years 
Berkshire has    not really had the hot hand in energy     Fadel Gheit  an analyst for Oppenheimer   Co  in New York  told Bloomberg News     The whole energy sector obviously is now traded in completely different circumstances than they were only a year ago    
Even so  Berkshire isn   t giving up on oil stocks entirely  The holding firm last quarter boosted its bet on oil refiner Phillips 66 NYSE PSX  and it raised its stake in Suncor Energy Inc  NYSE SU  a Canadian producer of synthetic crude  to 22 4 million shares  according to the filing ",2015-02-18,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/buffett-dumps-$3.7b-exxon-mobil-investment-328587,328587

The prospects for Arctic shipping and oil extraction in the new year loom large among representatives from polar nations gathered to deliberate the state of the region in Troms   Norway this week  Russia is there to ponder the theme of  Climate and Energy   And China  too  is proving an eager participant  The weeklong meeting  called Arctic Frontiers  is the annual forum for world leaders to consider the Arctic through many lenses as a scientific frontier  a budding business opportunity for shipping firms and oil companies and a political arena replete with power grabs and cross border cooperation  The gathering of some 1 400 participants takes place amid growing international tension over which countries have rightful claims to the region  The opportunity to develop natural resources in the Arctic is vast as reservoirs there still hold 13 percent of the world s oil and 30 percent of its natural gas  according to the US Energy Information Administration  The cost of developing those resources  however  can run 50 to 100 percent higher than if the same reserves were to be tapped in Texas  Last fall  Russia claimed a broad swath of ocean floor in the Arctic holding billions of tons of oil and gas  and more recently ramped up its military presence in the area  At the conference  Alexander Sergunin of St  Petersburg State University and Alyson JK Bailes of University of Iceland weighed in on whether the Ukrainian crisis and Russia s military build up off its northern shore would set off alarm bells for other polar states  Sergunin pointed to the role of the Arctic Council  an international governing body for the region  in assuaging these concerns  The U S  will chair the council for two years beginning later this spring after taking the reigns from Canada  Admiral Robert J  Papp  a U S  Arctic ambassador  has started a string of political visits to Russia and other Arctic nations including a keynote speech at the conference to set the stage for U S  leadership  Meanwhile  China continues to make clear its growing interest in the Arctic  Sun Xiansheng  the director general of China National Petroleum Corporation  said that his country is ready to assist with the development of the region s resources according to Newsweek  The Chinese also wish to scout new trade routes  which can cut the distance between Asia and Europe by 40 percent  China edged closer to the Arctic by receiving observer status in the Arctic Council in 2013 after declaring itself a  near Arctic  state  This year s conference opened with a debate on whether the area s resources are still worth developing in a time of falling oil prices  Norway is expected to open new licenses off its shores soon  according to the Barents Observer   Those licenses will be licenses to lose money   said Jens Ulltveit Moe  an investor with Umoe  during the debate  Others disagree   Breaking price for production depends on the size and the fields locations  Some fields might have a cost as low as  50 per barrel   said Kjell Gi ver  director of Petro Arctic  according to the Observer  The International Energy Agency still predicts a 37 percent rise in global energy demand by 2040  Greg Leveille of ConocoPhillips  in a presentation to the conference  called the booming development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources the  greatest energy success story of the 21st century  ",2015-01-21,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/who-owns-the-arctic -russia,-china-and-others-debate-324491",324491

PortfolioEfficiency  a company s ability to transform inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of financial health  Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar irrespective of market conditions as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency Key Ratios to Identify EfficiencySometimes it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company  This is the reason why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks  These efficiency ratios are Inventory Turnover  The ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a four quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios  It indicates a company s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position  While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS  a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales  which has resulted in excess inventory Receivables Turnover   This is the ratio of 12 month sales to four quarter average receivables  It shows a company s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit  A high receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or  debtor s turnover ratio  is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers Asset Utilization  This ratio indicates a company s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level  It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four quarter average of total assets  Like the above ratios  high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient Operating Margin  This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period  It measures a company s ability to control operating expenses  Hence  a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than peers For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Disclosure  Officers

188980,410496,COP,Oil group wants highest danger label for Bakken rail shipments,news,"NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  oil industry group is recommending that all crude shipped by rail from North Dakota s Bakken fields be labeled as the most dangerous type of oil cargo  a designation that could hasten the use of new or upgraded tank cars 
On Monday  the North Dakota Petroleum Council  NDPC  released the final results of a wide scale study on the quality characteristics of Bakken crude  which has been involved in several fiery oil train derailments over the past year 
The study confirmed preliminary findings released in May suggesting that Bakken was little different from other forms of light  sweet U S  crude and posed no greater threat versus other fuels when transported by rail 
The NDPC also issued a series of recommendations following the study  however  including one urging oil by rail shippers to classify all Bakken crude oil as  Packing Group I  hazardous materials 
That is the highest risk level of a three tiered danger assessment  and the NDPC said it was recommended  even though the majority of samples tested for the study would fall within specifications for PG  Packing Group  II  
Current methods for testing boiling point  the key criteria for differentiating PG I and II classifications  can be inconsistent  the NDPC said  Because it typically contains a high proportion of very light hydrocarbons and petroleum gases  Bakken crude tends to boil at lower temperatures 
 The margin of error for the test methodology can result in different labs testing the same sample with values meeting both PGs  PG I has the more stringent standards and is therefore recommended to avoid further confusion   said the NDPC report  which was prepared by industry consultants Turner  Mason   Co 
Historically the Packing Group label has made no material difference in how oil is handled on trains  its only purpose was to inform emergency responders about the cargo  The DOT 111 tank car  the model used almost exclusively to ship oil by rail  is able to transport any Packing Group  Many oil companies have been using PG I routinely simply to ensure they were compliant 
But under new regulations proposed last month by the U S  Department of Transportation  the Packing Group determination could become a pivotal factor in determining how quickly shippers use new or upgraded tank cars that will gradually replace older model DOT 111s long seen as flawed 
The NDPC represents major producers in the Bakken including Marathon Oil Corp  N MRO   ConocoPhillips  N COP   Continental Resources  N CLR  and Hess  N HES  
Authorities had already begun to crack down on misclassified oil shipments after the Lac Megantic tragedy in Canada last year  when a runaway oil train with cargo from the Bakken energy patch derailed and killed 47 people in the center of a Quebec town 
In February  the DOT s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  PHMSA  fined three companies for using incorrect Packing Group labels for their Bakken cargoes  Two of them had mislabeled shipments as PG II  when in fact they should have been labeled PG I  A third company had used a PG III label rather than PG II 
The DOT rules last month said older model DOT 111 cars would not be allowed to carry Packing Group I crudes within two years  while less dangerous crudes that fall into PGs II and III could still be shipped in the older cars for three and five years 

The rules are open to public comment and may not be finalized for several months 
In its own study released last month  the PHMSA said most crude from the Bakken tested as PG I or II material    with a predominance to PG I   It also said the oil was  more volatile than most other types of crude   a finding disputed by both the American Petroleum Institute and NDPC

188981,410497,COP,Alaska oil tax supporters fending off repeal efforts,news,"By Steve Quinn JUNEAU Alaska  Reuters    Alaska voters looked on track to narrowly uphold a new law that cuts taxes on oil production and is worth up to  1 billion a year to companies such as ConocoPhillips  N COP   BP Plc  L BP  and Exxon Mobil Corp  N XOM  
With 80 percent of voting precincts reporting results in Tuesday s primary  those favoring the law held a four point lead  according to unofficial returns posted by the Alaska Division of Elections 
Upholding the 8 month old tax reduction ushered in by Governor Sean Parnell means the state would not revert back to the system implemented by his old boss  Sarah Palin  who raised taxes in 2007 
Results will not be certified until Sept  2  said state elections director Gail Fenumiai  who added that nearly 11 000 absentee ballots needed to be counted over the next 10 days 
Parnell  who claimed his own victory in the state s Republican primary election on Tuesday night  has said his tax rollback will make Alaska more competitive for investment and North Slope oil producers  He called the More Alaska Production Act crucial to the state s long term future because it would reverse declining output 
Repeal backers got on the ballot last year with a petition featuring 50 000 signatures shortly after Parnell signed Senate Bill 21  They have faced opposition that has raised close to  15 million compared with their several hundred thousand dollars 
Those pushing for the repeal said Parnell s system only put more money in the oil companies  pockets for investment elsewhere while depleting the state s fiscal war chest

188982,410498,COP,Venezuela says to pay less than  1 billion to Exxon over nationalization,news,"By Andrew Cawthorne and Diego Ore CARACAS  Reuters    Venezuela will end up paying less than  1 billion to Exxon Mobil Corp  N XOM  for oil assets nationalized in 2007  after this week s World Bank tribunal award  the Venezuelan government said on Friday 
Venezuela says it will deduct a previous award made against it by another international tribunal  the Paris based International Chamber of Commerce  ICC   from Thursday s  1 6 billion ruling by the World Bank s ICSID body   In concrete  exact terms  our republic will have to cancel something less than  1 billion  that is to say 5 percent of Exxon Mobil s pretentions against our country   said Ramirez  who until a cabinet reshuffle several weeks ago  was head of the oil ministry and state oil company PDVSA 
A senior PDVSA source told Reuters on Thursday that the company would pay the compensation ordered after November 
Exxon received  908 million from PDVSA in 2012 after a separate decision by the ICC over the same claim  but had been seeking far more overall 
 We re ready  We have no problem finishing up this determination and closing this chapter that became a menace to the economy of our nation   Ramirez added at a news conference 
The case relates to the 2007 takeover of a large heavy crude project in the Orinoco region by then president Hugo Chavez s socialist government 
Venezuela is hailing the outcome as a victory for its sovereignty over rapacious Western multinationals  and oil workers were shown celebrating on state TV on Friday 
Exxon  though  has also expressed satisfaction  saying the decision vindicated its view it had not been properly compensated 
PRECEDENT FOR CONOCO 
Hot on the heels of the Exxon ruling  ConocoPhillips  N COP  said on Friday it had also filed for arbitration at the ICC against PDVSA for compensation related to the termination of its partnership contract after a nationalization 
That ICC filing is separate from the U S  oil company s arbitration pending before the World Bank s International Center for Settlement for Investment Disputes  ICSID  
The cases come at a delicate time for Venezuela s finances  with the economy apparently entering recession   though official data has been suppressed   and multi billion bond payments due 
 Although the government has downplayed the Exxon Mobil ruling  it clearly creates additional fiscal strains at a time when oil prices are falling and the sovereign and PDVSA face large external debt repayments   said the Economist Intelligence Unit s analyst Federico Barriga 
 Questions over Venezuela s capacity to pay have accentuated in recent months  given the dismal state of the economy and falling international reserves  
PDVSA is seeking to ease its debt burden through swaps 
Despite Ramirez s estimate of an under  1 billion payment to Exxon  Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated the eventual cost at  1 027 billion  including interest  while Barclays put it at  1 billion to  1 2 billion 
 We expect the government to try to buy time before making the payment and do not think the ruling will affect the country s capacity to pay bonds maturing this month   Barclays analyst Alejandro Grisanti said

since 2014  Further  the November payroll report showed that the domestic labor market continued its recovery from the effects of hurricanes  while jobless rate ticked stayed at a 17 year low of 4 1   The central bank s lifting of short term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point can also be interpreted as a by product of rising economic growth and optimism  The expected  policy normalization  simply indicates that the economy is ready for the  quantitative easing  tap to be turned off  Though higher interest rates raise the cost of debt capital  an expanding economy supersedes low borrowing costs in the grand scheme of things  Meanwhile  President Trump s proposals to overhaul the tax law and make it business friendly  added to the positive sentiment and powered

give negative returns to investors this year  A strong third quarter notwithstanding  energy   which was the best S P sector performer in 2016  with a market thumping 24  return   has not exactly had a great year  The  sector is down more than 1  year to date versus 21 9  growth for the broader S P 500   With U S  drillers ramping up their output quickly in response to the extension of  until the end of 2018 and rising rig count pointing to further jump in American production  the tightening of global oil market is getting undermined and prices are under constant pressure  The steady trend of rising domestic oil production continues to be the biggest headwind for the market  As per the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release  U S  output rose by 73 000 barrels per day  for the week ending Dec 8  to 9 8 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983  Market participants argue that fundamentals point to a looming oil supply growth despite WTI crude currently staying above the  55 per barrel mark  A Handful of Companies Defied the Downturn Even amid the volatile  declining market  some companies have stood firm  indicating investors  confidence in them  If bought now  these stocks are likely to outperform others and create long term wealth  However  selecting stocks to buy could be a tricky proposition  especially with

189038,410554,COP,Dow s Winning Streak Ends At Five Days,opinion,"Well  Congressional leaders say they have a tax plan all worked out and President Trump can t wait to sign it   but it still needs to pass first  The market got a bit rattled on Thursday when Senator Marco Rubio said he would vote  no  on the plan unless it expands the child tax credit  The odds are still pretty good that something will get passed soon  but such uncertainties can just gnaw at stocks throughout the course of a session  That s what happened today and  unfortunately  it meant the end to an impressive streak for one of the major indices 
	The Dow slipped by 0 31  to 24 508 7  ending a five day winning streak that also included four straight all time highs  The S P declined 0 41  to 2652 and the NASDAQ was off 0 28  to 6 856 5  The tax uncertainty spoiled some good economic data in the session  especially a gain of 0 8  in November retail sales that trounced expectations of only 0 25   Any pullbacks will likely be a buying opportunity  which is why we had a new buy today   said Jeremy in Counterstrike 
	The buy turned out to be one of the biggest energy companies in the world  which the editor added in anticipation of higher oil prices  He also sold a name for a double digit profit  That was all the activity in the portfolios today  However  the highlights section below has more than just the Counterstrike moves  it also includes a couple excerpts from other services  Give it a look Today s Portfolio Highlights Counterstrike  Now that Twitter  TWTR  has finally found a way to monetize its platform  shares of the social media staple have taken out the portfolio s  23 target  The move prompted Jeremy to sell half the position for a 12 3  advance in a little over a month  The editor stresses that there s nothing wrong with the stock  which is why he s hanging onto half   he s just being disciplined and taking profits 
	Meanwhile  Jeremy wants to be in the energy space in early 2018  as he expects crude to retake  60 and then some  For now though  a leader like ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  is a bargain  so it was added to the portfolio with a 12  allocation  The editor likes its risk reward and its longer term outlook  COP beat by 77  in its most recent report and is a good candidate for a long stay in Counterstrike  Read the full write up for more specifics on these moves  
	Insider Trader   Investors turned pessimistic on Wall Street today on renewed fears that the tax reform plan may not pass after all 
	 Basically  until this is signed  no one really believes it will happen   Additionally  much of the excitement surrounding it may now be priced in  Wall Street loves to anticipate things  Stocks will often run up into an event  such as a Fed meeting where they may cut rates or do QE  and then see little movement after the event actually occurs  Much of this year s rally was likely pricing in the tax reform plan so it could be that the bulls will actually be  ho hum  about it once it actually passes  if it does       Tracey Ryniec
	Large Cap Trader   Retail sales in the world s most important economy rose  0 8  last month from October  the Commerce Department said on Thursday  The figure is ahead of the  0 3  increase consensus was expecting and comes on top of a  0 5  advance recorded in October 
	 So called control retail sales  which exclude volatile items like autos  petrol sales and other products like building materials  also rose  0 8  from October   topping analysts  estimates for an  0 4  rise 
	 The data offer further evidence of strength in consumer spending and give Fed officials another thing to think about as they deliberate on the direction of interest rates for next year      John Blank
	All the Best

189138,410654,COP,Chevron  CVX  Gears Up For First Shale Development In Canada,opinion,"Integrated energy company Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   recently announced that its Canadian unit is progressing with its shale play development in the East Kaybob region located in Duvernay formation of west central Alberta  It will be the company s first shale play development in Canada 
Of the 330 000 acres in the formation  Chevron Canada holds 70  operating stakes  where it plans to start development in about 55 000 acres of the liquid rich Duvernay  It has been almost eight years since the company registered its presence in Duvernay and is now one the biggest landholders in the basin  Chevron used its experience of operating in the North American shale assets during appraisal drilling for the project  The company has yet to provide the financial details of the project  which is expected to come online during the second half of 2019 
Midstream company Pembina Pipeline Corp    NYSE PBA   is expected to invest C 290 million to create an infrastructure that will be able to ship and process gas and condensate 
The Canadian oil industry  which is ruled by the oil sands of northern Alberta  has witnessed around  23 billion worth of divestments this year from several oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   and others after oil prices fell during the first half of the year 
However  Canadian shale plays   like Duvernay and Montney   continue to remain attractive to players like Chevron as it is much cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in these formations compared to the costly oil sands  Apart from the assets in the Duvernay formation  Chevron has stakes in the Liard and Horn River basins located in Western Canada 
About the Company and Zacks Rank
San Ramon  CA based Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world  based on proved reserves  The company is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production  refining and marketing of petroleum products  manufacturing of chemicals  and other energy related businesses  Chevron  in its present form  resulted from the 2001 merger between Texaco and Chevron Corporation  Chevron s operations are divided into two main segments  Upstream and Downstream 
In the third quarter  Chevron generated  5 4 billion in operating cash flow  while shelling out around  5 2 billion in capital expenditures and dividends  This led to around  200 million of excess cash flows  something that the company achieved for the first time since 2012  As a result of Chevron s focus on planning and execution  the company continues to reduce its operating costs with underlying expenses down almost 5  year to date compared with 2016  Cash capital expenditures for the first nine months of the year are also down 30  
Chevron targets to grow volume by 4 9  in 2017  This is largely dependent on few big projects  However  sudden and unforeseen damage may reduce the company s planned net increase in output  In particular  Chevron s high profile Gorgon LNG development in Australia is suffering from mechanical issues that may restrict its ramp up 
Chevron has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

189236,410752,COP,Will Shift To Anadarko Reshape The U S  Shale Play Map ,opinion,"In a low oil price environment  oil companies looking for options to reduce the cost of production and cope up with oil price volatility  For this reason  many of the U S  oil companies have left the Canadian oil sands and moved to the Permian Basin where production cost is lower 
Apart from the Permian Basin  there are five other major oil producing regions in the United States  which are covered by EIA in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report  These include Appalachia  Bakken  Eagle Ford  Haynesville and Niobrara 
However there is growing interest in another shale play located to the north of Permian Basin  It has witnessed a brisk increase in investment and drilling activity recently  which has prompted the EIA to include the region in its monthly Drilling Productivity Report  The growing presence of shale players in the Anadarko region may have led to its inclusion  The region incorporates 24 Oklahoma and five Texas counties 
Production Related Details
In terms of production  the Anadarko region generated 447 000 barrels of oil and 5 979 million cubic feet of gas per day in August 2017  Moreover  the region is becoming popular due to surging natural gas production and the trend is expected to continue in the coming month 
The month over month data shows that the region is likely to register an increase in oil and gas production  for September 2017  by 12 000 barrels and 78 million cubic feet per day  respectively 

Why the Shift 
The interest in Anadarko region   incorporates one of the most prolific natural gas reserves in North America   can be attributed to the rising opportunity of using upgraded drilling and completion technology 
Another factor that is increasing the focus on Anadarko is rising lease operating expenses in the Permian Basin  There is also a shortage of oilfield services and occasional production hiccups from time to time in the Permian Basin  Investors should know that 129 rigs  as of July  were actively engaged in drilling activities in Anadarko basin  which were less than 373 active rigs in the crowded Permian Basin 
The Anadarko region includes the STACK  Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher  LON KGF  Counties  and the SCOOP  South Central Oklahoma Oil Province  plays  These two areas have witnessed an increase in investment from exploration and production companies in the recent years 
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation   NYSE APC    SandRidge Energy  Inc    NYSE SD    Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR    Newfield Exploration Company   NYSE NFX    Apache Corporation   NYSE APA    and ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   are among the oil companies operating in the basin  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation presently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

189247,410763,COP,4 Stocks To Watch For Explosive Earnings Acceleration,opinion,Right from the top brass to research analysts  earnings growth captivates all  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Take a company s revenues over a given period of time  subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings Studies  however  have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement  Hence  earnings acceleration works even better in lifting the stock price Future OutperformersBasically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance The Winning StrategyLet s look at stocks for which the last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS

Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3   The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3  In addition to this  we have added the following parameters Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This screens out the low

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  CRZO  RDS A  COP  LNG   SDRL 

	It was a week where both oil and gas prices registered gains 

	On the news front  energy explorerCarrizo Oil   Gas Inc   NASDAQ          and supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc  NYSE          announced purchase agreements  while large independent producerConocoPhillips  NYSE          agreed to sell acreage in the Barnett shale field in Texas 

	Overall  the sector ended the second quarter on a positive note  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures added 7  to close at  46 04 per barrel  while natural gas prices rose 3 62  to  3 035 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

	Oil prices staged a slight recovery from previous week s 10 month lows  encouraged by the U S  Energy Department s inventory release that showed a fall in domestic oil production  Per the most recent report  U S  output decreased 100 000 barrels per day   the largest decline since July 2016  Some sector observers see the third decrease in the last 8 weeks as a sign of brake in shale oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market 

	Investors also rejoiced over a reduction in the U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country  for the first time in 6 months   again pointing to a slowdown in shale output 

	Meanwhile  natural gas also turned higher following a smaller than expected increase in weekly supplies 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  Upstream energy company Carrizo Oil   Gas Inc  signed a purchase and sale agreement with ExL Petroleum Management  LLC    a portfolio company of private equity and venture capital firm  Quantum Energy Partners    to acquire Delaware Basin assets for  648 million in cash and potential contingent payments 

	The acquisition of the assets is in line with the company s plan to increase its core position in Delaware Basin  one of the highest return plays in North America 

	Carrizo will receive 23 656 gross  16 488 net  acres after the acquisition  which is expected to close in mid August  in Reeves and Ward counties  Net production from the asset is around 8 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE d   of which 48  is oil  The company will get 11 operational wells and seven prospective wells  Although ExL is presently operating with four rigs in the area  Carrizo plans to start operations with three rigs after the acquisition 

	The contingent payment requires Carrizo to pay ExL  50 million per year  maximum of  125 million  if U S  oil averages more than  50 per barrel in any calendar year during period 2018 2021   Read more     

	2  One of the world s largest independent oil producer ConocoPhillips has decided to divest its stake in the Barnett Shale for a consideration of roughly  305 million plus net customary adjustments  The buyer of the asset is a unit of Miller Thomson   Partners  involved in the acquisition and development of natural gas resources  It is to be noted that proceeds from the sale will likely be utilized for ConocoPhillips  general corporate activities 

	The divestment reflects the company s objective to lower its exposure to natural gas rich resources  During 2016  net production from the Barnett Shale was 11 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE D   Of the total output  natural gas accounted for 55   while natural gas liquids comprised 45  

	With the Barnett Shale transaction likely to close by the third quarter of 2017  the company s 2017 production guidance is likely to get slashed by 5 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBOED   However  the company believes that there will not be any material impact on cashflows for this year following the divestment   Read more     

	3  Shell Energy North America or SENA  a part of the integrated oil company Royal Dutch Shell plc recently signed a purchase agreement to acquire power and retail electric company  MP2 Energy  The acquisition   whose financial details have yet to be disclosed   is expected to be closed by the third quarter of 2017 

	The Woodlands based MP2 operates power plants and provides retail power to final consumers  Its operations also include commodity hedging  asset and risk management  execution of transactions  and delivering according to the precise needs of the clients  On the other hand  SENA s operations incorporate commercial and industrial retail energy management on the west coast of the US 

	The deal will diversify Shell s business and help it to expand its electricity presence beyond the West Coast and spreading into Texas  the Midwest and the East Coast  Shell will be able to use MP2 s network and self developed proprietary systems and technology to supply market based solutions to manage energy supply  load  and generation  In particular  the MP2 buy will help complement Shell s transition away from oil and gas as part of its efforts to reduce operational carbon footprint   Read more    

	4  U S  based natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy Inc   NYSEMKT         recently inked a deal to export liquefied natural gas to Lithuania s state owned gas trader Lietuvos Duju Tiekimas  The company   currently carrying a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   expects to deliver the first U S  LNG cargo by the second half of August  You can see     

	This is the first LNG import deal that Lithuania signed with the U S   adding to the long list of buyers of U S  s LNG supply  With the energy production boom in U S   the nation is likely to become the world s largest LNG supplier by 2035  transcending Australia and Qatar 

	With domestic prices remaining constrained due to abundant supplies  Cheniere Energy sees a big opportunity in selling U S  natural gas production at higher prices overseas  Interestingly  the company is the only LNG exporter of the U S  and plans to turn the natural gas glut into export revolution  Cheniere Energy commenced its LNG cargo exports in early 2016 and currently exports natural gas to around 20 countries including Latin America  Europe  Asia  Middle East  Japan  Korea  India and others   Read more

	The company has been contemplating restructuring under bankruptcy for quite some time now and is in advanced talks with the lenders  The company expects to conclude the negations with the creditors by the end of June  However  with the one month extension in the credit facility provided to North Atlantic Drilling  investors can expect that the company will release its restructuring plans by the end of next month   Read more

189250,410766,COP,ConocoPhillips  COP  Posts Earnings In Q2  Cuts Capex View,opinion,"Upstream energy player ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   reported second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share that compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents and year ago quarter loss of 79 cents 
Revenues of  8 882 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 735 million  The top line also improved from  5 575 million in the year ago quarter   
Higher realized prices from commodities sold primarily led to the strong Q2 numbers  Production ramp up from numerous key developments also supported the numbers 
Exploration and Production
Production from continuing operations averaged 1 437 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day  MBOED  in the quarter  as compared with 1 546 MBOED in the year ago quarter  The decline was led by field decline  which was negated partially by production ramp up from numerous key developments 
Price Realization
Average realized price for oil was  48 16 per barrel  compared with  42 72 in the year earlier quarter  Natural gas liquids were sold at  20 99 a barrel versus  16 55 a year ago  The price of natural gas was  3 83 per thousand cubic feet  compared with  2 49 in second quarter 2016     
Financials
As of Jun 30  2017  the company had total cash and cash equivalents of  7 5 billion and debt of  23 5 billion  with a debt to capitalization ratio of 43   In the reported quarter  ConocoPhillips generated  1 8 billion in cash from operating activities  The company spent  1 billion as capital expenditures and investments and paid dividends worth  331 million 
Total Expense
The company reported expenses of  13 2 billion in the second quarter  as compared with  7 2 billion in the April June quarter of 2016 
Q2 Share Performance
The company s price chart has shown considerable weakness through the quarter  During the aforesaid period  ConocoPhillips has lost 11 9   compared with the 16 9  decline of the  

Guidance
ConocoPhillips  third quarter 2017 production guidance is pegged at the range of 1 170 1 210 MBOED  excluding production from Libya 
Weak oil and gas pricing scenario compelled the company to slash 2017 capital budget from the earlier projection of  5 billion to  4 8 billion  It seems that ConocoPhillips is following the likes of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation   NYSE APC   and Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   in this regard 
Zacks Rank   Key Pick
ConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   A better ranked player in the energy sector is TransCanada Corporation   TO TRP    with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

189259,410775,COP,There Will Be Blood In The Energy Sector,opinion,"Ladies and gentlemen  if I say I m an oil man  you will agree  Now  you have a great chance here  but bear in mind  you can lose it all if you re not careful 

Daniel Plainview  There Will Be Blood  2007 
The stark 2007 film  There Will Be Blood  featured one of my all time favorite actors  Daniel Day Lewis  as a self proclaimed  oil man  who comes to Little Boston  California to capitalize on the town s newly discovered oil reserves  As the movie s ominous title implies  the plan doesn t go exactly as expected  and the movie eventually culminates with a dark  bloody scene in a bowling alley  parental supervision strongly advised  
Lately  the fate of oil bulls has been similarly dark  Plenty of bullish blood has already been spilled in the oil market  and with today s drop to a new year to date low in West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude  the outlook looks likely to get worse before it gets any better 
The proximate fundamental cause for this week s drop has been news that Libya is pumping the most crude oil in four years after a deal with Wintershall AG enabled at least two fields to resume production  In addition  the amount of oil stored in offshore tankers reached its highest level of the year at 112M barrels  As any economics 101 student will tell you  a large increase in supply will inevitably push down price  cetis paribus  
Six weeks ago  we took a deep dive into the absolute and relative performance of the S P 500 s energy sector   At that point  we concluded that 

  W ith this year s breakdown from the 2016 s  bearish flag  pattern  the long term underperformance of energy stocks could carry over through 2017 and beyond 

Updating the relative performance chart from that early May piece suggests that  if anything  the outlook for energy stocks has worsened with the latest drop in oil prices

189278,410794,COP,EIA Says U S  Crude Supplies Declined For The Sixth Week,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles declined for the sixth straight week  continuing to drag down the overall surplus  Moreover  domestic oil production fell for the first time in 3 months  On a further positive note  the report revealed that refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   both decreased from their previous week levels 
While these data sets might be considered as bullish ahead of next week s crucial OPEC meeting  many traders pointed out that the crude drawdown was smaller than expected and the commodity s overall supply still remain much more than what the market can absorb 
As it is  oil prices have been on a downward spiral over the past month  erasing most of the gains associated with the OPEC led output cut  The continued rise in domestic production thanks to soaring shale output have dragged down the commodity below the psychologically critical  50 threshold 
Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1 75 million barrels for the week ending May 12  2017  following a decline of 5 25 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 2 2 million barrels  An uptick in refinery demand and a dip in domestic oil output  for the first time in 13 weeks  led to the stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer though the withdrawal failed to match up with expectations 
While the sixth straight inventory reduction will further help narrow the year over year storage surplus  the U S  still remains awash with excess oil  At 520 77 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 2  from the year ago period and are in the upper limit of the average range during this time of the year 
Worryingly  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   inched up 35 000 barrels from previous week s level to 66 31 million barrels 
The crude supply cover was down from 30 7 days in the previous week to 30 5 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 33 6 days 
Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were down for the second week in a row on lower production and imports  The 413 000 million barrels draw   below polled number of 500 000 barrels decrease in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles down to 240 67 million barrels  Despite last week s decline  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1  higher than the year earlier level but is over the upper half of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  went down by 1 94 million barrels last week  well ahead of the analysts  expectations for a 1 3 million barrels fall  Following the third successive reduction in distillate fuel stocks  at 146 82 million barrels  distillate supplies are 4  lower than the year ago level but are within the upper half of the average range for this time of the year 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 1 9  from the prior week to 93 4

189290,410806,COP,Oil Prices Soar After Saudi Arabia And Russia Extend Oil Production Cuts,opinion,"Oil Cut Extension
Oil prices are soaring after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they have agreed to extend oil production cuts beyond the agreed upon deadline for another 9 months  That means both Russia and Saudi Arabia will extend cuts to March of 2018 at a time when we are seeing evidence that the prior cuts are just starting to have an impact  It appears that the oil cuts had a lag time to get the market in balance as U S  shale producers increased output but also as traders dumped oil from floating storage and releases of oil from the U S  Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
But now with rising demand and a commitment by Russia and Saudi Araiba to extend cuts  we could see the recent 5 week drop in U S  oil inventories continue for the foreseeable future  Add the potential default of Venezuelan bonds and the upcoming Iranian election  and we could see more support as prices get back what they gave back in the month of April  The extension of the cuts may drive global inventories below the five year average as demand starts to rise 
Saudi Arabia s energy minister  Khalid al Falih  was serious when he said he would do whatever it takes to get global supply back to the five year average  Dow Jones reported that Russia and Saudi Arabia  in a joint statement after a meeting of the Group of 20 countries in China  oil ministers from the world s top two top crude producers said they would consult with other nations on the need to extend the output cut 
Saudi Arabia s energy minister Khalid al Falih said 

There has been a marked reduction to the inventories  but we re not where we want to be in reaching the five year average  We have  before coming to this announcement today  reached out to many of our colleagues within and outside OPEC  and I think there is consensus that this is the right approach and the right thing to do     The agreement needs to be extended  as we will not reach the desired inventory level by end of June  Therefore  we concluded that ending will probably be better by the end of first quarter 2018 

Russia s energy minister Alexander Novak said 

Preliminary consultations show that everybody is committed   I don t see reasons for any country to quit 

The extension of cuts is very bullish as the situation in Venezuela is getting darker  Dow Jones reports that   Bondholders looking for compensation if Venezuela defaults know that one big pot of money remains  the assets of state owned oil refiner Citgo Holdings Inc   but there is a problem  Dozens of companies are lining up with claims on those same funds  Venezuela last year pledged all of Citgo s equity as collateral to bondholders and to state owned Russian oil producer Rosneft in debt deals 
In addition  at least 43 companies  including ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  Co  and Canadian mining firm Crystallex International Corp   are pursuing legal claims against the government  according to World Bank s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes  These companies say they were stiffed when Venezuela s government expropriated their assets there Now with Wall Street judging that a default may only be a matter of time  it is becoming clear that there isn t nearly enough of Citgo to go around   There are more hands out than there are assets to pay them   said Russ Dallen  a partner at investment bank Caracas Capital Markets  based in the Venezuelan capital 
A default would trigger rights enabling any of the claimants to attempt to seize Citgo  triggering cross default clauses in Venezuelan sovereign bonds if they remain unpaid once a final court order is issued  according to Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   Attorneys say that would send creditors into a frenzied legal battle for assets that could take years to resolve  Stay tuned  This could drive Venezuelan oil output to a halt 
Iran s economy is also in a shamble  raising concerns about who is going to be the new President  The LA Times says that centrist leaning President Hassan Rouhani faces an uphill battle for a second term  A poll by the Iranian Students Polling Agency last week showed that while Rouhani remains in the lead with 41 6   two conservative opponents are catching up  Consequently  Rouhani has changed his campaign rhetoric this week by criticizing his rivals  including the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  The change in tone  some experts say  is reminiscent of his 2013 presidential campaign strategy  The outcome could shake up oil if a hardliner gets in power

Oil and Gas Stock Roundup  COP  WPZ  NS  SDRL  SLB 

	It was a week where oil prices tightened their grip over the  50 a barrel level  while natural gas futures fell from a 2 month high 

	On the news front  multinational oil companyConocoPhillips  NYSE          and energy infrastructure operator Williams Partners L P   NYSE          agreed to sell their respective assets in separate multibillion dollar deals  while another pipeline operator NuStar Energy L P   NYSE         became the latest firm to join the Permian rush with a  1 5 billion acquisition 

	Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures added 1 8  to close at  53 18 per barrel  natural gas prices fell 1  to  3 227 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

	Scoring its third consecutive weekly gain  oil rallied to its highest level since early March following increasing prospects of the OPEC led cartel extending its production cut agreement by six months 

	However  the continued growth in U S  production and a burgeoning rig count   both pointing to the ever increasing shale drilling activities   kept prices in check 

	Meanwhile  natural gas turned lower after a  Neutral  storage report and the onset of mild spring temperatures that will cut the fuel s requirement  The demand situation is expected to improve once warm weather sets in and gas fired electricity generation for air conditioning need picks up 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  One of the world s largest independent oil producer ConocoPhillips entered into a definitive agreement to divest its interest in the San Juan Basin to an affiliate of privately held Hilcorp Energy Co  for about  3 billion of total proceeds

189338,410854,COP,What s In Store For Phillips 66  PSX  This Earnings Season  ,opinion,Leading refining player Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   is expected to report first quarter 2017 earnings on Apr 28  before the market opens The company s earnings surprise history is disappointing  Phillips66  which was spun off from ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   on May 1  2012  missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the prior four quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 14 95   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement     Factors Likely to Influence EarningsPhillips 66 with 13 refineries  most of which are located in the U S  is among the largest refiners in the world with total processing capacity of 2 2 million barrels per day It is to be noted that the company s prospects are negatively correlated with oil prices  This is because refiners buy raw crude to produce refined products like gasoline  During the first quarter  the pricing scenario of crude was better than year earlier quarter  courtesy of the historical OPEC agreement  Though this was favorable for the Energy sector as a whole  refiners tend to be losers as improvement in crude price translates to higher input cost for these companies  This is likely to hurt the company s first quarter profitability Q1 Stock Price Performance Pricing chart for the first three months of this year reveals that Phillips 66 s shares outperformed the Zacks categorized industry  During the aforesaid period  the company s shares lost 8 3  as against 9 4  decrease for the broader industry Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Phillips 66 is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company stand at 3 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Phillips 66 carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP  an Earnings ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  Conversely  the Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Stocks to ConsiderThough an earnings beat looks uncertain for Phillips 66  here are some firms that you may want to consider on the basis of our model  These have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Chesapeake Energy Corp    NYSE CHK   has an Earnings ESP of  5 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release earnings on May 4  You can see  Cimarex Energy Co    NYSE XEC   has an Earnings ESP of  2 38  and a Zacks Rank  3  The firm is expected to release earnings on May 8 Looking for Ideas with Even Greater Upside Today s investment ideas are short term  directly based on our proven 1 to 3 month indicator  In addition  I invite you to consider our long term opportunities  These rare trades look to start fast with strong Zacks Ranks  but carry through with double and triple digit profit potential  Starting now  you can look inside our home run  value  and stocks under  10 portfolios  plus more ,2017-04-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what's-in-store-for-phillips-66-(psx)-this-earnings-season-200185386,200185386
189358,410874,COP,Precious Metals  A Ticking Time Bomb,opinion,"The Great Precious Metals Market Disconnect that took place four years ago is now a ticking TIME BOMB  While the Fed and Central Banks have been relatively successful in propping up the broader stock  bond and real estate markets  time is not on their side  The more the highly inflated markets continue higher  the more breath taking will be the inevitable collapse 
Now  I am not just pandering hype here  there is plenty of data to support the evidence that the precious metals suffered a serious disconnect from the broader markets in 2012 and continue to be held down like a coiled spring  One of my readers forwarded me this excellent chart  which shows this perfectly 

The chart is a Silver Gold ratio  RED LINE  compared to the S P 500 Index  BLACK LINE   Take note  this is not a Gold Silver ratio  but the opposite   As we can see  the Silver Gold ratio line has paralleled the S P 500 from 1997 to 2012  very closely  However  when the Fed announced QE3 at the end of 2012  something quite interesting took place  The Silver Gold ratio continued lower towards its bottom level  but the S P 500 Index surged upward to a new record high 
While many precious metals investors realize that this disconnect took place  this chart shows it with more precision  Furthermore  if we look on the right side of the chart we can see the percentage level of this disconnect is 65   This is off definitely off the charts  literally and figuratively  Again  I appreciate my reader for forwarding this chart 
After looking at this chart  I did some additional research on the S P 500 and the silver price  If we look at the S P 500 divided by the silver price since 1981  we have the following chart 

The current S P 500 Index Silver ratio is 130 1  Basically  130 ounces of silver would buy the S P 500 today  When silver reached nearly  50 in 2011  the S P 500 Silver ratio was 28 1  However  if we go back to 1981 or in 1983  we can see the S P 500 Silver ratio was 10 1 
If we applied the same 1981 S P 500 Silver ratio today  the price of silver would be  230  That being said  the value of the S P 500 is severally inflated  So  it is difficult to determine a realistic silver price based on a highly inflated stock index 
Regardless  the YELLOW ARROW in the chart shows that the S P500 Silver ratio should have continued lower  not higher towards the 130 1 ratio it is currently  Unfortunately  the precious metals were not allowed to be apart of this GREAT INFLATION because there just isn t enough physical metal to go around   if the public started buying hand over fist 
Market Volume Indicating Something Is Really Wrong With The Markets
Not only have the precious metals disconnected from the broader stocks markets  shown in the first chart above   if we look at the volume at the S P 500 and the silver price  we can spot another troubling sign 

After the S P 500 hit its low of 666 points in 2009  overall trading volume continued to decline  While I have mentioned this before in a previous article  I have looked at this trend in a different way  We must remember  a healthy stock or index rises along with its trading volume  This is precisely what took place with the S P 500 from 2000 2009  However  the opposite has taken place since 2008 9  when the U S  financial system suffered a severe heart attack 
Now  if we look at the Silver price chart  we see a much different picture 

As the silver price trended higher since 2000  so did its trading volume  While its trading volume spiked in 2011  along with the price  and the fell lower  its overall trend has been higher  Again  this is nothing new  but what I realized is this important factor 
While the S P 500 Index has been moving higher on a declining amount of trading volume  this has seriously INFLATED its true value  On the other hand  as the silver price has been moving lower or sideways as its trading volume has increased  its value has been severally DEFLATED 
Basically  the S P 500 Index is moving higher on lower and lower volume  thus INFLATING its value  Now compare that to the Silver price which is being DEFLATED by an increasing amount of paper trading contracts 
Yes  it is true that a Future s Market was designed to properly hedge producers and buyers of commodities  metals and energy  However  gold and silver do not behave like most commodities that are consumed  Gold and silver also perform as monetary assets or stores of value  By increasing the paper trading volume of gold or silver  it diminishes its role as a monetary or store of value asset 
Of course  this is being done on purpose  While the Fed and Central Banks continue to prop up the broader stock  bond and real estate markets with money printing  debt and derivatives  the ENERGY that they are relying upon to continue BUSINESS AS USUAL  is in serious trouble 
If you have not read my article  THE BLOOD BATH CONTINUES IN THE U S  MAJOR OIL INDUSTRY  it provides clear evidence that the big U S  oil companies  ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  are going into serious debt to pay for capital expenditures or pay shareholder dividends  This is not a business model that is sustainable in the long run  Something is going to give  and in a BIG WAY 
The Great Precious Metals Market disconnect is a ticking TIME BOMB  Even though it is impossible to forecast when the bomb will go off  logic suggests the S P 500 will head LOWER  while the price of silver  and gold  will head HIGHER ",2017-02-10,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-great-precious-metals-market-disconnect:-a-ticking-time-bomb-200175322,200175322
189359,410875,COP,Weekend Update,opinion,"VIX tested weekly intermediate term resistance at 12 64 a second time before closing at weekly short term support at 11 50  An aggressive buy signal may be forthcoming should the VIX rally above its intermediate term resistance  The breakout above long term resistance at 13 74 implies higher targets to come

 Exceptional Stability 
As Bloomberg notes  swings in U S  stocks have become unusually narrow as a rally  driven by Donald Trump s election as president  has persisted  The S P 500 Index s volatility over 65 trading days  or about three months  ended last week at the lowest since November 1995  The 65 day time frame was cited in a report Tuesday by David Rosenberg  chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff   Associates Inc 
SPX  throws over  the Broadening Top  week 3 

SPX continued its throw over above the upper trendline of its orthodox broadening top  making a new high  A reversal of a throw over may be a strong indication of a change in trend  A decline beneath the cycle top support and short term support  both near 2293 15  gives the SPX a sell signal  A break of those supports may send the SPX to its cycle bottom at 1895 09  or possibly lower 
 Bloomberg  It isn t over till it s over  Especially on Friday 
For the second time in two weeks  a final hour ramp in the S P 500 turned the index green for bulls  with the benchmark equity gauge jumping 6 points in a little over 30 minutes to close with a 0 1 percent advance and help preserve a fifth straight weekly gain  A similar spike salvaged gains seven days earlier 
Andrew Brenner  head of international fixed income for National Alliance Capital Markets  wrote in a note to clients 

The machines kicked in and brought all the averages positive at the close  We think markets move big time next week off the Trump speech Tuesday 

The NDX nearing Wave Completion 

NDX stalled on Wednesday in its extended throw over above the upper trendline of its orthodox broadening top  Wave 5 is slightly longer than the length of Wave 1  achieving Wave equality at 5333 19 and probable completion  A breakdown beneath the upper trendline of the Broadening Top at 5250 00 may imply a sell signal 
 Tumblr  The Nasdaq 100 has never had a run of strong closes like it is currently demonstrating 
If it seems like the stock market has had a good run of it lately  you re not imagining things  Stocks across the market cap spectrum have been on a remarkable run of both up days as well as new highs  Furthermore  if it seems like the market has been closing firmly on a consistent basis  you are not mistaken  In fact  in some respects  the recent run of strong closes is unprecedented 
High yield bond index challenges its cycle top resistance 

The high yield bond index is now challenging its cycle top resistance at 169 77  A break beneath the diagonal trendline and intermediate term support at 163 16 implies a complete retracement of the rally may occur  once the rally is over 
 SeekingAlpha  Corporate bond ETFs create what I like to call  phantom liquidity   What you see  or what you think you see  is not in fact what you get  This problem is especially acute in high yield ETFs like the iShares iBoxx   High Yield Corporate Bond  NYSE HYG  and the SPDR Barclays  LON BARC  High Yield Bond  NYSE JNK  
In the post crisis regulatory environment  dealers aren t willing to serve as middlemen  the cost of balance sheet is simply too high  What that means  in the simplest possible terms  is that in a pinch  no one is going to be willing to catch a falling knife or  in market parlance   inventory  these bonds

 AltMarket  As a part of the increasingly obvious set up of conservative movements by international banking interests and globalist think tanks  I have noticed an expanding disinformation campaign which appears to be designed to wash the Federal Reserve of culpability for the crash of 2008 that has continued to fester to this day despite the many claims of economic  recovery   I believe this program is meant to set the stage for a coming conflict between the Trump Administration and the Fed  but what would be the ultimate consequences of such an event 
In my article  The False Economic Recovery Narrative Will Die In 2017   I outlined the propaganda trap being established by globalist owned and operated media outlets like Bloomberg  in which they consistently claim that Donald Trump has  inherited  an economy in recovery and ascendancy from the Obama administration  I thoroughly debunked their positions and  evidence  by showing how each of their fundamental indicators has actually been in steady decline since 2008  even in the face of massive monetary intervention and fiat printing by the Fed

Wolfcamp has an estimated average of 20 billion barrels of oil  16 trillion cubic feet of associated natural gas  and 1 6 billion barrels of natural gas liquids there for the taking  To put this into perspective  according to USGS  the Prudhoe Bay formation on the North Slope of Alaska the largest producing oil field in North America to date has only produced roughly 12 billion barrels of oil in the past 43 years  And the East Texas Field  which is the biggest producing oil field in the lower 48 states  has produced just over 7 billion barrels of oil since the 1930s 
In other words  the magnitude of this oil discovery is incredible  And based on current oil prices  the newly found untapped oil is worth almost  900 billion 

Midland Basin Map  courtesy of USGS
 The fact that this is the largest assessment of continuous oil we have ever done just goes to show that  even in areas that have produced billions of barrels of oil  there is still the potential to find billions more   said Walter Guidroz  program coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program 
 Changes in technology and industry practices can have significant effects on what resources are technically recoverable  and that s why we continue to perform resource assessments throughout the United States and the world   Guidroz continues 
USGS notes that over 3 000 horizontal oil wells have already been drilled and finished in the Wolfcamp section of the Midland Basin  According to  Wolfcamp has been one of the primary targets for shale drillers like ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   and Diamondback Energy Inc    NASDAQ FANG   in recent years  as intensive drilling and fracturing techniques  or fracking  became more commonly used

189383,410899,COP,Ruts  Cuts And Gluts,opinion,"At the bottom of the energy cycle we know that low oil prices put companies in a rut  which lead to cuts in investment  which eventually reduced production  which then evaporated oil gluts  That process may accelerate with a little help from our friends in OPEC 
Oil prices are bouncing back as progress seems to being made in getting non OPEC nations to participate in OPEC production cuts  Both Russia and Oman have committed to their share of a cut and they are working with smaller producers to help them participate  if even a small way  Russia even has said that they would accept some natural decline rate from some participants as part of the cut and that should help make it easier for some countries to join a deal  It also puts pressure on other producers that don t want to look like they were the country that killed the OPEC deal that has raised the hopes of energy producers across the globe 
Prospects of an OPEC production cut is getting some oil companies and investors excited even as we know some oil companies are still in the Cap X reduction mode at a time when investors are starting to get bullish on energy  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  had again cut CapX on high cost projects in part to keep its dividend printing machine rolling  Yet that does not mean energy deals are not going to heat up  It is going to see some leaps and pull packs 
Today s Financial Times for example has a headline that says   Bond investors hand Opec a vote of confidence as relief looms for corporate borrowers as Opec supply cut boosts investors  mood   The FT says that   the worst may soon be over for corporate borrowers from the battered US energy industry  per S P Global  as a flurry of debt sales suggests investors are confident the Opec supply cut will help put a floor under the oil price  While defaults of energy groups will continue into 2017  analysts with the credit rating agency say they are likely to level out next year and that stresses on the energy sector will  eventually subside

Glencore  LON GLEN  also cut a major deal buying part of Russian Rosneft  MCX ROSN  in a deal backed by Vladimir Putin  Putin has also sent a message to Russian oil companies that they are all going to cut production like it or not  I wonder if he has the same type of sway with other non OPEC producers  Reuters says that some companies are turning to Chapter 11 creditor protection to shed debt and raise cash so they can spend and invest again  Add to that the hope that Donald Trump will allow producers to compete is fueling optimism and investment 
We continue to believe that the run in oil is not done  Despite skepticism about the OPEC deal  we believe it is as good as done  We should see the market rally to congratulate the announcement

But strategic supplies at the Cushing  OK storage experienced the biggest weekly build in years  On a further bearish note  the report revealed that refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   both increased handsomely from their previous week levels   
The negative data set  coupled with skepticism over OPEC s production cut deal  has meant that the oil market continues to remain volatile with a lot of uncertainties Sector Price Index
 

Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 2 39 million barrels for the week ending Nov 11  2016  following a decline of 884 000 barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 1 7 million barrels  An uptick in refinery activity led to the higher than expected stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer 
Following a run of drawdowns in recent months  the year over year storage surplus has narrowed down considerably  Nonetheless  U S  remains awash with excess oil  At 485 76 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 7  from the year ago period and are at upper limit of the average range for this time of year 
Worryingly  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   jumped 3 78 million barrels from previous week s level  The hefty increase  the biggest since 2009  took inventories at the oil hub to 65 29 million barrels 
The crude supply cover was down from 30 2 days in the previous week to 29 8 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 29 5 days 
Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were up for the fourth straight week on weakening demand  partly offset by falling imports and production  The 3 43 million barrels build  significantly above the analysts  polled number of 900 000 barrels increase in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 229 55 million barrels  Subsequent to last week s increase  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 5  higher than the year earlier level and is well above the upper half of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  went up by 2 50 million barrels last week  again dwarfing analysts  expectations for a 100 000 barrels rise  The fourth successive weekly increase in distillate fuel stocks could be attributed to lower demand  somewhat neutralized by a fall in imports and production  At 156 70 million barrels  distillate supplies are 5  higher than the year ago level and are sitting over the upper half of the average range for this time of the year 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 0 6  from the prior week to 90 4  
About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  Petroleum Status Report  containing data of the previous week ending Friday  outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U S   both locally and abroad 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of petroleum products  It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry 
The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers  such as ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   and ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP    and refiners such as Tesoro Corp    NYSE TSO    Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   and HollyFrontier Corp    NYSE HFC

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  RDS A  CVX and More

	It was a week where both oil and gas prices finished sharply lower 

	On the news front  European supermajor Royal Dutch Shell plc  NYSE      pledged to invest  10 billion in Brazil over a five year span  while U S  biggie Chevron Corp   NYSE      and partners commenced production at the Mafumeira Sul development offshore Angola 

	Overall  it was another dismal week for the sector  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures dived 5 4  to close at  43 41 per barrel  while natural gas prices ended down 5 3  to  2 619 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

	Oil prices sank to multi month lows after reports showed that output by members of the OPEC cartel   whose associate nations supply around 40  of the world s crude   rose to an all time high in Oct  At 33 64 million barrels a day  current production is way over OPEC s target to limit volumes to a range of 32 5 million   33 million barrels a day  Given the recent data sets  investors have started doubting whether OPEC will be able to rein in production as part of the plan reached in Sep 

	Adding to the pessimism was the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed a dramatic increase in domestic crude production 

	Meanwhile  natural gas also turned sharply lower following a larger than anticipated inventory build that pushed the commodity s storage level to a new all time high  The commodity was further hampered by a warmer than normal weather that translates into weak demand for the heating fuel 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	Following regulatory changes in Brazil  Shell seeks to expand its ultra deepwater oil exploration and production holdings in the country  Notably  the company already operates 5 500 energy stations in the nation and has acquired a large number of oil and gas assets via its takeover of BG Group this year   Read more     

	2  Chevron Corp   the second largest U S  oil producer  recently reported that it has started production at the Mafumeira Sul oil field along with Angolan state oil major   Sonangol  The initial production capacity of the field is 10 000 barrels per day

Oil prices moved south for the third time in 4 weeks after the Paris based International Energy Agency   IEA   projected a bleak demand outlook for the commodity  In its monthly report  the energy monitoring body that advises oil consuming countries  said that global crude demand will rise by 1 3 million barrels a day in 2016   down by about 100 000 barrels a day from its earlier projection  
The IEA also trimmed next year s forecast by 200 000 barrels per day to growth of 1 2 million barrels a day  With demand growth slowing amid the specter of record high inventories and rising supply  the agency warned that the world s oil surplus is set to persist at least until mid 2017 
Before IEA s weak demand predictions  crude was already falling on OPEC s worries about the oversupply crisis  On Monday  the international cartel of oil producers said that it expects production from non member countries   such as Russia   to increase in 2017  reversing prior expectations of a drop

	Chicago  IL   September 21  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include   Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC       Encana Corp      ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP       Eni SpA     and Patterson UTI Energy Inc     

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Oil   Gas Stock Roundup

	It was a week which saw oil prices settle at its lowest level since Aug 10  while natural gas futures rose to a 2  month high 

	On the news front  domestic upstream operator Anadarko Petroleum Corp      has agreed to buy deepwater Gulf of Mexico  GoM  properties from Freeport McMoRan Inc  for  2 billion  while Canada s Encana Corp      launched a  1 billion share offering to pay debt and boost drilling 

	Overall  it was a mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures plunged 6 2  to close at  43 03 per barrel  natural gas prices ended up 5 4  to  2 948 per million Btu  MMBtu    See the last  Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  here     

	Oil prices moved south for the third time in 4 weeks after the Paris based International Energy Agency   IEA   projected a bleak demand outlook for the commodity  In its monthly report  the energy monitoring body that advises oil consuming countries  said that global crude demand will rise by 1 3 million barrels a day in 2016   down by about 100 000 barrels a day from its earlier projection 

	The IEA also trimmed next year s forecast by 200 000 barrels per day to growth of 1 2 million barrels a day  With demand growth slowing amid the specter of record high inventories and rising supply  the agency warned that the world s oil surplus is set to persist at least until mid 2017 

	Before IEA s weak demand predictions  crude was already falling on OPEC s worries about the oversupply crisis  On Monday  the international cartel of oil producers said that it expects production from non member countries   such as Russia   to increase in 2017  reversing prior expectations of a drop 

	Finally  expectations regarding the resumption of shipments from Nigeria and Libya proved another headwind for oil prices 



	Meanwhile  natural gas eked out a handsome gain following an in line build and predictions of strong gas powered cooling demand with forecasts of warmer temperature throughout Sep 

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  Oil and gas finder Anadarko Petroleum Corp  has inked a deal to acquire mining giant Freeport McMoRan Inc  s deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets for a consideration of  2 billion in a bid to expand its operation in the region and gain additional scope for exploration  The transaction is anticipated to close by 2016 end 

	The acquisition will double Anadarko s ownership in the Lucius development to 49  from 23 8   thereby enabling the company to leverage future value addition at Lucius and achieve over 400 million barrels of oil equivalent  BOE  in estimated recovery from the development 

	The to be bought assets are expected to generate  3 billion free cash flow over the next five years  while adding nearly 80 000 BOE per day to Anadarko s production volume  80  crude    Read more     

	2  Canadian energy explorer Encana Corp  announced the pricing of its previously declared public share offering  The company has offered 107 million of its common shares at US 9 35 per share  Encana   which currently carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    expects to generate gross proceeds of more than US 1 billion from the offering  You can see   

	Encana is expected to utilize nearly half of the net proceeds to lower its long term debt and strengthen its balance sheet  The remainder will be utilized by the company to fund a portion of its 2017 capital budget 

	The capital budget of 2017 is mainly focused on boosting oil and petroleum liquids production from Encana s Permian Basin   where the company is a top tier operator   by increasing the number of rigs  This  in turn  is expected to double the number of wells on stream in the Permian in 2017 from that in 2016 

	3  Leading Houston based oil and gas finder ConocoPhillips     is on track to divest its entire 40  stake in an oil and gas production sharing block that it operates on the South Natuna Sea Block B off Indonesia  The assets will be purchased by Indonesia s PT Medco Energi Tbk 

	ConocoPhillips has been contemplating the sale of its interest in Block B   which produces about 300 million standard cubic feet of gas and 30 000 barrels of oil  a day   and related facilities in the Natuna since Aug 2015  Neither of the companies disclosed any details relating to the transaction 

	This acquisition is being viewed by many as an attempt by Indonesian officials to strengthen defenses of the nation s maritime borders by ramping up of energy projects as well as boosting resource nationalism 

	The block is located in an energy rich chain at the edge of the South China Sea in the Natuna Islands  Notably  Indonesia has faced increasingly aggressive maritime moves by China in this region 

	4  Italy s Eni SpA    has signed a deal with the government of Montenegro to explore four offshore blocks in the country for a period of 30 years  The blocks cover 1 228 square kilometers and the company received the exploration license following the First International Competitive Bid Round 

	Per the concession contract  Eni will be the operator of blocks 4118 4  4118 5  4118 9 and 4118 10 with a 50  interest  The remaining stake will be held by OAO NOVATEK   Russia s leading gas player 

	Eni management added that this contract reflects its aim to significantly strengthen the company s upstream portfolio  Eni has been present in the region as a leading exploration and production player since early  60   Read more     

	5  Onshore contract driller Patterson UTI Energy Inc      recently declared that it has signed a deal to acquire Calgary  Alberta based drilling technology company  Warrior Rig Ltd   and certain related entities  The transaction amount has not been disclosed as yet

189434,410950,COP,ConocoPhillips Inks MoU In Alaska To Boost North Slope LNG,opinion,"ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   recently inked a memorandum of understanding with the State of Alaska to form a joint venture  JV  to buy and sell liquefied natural gas from North Slope to global markets Per Alaska s Gasline Development Corp    AGDC    the JV s focus would also be on marketing North Slope gas and gaining support of other major North Slope producers in the formation  To this end  ConocoPhillips and the State of Alaska are trying to rope in two other major North Slope gas owners   ExxonMobil Corporation   NYSE XOM   and BP plc   NYSE BP     into the JV The Governor of Alaska has long been supporting the need for marketing and lining up of buyers for the North Slope gas to better project the natural gas prospect in Alaska and discuss the project the state has studied in recent years with the three energy behemoths ConocoPhillips has played an important role in building the Alaska s reserves  The company boasts the longest contract in LNG history as it has been shipping LNG from Nikiski to Japan markets for over four decades  The JV will further help to develop the state s LNG resources for the global market The statement issued by AGDC  if the JV is formed  it will likely include activities like seeking federal tax exemption for a state led project  looking for low cost financing and investor options for a project that has so far been financed by the state and the producers  finding an engineering company interested in contributing and assuming a big part of the construction risk  obtaining a gas supply contract from oil producers who have said they will sell their gas to the state at reasonable terms  and reviewing prospects for sales in the global LNG marketplace CONOCOPHILLIPS Price
    For years  massive amounts of North Slope gas have been yielded and re inserted underground to pressurize reservoirs and boost oil production  However  the state and partners perceive a new role for that gas  going ahead  However  the isolated location would calls for the construction of an 800 mile gas line Per a recent study  the Alaska LNG project was found to be uncompetitive on a global scale  This stimulated the state s struggle to look for a tax exemption and lower costs in other ways The objective of the MoU finalized between the state and ConocoPhillips is somewhat increasing market awareness about North Slope gas The agreement  which was signed by AGDC  would not provide a copy A revised appraisal that was concluded this summer estimates the construction cost at  45 billion  Exports of about 20 million tons per year have been sanctioned by the U S  Department of Energy ConocoPhillips currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Another better ranked players from the energy sector is EQT Midstream Partners  LP   NYSE EQM    It sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  In the last reported quarter  EQT Midstream delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6 72   Coming to the earnings surprise history  EQT Midstream beat estimates in three of the last four quarters Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-09-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/conocophillips-inks-mou-in-alaska-to-boost-north-slope-lng-200155516,200155516
189435,410951,COP,OPEC Surprises With Production Cut  Energy ETFs Soar,opinion,The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  unexpectedly agreed to cap its oil production for the first time in eight years at a meeting in Algiers  infusing optimism into the energy sector  This is especially true as oil price jumped almost 6  immediately after the news  This would be the first historic deal between the OPEC and non OPEC producers in over a decade  read    Proposed DealThe 14 member cartel proposed to cut oil output by about a million barrels per day to 32 5 33 million barrels per day from the current 33 2 million barrels per day  Saudi Arabia  the largest oil producer  will likely curtail its production by 350 000 barrel a day while the full details of output cut by each country will be finalized in the next meeting on November 30  in Vienna Investors should note that Iran  Libya and Nigeria will not be part of the agreement and will continue to increase their production by as much as 1 5 million barrels a day collectively As per the International Energy Agency  IEA   the production cut of 200 000 to 33 million barrels per day will have a limited impact on global supply and markets are unlikely to rebalance until the second half of 2017  But if OPEC cuts 700 000 barrels per day of oil  then it would take care of the global supply glut issue as soon as the end of this year The move would be a huge boon to the energy sector  as it will end the two year crude oil rout and stabilize the oil market  It will revitalize growth in the battered energy sector and lift the economies of the oil rich countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia  read    Global Oil Stocks SurgeThe news sent the global energy space into deep green yesterday with small cap stocks like Denbury Resources  NYSE DNR  and SeaDrill Limited  SDRL  leading the way  surging 21 3  and 19 7   respectively  U S  oil heavyweights   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and

189436,410952,COP,Phillips 66 s Dividend Payment Impresses Amid Macro Risks,opinion,"On Sep 28  2016  we issued an updated research report on Texas based Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   Phillips 66 has a remarkable  geographically diversified refinery base  The company s 14 refineries enable it to participate in various market opportunities and provide an advantage over region specific competitors  Further  most of Phillips 66 s refineries are integrated with transportation  marketing and commercial operations that provide crude supply flexibility  These refineries benefit from strong margins because of low feedstock costs courtesy of higher proportion of onshore crude sources  which offers a distinct cost advantage over seaborne crudes  Phillips 66 also owns or has interests in three refineries in Europe and one in Asia Banking on the aforesaid positives  the company has been able to pay attractive dividends since its spin off from ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  on May 2012  We expect the company to continue increasing dividend payouts in the long run Phillips 66 remains focused on improving its supply chain network  For this purpose  the company has invested heavily on transportation and logistics assets  As a result  the company is capable of procuring crude from sources round the globe Phillips 66 is expected to direct the majority of its capital expenditure toward Chemicals and Midstream businesses rather than the larger refining and marketing segment  These midstream and chemicals segments are believed to be higher margin and possess stronger growth prospects  The investment for midstream projects will mostly be in the central U S   where the need for pipeline and other infrastructure is much higher in newer production areas  Investments for Chemicals are likely to be made mostly in the U S   to gain from low natural gas prices and rising petrochemical demand PHILLIPS 66 Price and Consensus
    However  Phillips 66 s performance is dependant upon sourcing crude oil from suppliers worldwide  A steady supply is mandatory for the company to maintain its production volume  Any geo political disturbance round the globe can render its refineries idle and hamper the top line  As such  the profitability of the company depends upon the spread among the margins of refined product prices and crude oil feedstock prices  However  the spread is dependant upon a host of macro factors outside the domain of the company s control Further  Phillips 66 s chemicals business operates in a highly volatile industry where sales prices are always fluctuating  The company s profitability in such a sector is not always guaranteedMoreover  low oil prices have resulted in declining production as a result of spending cuts by most of the oil majors  This in turn could slow midstream investments and growth outlook and adversely affect Phillips 66 operations Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPhillips 66 currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked players from the energy sector include Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB    NGL Energy Partners LP   NYSE NGL   and Evolution Petroleum Corp    NYSE EPM    All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Enbridge posted a positive earnings surprise of 19 57  in the preceding quarter NGL Energy Partners has a mixed earnings surprise history  The partnership posted positive earnings surprise in two of the last four quarters  It reported a positive earnings surprise of 1480 0  in the preceding quarter In the last reported quarter  Evolution Petroleum Corp  delivered a positive earnings surprise of 350 00   Coming to the earnings surprise history  the company beat estimates in two of the last four quarters Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Industry Outlook  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-09-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/phillips-66's-dividend-payment-impresses-amid-macro-risks-200156273,200156273
189438,410954,COP,Oil Jumps On Another Big Inventory Draw  OPEC Action,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles declined for the fourth straight week  continuing to drag down the overall surplus 
The bullish sentiment on the back of drawdown in U S  crude stocks was further supported by the OPEC oil cartel s surprise decision to curb production for the first time since 2008 
As a result  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures surged 5 3   or  2 38  to settle at  47 05 per barrel Wednesday   the highest in about 3 weeks 
This also prompted investors to increase their exposure to oil and related support plays  Market heavyweights like Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX    Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Apache Corp    NYSE APA    Occidental Petroleum Corp    NYSE OXY   and ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   all experienced gains in yesterday s trading

Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1 88 million barrels for the week ending Sep 23  2016  following a decline of 6 2 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go up some 3 2 million barrels  A big drop in imports led to the surprise stockpile draw with the world s biggest oil consumer 
Following the fourth straight inventory reduction  the year over year storage surplus has narrowed down considerably  However  U S  still remains awash with excess oil  At 502 72 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 10  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year 
In particular  crude inventories at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   was down 631 000 barrels from previous week s level to 62 08 million barrels 
The crude supply cover   at 30 2 days   remained unchanged from the previous week  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 28 3 days Oils Energy Sector Price Index
 

Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were up for the second time in 3 weeks as imports rose and demand weakened  The 2 03 million barrels build   compared to analysts  expectations for unchanged supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 227 18 million barrels  Following last week s increase  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 2  higher than the year earlier level and is above the upper half of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  went down by 1 92 million barrels last week  higher than the analysts  polled number for a 700 000 barrels drop in inventory level  The decrease in distillate fuel stocks   for the first time in 7 weeks   could be attributed to a fall in production  assisted by higher demand  At 163 08 million barrels  distillate supplies are 8  higher than the year ago level and are over the upper half of the average range for this time of the year 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was down by 1 9  from the prior week to 90 1  
About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  Petroleum Status Report  containing data of the previous week ending Friday  outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U S   both locally and abroad 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of petroleum products  It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry

189462,410978,COP,Bearish Supply News In Focus For Crude,opinion,"October crude oil continued to consolidate on Monday  August 29  2016  resulting in a narrow range candle as traders couldn t push price in either direction  Without bullish headlines driving algorithm trading  bearish supply news came into focus 
OPEC continues to increase production capacity as The United Arab Emirates announced it is going to increase oil production to 3 5 million bpd by 2018 and Iran continues to increase its oil production 
Iran continues to play both sides as they want stable prices  but want to regain their lost market share from the sanctions imposed by the US 
It is unlikely an agreement will be reached in Algeria at the end of September for a production freeze  Plus  the ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  CEO says he believes the glut will persist into 2017 
The bearish news wasn t able to take crude oil below the August 25th lows at 46 42 as the 13 DMA  46 82  held price in check  The 13 DMA rises to 47 10 for Tuesday s trade and a rally above here could see price test resistance at 48 46  the August 26 high  
Trendline resistance drops to 49 03  Trading below the 13 DMA could see futures trade down to test support at 46 42 and then support at the 100 DMA  45 93  and the 50 DMA is at 45 51  Trendline support is at 45 27

189465,410981,COP,Here s Why Oil s Price Hike Won t Last,opinion,"Weeks before the highly awaited OPEC meeting in September  oil prices ticked higher unexpectedly  The prices of oil were initially thought of declining further due to oversupply concerns and as the Fed heightened the possibility of a rate hike very soon 
On Monday  Brent crude lost 1 42 percent  while U S  crude dropped 1 34 percent  During the session earlier  U S  West Texas Intermediate crude and Brent crude futures rallied 17 cents and 12 cents respectively 
The recovery of oil came as a surprise as the Saudi Arabia and Iraq remained aloof with any intervention with the glut concerns  Previously  Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Kahlaid Al Falih made it clear that intervention was not needed and declared that the market is moving in the right direction  On the other hand  Iran also amplified its production alongside with the intention of Iran to regain its market share 
OPEC Meeting
Most of the market participants have been pessimistic in the outcome of the OPEC meeting  Partly due to the fact that the organization has made numerous attempts to address the glut issue but until now the situation persists  Adding to this  most of the major oil kingpins do not agree with the out freeze suggested by the OPEC 
Other oil producers under the wing of the OPEC want a long time recovery of the commodity and to reach the  50 per barrel  Productions in Nigeria  for instance  faced a great challenged as the violence and chaos in Niger Delta affected the production area  Also  Venezuela hardly awaits for a huge bounce back of the price as it deals with economic brawl 
Oil prices moved higher at the start of the month after the production cut came into the perspective of the investors again  However  the credibility of the organization was fairly questioned  which sent the oil in the red line  Moreover  the commodity dealt with the soaring U S  dollar after the Fed declared hawkish view regarding the adjustment of the policy rate in September 
Volatility Until 2017
Recently  senior officials at Shell  NYSE RDSa  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  concluded that oversupply would probably be extended until 2017  Martin Bachmann  head of exploration and production in Europe and the Middle East at Wintershall AG  said  Basically  volatility is the word  There will be a rebalancing  Over what timeframe is the big question  
Norway s Petroleum and Energy Minister Tord Lien had a different view  He said that the rebalancing in the oil market is already happening and part of the supplier industry will continue to have demanding months ahead 
Based on the estimates made by the U S  Energy Information Administration  the global oil demand may surge from 94 8 million barrels per day this year and could end up to 105 3 million barrels after a decade 
A prominent energy analyst also shared the any immediate change in the supply and demand may improve if the peace holds between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces  The recent turmoil can affect the output figures of Columbia in the years ahead 
Bottom Line
Evidently  the problem among the OPEC members is a unified decision  As OPEC fails to make a firm decision  the oil market would not be stable  Major oil producers would just continue on pumping oil and glut concerns can linger until next year 
Meanwhile  market players still watch closely the rate hike  which could send the greenback higher  Traditionally  stronger dollar makes oil purchases expensive for buyers using other currencies which could affect the demand for the c commodity 
In the meantime  oil would be on a tight range and major price movement is set to happen in September in light of the OPEC and Fed meeting ",2016-08-30,TradingBanks,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here’s-why-oil's-price-hike-won’t-last-200150784,200150784

Slowdown in Oil Finds Raises Alarm Over Supply Gap Ahead

The Oil and Gas sector continues to remain in troubled waters with a new report mentioning that in 2015 explorers had managed to discover only about 10  of the average level of oil found annually since 1960 and the level is expected to decline even further  This has raised apprehensions that the amount of oil discovered might be too less to meet future demand 

Oil prices have more than halved since the commodity prices started tumbling two years ago  As a result  drillers have cut their exploration budgets enormously  which in turn  has resulted in discovery of just 2 7 billion barrels of new supply  Per the figures from Edinburgh based consulting firm Wood Mackenzie Ltd   this is the lowest level since 1947  As of the end of last month  drillers found just 736 million barrels of conventional crude 
	Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  global oil demand is expected to grow to 105 3 million barrels in 2026 from 94 8 million barrels a day in 2016  However  the slowdown in the discoveries has raised questions regarding the ability to meet this increasing demand  Though the U S  shale boom has the potential to make up for the difference  prices locked below  50 a barrel undermine the possibility of growth in the area 
	Wood Mackenzie reported that global spending on exploration   seismic studies to actual drilling   has been lowered to  40 billion in 2016 from about  100 billion in 2014  The spending level is expected to remain flat through 2018  Moreover  through August this year only 209 wells were drilled as against 680 in 2015 and 1 167 in 2014  This compares unfavorably with an annual average of 1 500 in data from 1960 
	The low exploration data indicates that production might be obstructed few years down the line  which in turn  would push up the oil prices  Currently  oil prices are hovering around  50 a barrel that is less than half their 2014 peak  In a Saudi Arabia led strategy to augment market share  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  decided to continue pumping without limits  This pushed down the U S  production to a two year low 
	According to the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell plc     oil companies will need to invest about  1 trillion a year to continue to meet demand  The CEO expects demands to rise by 1 million to 1 5 million barrels a day  with about 5  of supply lost to natural declines every year 
	The persistent weakness in prices has forced explorers to find new resources that are less risky as well as cheap  As a result  these companies are focusing more on appraisal wells on already discovered fields and less on frontier areas such as the Arctic  Companies that have abandoned exploration in Alaska last year include Statoil ASA    and Royal Dutch Shell 
	ExxonMobil Corporation  XOM  has also decided against investing further in the proposed Alaska LNG facility  The other stake owners in the project are BP plc    and ConocoPhillips     holding 20  each  These companies too have indicated their possibility of withdrawing from the project

Oil Falls on Surprise Stock Build  Record Saudi Output

	The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise build  Worryingly  supplies at the Cushing  OK storage hub jumped  too  On a bullish note  the report revealed that refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   both decreased from their previous week levels 

	While the unseasonal crude build report offset the big drop in fuel supplies  data showing record July production from Saudi Arabia weighed on markets  As a result  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures lost 2 5   or  1 06  to settle at  41 71 per barrel Wednesday 

Analysis of the EIA Data

Crude Oil    The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories increased by 1 06 million barrels for the week ending Aug 5  2016  following a rise of 1 41 million barrels in the previous week 

	The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 1 75 million barrels  Lower refinery usage led to the surprise stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer even as imports and production fell 

	In particular  crude inventories at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   was up 1 16 million barrels from previous week s level to 65 26 million barrels 

	Following the third straight week of inventory rise  at 523 60 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 15  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year 

	The crude supply cover   at 31 3 days   remained unchanged from the previous week  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 26 8 days 



Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were down for the second time in two weeks as demand strengthened  The 2 81 million barrels draw   comfortably exceeding the analysts  polled number of 1 6 million barrels decrease in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles down to 235 38 million barrels  Despite last week s decline  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 9  higher than the year earlier level and is comfortably above the upper half of the average range 

Distillate    Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  fell by 1 96 million barrels last week  as opposed to analysts  expectations for an 400 000 barrels rise in inventory level  The decrease in distillate fuel stocks   for the third time in four weeks   could be attributed to lower production and strengthening demand  But at 151 20 million barrels  distillate supplies are still 2  higher than the year ago level and are near the upper half of the average range for this time of the year 

Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was down by 1 1  from the prior week to 92 2  

About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report

	The Energy Information Administration  EIA  Petroleum Status Report  containing data of the previous week endingFriday  outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U S   both locally and abroad 

	The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of petroleum products  It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry 

	The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers  such as Exxon Mobil Corp      Chevron Corp     and ConocoPhillips    and refiners such as Phillips 66    and HollyFrontier Corp

189501,411017,COP,Optimism In ConocoPhillips Despite Poor Earnings Report,opinion,"Multinational oil company ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP     once again posted a higher than expected quarterly loss for Quarter 2  They have been forced to cut down their budget yet again from  5 7 billion to  5 5 billion  Earnings misses and the ongoing oil slump resulted in the stock s poor performance in 2016  falling 13 9  year to date  However  ConocoPhillips remains an optimistic company that should be kept on the radar 
Earnings and Financial Position
ConocoPhillips reported a second quarter 2016 adjusted loss of  0 79 per share  steeping lower than Zacks Consensus Estimate of   0 62  Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 16  and dropped  8 67 billion in comparison to 2015 Quarter 2  The company put up a 2016 second half net loss of  2 5 billion  freefalling down from the  93 million in earnings made in the same period a year ago 
A positive indicator in the company s current financial position is their achievement in reducing debt levels by  800 million  The oil giant has also generated  200 million in asset sales  remaining on track for the planned  1 billion in asset sales proceeds for the year 
The company has cut its dividend down to  0 25 from  0 74 to further aid their financial position in successfully escaping the current oil climate 
Increasing Efficiencies in Operations 
ConocoPhillips is in the midst of selling off its costly offshore exploration projects in favor of more efficient domestic operations  Drilling is taking place primarily in Texas through the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford  with lower costs and higher production being the catalyst behind this focus  While the oil giant plans to greatly reduce capital expenditure in the region  production is expected to persist on the same level  Management expects a margin growth of 3 5  
The firm is setting forth an exit strategy to abandon its massive deepwater exploration projects for more cost efficient North American unconventional projects  It will still allow them significant access to inventory while greatly slashing costs of operations  Most recently  ConocoPhillips successfully exited their Senegalese offshore exploration project in a  350 million interest sale to Woodside Petroleum     The company will also exit their joint Nova Scotia offshore drilling venture with Suncor Energy    and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa      By 2017  ConocoPhillips will free  800 million which will allow better access to cash and flexibility with the aforementioned North American drilling operations 
Safe Haven for Oil Bulls 
The company s stock performance highly correlates with crude oil pricing  There is minimal risk outside of the commodity s pricing that will have damaging effects on the stock price  Following crude oil s bottom out in February  ConocoPhillips made a fantastic recovery with oil  as the stock shot up 28  to date since then 
The U S  rig count is recovering rapidly as well  jumping from 11 to 341 rigs now online  This is a strong indication of where oil is headed  as major oil producers believe the bottom has already passed and now is the time to restart drilling activity  The general consensus of analysts suggests oil must rise above its current  40 range  As long as oil prices steadily increase  we are likely to see an extended rally in the stock price 
Hess Corporation  NYSE HES     is another major oil player with a stock price strongly correlating with oil prices  riding the February oil rebound to a 47  increase in share price to date  The company is ranked as a  Buy  by Zacks com ",2016-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimism-in-conocophillips-despite-poor-earnings-report-200146211,200146211
189502,411018,COP,Is Ford s Dividend At Risk  You Might Be Surprised,opinion,"With a high dividend yield sitting near 5   Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  has caught the attention of many income investors living on dividends 
However  as most of us know  high yields often serve as a warning sign about a company s health and dividend safety 
The best investment advice is to approach high yield stocks with caution 
Ford s case is a little curious because the company just set an all time quarterly record in its automotive segment with pre tax profit of  2 8 billion   more than four times the amount of regular dividends paid   600 million  
With results like those  what could investors be worried about 
Automotive sales are highly cyclical  and the major auto manufacturers have been absolutely shellacked in past downturns  which are usually sudden and violent in nature 
With U S  vehicle sales sitting near their prior historical peaks  there is no shortage of anxiety in the market that another downturn could be right around the corner 
While Ford paid out its first dividend way back in 1956  the company s track record doesn t come close to the consistent income growth delivered by Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings 
In fact  since 1980  the company has cut its dividend four times  The chart below depicts the seasonally adjusted annual rate  SAAR  of U S  auto sales  green line  and Ford s total dividends paid  blue bars  from 1976 through the first half of 2016 
The red circles denote periods when Ford reduced its dividend and are wrapped around the trend observed in U S  vehicle sales during those times 
Source    Simply Safe Dividends
Three of Ford s four dividend cuts were approximately 10 years apart from each other 
With the company s last dividend cut occurring in 2006  investors are wondering if history could repeat itself 
However  while the business is nowhere close to being considered a blue chip dividend stock  the 2016 Ford is a much different company than it was in past decades 
Let s take a closer look at why the company cut its dividend several times in the past 40 years and whether or not another dividend cut could be on the horizon 
1980 Dividend CutFord s first dividend reduction during the period I analyzed took place in 1980  According to the Washington Post  U S  automakers  production was down more than 30  compared to the prior year 
Lower production volume meant that Ford s large fixed cost base from its manufacturing plants was spread across fewer vehicles  crimping profitability 
Ford posted a record loss of  164 million in the first quarter of 1980 and was on track to lose more than  1 billion for the full year 
General Motors  NYSE GM   the largest company in the industry  was the only auto manufacturer that managed to turn a profit 
All of Ford s losses were attributable to its North American operations  which more than offset profits from non auto and foreign subsidiaries 
Ford made its biggest dividend cut in its history  at the time   reducing its payout by 70  in 1980 before completely eliminating the dividend in 1982 
With a loss per share of  12 83   9 40  and 75 cents in 1980  1981  and 1982  respectively  Ford had little choice but to cut the dividend  which amounted to approximately 16 cents per share in 1979 
Ford s initial 70  reduction in the dividend saved the company nearly  340 million per year 
Ford began paying dividends again in 1983  but it wasn t until 1986 that its quarterly payout exceeded the dividend amount it was doling out in 1979  That is far too long for income investors to wait 
To conclude  Ford s 1980 dividend cut was caused by weak industry conditions and unproductive manufacturing facilities  particularly in North America 
While there s not much Ford can do about the cyclical nature of automotive sales  it clearly has room to improve the cost effectiveness of its production facilities 
1991 Dividend CutFord s next dividend cut took place in early 1991 
After sinking to an annual pace of 9 10 million vehicle sales per year in the early 1980s  U S  vehicle sales rallied sharply to more than 15 million annual units by the end of the decade 
However  U S  vehicle sales fell nearly 30  from an annual pace of 16 million in January 1990 to less than 12 million just one year later  The U S  economy had fallen into a recession  reducing demand for vehicles  and the Persian Gulf War also created challenges 
In response to difficult market conditions  management lowered the company s quarterly payout by 53   dropping it from 75 cents per share to 40 cents 
Ford was also involved in a  3 billion cost reduction plan at the time  Reducing the dividend saved more than  650 million per year 
Interestingly enough  Ford had previously stated that it did not want to lower its dividend if profits fell during the next normal cyclical downturn  The company had even resisted pressure to significantly boost its dividend during the boom times of the 1980s 
What was management s excuse when the dividend was ultimately cut  Here s what Ford s chairman Harold Poling  

 The situation we face today is much more than a normal trough in the business cycle and in automotive earnings  The automotive industry is in the midst of one of the toughest and most challenging periods it has ever confronted  

Indeed  Ford reported a loss in excess of  600 million during the first quarter of 1991 compared to a profit of more than  500 million during the same period just one year earlier 
General Motors  Ford  and Chrysler  NYSE FCAM  lost a combined  3 billion during the first quarter of 1991   the worst period ever for the automotive industry at the time  cyclical  capital intensive businesses can be lethal  
Ford wasn t the only company to cut its dividend during this time  Many companies enjoyed a strong gain in profits  and corporate largesse  during the 1980s and somewhat lackadaisically paid out generous dividends to keep shareholders satisfied 
According to the Commerce Department  American corporations had nearly doubled their payout ratio from 23  in 1980 to 44  in 1990  Debt was used to finance much of the dividend growth during this period marked by strong business conditions 
Of course  nothing lasts forever  Once the U S  economy entered a recession  many dividends proved to be vulnerable as companies were burdened with interest payments and increasingly squeezed for cash 
It wasn t until 1997 that Ford s dividend surpassed its prior peak reached in 1990  Once again  income investors were left hanging 
2002 Dividend CutAfter bottoming out in the early 1990s  Ford s dividend more than tripled over the next decade 
The company s next dividend cut was announced in early 2002 when management cut Ford s quarterly dividend from 10 cents per share to 5 cents  representing a decline of 50  
The U S  economy had entered a recession in recent years  but U S  vehicle sales remained surprisingly resilient   above a 15 million annual rate throughout the entire period 
Prior to announcing its dividend reduction  Ford had more than  16 billion in cash  and analysts didn t believe the company needed to slash its dividend 
Even Ford s CFO said he didn t see any reason to suggest Ford cut its dividend during the summer of 2001 
Why then did Ford cut its dividend 
The company was experiencing intense competition from low cost foreign competition  incurring heavy marketing costs  dealer incentives were out of control   and facing heavy expenses related to quality issues  e g  ignition lawsuit  Firestone tire recall  issuing longer product warranties  
Ford was handicapped in many ways that would severely hurt the business heading into the financial crisis as it continued hemorrhaging market share to lower cost foreign competitors 
For example  according to the Wall Street Journal  Ford s labor contract with the United Auto Workers union did not allow Ford to close any plants unless the company could prove it was in an economic crisis 
It s no wonder why Ford s market share continued to slip and earnings were eroding despite reasonably strong U S  vehicle sales 
Ford reported a multi billion dollar pretax loss in its automotive segment in 2001 and lost several hundred million dollars in 2002  The company s S P credit rating was also lowered from A in 2000 to BBB  in 2001 and BBB  in 2003 
While Ford wasn t necessarily in a dangerous financial situation or facing another deep trough in vehicle sales  the dividend cut provided the company with some breathing room as it began to more seriously clean up its act 
The dividend reduction saved over  1 billion per year  helping Ford handle its debt load and improve productivity in an effort to stabilize its market position and bring its auto business back to breakeven 
The company kicked off a large number of restructuring actions intended to generate  9 billion in annual cost savings by the mid 2000s   just in time for the company s next dividend cut 
2006 Dividend CutAfter initialing slicing its dividend in half  Ford announced it was suspending its dividend altogether in late 2006  The company would not begin making dividend payments again until 2012 
At the time of the dividend cut  the auto market had not yet severely corrected  it began to fall in earnest in early 2008  
However  Ford s auto segment had lost money for six consecutive years  including a loss in excess of  1 5 billion in 2005  compared to dividends paid of approximately  730 million  
Ford faced headwinds from high gas prices  which resulted in consumers buying fewer SUVs and trucks in favor of smaller cars and crossover vehicles 
The company also added two extra years to the powertrain warranty of its cars and trucks and took other steps to try and improve the resale value of its vehicles  These moves would further erode the company s earnings 
By the end of 2006  Ford s S P credit rating had fallen to a B with a negative outlook  Ford was in clear need of a major turnaround effort if it wanted to survive for the long term 
The company s U S  market share had declined from close to 26  in the early 1990s to less than 19  in 2005  The outlook for the company was dire 
Cutting the dividend was part of Ford s massive restructuring plan  which included reducing its North American workforce by nearly 30  and shuttering over 25  of its production capacity 
These actions have put the company on a more encouraging trajectory today  but that doesn t mean Ford is out of the woods just yet 
Ford s Dividend Safety TodayFord has clearly experienced a number of rough patches over its lifetime 
While some of its challenges were caused by the cyclical nature of the auto cycle  a lot of its issues were the result of many poor operational and financial decisions made by management 
These strategic oversights compounded over the course of several decades  gradually eroding Ford s market share and creating an existential threat to the entire company 
Today  Ford is arguably in a structurally healthier and more flexible position that enhances the safety of its dividend payment 
The company ended 2015 with only 67 manufacturing plants  which is down significantly from the 113 plants run by Ford in 2005 
Ford also has 199 000 employees today compared to 300 000 employees in 2005  Many of its union labor contracts have been modified as well to provide Ford with additional flexibility to manage through the next downturn 
The company also sold or exited all but two of its brands  Ford and Lincoln  to better focus the firm on its strongest opportunities 
From 2013 through 2015  Ford s automotive segment generated cumulative pre tax income of  22 7 billion  excluding special items  compared to total dividend payments of  5 9 billion  Its automotive operating margin of 6 8  was the highest since at least the 1990s 
An argument can certainly be made that Ford s automotive business is stronger than ever thanks to healthy industry conditions and legitimate operational improvements made by management 
From a growth perspective  Ford s global market share is showing signs of stability as well  The company s share edged up from 7 1  in 2014 to 7 3  in 2015 and has now gained 40 basis points over the last three years 
Ford has also been launching more than 10 new products around the world each year to keep its vehicle lineup fresh and competitive 
Low gasoline prices have certainly helped as well since they make big ticket vehicles like trucks and SUVs more appealing 
What does this all mean for Ford s dividend 
My objective is to never own a company that reduces its dividend payment 
The three dividend portfolios in our newsletter have been successful so far  These portfolios have collectively enjoyed over 60 dividend increases and avoided any dividend cuts since they were started 
Companies usually give off a number of warning signs before they actually cut their dividends 
The companies most likely to cut their dividends usually have some combination of high payout ratios  weak free cash flow generation  declining sales and earnings  weak balance sheets  and no proven commitment to paying and growing dividends over time 
Tracking these key metrics is time consuming  which is why I created a Dividend Safety Score to help me keep tabs on all of these factors for companies I am interested in 
Our Dividend Safety Score analyzes 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to answer the question   Is the current dividend payment safe  
We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and free cash flow payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  profitability trends  and more  Ford s most important dividend and fundamental data can be seen by  
A Dividend Safety Score of 50 is average  75 or higher is considered excellent  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Most companies that end up cutting their dividends score below 25 prior to announcing their dividend reduction 
Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI   Potash  BHP Billiton  LON BLT   and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  all scored below 20 for Dividend Safety before announcing their dividend cuts 
Ford s Dividend Safety Score of 39 suggests that the company s dividend payment is safe for now but somewhat riskier than the average dividend stock 
As I previously noted  Ford is generating tons of cash in today s favorable environment 
The company s dividend has consumed just 34  of Ford s free cash flow over the last 12 months  and Ford maintains over  39 billion in cash on hand compared to total dividend payments of  2 4 billion last year 
While the company s U S  sales slipped 3  and came in below expectations in July  there is no reason to believe that the current auto cycle is unraveling 
The average age of U S  vehicles sits at 11 4 years  which is its highest level since at least 1995  In other words  demand for new vehicles could remain strong for many years to come 
In this scenario  investors in Ford can almost certainly sleep well at night about the safety of their dividend income 
But what if the auto cycle begins to tumble 
In my view  this is the biggest unknown   how Ford will perform in the next industry downturn 
Will the company s smaller manufacturing footprint and reduced labor force allow its auto segment to at least breakeven 
Will Ford s financial services arm  which is levered 10 1 with over  120 billion in debt and the lowest investment grade credit rating from S P  face unprecedented challenges if some of its loans go bad  especially subprime  
If I had to guess  Ford s operational improvements  reasonably healthy balance sheet   10 billion in available credit lines  and improved cash management philosophy will be enough for the company to finally maintain its dividend during the next industry downturn 
That last point is important  Ford s current dividend policy was built to survive through a downturn  While management thought the same thing back in the early 1990s and was proven wrong  this time seems different 
The new and improved Ford is much more competitive and streamlined  The company s regular quarterly dividend amounts to roughly  2 4 billion per year  which is less than the annual dividends it paid in 2000 despite the company s much improved profitability today 
When times are good  Ford will reward shareholders with supplemental dividends instead of raising its regular payout 
The company paid a supplemental dividend of  1 billion this year and is on track for additional special dividends in future years  assuming vehicle sales remain stable 
Closing Thoughts on Ford s Dividend SafetyDividend investors have experienced somewhat of a joyride with Ford over the last 40 years  The company has slashed its payout four times and even stopped paying dividends altogether twice 
Barring an unprecedented shock in auto loans  credit quality or some truly nasty combination of events  e g  spiking gasoline prices  intensified marketing incentives   pricing pressure  total collapse in industry volumes   I believe Ford s regular quarterly dividend will prove to be safe 
However  after several decades of disappointment and potentially peaking industry conditions  it s no wonder why investors are hesitant to reward Ford s stock with a higher earnings multiple  currently trades at 6 3x forward earnings estimates  
To some degree  Ford is largely a  show me  story as management seeks to restore credibility with investors and prove itself during the next dip in vehicle sales 
While income investors will continue to be attracted to Ford s 5  dividend yield  this is still volatile stock that will get whacked during the next downturn   even if the dividend remains safe as I suspect it will  An investment at Ford is not for the faint of heart 
I personally prefer General Motors  GM   which I researched  ",2016-08-05,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/f:-is-ford's-dividend-at-risk-you-might-be-surprised-200146404,200146404
189503,411019,COP,How Plasma Pulse Technology Is Boosting Oil Production,opinion,"Let s face it  The gulf separating those who understand that hydrocarbons will remain a key part of the global economy from environmentalists is a gap in ideology that will never be totally bridged 
That s despite the argument that  other than water  there s no liquid that humans rely on more than petroleum  We use it to fuel our cars  heat our homes  pave our roads and create countless consumer products 
But hardcore greens oppose further oil and gas drilling or exploration in any form  both within America and internationally  Thus  there is no way that this demographic would even humor the idea of using a plasma source to stimulate long lived wells 
There are others out there  however  for whom the goal is simply  to be cleaner  
Not pure  just cleaner 
And there s a company with the technology to make the next stage of the North American energy boom not only cleaner  but easier and more efficient  as well 
The shale revolution that s driven U S  production to all time highs was itself fueled by critical innovations in enhanced oil recovery  EOR   These include thermal injection  gas injection and chemical injection technology to support hydraulic fracturing  fracking  
Fracking requires obscene amounts of water  in addition to controversial chemicals   not to mention seismic disturbances recorded in areas of concentrated use 
Plasma pulse technology  PPT  manipulates electrically generated plasma vibrations to reduce viscosity  increase permeability and improve the flow of oil to the surface for extraction 
It does so without causing acidization and absent the use of hydrofracking or chemicals  which are particularly hostile to the environment 
My great uncle was a key figure in plasma physics research at NASA during the initial stages of the Space Race  So when I hear about new applications  I pay attention 
Now  this is not a magic bullet  reflected in the fact that the share price of the U S  company that licenses the technology  Propell Technologies Group Inc  OTC PROP   last traded for 3 1 2 cents per share on the Over the Counter  OTC  market 
The stock has enjoyed a few bounces since going public in mid 2010  rising as high as 92 cents in mid 2013 
This year  however  it s down about 60  and is now trading around its all time lows  At these levels  the market capitalization is  9 4 million 
There are about 270 million shares outstanding  with average daily volume of about 225 000  So it s thinly traded and basically a penny stock 
But PPT has its advantages  And those advantages are becoming more and more important with each new law restricting hydraulic fracturing in the United States 
This combination of high level plasma physics and old school oil production is innovative and commercially viable  That s demonstrated by its successful use in more than 200 wells in Russia  China and Eastern Europe by clients including ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   NK Lukoil OAO  LON LKOHyq   Gazprom  MCX GAZP  and Rosneft  LON ROSNq  
In the United States  PPT has been used to treat 40 oil wells  27 of which show an average initial production increase of 295  and an average 88  rise in barrels of oil production over 60 days 
In January  Propell s board of directors brought in a new CEO  C  Brian Boutte  to reorient the company into one geared toward traditional exploration and production  E P  
The new strategy is focused on acquiring conventional assets from distressed producers whose overleverage and weak balances sheets leave them particularly vulnerable amid the steep decline and continuing bear market for oil prices 
Propell will apply PPT to boost production from existing wells  with accessible infrastructure in Texas  Oklahoma and Louisiana 
In addition to PPT  Propell is blessed with a solid balance sheet  including ample cash on hand  and the support of deep pocketed major investors familiar with the technology s successes outside the United States 
The market for enhanced oil recovery is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of more than 25   reaching  225 billion by 2020  So the opportunity is there 
And as the technology is applied in North America and around the world   PPT has been tested at only 400 wells so far  so it s in the very early stages of development   there s considerable room for adaptation and innovation 
Right now  the company can use its resources   including its balance sheet and technology   to capitalize on the misfortune of other companies that don t have the wherewithal to survive oil s downturn 
In the short term  this reads as a sharp but logical shift that should help the company generate greater cash flow and set it on a quicker course to profitability 
The longer term case is based on the assumption that oil prices will eventually strengthen 
That old adage that  the cure for low oil prices is low oil prices  now means that waning profits  lower rig counts and declining production amid stabilizing global demand forecasts will eventually build a floor for recovery 
And commodity pricing is subject to geopolitical uncertainty  too  That includes factors such as civil unrest in exporting countries and supply chain disruptions in key geographic hot zones 
At the same time  providing PPT to other E Ps remains a major part of Propell s business model  And it will have a critical role in North America s continuing oil boom 
It s not a substitute for fracking  but it is a way to get more oil for less cost   and less pollution   without additional drilling 
At the very least  it will help re energize existing fractured wells and extend their productive lives 
Drilling fewer wells is more efficient  cheaper and cleaner 
According to Zion Research  the market for enhanced oil recovery is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of more than 25    set to reach  225 billion by 2020  So the opportunity is there

189580,411096,COP,Canada Wildfires Still Not Reflected in Official Oil Inventories,opinion,"A month and a half after they began  the Fort McMurray wildfires in Alberta  Canada still blaze on in contained patches  Already estimated to be the most expensive disaster in Canadian history  costing the Albertan economy  70 million per day  the fires are now believed to be the work of humans  according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  RCMP  
Regardless of how it started   the beast   as some call it  has been a major disruptor to oil sands operations north of the fires  Affected exploration companies are looking at a collective loss of more than  1 4 billion  The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimates that an average of 800 000 barrels per day in production were taken offline last month  contributing greatly to May s having the highest monthly level of unplanned global oil supply disruptions since the agency began tracking such data in 2011 
Altogether  3 6 million barrels of oil per day were lost in May around the world  nudging crude prices up to levels we haven t seen since July of last year 
This month  disruptions caused by the fires are expected to average 400 000 barrels per day  Many companies such as Suncor Energy  NYSE SU   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  Canada  Syncrude Canada and Athabasca Oil Corp  TO ATH  have returned to the oil sands and are now beginning to pump crude again  but it will be weeks before they resume full production 
Similarly  it will be days before the disruptions  show up  in the official inventories at Cushing  Oklahoma  the largest commercial storage hub in the U S  When this happens  it might prompt investors to buy crude based on lower inventories  even if only in the short term  helping to lift prices even more 
All Pipes Lead to Cushing A lot of Canadian oil not to mention crude from North Dakota and gas from Pennsylvania bottlenecks in Cushing  Oklahoma  where it s all stored and blended  From there it s dispatched by rail and pipelines to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere 

Every week  the EIA releases a report detailing crude flows and oil stock levels in each of the nation s Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts  or PADDs  of which there are five  New England  PADD 1   Midwest  2   Gulf Coast  3   Rocky Mountain  4  and West Coast  5   Many analysts and investors pay special attention to PADD 2 because  among other reasons  the overwhelming majority of Canada s crude exports to the U S  enter through the Midwest district  usually through Chicago  before ending up in Cushing 
Looking at PADD 2  then  gives you a good idea of what percentage of inventory change at Cushing is a reflection of fluctuations in Canada s output 
Good Things Come to Those Who Wait Below  you can see that storage levels in PADD 2 are still above their five year range  though with a narrower margin than the same time last year  At the tail end of the weekly amount  the line is clearly tapering down maybe not dramatically  but it s a good sign that supply and demand could be starting to rebalance  as I discussed 
You might infer that at least some of this drawdown is a result of the production outages in Alberta  But the truth is that we probably won t see a meaningful decline until later this month  That s mainly because oil moves at only three to five miles per hour through the Keystone Pipeline  creating a delay of between five and six weeks from the time it leaves Calgary to the time it arrives in Cushing  The other reason is that Canada might have initially exported some of its local inventories to make up for the supply disruption 
Sophisticated investors have already accounted for this time delay  They will also be first to act when the disruption is fully reflected in the EIA s weekly reports 
In any case  lower inventories in the short term should temporarily help supply and demand rebalance  along with the drop in the North American rig count

189593,411109,COP,Oil Discoveries Lowest Since 1952  Is This The Bottom ,opinion,"Per a report by research firm IHS  the year 2015 marks the least amount of oil and gas discovered in over the last 64 years New oil discovered outside North America in 2015 totaled 2 8 billion barrels  the lowest amount since the industry actively started its worldwide oil exploration after World War II  The year also represented the fourth straight year of declining oil volumes   something that had never happened before Notably  about 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent  BOE  was added through gas discoveries in the year  This signifies the fifth consecutive year wherein gas volumes discovered surpassed oil volumes discovered Factors Behind the Decline in VolumesPer Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   major oil players have been forced to make substantial budget cuts to combat the freefall in oil prices  This is particularly true with respect to exploration  where spending was reduced to a meager  95 billion in 2015 from  168 billion two years earlier  ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc   ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP    Hess Corp    TO E   and EOG Resources Inc   TO E   are among the long list of companies that have slashed their capital budget Moreover  the industry wide pullback of drillships from international waters as companies began to shift focus to shale formations in Texas  North Dakota and Oklahoma resulted in decline in discoveries  Given that investments in shales are both cheaper and less risky than drilling in international waters  the move was an expected one in the lackluster commodity price scenario 
However  analysts are of the opinion that the unconventional oil in North America is not sufficient to resolve the lack of discoveries  Tight oil production is estimated to account for about 15  of global output by 2040 At the start of the decade  when oil demand rose rapidly  explorers were seen splurging astronomically on exploration  However  the outcome was poor with only a few notable hydrocarbon discoveries  such as Statoil  OL STL  ASA s   NYSE STO   Johan Sverdrup field off Norway s coast or EniSpA s   TO E   giant Zohr gas field off Egypt In 2015  companies drilled about 4 300 conventional exploration and appraisal wells compared with 5 200 in 2014 and 5 300 in 2012  Deep water drilling  which means drilling in 1 000 to 5 000 feet of water  decreased by more than 20  and the ultra deepwater well count plunged more than 40  from 2014 However  a surge in new oil fields in recent years and the increase of Iran s production on the back of international sanctions raises optimism about exploration in the short term Over the longer run we feel to avoid any supply gap in the future  we believe that exploration companies should continue to focus on exploring instead of waiting for the commodity price to improve  In case the companies do not take immediate action  the challenges may be difficult to overcome  After all oil discoveries are essential to substitute resources  meet an ever growing demand and offset the depletion of existing fields Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-05-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil-discoveries-lowest-since-1952:-is-this-the-bottom-200131949,200131949

189595,411111,COP,Crude Marches Higher  5 Energy Stocks With Great Momentum,opinion,Energy investors are all fired up with West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude making a dramatic comeback  breaching the  50 per barrel barrier and still going strong  With no immediate threat from the Federal Reserve of raising rates this year we feel that the momentum is here to stay for the commodity  So investors can try out a short term play using a momentum strategy to add substantial returns to their portfolio  As a caveat  this is a purely speculative strategy and strictly not meant for risk averse players With volatility slated to persist in the broader market till Nov 2016   the election year   we feel energy stocks that have already been substantially hit can only witness an upward momentum  So it will be prudent to invest in stocks from this sector that have shown an upward trend in prices Crude MomentumThe commodity benefited from lower U S  crude oil inventories coupled with supply outages round the globe like in Nigeria and a spike in Chinese demand  This can be termed as a total reversal of fortune for crude which saw a 12 year low mark of  26 21 per barrel in mid February  From there the wheels of fortune witnessed a total reversal  resulting in both Brent and WTI breaching the  51 per barrel and still looking up  In fact  this recent momentum resulted in WTI crude breaching the  50 benchmark for the first time since Jul 2015 Reflecting the renewed strength  the fear gauge CBOE Russell 2000 Volatility Index  RVX    a popular measure of volatility   declined 6 46  over the past one month  thus easing apprehensions of a volatile market in the near future  Hence  we believe that this is the perfect time for investors to buy stocks which produced high returns in the last one month  This was aptly reflected over the past week when big oil components like Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  advanced 8 35   ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   increased 7 78  and Eni SpA   TO E   rose 6 35  Moreover  the news of the oil price rise is good for oil drillers as their expected rig demand is positively correlated with crude prices  To say it in another way  the higher the price of oil  the more the exploration and production activities take place  Not only will a step up in activities bode well for the industry  these will also automatically translate into greater rig demand  Energy investors stand to gain from both 5 Momentum PicksThe basic fundamental driving a momentum trader is an investing strategy that seeks to capitalize on market volatility  Once a trend is recognized

189610,411126,COP,Alberta Wildfire Puts These ETFs In Focus,opinion,"As if global growth worries were not enough  natural calamity gnawed at the Canadian economy last week  The country saw the worst wildfire in recent times  with about  acres bursting into flames  Apart from residents  safety issues  the outbreak   which took place in Fort McMurray  Alberta   was more detrimental to the oil sands  read    
	The region is oil rich and economists are now predicting that  wildfire could cut oilsands    Among the renowned operators  Suncor Energy    has closed all of its oilsands facilities in the region  causing about 600 000 bbl d of production stoppage and has surrounded its facilities with fire breaks  The other companies that shut down production included Shell  LON RDSa  Albian Sands  Nexen Long Lake and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  Surmont and so on 
	Given uncertainties pertaining to the wildfire situation  Royal Bank of Canada  RBC  commented that  if we assume those shutdowns last for two weeks  they would subtract from May GDP   Apart from the blows from oil related earnings  this unprecedented disruption will also likely weight on citizens  daily routine and thus take a bite out of retail sales Economists  Estimate Cut
	Owing to this fire issue  RBC has slashed its prediction for second quarter annualized growth to 0 5   Previously  the bank had expected Canada s economy to expand at a 1 5  clip in the April to June quarter  per the source 
	BMO Financial has also reduced its second quarter GDP estimate to zero from 1 5  to account for the damage of the Fort McMurray wildfires 
	A  forecast that a fall of about 500 000 barrels of production per day is equal to nearly one fifth of overall output  And this would curtail growth by about 0 12 percentage points for every week of production cease 
	All in all  the Canadian economy is to get a considerable hit by the oil patch as the Fort McMurray has been reduced to ashes and will take some time to get back to its former shape    a catastrophe of this level could cause as much as  9 billion losses in the insured industry ETFs to Watch 
	Since Canada was forced to see the shutdown of more than  country s usual daily output  a significant tightening in oil supplies has been felt in the global market  As a result  oil prices jumped post Fort McMurray fire  Oil prices upped about 2  in trading early on Monday  as per Reuters  This might favor oil ETFs like United States Oil  NYSE USO     and United States Brent Oil     Notably  USO and BNO were up about 0 6  and 0 5   respectively on May 6  2016  read    

	Since Canada s GDP will be hit  Canada ETFs may underperform due to this fire disaster  The fund iShares MSCI Canada    has 41 2  weight in the financial sector followed by 20 8  in energy and 11 5  in materials sector  see  here  
	Another fund that could be hard hit is IQ Canada Small Cap ETF     If domestic activities fall short extensively in May  then the fund may decline as small caps are truly reflective of domestic actions

Oil prices moved north for the fifth time in 6 weeks on supply disruptions in Nigeria and Libya  A report by Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA   projecting the global oil inventory overhang to fade notably in the second half of the year  also propped up the commodity  Things were further helped by the Baker Hughes report that showed another drop in oil directed rigs   indicating a break in shale drilling activities 
On the other hand  natural gas stayed flat after an encouraging inventory report was offset by mild temperatures across most parts of the country that restricted the commodity s requirement for power burn

189633,411149,COP,Keep An Eye On Qatar The Leading Exporter Of LNG,opinion,"Natural gas is a tricky thing   besides its propensity to blow up  it also requires a change in state  from gas to liquid  for trans oceanic transport  The capital outlay for liquefaction and gasification terminals is significant as well as time consuming  Over 25 years ago  when the natural gas market was tight  one country invested so extensively in the infrastructure to extract  convert  and ship natural gas that it is now the leading exporter of liquefied natural gas  That country is Qatar 
Qatar not only leads the world in exporting liquefied natural gas  LNG   but is also the foremost expert in the liquefaction process  While energy companies around the world are struggling financially during this period of prolonged low energy prices  Qatar sees opportunity  The country is quietly leveraging its expertise and its capital to buy up natural gas assets around the world 
Back in 2013  when fuel prices were still high  Qatar and Centrica  L CNA   a British company  purchased natural gas assets in Alberta from Suncor Energy Inc  N SU  valued at  1 billion  The following year  the Qatar Centrica team bought additional assets in Canada   this time from Shell  L RDSa   Meanwhile  Qatar has been sitting on an investment right in the heart of America s energy industry  Qatar Petroleum  along with Conoco Phillips and Exxon Mobil  N XOM  own the Golden Pass re gasification plant on the Gulf Coast in Texas  The plant was originally intended to process imported natural gas  but has applied for a permit to retool as an export facility  Qatar recently expanded its assets by closing a deal to purchase a 30  share in Morocco s offshore oil and gas assets from Chevron  N CVX  
Despite a year of lower revenue from oil  the fact remains that Qatar  like its Persian Gulf neighbor Saudi Arabia  has the funds to make strategic asset purchases  The county has low public debt  a large stock of foreign reserves  and an ever more extensive sovereign wealth fund  At a time when major oil companies like Chevron Corporation  N CVX   ConocoPhillips  N COP   Royal Dutch Shell A  N RDSa   and Exxon Mobil Corporation  N XOM  are struggling to choose between maintaining their dividends or their credit ratings  Qatar is in an excellent position to take assets off of their hands ",2016-02-09,"Ellen R.

189634,411150,COP,Comparing ConocoPhillips And MLPs ,opinion,"Around ten days ago ConocoPhillips  N COP  and Magellan Midstream  N MMP  both released their 4Q15 earnings  and held conference calls on February 4th to discuss them  This coincidence of reporting is about all they have in common  but it caused us to look a bit more closely at an energy company  COP  that truly has commodity price exposure and what it s doing about it 

COP announced a two thirds cut in their dividend  a completely understandable move because they really are financing it with debt  The problem with an Exploration and Production  E P  company like COP is that they have to keep replacing their assets 
Hydrocarbons produced are assets no longer available to generate future revenues  and so they keep investing in new future production  Consequently  COP s  3 3BN of 2015 EBITDA was dwarfed by  10BN of capex resulting in negative free cashflow  FCF   They lost  3 50 per share 
The company closed out the year with half the cash with which it started   2 4BN versus  5 1BN  and on top of that their proved reserves fell by 19   from 8 9 BBOE  Billions of Barrels of Oil Equivalent  to 8 2 BBOE  Incidentally  COP s 2015 Depreciation  Depletion and Amortization  DD A  was  9BN  pretty close to their capex  Their new investments were approximately equal to the hydrocarbon assets they extracted and sold  In 2016 their DD A is likely to exceed their capex by  2BN  They are running very hard and not even moving forward  2015 was a year COP will happily forget   they lost money  used up half their cash and saw their reserves drop  They have nothing to show for it 
It s hard to know how to value COP  and especially hard to compare them with an MLP  which is where we re going   Neither their free cash flow yield nor their P E multiple are meaningful since both are negative  On an Enterprise Value EBITDA  EV EBITDA  basis they re priced at 15 4X based on 2016 guidance  which incorporates a 36  slashing of their capex budget to  6 4BN  This multiple flatters COP and all E P companies though  because it backs out depletion and depreciation although their future EBITDA is dependent on continuing growth capex to replace what s gone 
COP s dividend cut was a belated acknowledgment of the obvious  which is that they don t generate any cash to pay a dividend so are funding it with debt  In fact  COP operates in the way that many MLP critics assert is prevalent with midstream infrastructure businesses  although there are substantial differences between the assets of an E P company  hydrocarbon reserves which are used up  and pipelines which last for decades and don t require perennial replacement  although they do require maintenance  
MMP reported solid earnings and generates Distributable Cash Flow  DCF   a measure somewhat analogous to COP s FCF  although MLP critics will disagree on this point   MMP s DCF covers their distribution  whereas COP really has no business paying a dividend  MMP s EV EBITDA  in which their EBITDA is more reflective of FCF generation because its assets are not naturally depleting  is 15 3X on 2016 guidance  roughly the same as COP s 
Now it s true that COP has tracked the Alerian Index  AMZX  more reliably than MMP  which is to say MLPs have behaved like an enormous cash consuming owner of depleting assets rather than the cash generative owner of sustainable assets that they are  The few E P names in the Alerian index have been dumped following distribution cuts  reliable distributions are one of the the rules for inclusion   so AMZX no longer includes E P businesses  MMP has outperformed AMZX  and yet its valuation fails to differentiate it from COP  It has been dragged down by its sector 
We continue to think that the ongoing collapse in MLPs is reflective of their financing model and rigidity of the investor base  see    Traditional MLP investors are U S  taxable  high net worth  HNW  individuals  The arrival of smaller retail investors through mutual funds and ETFs for a time met the increased need for growth capex that traditional MLP investors  who like their distributions  didn t want to finance by reinvesting everything they received  The retail investor was the marginal buyer  for a while  The surprise has been that upon his exit  new sources of financing have required a substantial price discount  MLP proponents have written for years about the institutionalization of the sector  The evidence clearly shows that once you exclude institutional money managers of retail money  the true institutional investors of public equities  pension funds  sovereign wealth funds  endowments and foundations  are not natural MLP investors because of the tax barriers 
Deciding the sector is cheap and then identifying a manager and implementing is a deliberate process  and while we see some evidence that it is under way  the buyer of an MLP today is most likely still the traditional HNW taxable investor  Given the collapse in prices  he s not very enthusiastic  In this way  the MLP sector is unlike any other sector of the U S  equity markets where capital can move in more opportunistically  Eventually  institutional investors will commit more meaningful capital  but it takes time  Most of the publicly listed MLP funds are terribly tax inefficient  see    although not   As well as selecting a manager to oversee an MLP portfolio  a non tax paying pension fund must decide to file a tax return  as direct holdings of MLPs would require   These are not trivial decisions  Count the cheerleaders for the  institutionalization  of the MLP sector among those whose views were aspirational rather than realistic

189656,411172,COP,Gas  Plasma  And The Future Of EOR In The U S ,opinion,"The failure of OPEC members to discuss production ceilings at a recent meeting has compounded selling pressure in crude oil  and the global benchmarks are trading at close to six year lows  ETFs have followed suit  with United States Oil  N USO  closing out last week at  12 46   a 90  discount on the  113 highs recorded back in 2008  Oil producers are struggling to drill profitably  and with OPEC s seeming monopoly on the price of crude  are turning their focus to a factor that remains within their individual control   efficiency  The major producers can t control the price they sell at  but to an increasing extent they can control their cost per barrel  and as we go forward  it is this latter factor that looks set to be the primary determinant of their bottom line  So  with this said  how is big oil approaching this efficiency drive 
The space is called enhanced oil recovery  EOR   By employing a selection of techniques  oil companies can extract up to 60  more of a reservoir s original oil than is possible without EOR  There are three categories of EOR   thermal  gas and chemical  Gas is by far the most used in the US  accounting for circa 60  of EOR production  Thermal accounts for just under 40   and chemical around 1   The science behind the thermal technique is pretty simple  steam is injected into wells  it heats up the oil and makes it less viscous  which makes it easier to pump out of the well  Gas injection  most commonly CO2 injection  is similar  in that it decreases the viscosity of the oil in a well  but it also helps to maintain the underground pressure and   in turn   improve displacement 
According to a report published by BP plc   L BP   a 5  increase in the recovery rate of its wells would translate to between 300 and 600 billion barrels of extra annual production  US oil demand is approximately 6 billion a year  with 1 4 billion of these barrels imported from OPEC nations  With an increasing drive towards complete self reliance a big part of both political and social agendas  the impact of EOR is tremendous  Why  then  are all companies not employing EOR tactics at all wells  As always  it s a matter of economics  If the price of oil is too low  the added cost per barrel disincentives EOR 
Consider CO2 EOR as an example  For companies that use CO2 EOR  the cost of the CO2 makes up the majority of the entire undertaking  assuming the wells in question have already been redrilled redressed to accommodate the process  On average  the cost of the CO2 accounts for 25 50  of the cost of the barrel produced  The price of CO2 varies  it usually fluctuates in line with the price of oil   but using a reasonable average of price over the last few years  and for the purposes of this study  let s put it at  2 McF  At this price  total CO2 purchase costs come in at around  15  based on the amount of CO2 required to produce the extra barrel of crude in question  Say the price of oil is at  70 a barrel  and an oil company pays  15 in royalties and production taxes  it makes  55 net revenues per barrel  Subtract  15 for operational costs and  15 for the C02 costs  and the company in question nets  25 per barrel  pre tax  Consider the same scenario at current per barrel prices  however  and the situation is not so positive  Assuming the same costs  and the current price of  40 a barrel  the company in question loses  5 per barrel of CO2 EOR oil it produces 
Essentially  therefore  the US has billions of barrels of oil in its domestic fields that CO2 EOR could drill  but at current prices  there is no financial incentive for the companies who own the wells to produce  Conversely  there is a financial disincentive  So  what s the solution  If the US can enhance its enhanced recovery methods  and bring the cost per barrel of recovery down  it could reverse the disincentive  Enter  Russia  A large portion of Russian oil operations have adopted the latest trend in EOR   plasma pulse technology  Plasma pulse EOR involves the insertion of a pulse tool into vertical wells  which emits repeated bursts of impulse waves  These bursts cause the wells to vibrate  loosening the sediment surrounding the oil and increasing permeability  This increased permeability makes it easier to pump the oil out of the well  A team at the St  Petersburg State Mining University developed and patented the technology  and it is proven across more than 200 wells in Russia and Europe  with an 87  success rate  with success measured as a 100  increase in well production  It is cheaper  by way of reduced operational cost and lack of necessity to store and purchase CO2  than gas EOR 
Now  the technology is coming to the US  Licensed through Novas Energy Group  a subsidiary of Propell Technologies Group  Inc   OBB PROP   plasma pulse has completed around 40 successful treatments in California  Kansas  Louisiana  Oklahoma  Texas  Tennessee and Wyoming  So far  the companies adopting the treatment have been small   AusTex  OTC ATXDY   Miller Energy Resources  OTC MILLQ  and Richfield Oil and Gas to name a few   but in Europe and Russia industry giants such as ConocoPhillips  N COP  and Gazprom  MCX GAZP  have incorporated plasa pulse into their operations  Further  big name individuals associated with the oil and gas industry are allocating capital towards the technology  Russian billionaire Roman Abromavich  perhaps best known for owning UK based Chelsea FC  invested  5 million earlier this year in Propell  and a further  9 million a few months later  the second investment was the result of an option to invest further associated with the first investment   As stated in this Business Insider article  he is known for going big in these sorts of spaces  so the  15 million likely represents an initial position  preceding a much larger investment once the technology starts to expand 
Can  then  plasma pulse technology replace the US s reliance on CO2 EOR  It is probably too early to draw this conclusion  as the CO2 EOR framework is well established in the US  However  we can reasonably conclude that it is an attractive alternative  especially given current oil prices  If oil remains at less than  50 a barrel  the larger oil companies will need to look to alternatives to CO2 EOR if they are to profitably draw on their sleeping oil reserves  Plasma pulse technology is a viable alternative  and could  therefore  be a major part of EOR in the US going forward  Definitely a space worth watching ",2015-12-09,Samuel Rae,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/gas,-plasma-and-the-future-of-eor-in-the-us-375151",375151

189658,411174,COP,ConocoPhillips  A Cautionary Tale From The Oil Patch,opinion,"ConocoPhillips  N COP   on the morning of February 4  2016  The news included a capitulation to the on going deterioration of business conditions in the oil patch  COP slashed its dividend by two thirds 

 ConocoPhillips  NYSE  COP  today announced it is taking actions to maintain its strong balance sheet in response to both the weak outlook for commodity prices and expected credit tightening across the industry  The actions will position the company to accelerate shareholder value creation as prices recover 
The company announced that its board of directors approved a reduction in the company s quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share  compared with the previous quarterly dividend of 74 cents per share  

Chairman and chief executive officer Ryan Lance went on to lament that the decision to cut the dividend was a  difficult one   Essentially the company is coming to terms with the very real possibility that commodity prices stay lower for longer than originally anticipated 

 The dividend has been  and will continue to be  a top priority  We still intend to provide a competitive dividend  while significantly lowering the breakeven price for the company and substantially reducing the level of borrowing in 2016  Our actions also position us to deliver strong absolute and relative performance as prices recover  

Up until now  COP had worn a very brave face  In doing so  COP s cautionary tale reminds us that we cannot assume that company management fully grasps and or is ready and willing to communicate the true range of operational realities facing the business   For the sake of argument  I am excluding the chance that  in this case  management actually feared a dividend cut but did not want to confront the possibility  
An irony of COP s capitulation comes from six months ago when the company announced Q2 2015 financial results on July 30  2015  At that time  COP made headlines by boldly and emphatically pronouncing that its dividend was safe  Here is Lance as quoted in the   emphasis mine  

 So let me give you the punch line of these comments  the dividend is safe  Let me repeat that  the dividend is safe  The business is running well  we have increasing flexibility and can achieve cash flow neutrality in 2017 and beyond at today s strip price of roughly  60 per barrel Brent  And we have a unique formula for sustainable performance and a portfolio that can deliver  

To help prove the point  COP increased the dividend by a small amount as part of   an important message for our shareholders   Lance exuded confidence in declaring that the company is managing for the short term  medium term  and long term  The company was firmly committed to growing the dividend as a top priority  The balance sheet and affordable growth came in second and third respectively  A moment of clarity for considering a potential bad outcome came later in the call when COP noted it could use debt to fund its dividend if necessary 

  we still have really solid access to the capital markets to the extent that we   that it s necessary to go beyond our cash balances to fund our capital and our dividend in the period before 2016 when we get to cash flow neutrality  We certainly have the ability to do that in a very effective way  

Perhaps those musings represented a warning sign 
Fast forward to the Q4 2015 earnings call on October 30  2015  Oil prices had declined sharply for a month following COP s July earnings conference call  Prices rebounded sharply from there and had stabilized for the two months going into COP s call 

For a few months last fall  oil stabilized in anticipation of the next OPEC announcement  hopes the cartel could finally cooperate in manipulating prices higher  
Hope was in the air  COP increased the dividend and again noted this action demonstrated that the dividend remained a top priority  The next set of quotes come from Jeff Sheets as published   Here is Sheets reminding analysts that COP could fund the dividend from debt 

 We re going to  we will first use the cash that s on our balance sheet and then to the extent that cash from operations and asset sales don t fully fund capital in the dividend we ll be looking to increase debt  I mean that it s just a mechanic of what s going to end up happening for us  And as we said as we look at the amount of debt that we might need to raise even in some continuations of some pretty tough price environments we feel comfortable that that capacity exists on our balance sheet  And it really exists within a single A credit rating as well  

Debt funded dividends remained the worst case scenario for COP  The company was not even contemplating the possibility of rolling back the dividend  emphasis mine  

 We think of a dividend as something that really should only go one direction and there can be some variability in the rate at which dividend increases  But the key to a dividend is to have it be consistent and to grow it over time 
So we haven t really had significant discussion to talk about trying to adjust the dividend  It s an important part of our value proposition  It puts a lot of discipline into the system to have that dividend  So you ve heard us talk about it pretty consistently  You re going to continue to hear us talk about that as a key component of our value proposition  

As part of the company s key value proposition  COP had to cling to its plans and had to insist on infusing hope in the investor base 
Matt Fox further reassured the audience 

 When we look at what it s going to take to win in a more cyclical and volatile future we think it s a diverse low decline production base that gives us stable source of funding to sustain the dividend and we have that  

So no wonder COP described the decision to roll back the dividend by two thirds as a difficult one  Based on prior statements  the cut undermines the  value proposition  of holding the stock  The cut could cast doubt on the health of the company s balance sheet and ability to stabilize its financial results 
Going into earnings  COP had suffered heavy losses in parallel to the on going plunge in oil  I am guessing part of the selling in COP was a recognition of increased dividend risks  Yet  the stock still lost 8 6  in the wake of earnings  Fortunately for the stock  there was already just enough buffer built off the recent 6 1 2 year low 

ConocoPhillips  COP  has not seen prices this low since 2009 


Trading volume surged to 49M  4x the 3 month average  as investors expressed their disappointment with COP s capitulation on the dividend 
To be fair  forecasting is difficult  Accepting trends that are working against your business  your hopes  and your plans must be just as difficult if not more so  I wrote this cautionary tale as a quick tour through COP s past three earnings reports just to illustrate the dangers in assuming that management s task is NOT difficult  Given the experts can fail to notice the train roaring down the tracks of their own industry  one does well to adopt circumspection and to respect the trends 
Be careful out there

189678,411194,COP,Energy Sector Bottoming Out  Turning A Corner,opinion,"We are watching oversold crude oil prices building a bottom 

Source  Short Side of Long
It is not easy to stick your neck out and make a major call on an asset class  but we here at Short Side of Long have done it in the stock market on 25th of August  About a week after that call  we also gave readers a heads up as to why we think commodities are finally   Finally  just before the month of October started  we discussed the potential for a precious metals rally  anticipating a falling probability of FOMC hiking rates in 2015 
One of the major stock purchases we made in both late August as well as late September were the beaten down energy stocks  sector via Energy Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLE    We jumped at great value and very high dividend yields in individual names such as ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Chevron  NYSE CVX  amongst others  as well as the overall Oil   Gas sector  SPDR S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production  NYSE XOP   
The reasoning behind this purchase is our view that Crude Oil has most likely bottomed  together with the fact that Energy stocks just suffered one of the worst bear markets and liquidation panics in two decades 
August panic in the energy stocks was 2nd worst in two decades

Source  SentimenTrader  edited by Short Side of Long 
The type of the liquidation we saw in crude oil throughout the 2014 15 period has certain similarities to other historical crashes from 1986 and 2008  Both of these are selling climaxes  and once the bottom is reached one should buy all one can  We finally see a change in supply and demand dynamics  with  rapidly declining in recent quarters  which almost guarantees a noteworthy fall in future supply  Furthermore  corporate insiders  smart money  have been busy buying energy stocks  while hedge funds and speculators  dumb money  are extremely bearish with  in two decades 
During the 25th of August  now also known as Black Monday  market participants reached a boiling point  as they completely dumped energy stocks  Percentage of components in the S P Energy sector  NYSE  XLE  spiked over 75   which was the second worst selling climax  only outdone by the Lehman panic of October 2008  Furthermore  percentage of energy components trading above the 200 day moving average has been depressed  oversold  for the longest stretch in almost two decades  We haven t seen neutral readings  above 50   in over 52 weeks  which shows just how incredible the selling pressure in this sector has been 
Energy sector has been in a strong bear market for over 14 months

189679,411195,COP,Shale Oil Bottom  Here s The Key To An Eventual Turnaround,opinion,"For those who knew where to look  there was vital information in ExxonMobil  N XOM  and Chevron s  N CVX  most recent earnings calls 
Last week I warned investors not to fall for several false signs that shale oil had bottomed out  but we do need to keep an eye on legitimate signs of a potential comeback  The most prominent signal to date of a reinvigorated shale industry is that the major oil companies are now showing interest in purchasing shale assets 
Way back at the   when low oil prices were a novelty instead of a new normal  I  to keep an eye on how large oil companies handle the fracking industry  As expected  struggling fracking companies began putting assets on the market almost immediately in order to free up cash and improve their balance sheets for lenders  As I said then  when the large oil companies strategically decide to invest  we will know that the shale industry has hit its bottom  After all  who knows the trends better than the majors 
Last week I highlighted a Chinese real estate investment firm that recently bought significant assets in Texas as an example of what NOT to look for  This week  there are signs that the major companies  such as ExxonMobil  N XOM   Chevron  N CVX   Total SA  N TOT   Statoil  N STO   Royal Dutch Shell A  N RDSa   and even national companies like Saudi Aramco MAY be getting ready to move into the shale patch 
The majors are suffering from lower revenues over the last year and have begun announcing cuts in mega projects like those in the Arctic  North Sea  and Gulf of Mexico  Yet these companies need to have projects in the development pipeline for their own long term stability  Shale oil assets in Texas  North Dakota  and Oklahoma are comparatively inexpensive to develop and becoming cheaper to purchase every month  In the last week  ExxonMobil and Chevron made clear to shareholders that they plan to significantly increase their U S  shale oil production over the next few years 
ExxonMobil bought into the fracking industry nearly five years ago when it purchased XTO Energy for  35 billion  With infrastructure and personnel already in place  it is primed to expand its shale oil production   when the time is right  Other large companies will also want to buy into the fracking industry  either by purchasing entire companies or by purchasing assets  These companies will buy at the lowest price and may even choose not to put assets into immediate production until oil prices rise enough to make production more profitable for them  The majors can afford to wait  whereas the small fracking companies have to produce as much oil as possible right now in order to remain afloat  regardless of the price of oil 
Keep a close eye on majors like ExxonMobil  Chevron  RDS  ConocoPhillips  N COP   and Aramco  When they start purchasing  it means they see the bottom of shale valuations  They may choose to wait until fracking companies get slammed after the next credit review in 2016  or they may make their moves in next few months  as shale producers struggle to free up cash in order to convince lenders to keep their lines of credit open  Either way  when the majors move in  shale oil will finally see the light at the end of the tunnel ",2015-11-04,"Ellen R.

189691,411207,COP,The Energy Report  King Glut,opinion,"Oil prices fell under pressure as weak data out of Japan is raising more fears of a glut of oil  A market that has already priced in fears of a China slowdown is now trying to asses economic fall out in other consuming nations  This comes after U S  oil rig counts rise for the 4th week in a row and OPEC is talking about record production  Even in Non OPEC nation Oman saw its output rise above 1 million barrels a day for the first time  Japan GDP contracted 0 4  and it is reflecting the deflationary pressures we have been seeing around the globe 
Yet oil inability to close below  42 a barrel is still a hurdle that shorts may have to deal with  A close below  42 would open the door up for a test of  38  but so far the market has not been able to do that  Maybe today  as most of the volume and open interest moves from the September to the October contract  but it is early 
Turn those machines back on  I demand an investigation  After massive price spikes in the midwest  drivers are angry and we can tell by the response of politicians  Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette led the way in a letter to BP America headquarters in Chicago saying that  Apart from complaints of price gouging and suspicions of price fixing  many constituents express disbelief that reported problems at various refineries    can cause such direct and immediate effects at the pump   He also warned gas stations to not even think about gouging consumers  This was followed by a joint letter from Michigan Representative Fred Upton  R St  Joe County  and Rep  Jackie Walorski  R Indiana  to the chief executive officer of British Petroleum  Robert Dudley 

 We sent this urgent letter to BP today because consumers have a right to know what is going on with the unscheduled shutdown of the Whiting refinery  Some areas of the Midwest have seen prices rise over  1 per gallon over a 24 hour period  disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable of our constituents and resulting in large unpredicted costs in getting goods to market across the region  Additionally  some are worried that speculators may force additional increases due to lack of information  Needless to say  this incident poses a serious hardship for our districts  

The Crude Export Ban is starting to crumble  Bloomberg News reports that  The U S  agreed to allow some crude to flow to Mexico in another step toward easing a 40 year ban on most domestic oil exports  Limited shipments of crude will be exchanged for Mexican oil coming back to the U S   said a senior administration official who asked not to be named according to government policy  Canada is the only other nation that is exempt from the prohibition on exports  Requests from less than a dozen other unidentified countries to import U S  crude were denied  the official said  
Energy producers including Exxon Mobil Corp  NYSE XOM   and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  have called for an end to the export restrictions after a drilling boom boosted U S  oil production to the highest level in more than 40 years  Some members of Congress have also called for an end to the policy  as prices dropped by more than half since last June  Approval from the U S  Commerce Department comes after the same agency allowed for exports of lightly processed oil last year   It shows the administration is going to be flexible within existing law to find homes for domestic production   said John Auers  executive vice president of energy consultant Turner Mason   Co   With crude prices being low  export restrictions are arguably causing an even greater impediment to domestic production   Under the permits due to be issued by the end of the month  Mexico can receive the oil in return for shipping similar quantities to U S  refineries  The U S  crude that goes to Mexico must be refined there ",2015-08-17,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-for-08-17-2015-261916,261916
189692,411208,COP,This Week In Energy  A Dangerous Global Trend Emerging,opinion,"The bear market continues  Another week  another significant loss for oil prices  WTI neared breaking through the psychologically important  40 per barrel threshold  as a litany of negative news pushed down oil prices  Peak driving season is nearing its end  More importantly  the refining maintenance season is set to begin  That potentially raises two negative forces slamming the markets at once   less oil demand  and more crude supply diverted into storage 
One important global trend to watch is the souring of the emerging market economies  Countries like the BRICs  Brazil  Russia  India  China   and other rapidly growing countries like Turkey  Indonesia  South Africa and Colombia  to name a few  have been a major source of economic growth in the past five years  These countries grew way faster than the developed world  which suffered from stagnant growth and a hangover of the financial crisis 
Much of the growth in emerging markets came from the commodity super cycle  however  which has now suffered a once in a generation bust  Resource extraction economies  particularly those in Latin America and Africa  capitalized on the voracious appetite for raw materials in India and China  But China s dramatic slowdown  which could yet turn into something worse  was ill timed  It is unfolding at the same time that a variety of commodities busted from too much supply  crude oil  natural gas and coal  to name a few 
The problem was summed up this week by the crushing blow inflicted on the share price of Glencore  LONDON GLEN   the Swiss mining multinational that reported a  this week for the first half of 2015  The stock cratered nearly 10 percent on Wednesday  The yield on Glencore s bonds has jumped by a percentage point since July to 5 9 percent  an indication that the company s debt is looking more risky  Glencore mines metals  minerals  oil and coal  and is taking a beating from the slowdown in China 
On top of slowing emerging market economies and the commodity bust is the potential tightening of monetary policy in the U S   which could strengthen the dollar and depress currencies around the world further  A worldwide sell off in emerging market currencies is devastating market sentiment  and raising serious questions about oil demand  Russia s ruble  Mexico s peso  Nigeria s naira and many others are under increasing pressure  The one thing they all have in common is a dependency on resource extraction and commodity export driven growth 
In other words  emerging markets may no longer carry the weight of global growth  With the industrialized world still posting unimpressive growth rates  what comes next is unclear  The global economy is showing some significant cracks 
On to more oil news  Canada s oil industry is under fire from multiyear lows in oil prices  Canada s oil sands sell at a discount to WTI due to differences in quality and infrastructure bottlenecks  but Canadian grades are selling much lower because of the BP  LONDON BP  refinery outage in the Midwest  While WTI is selling for around  40 per barrel  Canada s oil sands are selling for about half of that  Some producers are losing money even on mature projects that only have operational costs  In other words  they are on each barrel sold  Suncor Energy Inc  NYSE SU   Cenovus Energy Inc  NYSE CVE   and Canadian Natural Resources Limited  NYSE CNQ  are just a few of the companies that are seeing their share prices crater  Much of the oil industry is facing major financial pressure from low oil prices  but Canada is probably suffering worse than others 
Moody s downgraded the credit rating of ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  to A2 from A1   The ratings downgrade reflects Moody s expectation that COP s financial leverage will remain high through 2017  with the company increasing its debt levels to fund negative free cash flow   Gretchen French  Moody s Vice President  said in a    We positively note that in the face of a weak commodity price environment  COP has taken a number of steps to lower its cost structure  increase its financial and operating flexibility  and maintain a strong liquidity profile  However  the A2 rating positions the company with more flexibility within the rating and relative to its peers  
The U S  government held an auction for offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico this week and the results were the worst since the early 1980s  Only five companies   led by BHP Billiton Petroleum  LONDON BLT    actually submitted bids  a low level of interest  Offshore oil companies are declining to put up the capital to acquire offshore acreage  preferring to focus on their existing holdings and some even looking to sell off assets to survive the downturn  Unlike shale drilling  which can be done in a matter of weeks or months for a few million dollars per well  offshore oil projects can take years to develop  costing billions of dollars  That is a luxury that most companies can t afford right now 
The oil export debate continues to gain momentum in the United States  This week a key Democratic Senator  for increased oil exports  Sen  Robert Menendez  D NJ   once an opponent of oil exports  framed his support as a tool to gain leverage over Iran  Menendez came out against the nuclear agreement that the Obama administration negotiated with Iran  and said that more oil exports would allow the U S  to renegotiate a stronger deal  His argument ignored the fact that the rest of the international community won t entertain a return to negotiations  And in any event  Sen  Menendez s opposition probably won t kill the deal 
But important for the issue of oil exports was his newfound support for removing the ban  There is growing support on both sides of the aisle to scrap the four decade ban  and the six year low in oil prices only adds more urgency to the matter 
Nigeria is making strides in cleaning up its corrupt oil sector  New president Muhammadu Buhari has  the chief of the National Nigerian Petroleum Corporation with a former Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  executive  From there  the new head of the NNPC got rid of all of the company s executive directors and officials at related agencies have been forced into retirement or let go  The reshuffling and slimming down of the national oil company are impressive notes of progress for Buhari  who has aimed to create a leaner  business like company  Another objective is to reduce oil theft  which Buhari has stated has run as high as 250 000 barrels per day  Clear progress on that front remains to be seen ",2015-08-24,OilPrice.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-week-in-energy:-a-dangerous-global-trend-emerging-262618,262618

189694,411210,COP,4 Myths About The Market Meltdown And Energy Pricing ,opinion,"1  Demand in China is Weak
The Chinese stock market may be down to 2007 levels and the government may be devaluing the yuan  but there is no indication that this  economic slowdown  is extending to commodities  China is one of the largest consumers of commodities in the world  A decline in commodity imports should foreshadow an economic downturn  but Chinese crude oil imports were up 27  in June and went up another 1 7 million barrels a day in July  In the beginning of August  the Chinese Ministry of Commerce granted licenses to two independent refineries in China to import crude oil directly  a move designed to further open their commodities market to private interests  Most of China s domestic independent oil refineries have never received sufficient crude oil feedstock from the government and have been relying on imports of low quality fuel oil to refine into gasoline and diesel  Freeing these refineries to arrange their own imports should increase demand for crude oil imports in China in the coming months  and if China continues on this path  crude oil imports may rise even more  The bottom line is that if Chinese refineries have the ability to import more crude oil  they surely will  especially at the low  40 barrel prices seen in today s market 
2  Low Prices are Bad for the U S  Energy Industry
 Not everyone is losing money in the U S  oil market today  Refineries  petrochemical processing plants  and other manufacturers that use crude oil as feedstock are seeing huge profit margins  Gasoline demand is up 4 1  in the U S  this year and refineries in the Chicago area saw profit margins of  50 48 in August   the highest since September 2008  In New York  the spread between gasoline and crude oil has been in the  30 range  Crude oil in the United States is artificially depressed because of a lack of refining capacity that is particularly acute due to a mismatch in the type of oil available in the U S  and the type most efficiently refined by North American refineries  and because of several mechanical issues at major refineries that have taken hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day out of production  All signs indicate that the U S  would process more crude oil if it could which would push crude oil prices higher and gasoline prices lower  But since there is not enough refining capacity for all of the available crude  refineries and gasoline distributors are raking in the profits  This is why you cannot find  1 50 gas at the pump 
3  The Oil Price Slide Will Break Up OPEC
 Low oil prices have been hurting small oil producing nations for the better part of the year  and every few months Venezuela  Iran  Nigeria  Algeria  and Libya call for OPEC to reassess its current production policies  The fact that half of OPEC is unhappy with the cartel s decisions to keep pumping oil  whereas the big producers   Saudi Arabia  the UAE  Qatar  and Kuwait   are committed to staying the course  is no indication that OPEC is breaking apart  None of the smaller  poorer producers have even threatened to leave OPEC  After all  without OPEC their productive capacity means even less than it does now  Relatively small producers only have a voice in the global oil market today because of their OPEC membership  Dissention in the ranks of OPEC is nothing new  Saudi Arabia and Iran fought tooth and nail over where to set the price of oil in 1974  and Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990  in part because Kuwait s illicit overproduction drove down oil prices  A little bickering is par for the course  and Saudi Arabia will handle the smaller OPEC producers  because those smaller players have nowhere else to go 
4  All Oil Players are Suffering
 Low oil prices hurt some players more than others  Public companies are all taking hits in the stock market  but those with diversified upstream and downstream operations can make up for it  When large companies  like ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX   Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSa  and BP  NYSE BP  cannot make a profit in oil production  they rely on their downstream refining operations to even out the difference  National oil companies that are similarly diversified  like Saudi Aramco  are also better situated to handle low oil prices by relying on refining operations  and they do not have to deal with the whims of shareholders  On the other hand  companies like Continental Resources  NYSE CLR  and Whiting Petroleum  NYSE WLL  do not own stakes in refineries  leaving them at the mercy of sub  40 barrel oil prices  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   on the other hand  spun off its downstream operations into a separate company  Phillips66  NYSE PSX   which is positioned to do quite well in this period of low oil prices  Players who diversified during the period when high crude oil prices helped them reap profits are better positioned to ride out these lean times  The big and diversified firms will also ultimately best position themselves to purchase their competitors  who  come October  will certainly find themselves in even worse situations ",2015-08-25,"Ellen R.

189695,411211,COP,Is Recession Necessary For The S P 500 To Fall 20  From All Time Highs ,opinion,"Is it possible for a bear market to occur when the U S  economy is expanding  Certainly  In fact  most bear markets are already well on their way to becoming 20  price declines long before a recession is formerly identified 
Consider the most recent bearish retreat  10 07   3 09   The National Bureau of Economic Research  NBER  officially declared on 12 1 08 that the U S  recession had started in December of 2007   a declaration that came nearly one year after the economic downturn s inception 

Nine months before NBER expressed its  recession  call  the S P 500 had already plummeted close to the 20  level  March  2008   At that moment  the Federal Reserve saved financial markets by joining JP Morgan Chase  NYSE JPM  in bailing out Bear Stearns  Then  in the first week of July  five months before the NBER proclamation  the S P 500 had descended more than the requisite 20   And by the time anyone could count on an authenticated recession  the S P 500 had already plummeted roughly 47 8    close to half of its entire value 
Well  okay  I suppose that the world s best economists should err on the side of caution before making hasty decisions  Perhaps NBER  composed of academic economists from Harvard  Stanford and other top notch universities  were quicker in warning investors prior to the 3 2000 10 2002 tech wreck 

Unfortunately  nine months before NBER expressed a March 2001 recession start in November of 2001  the S P 500 had already made its bearish descent   Nine months again   It gets worse  The S P 500 had already dropped 29  by November of 2001 and the  New Economy  NASDAQ had already plummeted 65  

In spite of the obvious evidence that U S  stock assets tend to fall long before the most prominent minds affirm contraction in the U S  economy  an overwhelming number of analysts keep exclaiming that there is no recession in sight  And without a recession  they say  there s not going to be a bear 
I am not sure this is an accurate statement  Since 1950  we have seen non recession 20  plus drops in 1962  1966  1978 and 1987  We have also seen non recession drops that do not get the full benefit of the bear title  e g   1998 s Asian currency crisis Long Term Capital Management  2011 s euro zone  etc    yet reached the 20  threshold via  intra day  price movement and or  rounding   What s more  why do people automatically assign the recession tag to bear markets like the 3 2000 10 2002 tech wreck when the recession first began one year later in March of 2001  Perhaps because NBER later revised the recession date as having started in Q4 2000 
I have no idea if we will see a bear on this correction go around or the next 10  19  pullback or the one after that  What I do know is that the commodity slump has resulted in ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  slashing 10  of its global workforce  high paying oil jobs continue to disappear in a world of  45 oil  I also know that the  wants to hike overnight rates  likely raising the borrowing costs for consumers and businesses just as the  expects Q3 GDP at an anemic 1 2   Perhaps most importantly  I recognize that the U S  economy is part of a global economy that has been decelerating  JP Morgan s Global  is now at 50 7 where a reading below 50 would be indicative of a global manufacturing recession 


In mid August s  15 Warning Signs   I discussed the reasons why a pullback from the market top was exceptionally likely  One week later  in  Don t Blame China   I talked about the reasons why investors should expect a relief rally  And in my Thursday  8 27  commentary   Are You Selling The Drama Or Buying The Rally   I wrote 

If history teaches us that benchmarks tend to retrace half of their losses before retesting their lows   if you feel like you ve been here before and you don t choose to be scarred like that again   perhaps you might anticipate better buying opportunities in the weeks ahead 

You should not be surprised by yesterday s  Tuesday  September 1  extremely volatile move lower  The S P 500 has moved back below the correction point of 1917 because the global economy is decelerating and investors are fearful that a rate hiking campaign by the Federal Reserve might be the straw that breaks the U S  camel s spine  And manufacturer dependent sector funds like Materials Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLB  are taking the heaviest hits 

Do I think that a Fed tightening cycle might cause an imminent U S  recession  Not if chairwoman Yellen and other committee members decide upon a sloth like pace of one eighth of a point every third meeting or a  one n done  quarter point that would not be revisited for six months 
Then again  I am not sure that the recession non recession matters as much as others do  Right now  U S  stocks require clarity on rate policy more than they require anything else  The longer it takes for the Fed to provide clarity  the more U S  stocks are likely to struggle

189701,411217,COP,Oil  Was it Really That Bad ,opinion,"U S  stock markets plummet  dragging down the global oil market after a weak reading in the Chinese Manufacturing data  But was the data really that bad  The Chinese official Purchasing Managers  Index did fall into contraction to 49 7 but it was better than the private forecasts  Still with the lack of trust of the Chinese Government numbers  the market took it as a big negative and an excuse to sell off stocks big time  Now oil is getting prepared for another big increase in U S  oil supply  which will further weigh on oil prices  With the biggest three day rally since the first Persian Gulf War  oil has met with an 8 percent pullback 
The American Petroleum Institute also weighed on oil disconnecting its inventories rose by 7 6 million barrels reversing last week s 7 3 million barrel draw  Imports last week were delayed due to pipeline issues and tropical storms  Those supplies are back  As far as the rest of the API data it was really flat  Gas stocks fell 1 million barrels and Distillate stocks up 250 000  The Increase in supply also felt the impact from unplanned refinery outages and that should lead to a drop in refining runs  All in all the EIA version of the reports should be bullish 
The downside of lower oil prices  Company ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  announced it is cutting around 1 810 jobs  or 10 percent of its workforce  The Wall Street Journal report that the biggest proportion of the job cuts will be in North America  ConocoPhillips said it plans to eliminate more than 500 jobs in Houston  where it is based  In a news release  ConocoPhillips said it s making the cuts because the energy industry is in a  dramatic downturn   The Journal says that ConocoPhillips has already cut 1 000 jobs this year and had 18 100 employees on June 30 
That is leading to more talk of a collapse of U S  oil output later this year  with small shale producers under pressure and in debt up to their eyeballs there is more talk of a much larger than expected drop in US oil output 
Venezuela is saying that China to give them a  5 Billion oil they can keep producing oil and in return China will get back oil  Plus Venezuela will meet with Russia to talk about ways to prop up oil prices  Bloomberg Is reporting that Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are at odds with Iran and other OPEC members over whether the organization should include oil price forecasts in its long term strategy report  according to three of the group s delegates  The Gulf kingdom  which has led the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in a battle against rival producers  is seeking to exclude price assumptions from the report  according to the delegates  who asked not to be identified because the document isn t public  The disagreement reflects internal divisions over whether OPEC policy should focus on prices or the stability of the oil market  one of the delegates said

189711,411227,COP,Top Off The Portfolio With Phillips 66,opinion,"Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  was spun off from ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  in 2012 and has done swimmingly since  That is until oil prices started to head lower in July 2014  Since then the stock moved lower  finding a bottom in January this year  That bottom was nearly to the penny a 50  retracement of the move higher 

Since then the price lifted off the bottom and has settled around  80  The last 2 months the price has been rising against support and tightening against resistance at 82 the last two weeks  With the RSI in the bullish zone and the MACD holding positive and near the signal line  a break over 82 would trigger a buy signal 
From that point a target price of 100 comes into play from a Measured Move off of the January bottom  Using 80 as a stop gives a great reward to risk ratio  The company is not expected to report earnings again until July 29th before the market open  so aside from oil prices  the last bit of news to digest is the current dividend  The stock goes ex dividend on the 14th and if it holds over 80 that is a good indication of strength  A close under 79 would spell trouble

189732,411248,COP,Buffett Or Beal   Who s Right About Big Oil ,opinion,"He said Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  remains a  wonderful company  even though      it s current earnings power has been diminished significantly from what it was a year ago  as is true with all oil companies  We have other uses for the money      Warren Buffett  



 You can make some decent loans today that are very well secured   he says   The only place for oil prices to go is up over the medium to long term  Short Term anything can happen  but oil is not going to go down over the next seven years     Andrew Beal




Who are we to judge the investment prowess or possible misstep of either self made man  They are in fact both billionaires many times over   granted  one significantly more than the other  That said  we find the difference of opinion interesting  considering their respective approaches with capital and age  Buffett s unabashedly popular  84  and in the twilight of his legendary investment career  Beal is 62  press shy  and arguably in the sweet spot of growing a private banking empire   Notoriously conservative when it comes to risking his bank s capital  Beal pulled his bets early in 2004  concerned about the already frothy conditions prevalent in the commercial and residential real estate markets  Patiently waiting in the wings as the financial crisis swelled and swallowed the market in 2008  Beal placed his chips and took an early piece of the pot in the distressed debt markets  Today  Beal has his private bank squarely focused on energy companies  who s credit prospects have soured  as regional banks collectively shun financing with the price of oil plummeting over the past year   When oil was  130 a barrel they were all lending like crazy  Now it s  50  and they don t want to make a loan   said Beal   Where public companies now see immanent risk in the energy sector  Beal finds tremendous opportunity  What does he see that they don t  Put simply   relative value  without the condition of satisfying shareholders  immediate concerns  From his perspective  the collapse in the price of oil today offers more opportunity in the energy sector over the long term than  say  the U S  equity markets   I m not predicting a crash  but there will be a lot of disappointed investors   he has said 

Source  
At the end of the day  quarter   or year  what really matters to investors such as Beal or Buffet is the relative value and risk of their invested capital over the long term  If they estimate correctly  they ll outperform  For Buffett  the shear size of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  has made it increasingly difficult to move the needle  Thirty years ago  he would routinely outperform the S P 500 by over 20   With Berkshire Hathaway swelling to the fourth largest publicly traded company in the world   it s closer to 3  these days  All things considered  it s still impressive  And reflecting back over his career in its entirety   it s an unparalleled colossal feat   So why is Buffett divesting his shares in Big Oil as investors such as Beal see great relative value in the sector  For starters  he s managing a very large and complicated conglomerate of interests and will likely use the proceeds to fund new opportunities he s had better luck with in the past   such as the acquisition of Kraft  NASDAQ KRFT  by Heinz  Over the past several years  Buffett s hot hand has been twice rebuffed by his investments in Big Oil  buying ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  near the peak in oil prices in 2008 and selling that investment for a substantial loss in 2009  We know at that time he used the proceeds to help fund the BNSF Railway acquisition that went on to generate billions in profits for Berkshire  Today  he s likely looking to do the same by exiting Exxon with basically a marginal profit from his 2013 investment and putting that capital to work in an area he has had greater success with in the past   Will it bear the same fruit that the BNSF Railway acquisition provided Berkshire shareholders  From our point of view   not likely  When it comes to the recent Kraft acquisition  Heinz is paying top dollar for a company that generates a modest return   even if they succeed at lifting the same operating margin to what Heinz currently enjoys   6  post tax return on capital   Moreover  the public equity investment in Kraft will very much be at risk to the whims of the U S  equity markets  which from a variety of metrics is richly valued relative to world indexes and other asset classes   especially commodities   Despite the carnage witnessed in the commodities market over the past year  we ve gravitated to the relative value opened up in some of the hard asset sectors   such as oil and precious metals  To a large extent  we approach precious metals as simply a higher beta emotional proxy of the same investment thesis  A thesis that is either propelled ahead or anchored to inflation expectations and greatly motivated by trends in the dollar and real yields  With the U S  dollar index recently stretched to a relative performance extreme  see here   and with inflation beginning to move out of the trough it has remained in over the past two years  the long term prospects for hard commodities remains extremely attractive in our opinion   A relative performance chart that frames what we suspect will be shrewd timing on the part of Beal   and which we have closely followed over the past year  is the SPX Oil ratio  Our general impression  reflected by the ratio  is that markets are currently traveling away from a cyclical pivot from the disinflationary trend that began in 2011  to another reflationary upturn   As shown below in the chart  there is a broad asymmetrical structure in the ratio  defined by the blowoff moves in 1985 1986 and 1998 1999  Both moves were completed in market environments where equities strongly outperformed commodities  as oil prices collapsed   reinforcing a powerful positive disinflationary feedback in equities 

In 1986  the oil market stabilized after the supply driven decline was absorbed and the Fed eased aggressively in the first half of that year  By the end of 1986  oil prices had risen nearly 70 percent above the lows from late March  The relative performance between equities and oil would remain rangebound over the next decade  as the ratio worked its way higher  ultimately breaking out in 1997  Over the past several months  we have contrasted the comparative performance and price structures of the 1985 1986 supply driven decline  the 1998 1999 secular blowoff and the large demand driven crash in oil in 2008 2009  Although we firmly agree with Beal that anything can happen over the short term  from a variety of perspectives  oil appears to be moving constructively out of another major low and away from the cyclical disinflationary trend that had broadly worked against the commodity markets since 2011   In fact  from a comparative perspective  with the 1985 1986 blowoff  the current market appears to be completing the pivot faster than we initially estimated  with the ratio breaking down sharply below the lows from late January  as of last week  All things considered   and as revealed in previous notes   with insights drawn from the 1940s market environment  we are more inclined to speculate that the ratio will trend lower as it did from the 1998 1999 pivot  as the equity market rally cools in the U S  and commodities take the outperformance baton ",2015-04-20,Erik Swarts,https://www.investing.com/analysis/buffett-or-beal-place-your-bets-with-oil-248910,248910
189757,411273,COP,Energy ETFs In Focus As Oil Hits Q4 Profits  Hurts Capex,opinion,"The fourth quarter results from the big U S  oil companies like Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  are now out  As expected  the oil price collapse took a toll on their profitability  prompting them to cut capital expenses in order to conserve cash balance  This has become the order of the day  especially as the oil price plunge is not showing any sign of respite 
While XOM and CVX beat our earnings estimates  COP missed  On the revenue front  Chevron and ConocoPhillips surpassed our estimates 
Earnings for Big Oil Companies in Focus
The largest U S  oil company  Exxon Mobil  reported earnings per share of  1 56 that strongly outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 33 but declined substantially from the year ago earnings of  1 91  Total revenue fell 21 3  year over year to  87 28 billion  well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  92 68 billion  As the company s cash flow in the fourth quarter fell to the lowest level since 2009  Exxon Mobil cut its share repurchase program by 70  to just  1 billion for the ongoing quarter   Earnings at Chevron  which trails Exxon Mobil  came in at  1 85 per share  strongly outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 67 but deteriorating from the year ago earnings of  2 57  Revenues dropped 17 9  year over year to  46 09 billion and were much above our estimate of  33 28 billion  Chevron suspended its share buyback program and slashed its capital spending by 13  to  35 billion for this year  Unlike the other two  the third largest U S  oil company ConocoPhillips missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents while revenues of  11 85 billion outpaced our estimate of  11 73 billion  However  earnings and revenues were down from  1 40 and  13 99 billion  respectively  This company also followed its rival and cut its capital spending by an additional 15  after reducing it 20  last month 
Market Impact
Despite the shrinking profits and capex cuts  shares of XOM  CVX and COP are up 1 8   2 3   and 5 1   respectively  over the past three trading sessions  This has also sent energy ETFs in the green territory as well  in particular the funds having large allocations to these big oil giants  Below  we have highlighted some funds that have gained nearly 4  in the same period following the big oil earnings and would be in focus for the coming days iShares U S  Energy ETF  NYSE IYE  This ETF tracks the Dow Jones U S  Oil   Gas Index  giving investors exposure to the broad energy space  The fund holds 93 stocks in its basket with AUM of over  1 1 billion and average daily volume of more than 1 million shares  The product charges 43 bps in fees per year from investors 
Exxon Mobil and Chevron occupy the top two positions in the basket and take the bigger chunk of assets at 22 88  and 11 98   respectively  ConocoPhillips on the other hand make up for the fourth position at 4 79   From a sector perspective  oil  gas and consumable fuels make up for nearly 81 3  share while oil equipment   services takes 17 7  share Vanguard Energy ETF  NYSE VDE  This fund manages nearly  3 3 billion asset base and provides exposure to a basket of 164 energy stocks by tracking the MSCI US Investable Market Energy 25 50 Index  The product sees a solid volume of more than 475 000 shares and charges 12 bps in annual fees  read  Sector ETFs to Avoid for Q4 Earnings Season   Exxon and Chevron are the top two firms with 22 7  and 12 1  allocation  respectively  while COP is the fourth firm making up for 4 8  share  Though the product is skewed toward the integrated oil   gas sector with 39 7  of assets  exploration and production  and equipment services provide a nice mix in the portfolio with double digit exposure Energy Select Sector SPDR  ARCA XLE  This is the largest and most popular ETF in the energy space with AUM of  11 7 billion and average daily volume of 24 5 million shares per day  Expense ratio came in at 0 15   The fund follows the S P Energy Select Sector Index and holds 45 securities in its basket  Here again  XOM and CVX occupy the top two spots with 16 48  and 13 056  share  respectively  while COP takes the sixth spot at 3 78   In terms of industrial exposure  oil  gas   consumable fuels accounts for nearly 81 7  of the portfolio while energy equipment   services takes the remainder 
Will This Trend Continue 
These gains seem to be short lived given that the biggest strike since 1980 at nine refineries in the U S  will likely curtail crude processing adding to the global supply glut  This will likely push oil prices and energy stocks down  Currently  10  of the U S  refining capacity has been affected and if the strike turns to a full blown crisis  it could threaten about two thirds of the total refining capacity  indicating more pain for the commodity and the energy stocks  Added to the woes is the fact that the three in focus stocks have an unfavorable Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell  and fall in the bad industry category with the Zacks Industry Rank in the bottom 3  or 4   This underscores the pessimistic outlook for the overall energy space at least for the near term ",2015-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/energy-etfs-in-focus-as-oil-hits-q4-profits,-hurts-capex-240716",240716
189776,411292,COP,Gissen And Berol  Welcome To The Golden Era Of Oil And Gas,opinion,"Few things in life are certain  but Encompass Fund managers Malcolm Gissen and Marshall Berol are convinced that the world needs much more energy  and that this is great news for oil and gas companies and their investors  In this interview with The Energy Report  Gissen and Berol highlight eight oil and gas producers with potential for dynamic expansion  and two premium companies in the burgeoning sector of oil and gas services 
The Energy Report  In your May 31 annual report  you wrote   The most important change we have made to improve performance has been to increase the  Encompass  Fund s exposure to the energy sector  while reducing exposure to metals   Why have you done this 
Malcolm Gissen  We believe that we are now living in a golden era of oil and gas  We believe that demand for oil and gas will continue to grow faster than supply  This provides a unique opportunity to invest in companies that do not have a great deal of risk  yet boast many attractive characteristics  They are expanding production  They are expanding cash flows  They are improving exploration technology  They are reducing expenses  Internal rates of return  IRRs  often go over 100  
TER  How are the investments in the Encompass Fund allocated by sector 
MG  Oil and gas companies comprise about 20 25   Oil and gas field services are 2 5 4   and natural gas processing companies are about 2 7   Precious metals are a little under 20   We re not solely a commodity fund  however  We ve also got technology and biotech companies  as well as homebuilding  healthcare  and real estate investment trust  REIT  companies  among other sectors  represented 
TER  How much must oil and gas supply grow to meet demand 
MG  In  The Outlook for Energy  A View to 2040   Exxon Mobil Corp   Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM    in its annual report for 2013  predicted that global energy demand will grow about 35   driven by growth in developing nations  By 2040  Exxon expects nine of the world s 20 largest cities will be in India and China  and that these two nations alone will account for more than 50  of the increase in global energy demand  Even as fuel efficiency increases and technologies improve  oil will remain the No  1 fuel type  with natural gas supplanting coal as No  2 
The International Energy Agency  IEA  published a special report in June on this subject  The IEA projects that spending to meet energy needs will increase from  1 6 trillion   1 6T  in 2014 to  2T per year by 2035  The IEA report estimates that the total spent to meet the world s growing need for energy will be  48T by 2035  Less than half of that spending will be in developing new energy supply  most will be to replace declining production from existing oil and gas fields 
This bolsters our belief that investment portfolios should increase exposure to oil and gas  and helps explains why the Encompass Fund produced a 17 4  return as of the end of August 
TER  What will be the primary source of new supply 
MG  The IEA forecasts that North America the U S  and Canada will provide most of the new supply into the 2020s  After that  there will be more dependence on Middle Eastern oil and gas  according to the IEA 
Marshall Berol  I would add that whatever your views about climate change  the fact of that matter is that governments around the world are moving away from coal  China  for instance  is moving toward more use of natural gas  particularly around Beijing  because of pollution  China has announced that it will be closing almost 2 000 small coal mines  And after the Fukushima earthquake  use of nuclear power to generate electricity has become politically troublesome 
TER  Isn t an increased dependence on oil and gas from the Middle East troublesome  The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria  ISIS  army has already occupied much of Iraq and has moved into Kurdistan 
MG  Middle Eastern politics have become increasingly volatile  violent and unpredictable  We think it unlikely the jihadists are going to disappear  no matter how strongly the West responds to them  They are active in Lebanon  Syria  Iraq  Pakistan  Yemen  Libya and Nigeria  among other oil producing countries  and present a constant threat to oil supply in both the Middle East and Africa 
TER  Even as the Middle East burns  the West and Russia are ramping up sanctions against each other 
MG  Vladimir Putin seems intent on increasing instability in Eastern Europe  not just in Ukraine  and that impact is likely to grow  In 2013  the U S  exported more than  1 5T of goods  and less than 10  of that was either crude oil or petroleum products  That same year  Russian exports of crude oil  petroleum products and natural gas amounted to more than two thirds of total exports  and composed more than 50 percent of the Russian government s total revenue  Much of these exports go to Europe  30  of Europe s natural gas comes from Russia  There is a real threat that this supply could disappear  If that happens  natural gas prices will likely rise  and we ll see pressure on North America to replace the Russians as suppliers of natural gas for Europe 
TER  Do you believe in the peak oil theory 
MG  No  for two basic reasons  First  we re finding more oil  and a number of those discoveries are of very large reserves  such as those off the coast of Brazil  Mexico  Russia and Australia  among other places  Oil is also being found in more remote places  often very deep in the ocean  But it is there  and it will be produced  particularly with oil selling at  90 to  110 a barrel   90 110 bbl   Right now West Texas Intermediate  Oil  at around  94 bbl  is very profitable for oil companies  We expect prices to remain in this range perhaps even go higher for some time 
The second reason Marshall and I don t believe in peak oil is that technological advances are being made that are increasing production  as exploration companies capture oil and gas from existing reservoirs that had eluded them in the past  Horizontal drilling and fracking are making that possible  We re seeing more horizontal drilling than vertical drilling now in the U S  and Canada 
MB  That said  the technologies being utilized to increase production horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  fracking  are more expensive than drilling was just 50 or 75 years ago  when you punched a hole in the ground and the oil came gushing out  These increased expenses  as well as a tightening of supply demand  should result in a continued rise in oil and gas prices 
TER  After the 2008 economic crisis  we saw a drop in energy demand and a concomitant drop in prices  Should economic growth stall or fall again  won t demand and prices fall with it 
MG  There are two answers to this question  The first is that we re not traders  We re investors  We re looking at what will happen over the next 6 to 36 months  We also believe that the demand for energy in developing countries like China and India  and in Third World countries  assures that world demand will outstrip supply during any reasonable period over the next 5 10 years  There will  of course  be economic slowdowns  but we think they won t last more than a few quarters
MB  Another factor that should be mentioned is the increasing size of the middle class worldwide  In China  we re watching 250 300 million  250 300M  people move from rural areas to cities  and consume more energy  They want dishwashers  refrigerators  washers and dryers  and cars  We re seeing the same in India  as it builds infrastructure  A number of African countries are also demonstrating improvements in living standards 
TER  You have noted that because of increased horizontal drilling and fracking  the U S  is importing less oil every year  and have argued that soon oil imports will be unnecessary  Are horizontal drilling and fracking a short term boost to U S  energy supply  or is this a bigger story 
MG  Fracking is not a short term solution  but a permanent one  It is here to stay  The technology gets better and better  increasing oil and gas production and having a smaller impact on the environment  Proper regulation should ensure against environmental concerns  such as oil getting into the water table 
MB  Horizontal drilling and fracking are increasing production globally  not merely in the U S  and Canada  We think this trend will continue  Further technological advances cannot be guaranteed  of course  but we certainly don t discount them 
TER  How much of a premium do you award oil and gas companies already in production 
MG  We look more favorably on investing in companies in production  as opposed to those still in the discovery  exploration and development stages  With regard to oil and gas companies  we like those that are increasing production  cash flow and profitability  whether due to acquisitions of new lands or companies  or both  We are looking for companies that are very profitable  that have access to all the capital they will need to continue fast paced growth  that are applying newer technology to production of oil and gas  and that have experienced management teams with prior successes 
TER  In the mining industry  junior explorers find the metals  To what extent is increased oil production driven by oil juniors 
MG  Juniors drive production to a significant extent  Let me clarify  The large  integrated companies  such as Chevron Corp   NYSE CVX  or Exxon Mobil  produce enormous quantities of oil and gas  and are only interested in very large projects  In 2013  Exxon produced over 18 million barrels  18 MMbbl  of oil equivalent  oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  per day  and had revenues of  438 billion  Exxon will only explore if the project has very large potential 
The juniors produce less than 10 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  10 Mboe d   but the juniors in which we are invested have the potential to increase that by 20 35  per year  If they are successful and most are their stock prices should react accordingly  In some cases the juniors are exploring areas not known to have produced oil and gas  They can do this with greater dexterity and at far lower costs than the large companies  When the juniors find oil and gas in these areas  we often see larger companies come into those basins  buying companies and driving up valuations 
In other cases  the majors sell junior companies properties that  to the majors  may seem marginal because they don t appear to have enormous resources at the time  If the junior companies prove the potential of these properties  the majors can always buy back the properties  or simply buy the juniors involved  Cash flows are so enormous in this industry  and bank lines so available  that it is not difficult for large companies to make these acquisitions 
MB  Whether it s energy  mining or pharmaceuticals  the larger companies are less innovative  less creative  and more risk averse  It is the smaller companies that are willing to take the risks 
Some years ago  the oil majors in the U S  and Canada sold many of their enormous land holdings and leases to smaller  more nimble companies  It is the latter that made the technological advances in exploration and development we ve seen in the last 5 10 years  Now  the majors are coming back to the areas they had gotten out of 
TER  Junior mining companies have been hobbled by funding shortages for more than three years  Does this situation pertain to junior oil companies 
MG  Not to the same degree  by any means  The primary reason for the difference is that junior mining companies typically have no revenues  let alone profits  Junior oil and gas companies likely do have production growing production  They have increasing cash flow  which gives them the ability to finance their own growth 
TER  Which junior Canadian producers do you rate most highly  particularly with regard to potential expansion 
MG  The question of potential expansion is easy to address  They re all expanding  The ones we prefer are expanding faster and more efficiently  In client accounts  we re invested in nine or 10 Canadian oil and gas companies  and in one very good company in the U S  A number of these Canadian oil and gas companies pay very attractive dividends 
A company we think should be in every investor s portfolio is DeeThree Exploration Ltd   TO DTX   an oil weighted name in the Canadian mid cap space that has grown production for 11 consecutive quarters  That derisks the investment  as skeptical investors see DeeThree s success  We just met with the company s CEO  and he confirmed that DeeThree intends to grow production by about 1 Mboe d per quarter for the next few years  The company has the resources to accomplish this for a long period of time  DeeThree has been realizing exceptional results from its Belly River wells  which should continue to be the growth engine for the company  Growth should also come from its Alberta Bakken wells  The stock looks cheap when compared to its peers  It has some of the best wells and the biggest production from any initial well drilling in Canada this year 
TER  Which other Canadian companies do you like 
MG  When we look at energy companies  we examine their relative oil and gas production  the likely growth over the next one to two years  cost control and profitability 
Natural gas prices have backed off a bit and are not particularly high  as production has increased significantly the last few years  largely due to increased fracking  We think that natural gas prices are likely to go higher in the longer term  Oil prices look very attractive now  and we think they will go higher as well 
Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd   TO TVE  is a junior oil focused exploration and production  E P  company with exposure to two compelling plays in Canada  The company s production is expanding as it increases its capital budget  The company continues to outperform the expectations of analysts and investors  and has excellent management  We see the potential for growth in excess of 40  over the next 12 months 
Rock Energy Inc   TO RE  is deeply undervalued and a takeout candidate  There is much to like about Rock  The company has low declining wells  adequate capital and a clean balance sheet  all of which have helped it grow production  Rock is also enjoying internal rates of return of over 100  on a good number of its wells 
TER  Rock sold off its heavy oil acreage and has become instead a light to medium oil producer  What s the significance of that 
MG  It means better pricing  I think the company s decision will pay off 
TER  Is there another company 
MG  Bellatrix Exploration Ltd  TO BXE  is a deeply discounted Canadian E P that has been among the least expensive small mid cap Canadian E Ps  The company has grown production significantly over the past few years  about 65  of production is natural gas   as it has attracted overseas partners to fund some of its exploration on very favorable terms  In raising money recently  Bellatrix received bad advice from its banks and had to cut back the size of the raise  It was punished for that  and the stock declined  With about 40 Mboe d in production in 2014  and production increasing in 2015  we think that patient investors will be rewarded longer term 
The four companies we ve mentioned are all in client accounts  and we believe they are undervalued  even as they re expanding production and revenues while profitability grows  They have enormous resources and enough locations to drill for 10 20 more years  This is what makes the Canadian E P subsector particularly attractive 
TER  Could you explain the difference between development drilling and exploration drilling 
MG  The four companies we ve mentioned are developmental drillers  They drill where there are known pools of oil and or gas  and hit close to 100  of the wells they drill  Thus there is not great risk of drilling a dry hole  Exploratory drilling is riskier because you are drilling where oil and gas has not been discovered  but it has much higher upside 
TER  Which Canadian exploration driller do you like 
MG   Manitok Energy Inc   TO MEI  is an undervalued company that would be an attractive investment for a high risk high return investor  The company recently announced production was below guidance due to third party delays  infrastructure   The stock was hammered and has not recovered  even though drilling results are exceeding expectations  We recently met with the company CEO  and he indicated that the problems were behind the company  Investors willing to wait 6 18 months should do quite well in Manitok 
TER  Aside from the U S  and Canada  which region is most prospective 
MB  South America has two very significant oil and gas basins  One is in the Colombia Ecuador Peru area  and the other is in Argentina  We have stayed away from Argentina because its government has been distinctly unfriendly to both the energy and mining industries 
With the decline of the drug wars and a more business friendly government  Colombia has greatly expanded its oil and gas production over the past dozen years  There s a lot of development going on there 
TER  What s your favorite South American oil and gas producer 
MB  One company that has done quite well for the Encompass Fund is Canacol Energy Ltd   TO CNE   It now has 12 producing wells  and production is about two thirds oil and one third natural gas  Q2 14 showed a 47  production increase year over year  YOY  
Canacol does a lot of drilling in its existing production areas  and a lot of exploration in adjoining areas  It has the financial and managerial ability to handle growth  It s a solid midsize now  with about a US 522M market cap  and it has some big partners  including Exxon  ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc  BA RDS  
TER  How do you rate Asia for potential expansion 
MB  Our experience with Asia has not been all that positive  We invested years ago in a small exploration and development company called Continental Energy  CPPXF OTCBB   It was partnered in an Indonesian project with a Chinese company  Kunlun Energy  HK 0135   The Chinese company owned 70  of the project  with Continental and another company owning the other 30   They were being carried into production  but the Chinese and Indonesian governments had differing opinions about drilling methods  and the Chinese company pulled out of the project  Canacol also has bid on some projects in Malaysia  with the state owned company  Petronas  but this process is taking an extraordinarily long time 
So Continental has shifted its focus to oil services  and bought a significant minority in two Norwegian companies  One s a construction and oil service platform maintenance company  and the second is in engineering consulting  We think this was a very good move on Continental s part  Continental is literally a penny stock  but it has performed far better this year than previously  We re very optimistic about its future 
TER  Oil and gas servicing is a rapidly growing sector  What other companies do you like there 
MB  Energy services are very attractive to us because  as oil and companies have increased production  they require increased services from the related industries  engineering  pipeline construction  maintenance  disposal  water handling  etc 
Another good size holding that we have in the Encompass Fund is GreenHunter Energy Inc   AMEX GRH   It has also shifted its focus  in this case to the transportation  handling and disposal of the water and other fluids involved in fracking  Fracking pushes a lot of water into the ground  Most of that water comes back up  and needs treatment and disposal  GreenHunter s revenues increased 18  in the previous quarter year over year  The company is still not that large  but we think there s a lot of room for growth  GreenHunter operates primarily in the Appalachian region  in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays  and in the Bakken Shale of North Dakota 
The company is in the final stages of permitting to barge liquids on the Ohio River system  which appears to be far more economically and environmentally beneficial than trucking these liquids up and down the roads 
TER  Of the companies that we ve discussed  which are your favorites 
MG  Which of our children do we like the best  That s a very difficult question to answer  I can say that Canacol Energy and Continental Energy are among our largest holdings  as is Magnum Hunter Resources Corp   NYSE MHR   Magnum is the largest individual holding in our mutual fund 
Magnum had some property in Canada and in the Texas shale plays  which the company has sold off  It now concentrates on oil and gas production and exploration in the Marcellus and Utica areas  and has been very successful  The CEO  Gary Evans  previously built up another company also named Magnum Hunter  He sold that several years ago for about  1 2B  and started a new E P company under the same name  He is an extremely knowledgeable oil and gas executive  with a very experienced and knowledgeable team around him 
TER  How much consolidation in the oil and gas industry can we expect in the near future  and which companies do you see as possible takeover targets 
MG  There are many companies with lots of cash  and with interest rates as low as they are  it is much easier than it has been for years for midsize and larger companies to make acquisitions  We have seen many acquisitions of companies and of land in 2014  and we should see a number of significant acquisitions over the next couple of years 
One of the companies in some of our client accounts was Crocotta Energy Inc   CTA TSX   which had very aggressively expanded production  As a result  it was just acquired at a very nice premium by Long Run Exploration Ltd   TO LRE   Several of the companies we ve mentioned today are possible acquisition targets  Rock or Bellatrix could be acquired by one of the larger Canadian or American companies  because they have very attractive resources and have derisked their investments 
MB  We don t think that a proper investment philosophy is buying a company because it s going to be acquired  Having said that  buyouts are an attractive way to go when all the metrics are there  properties  finances and good management teams

189777,411293,COP,If You Believe That Collapsing Oil Prices Are Good For The Economy   ,opinion,"Are much lower oil prices good news for the U S  economy   Only if you like collapsing capital expenditures  rising unemployment and a potential financial implosion on Wall Street   Yes  lower gasoline prices are good news for the middle class   I certainly would rather pay two dollars for a gallon of gas than four dollars   But in order to have money to fill up your vehicle you have got to have an income first   And since the last recession  the energy sector has been the number one creator of good jobs in the U S  economy by far   Barack Obama loves to stand up and take credit for the fact that the employment picture in this country has been improving slightly  but without the energy industry boom  unemployment would be through the roof   And now that the  energy boom  is rapidly becoming an  energy bust   what will happen to the struggling U S  economy as we head into 2015 
At the start of this article I mentioned that much lower oil prices would result in  collapsing capital expenditures  
If you do not know what a  capital expenditure  is  the following is a definition that comes from  

 Funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property  industrial buildings or equipment  This type of outlay is made by companies to maintain or increase the scope of their operations  These expenditures can include everything from repairing a roof to building a brand new factory  

Needless to say  this kind of spending is very good for an economy   It builds infrastructure  it creates jobs and it is an investment in the future 
In recent years  energy companies have been pouring massive amounts of money into capital expenditures   In fact  the energy sector currently accounts for about a third of all capital expenditures in the United States  

US private investment spending is usually  15  of US GDP or  2 8trn now  This investment consists of  1 6trn spent annually on equipment and software   700bn on non residential construction and a bit over  500bn on residential  Equipment and software is 35  technology and communications  25 30  is industrial equipment for energy  utilities and agriculture  15  is transportation equipment  with remaining 20 25  related to other industries or intangibles  Non residential construction is 20  oil and gas producing structures and 30  is energy related in total  We estimate global investment spending is 20  of S P EPS or 12  from US  The Energy sector is responsible for a third of S P 500 capex 

These companies make these investments because they believe that there are big profits to be made 
Unfortunately  when the price of oil crashes those investments become unprofitable and capital expenditures start getting slashed almost immediately 
For example  the budget for 2015 at ConocoPhillips has already been reduced  

ConocoPhillips is one of the bigger shale players  And its decision to slash its budget for next year by 20  is raising eyebrows  The company said the new target reflects lower spending on major projects as well as  unconventional plays   Despite the expectation that others will follow  it doesn t mean U S  shale oil production is dead  Just don t expect a surge in spending like in recent years 

And  is reporting that the number of new well permits for the industry as a whole plunged by an astounding 40 percent during the month of November 

Plunging oil prices sparked a drop of almost 40 percent in new well permits issued across the United States in November  in a sudden pause in the growth of the U S  shale oil and gas boom that started around 2007 
Data provided exclusively to Reuters on Tuesday by industry data firm Drilling Info Inc showed 4 520 new well permits were approved last month  down from 7 227 in October 

If the price of oil stays this low or continues dropping  this is just the beginning 
Meanwhile  the flow of good jobs that this industry has been producing is also likely to start drying up 
According to the Perryman Group  the energy sector currently supports  

According to a new study  investments in oil and gas exploration and production generate substantial economic gains  as well as other benefits such as increased energy independence  The Perryman Group estimates that the industry as a whole generates an economic stimulus of almost  1 2 trillion in gross product each year  as well as more than 9 3 million permanent jobs across the nation 
The ripple effects are everywhere  If you think about the role of oil in your life  it is not only the primary source of many of our fuels  but is also critical to our lubricants  chemicals  synthetic fibers  pharmaceuticals  plastics  and many other items we come into contact with every day  The industry supports almost 1 3 million jobs in manufacturing alone and is responsible for almost  1 2 trillion in annual gross domestic product  If you think about the law  accounting  and engineering firms that serve the industry  the pipe  drilling equipment  and other manufactured goods that it requires  and the large payrolls and their effects on consumer spending  you will begin to get a picture of the enormity of the industry 

And these are good paying jobs   They aren t eight dollar part time jobs down at your local big box retailer   These are jobs that comfortably support middle class families   These are precisely the kinds of jobs that we cannot afford to lose 
In recent years  there has been a noticeable economic difference between areas of the country where energy is being produced and where energy is not being produced 
Since December 2007  a total of s have been gained in shale oil states 
Meanwhile  a total of  have been lost in non shale oil states 
So what happens now that the shale oil boom is turning into a bust 
That is a very good question 
Even more ominous is what an oil price collapse could mean for our financial system 
The last time the price of oil declined   there was a financial meltdown on Wall Street and we experienced the deepest recession that we have seen since the days of the Great Depression 
And now many fear that this collapse in the price of oil could trigger another financial panic 
According to Citigroup  the energy sector now accounts for 17 percent of the high yield bond market 
J P  Morgan says that it is actually 18 percent 
In any event  the reality of the matter is that the health of these  junk bonds  is absolutely critical to our financial system   And according to Deutsche Bank  if these bonds start defaulting it could  

Based on recent stress tests of subprime borrowers in the energy sector in the US produced by Deutsche Bank  should the price of US crude fall by a further 20pc to  60 per barrel  it could result in up to a 30pc default rate among B and CCC rated high yield US borrowers in the industry  West Texas Intermediate crude is currently trading at multi year lows of around  75 per barrel  down from  107 per barrel in June 


 A shock of that magnitude could be sufficient to trigger a broader high yield market default cycle  if materialized   warn Deutsche strategists Oleg Melentyev and Daniel Sorid in their report 

If the price of oil stays at this level or continues to go down  it is inevitable that we will start to see some of these junk bonds go bad 
In fact   recently stated that one industry analyst believes that up to 40 percent of all energy junk bonds could eventually go into default 

The junk bonds  or noninvestment rated bonds  of energy companies are also beginning to see heavy selling as investors start to worry that drillers could one day default on these bonds  Those defaults could get so bad  according to one analyst  that up to 40  of all energy junk bonds go into default over the next few years if oil prices don t recover 

That would be a total nightmare for Wall Street 
And of course bond defaults would only be part of the equation   As I wrote about the other day  a crash in junk bonds is  
In addition  plunging oil prices could end up absolutely destroying the banks that are holding enormous amounts of energy derivatives   This is something that I recently covered in  and  
As you read this  there are five  too big to fail  banks that each have more than 40 trillion dollars in exposure to derivatives   Of course only a small fraction of that total exposure is made up of energy derivatives  but a small fraction of 40 trillion dollars is still a massive amount of money 
These derivatives trades are largely unregulated  and  that they are likely to be at the heart of the coming financial collapse 

No one understands the derivative risk positions of the Too Big To Fail Banks  JP Morgan Chase  Citigroup  Bank of America  Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley  There is presently no way to measure the risks involved in the leverage  quantity of collateral  or stability of counter parties for these major institutions  To me personally they are big black holes capable of potential wrack and ruin  Without access to confidential internal data about these risky derivative positions the regulators cannot react in a timely and measured fashion to block the threat to financial stability  according to a National Bureau of Economic Research study 

So do we have any hope 
Yes  if oil prices start going back up  much of what you just read about can be averted 
Unfortunately  that does not seem likely any time soon   Even though U S  energy companies are cutting back on capital expenditures  most of them are still actually projecting an increase in production for 2015   Here is one example  

Continental  the biggest holder of drilling rights in the Bakken  last month said 2015 output will grow between 23 percent and 29 percent even after shelving plans to allocate more money to exploration 

Higher levels of production will just drive the price of oil even lower 
At this point  Morgan Stanley is saying that the price of oil could plummet as low as  next year 
If that happens  it would be absolutely catastrophic to the most important industry in the United States 
In turn  that would be absolutely catastrophic for the economy as a whole 
So don t let anyone tell you that much lower oil prices are  good  for the economy 
That is just a bunch of nonsense

189797,411313,COP,Will Europe Ever Catch Up With The US In Shale Gas Success ,opinion,"If recent experience is anything to go by no  not ever 
Europe s most promising region in Poland was widely expected to lead the way  Regulation was lighter than in markets like Germany which has a moratorium in place and France where significant probable reserves have been ruled out by all major political parties in the country with an outright ban 
Less dense population areas in Poland were also expected to reduce the not in my backyard response seen in the UK  in particular  but according to a BBC report out of 30 to 40 wells planned for 2013  to date there is just one well producing enough gas to be economically viable 
Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   Talisman Energy Inc   NYSE TLM   Total  NYSE TOT  and Marathon  TA MARA  have all pulled out  while Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and San Leon Energy Plc  LONDON SLEN  are persevering with the latter recently announcing it has a vertical that has proven to be encouraging enough that San Leon will proceed to horizontal drilling to further test the resource 
What has caused this disappointment  Initially  government policy was unnecessarily punitive  not environmentally but in terms of taxation and local collaboration  The main reason  however  according to ExxonMobil is the geology is different in Europe and the technology has not proven as effective as it has in the US 
Sure  the biggest hurdles to adoption in Europe  remain environmental and public opposition  Environmental concerns around contamination of groundwater and disposal of wastewater require research to quantify the real risks  research the EU has not undertaken and in the current climate the oil majors seem unlikely to take it on 
Public opposition is  in part  based on uncertain science and the difference in mineral rights in Europe from the US  In Europe mineral rights are owned by the state  whereas in the US they are owned by the landowner  creating a much greater incentive for landowners to allow hydraulic fracturing or  fracking  on their land 
In all probability  no place will likely  mirror the US s success  In terms of reserves  China holds the largest according to the US Energy Administration at 1 115 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable resources  Argentina is next with 802 and Algeria third with 707  Argentina s treatment of foreign oil firms like Repsol will dissuade investment in the short term but over time may prove attractive depending on the geology  Likewise  Algeria and Mexico at 545 may also qualify for the low density loose regulation argument  although as with China scant water resources in some areas are proving a major headache for other forms of mining 
China s centrally controlled economy probably has the best chance if it can entice  sufficient foreign expertise and gear up its rig construction industry  already significant  to take on the task of domestic development  Even more than in the US  collection infrastructure will be required promising rich rewards for tubular product steel mills in the years to come if the technology works effectively  The largest hurdle may be water availability  the country has the right geology  far fewer regulatory obstacles and  so far  relatively little public opposition but the main issue is water  the BBC says  Much of China s shale reserves are located in the northwest of the country  which is extremely arid 
After all the hype  the US may yet prove the sole major beneficiary of shale gas  at least in this decade  as others fail to match the mix of entrepreneurial talent and technological sophistication to overcome opposition and produce sufficient quantities to meaningfully impact prices

189798,411314,COP,Playing ConocoPhillips For A Bounce ,opinion,"The refining stocks had been building pressure to the upside until the market turned lower last week  They were getting a bit overbought so maybe this is a good thing to reset their risk and get ready for the next leg up  One in particular in the space  CononcoPhillips  NYSE COP   seems to be resetting well  But when will it stop falling 

The chart above shows that the RSI  a measure of momentum  has pulled back substantially on this weekly timeframe  and the price is near the 20 week  or 100 day  SMA  But it is hard to buy this stock with the long red candle from last week looming out there and support down near the 50 week SMA and the prior peak at 74  It would be a lot nicer to buy it on a bounce there  But what if it does not get there  Missing an opportunity to buy it at 79 would be horrible if it moved back higher  So what to do 

The options market gives you an opportunity to participate in an upward bounce without any risk on the downside until that 50 week SMA  Using something called a Call Spread Risk Reversal  you can get in now and not ave to wait to see what the stock price does  A Call Spread Risk Reversal is just a combination of options  The Call Spread is a long Call paired with a short Call of a higher Strike and the same Expiry  This is where the upside participation comes from  Selling an out of the money  OTM  Put makes it the Risk Reversal  as it adds downside risk  For this stock at November 82 5 90 Call Spread will give  7 50 of upside  This was priced at about  1 60 as I write this  And for the downside  selling a November 72 5 Put  priced at  1 22  brings the price down to less than 40 cents  It does expose you to owning the stock below 72 50 but isn t that where you liked to own it anyway

189815,411331,COP,Patient Contrarians  The Natural Gas Market Isn t What It Seems,opinion,Maybe it s the gloomy Seattle weather that has made investment manager Jim Hansen and his son and partner  Kevin  at Ravenna Capital Management immune to oil and gas industry hype about the supposed U S  shale gas  revolution   More likely it is thorough research focused on making their clients money and keeping that money out of harm s way  The Hansens are patient contrarian investors whose time horizon is generally several years  They can t help you if you want advice on next week s or next month s natural gas price  In fact  they re not sure anyone can reliably help you with that  So they focus on much longer term trends  and they think they ve spotted one in the U S  natural gas market  About a year ago when domestic natural gas prices hit levels reminiscent of the 1990s  they began to move their clients into natural gas related investments  Amid the media hype about cheap natural gas for decades  they saw a different reality  They believed that   which now provide about 40 percent of U S  production  were combining with rapid reductions in the drilling of new wells in a way that would eventually cause falling production and sharply rising prices  They weren t exactly clear on the timing  But  with their patient strategy  they just needed to sit and wait for what they felt was the inevitable   We are long term investors and include investments that allow us to get paid to wait   Jim Hansen said  referring to securities that generate regular payouts to holders  A year after their call  they have seemingly been vindicated as natural gas rose from a low of  1 82 per thousand cubic feet in April 2012 to over  4 currently  Prices might dip again  Jim Hansen added  but for long term investors the trend still looks good  What clues led the Hansens to their contrarian views  Kevin explained in one phrase  Look at what the industry does  not what it says  While hyping the future of natural gas  the industry was doing the following  Organizing their natural gas gathering systems into master limited partnerships and selling them to investors Selling producing acreage to foreign investors who  believing the hype  generally overpaid And when gullible foreign investors got wise  selling land packages at rock bottom prices when many companies were desperate to raise cash to meet their debt obligations Despite industry protestations to the contrary  all these things told Kevin Hansen that the industry  could not have been profitable   His views were eventually verified by none other than Rex Tillerson  CEO of ExxonMobil Corp   XOM   who    We are losing our shirts  on natural gas    Just recently one chastened industry executive  Matt Fox  ConocoPhillips   COP  executive vice president of exploration and production  let slip what price level might entice companies to increase U S  natural gas drilling again  During  with analysts he had this exchange with analyst Blake Fernandez  Fernandez  Okay  Great  Secondly  I guess it s on the natural gas side  I always view Conoco as having probably more leverage than peers do  U S  Natural Gas  and certainly that creates some optionality  Obviously  we haven t heard anything on increased activity just yet  but is there a certain price that we should ear mark as say   5  per  MCF where maybe you would begin to increase activity there  Fox  We do have a lot of potential there  to invest  But we re really focused in on investment now on the liquids rich assets  oil wells and also natural gas wells that yield large amounts of higher value ethane  propane  and butane  and of course we get associated gas  gas associated with oil wells  with that so we benefit from the gas price there  I would say that I wouldn t see us redirecting any capital towards gas assets until it s significantly north of the current prices   emphasis added  Apart from the awkward geographic analogy so popular on Wall Street these days   north  simply means  higher   it s not clear what  significantly  means  But since the questioner already offered the figure of  5  both Hansens believe Fox meant higher than that  The general problem that Kevin Hansen sees is that oil and gas companies are going to continue to prefer to drill oil wells as long as the price of crude floats near the  100 level  They will be reluctant to redeploy drilling rigs to natural gas fields until higher gas prices have been sustained for quite some time  perhaps several months and maybe longer  But with the rapid production decline rates in shale gas wells already bringing   both Kevin and Jim Hansen expect production to undershoot and prices to overshoot  perhaps dramatically  before a ramp up in new drilling begins in earnest  That means very high volatility in the U S  natural gas market in the not to distant future  Add to that any of the obvious pulls on natural gas supply  a very hot summer  electricity demand from natural gas fired power plants   a very cold winter  heating demand  or a hurricane  damage to gas production in the Gulf of Mexico   and you have the makings of a true crisis in supply  Even absent any of these  they expect prices to jump significantly in the coming two to three years  So  what do things look like after we pass through the crisis  Kevin explained that he expects the natural gas price to settle at levels much higher than today  And  those prices will bring out the supply needed to meet demand  The exploitation of the country s large shale gas resource will then proceed in a more orderly fashion for several years  But  dreams of vast  cheap supplies  say  at around  3 or  4 per thousand cubic feet  will be gone  and  with it plans for many new natural gas export terminals  Kevin believes that most of the export terminals now on the drawing board will never get funded  The math works like this  Export terminal operators generally work under cost plus contracts  If the U S  benchmark Henry Hub natural gas price is consistently at or above  6  then it won t be particularly competitive in Europe  an obvious market for U S  liquefied natural gas  LNG   After purchase it costs about another  6 to liquefy the gas  ship it and then regassify it  With European LNG prices currently running around  12 that would make U S  imports only just competitive  Will buyers want to commit themselves to long term cost plus contracts with U S  suppliers when prices have shown themselves to be so unstable as he believes they will be in the coming supply crunch  Other pie in the sky schemes that depend on cheap natural gas are likely to whither as well  He cites   one that would turn natural gas into diesel and other products  Given the high production decline rates  he believes that once U S  shale gas resources are tapped out   it s 2005 all over again   The country will be faced with declining natural gas production as it was in 2005  but this time with no relief in site  And unlike the industry  he doesn t think that scenario is decades away  Take the  s  off of decades  he says  and you ll likely be closer to being right about the timeline for America s next rendezvous with persistently falling domestic natural gas production ,2013-05-06,Kurt

189816,411332,COP,What Are The Koch Brothers Up To In Alberta s Oil Sands ,opinion,There s been a tempest of internet chatter over  which claimed the Koch brothers are now the largest oil sands leaseholders in the province of Alberta  even ahead of supermajors Royal Dutch Shell B  RDSb  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   The Koch subsidiary is reported to hold at least 1 1 million acres  an area almost the size of Delaware    Because of the Koch s political ties  the story is of interest to those who have tried to link the Koch brothers to  through which a portion of Alberta s bitumen is likely to flow  although  no such connection exists  Therefore the newspaper s story is of great interest to the political pundits  but relatively few are talking about the bigger question  namely     Why do the Koch brothers have such a huge footprint in Alberta s oil sands in the first place    The question is of immediate interest to investors  because  and one of America s most powerful corporations  If the Koch brothers are as involved in Alberta s oil sands as the Washington Post reports  then investors should want to know why    According to   the Koch holdings are primarily concentrated in the Peace River region of Alberta     a lesser known oil sands area compared to the much higher profile Athabasca region where all the major surface operations are based  Unlike the enormous bitumen mining operations in Fort McMurray which are relatively simple to excavate  the Peace River oil sands deposits are located underground  several hundred meters below the surface  They are known as in situ deposits because they are deeply buried sand formations saturated with extra heavy oil  Up until a few short years ago  these deposits were mostly shunned by the major producers  But as technology improved and oil prices rose  all that began to change    Since Koch Industries is a private corporation  they are under no obligation to give details on their massive oil sands lease blocks in the Peace River area  In fact   on the subject  Therefore in order to find out more about their holdings  I turned to the other oil companies in Peace River and began going through their websites  What I discovered was interesting    It turns out a large portion of Koch s Peace River oil sands holdings are concentrated in a single area comprising about 800 square miles  Their lease block in this area covers nearly a dozen townships  That s a massive land position  by anyone s standards  But why is Koch there  It turns out that Koch has surrounded an exploration company which has discovered a significant deposit     an underground geological platform which is saturated with  of which 887 million barrels are recoverable  according to the company s 51 101 compliant report  The company is Strata Oil and  they ve released on their website  As you can see  Koch has surrounded them to the northeast    It turns out that Koch isn t the only major player that s taken an interest in the region  Shell is directly to the south  as is Husky Energy  Both these companies have assembled substantial lease blocks in the adjacent townships    As I began to look more deeply into the play  the multi zone potential of the region became evident to me  While neither Shell  Koch  nor Husky are revealing the full extent of their plans  there appear to be three major oil zones which are being targeted in the area  They are all enormous    First  there s the underground oil sands formation which contains a very thick  extra heavy type of oil which only flows when heat is applied to it  Shell was the first one to really hone in on this prize  and is now ramping up to 80 000 barrels per day at their nearby Carmon Creek project    Second  there s the slightly deeper carbonate based formations  which  like the sands  contain extra heavy oil requiring thermal treatment  Shell has shown great interest in exploiting carbonate hosted bitumen deposits in Alberta   for their initial carbonate lease blocks in the Grosmont platform to the east  In fact  Alberta s carbonate hosted bitumen is considered by many to be  the next oil sands  and has been   of which 89 billion barrels may be recoverable using SAGD or CSS technology    And third  there are what appear to be a number of highly valuable pools of heavy oil which flow without thermal treatment  The wells are essentially conventional     they are cold flow  primary production  NYSE listed  has moved aggressively into the region and is exploiting these pools with incredible success  In fact  they ve acquired more than 300 sections of oil sands leases and have so far drilled 183 cold production horizontal wells with a mindblowing 100  success rate    They are producing from an average pay thickness of 15 20 meters  It s so lucrative that Baytex has announced they will allocate a larger percentage of their 2014 budget to the Peace River area than any of their other operations  including their shale oil projects in the Bakken     reinforcing my view that Alberta s oil sands deposits may trump their shale oil counterparts just on the basis of economics alone    It s therefore little wonder that Koch has moved so heavily into the Peace River oil sands play  They ve astutely assembled an incredible land position in one of North America s most valuable oil producing regions  Between the thermal in situ oil sands deposits  the substantial cold flow bitumen pools  and the promising carbonate bitumen reservoir  Koch may be sitting on a multi billion barrel oil sands portfolio which keeps the company rolling in profits for decades to come ,2014-04-10,Dick Sterling,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-are-the-koch-brothers-up-to-in-alberta's-oil-sands-209201,209201
189817,411333,COP,Watch This Bakken Oil Play,opinion,"The strength in this market is with Crude Oil  as both the spot price and oil stocks are holding up very well 
While the broader market has been experiencing a well deserved price retrenchment  both large  and small cap oil stocks have been on the comeback trail  The price strength is helpful as speculative fervor continues to come out of equities  The performance illustrates how helpful sectoral portfolio diversification can be when asset prices fall 
ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  is not expensively priced at approximately 9 5 times trailing earnings  The stock sold off significantly at the beginning of the year but has since recovered nicely  Currently yielding just less than four percent  this oil and gas story is similar to the other big integrated energy companies  it isn t about production growth but more about income for investors 
One company we ve looked at several times in these pages is Kodiak Oil   Gas Corp   KOG   This is a Bakken oil play that s really doing well  This stock was consistently expensive  being a highly liquid favorite of institutional investors  but earnings have caught up to the share price and the story is still intact  This junior energy producer still has a very bright future  The company s stock chart is featured below 
 
Chart courtesy of 
Energy consistently has a role to play in equity market portfolios  and it doesn t have to be pure play production stories  In terms of resource investing  I find it much more attractive over precious metals  particularly for investors looking for some longevity in their holdings 
In an environment that s likely to remain slow growing for several years  I like both the income and capital gains potential from oil stocks in pipelines  energy storage  processing  and transmission 
Previously  we looked at Chart Industries Inc  GTLS O  out of Garfield Heights  Ohio  This is a business with good long term fundamentals  and the stock is currently in its own downtrend  making it more attractive by the day 
Bakken oil is still a major growth story and an investment theme with more life  It s not the only play  of course  but the region still commands high recognition from institutional investors  which can make these stocks move with particular fervor 
A company like Kodiak Oil   Gas can move a lot higher on the stock market so long as spot oil prices don t fall from current levels  Wall Street analysts are still revising their earnings estimates upward and at 12 times its 2015 earnings  the position is not expensively priced like it used to be 
Everything depends on underlying commodity prices when it comes to resource investing  and oil s strength in the face of the recent sell off in equities is quite surprising  Its resilience is a positive indicator in terms of sentiment in global capital markets 
Expectations for economic growth still tend to move in concert with oil prices  and the current spot price over WTI  100 00 a barrel is itself a vote of confidence in the prospects for economic activity this year

189818,411334,COP,Energy ETFs In Focus On Big Oil Q1 Earnings,opinion,Big U S  oil companies like Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Chevron  NYSE CVX  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  reported their results last week for the first quarter  While COP fueled a rally in the broad energy sector  XOM and CVX saw modest decline in their share prices following the earnings announcement  Amid the booming shale oil and gas business  the three big oil companies are still struggling with shrinking production volumes  This is especially true as domestic oil and natural gas production at Exxon dropped 5 6  while Chevron oil and natural gas production slipped 3 6   Conoco experienced a modest production decline of 1 8  in the first quarter Earnings for Big Oil Companies in Focus The largest U S  oil company  Exxon Mobil  reported earnings of  2 10 per share for the first quarter  Though earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 88 thanks to lower exploration cost  higher natural gas prices and strength in upstream division  it deteriorated from the year ago earnings of  2 12  Total revenue dropped 1 5  year over year to  106 8 billion  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  111 4 billion  The lackluster result was primarily due to lower oil and gas output that dropped for the tenth time in the past 11 quarters as well as weak international refining and chemicals businesses  read     Similar to Exxon  earnings at ConocoPhillips   the third largest U S  oil company   strongly beat our estimate by 24 cents and surged 27 5  from the year ago quarter  This is mainly thanks to rising output in Texas and North Dakota as well as higher natural gas prices  Revenues rose 9 5  year over year to  16 05 billion and comfortably surpassed our estimate of  15 51 billion Chevron  which trails Exxon Mobil  was hit by lower global production and declining oil prices in the quarter  Earnings per share came in at  2 36  falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 53 and declining from the year ago earnings of  3 18  Revenues fell 6 3  to  53 26 billion and were a far cry of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  66 45 Market Impact The mixed performance from these three giants along with favorable supply demand trends keeps the broad energy sector on a close watch by investors  Both XOM and CVX have a poor Zacks Industry Rank  which is in the bottom 32  while COP has a solid Zacks Rank in the top 10   Further  the stocks retain a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   suggesting more room for upside  The ongoing tension in Russia and more sanctions against the country could disrupt the global oil supply that is considered favorable for the industry  read      ETF Angle Given this  most of the ETFs having larger allocation to these oil companies are in focus in the coming

189819,411335,COP,Malcolm Shaw  Why Is the Market Ignoring These Companies ,opinion,"Malcolm Shaw is looking at a modern day map to buried treasure  He sees a company operating a shale oil well that has tested at a free flow rate of 590 barrels per day  a junior producer in Argentina working naturally fractured shale  an unrecognized frack sand resource  and a company that owns one of the most exciting uranium discoveries on the planet  Yet Shaw  a partner at Hydra Capital Partners Inc   is sometimes mystified by the lack of investor interest  In this interview with The Mining Report  Shaw talks about these projects and more  explaining how a savvy investor can profit from diamond in the rough opportunities 
The Mining Report  Malcolm  uranium s spot price is at a 52 week low  What is your forecast for the uranium price moving forward 
Malcolm Shaw  The spot price is still depressed from overhang in the spot market that stemmed from the Japanese reactor shutdown in 2011  Japan was widely expected to begin reactor restarts this summer  but it appears that may be pushed back to early fall  It should be the starting pistol for a move in the spot price  I wouldn t be surprised to see the spot price recover  maybe to the  40 45 pound   40 45 lb  range  by the end of the year  But it s really going to depend on the pace of those Japanese reactor restarts 
TMR  Analysts keep saying that we are looking at a uranium supply deficit and rising prices by 2018  Why isn t the market responding to these threats 
MS  The uranium market is a little different than a market like copper or gold or oil  Spot prices are around  33 lb and term prices are around  47 50 lb right now  Spot s really only relevant if you re looking to secure supply for very near term delivery  whereas term is what an end user would expect to pay for guaranteed delivery in the future  some years down the road  In the near term  and maybe even the medium term  there s no shortage of uranium out there  But when you consider the new reactors coming online in the coming years  the supply deficit is staring us right in the face  The number of new reactor builds underway in Asia is significant  and when you look at the growth of electricity demand and the concurrent decline in air quality in a country like China  it s no mystery why nuclear has to become a larger part of Asia s energy mix 
Spot prices are generally important for market sentiment  which ultimately correlates with capital inflows and investment in the sector Cameco Corporation  NYSE CCJ  is the best market barometer that I can think of for sentiment in the uranium sector  It s been trading fairly well  up about 50  in the last six months  though it s been a little soft lately  I can t say when the market will respond  but I really do think it s a  when  not an  if   At the current spot and term prices  new production would be very difficult to finance 
TMR  How will the isolation of Russia and the nuclear reactor restarts in Japan affect the uranium as well as the oil and natural gas spaces 
MS  Russia is a juggernaut in the uranium sector  It has been one of the main suppliers for the U S  reactor fleet for about 20 years now under the Megatons to Megawatts program  That program is over now  There are transitional supply agreements in place to meet demands of U S  reactors in the coming years  To me  that seems like a suboptimal situation from a U S  perspective  I think it should encourage development of domestic uranium resources 
Russia is also jockeying with Saudi Arabia for the position of largest oil producer in the world and is critical to the gas supply of Europe  To sum it up  Russia is an energy powerhouse  but there are alternatives  The U S  is becoming increasingly less dependent on foreign oil  and I think we ll probably see the U S  become a real exporter of natural gas in the coming years  Gas prices are much lower in North America than other markets  like Asia and Europe  where they can be twice as high or higher  It s not hard to imagine that liquefied natural gas  LNG  projects will start to take advantage of that arbitrage 
Pretty much any time a foreign dependence on one commodity or another is highlighted as a result of geopolitics  as we re seeing with Russia right now  the market tends to react to decrease that dependence  It should have regulators in Europe looking to increase LNG import capacity and should also drive them to more aggressively pursue domestic gas sources  North Africa could also see some increased interest from energy investors as a lot of European gas comes from North Africa 
TMR  Are you expecting to see more uranium mining in North America 
MS  I would think so  In terms of domestic companies that are active  we re looking for producers like Energy Fuels Inc  AMEX UUUU   Uranerz Energy Corp   AMEX URZ   Ur Energy Inc   AMEX URG   Uranium Energy Corp   AMEX UEC  and maybe even an early stage project like Powertech Uranium Corp   TO PWE  to get the market behind them  maybe get their equity values a little higher so they can raise some money and advance their projects  Energy Fuels  Uranerz and Ur Energy are all pretty advanced  Each of them has production and is well financed  but again  their equity prices aren t reflecting the underlying value of their assets if you believe in a higher uranium price in the long term 
TMR  In your last interview  you were excited about the early reports from the Patterson Lake discovery by Alpha Minerals Inc  and Fission Energy Corp  How has that panned out 
MS  The two companies merged late in 2013  and the combined company is now called Fission Uranium Corp   FCU TSX V   Patterson Lake has turned out to be one of the most exciting uranium discoveries on the planet  The ultimate size of the resource is still unknown  but it has all the hallmarks of a world class deposit in terms of the holy trinity of scale  grade and depth 
One of its holes came back recently with a grade thickness of 992  That s equivalent to almost 100 meters  100m  of 10  U308  It s hard to describe how good that hole is  For its depth  it s probably one of the best mining exploration holes ever drilled for any commodity  The true thickness of that intercept is still unknown and uranium deposits are often irregular in shape  but to be in a system that can produce a hole like that at a depth of only about 60m from surface is very impressive  Ultimately a deposit like that will almost certainly be bought by a larger player  For me the only question is when 
TMR  So  what does the future look like for the company  Is it going to buy up or is it going to be selling out 
MS  Again  it does own 100  of Patterson Lake  I expect Fission to take that project through to an NI 43 101 resource estimate so that investors can have a formal idea of what the resource size is  because there are a lot of numbers being tossed around by the market  Ultimately  in terms of buyers  it s a relatively select club of companies that would make an acquisition like that  but any time you have a deposit with this kind of grade at that depth you re talking about a best in class deposit  and those tend not to stay in the hands of juniors 
TMR  Are there any other companies that are getting comparable results in the Athabasca 
MS  It s almost an unfair question  Patterson Lake has set the bar so high that other companies really can t be expected to compare  There s a reason why Patterson Lake gathered so much attention despite a sluggish spot market in uranium  When you make a world class discovery  the commodity price tends not to matter quite as much  It will be tough to follow up  but companies can always try  NexGen Energy Ltd   TO NXE  is on trend to the northeast  It has some pretty interesting looking rock and a few of its holes drilled from the winter program  but the assays are still pending 
TMR  Changing focus  natural gas appears to have escaped the bargain basement  3 per million Btu   3 MMBtu  price range  What was the catalyst for that 
MS  It was definitely the cold winter that we just went through coupled with historic lows in gas rig counts  Those two things together made the 2013 2014 winter season a real outlier in terms of storage drawdowns  The Energy Information Administration reported storage levels for natural gas right now are about a trillion cubic feet  1 Tcf  below the five year range for this time of year  That s just a huge deficit to make up for  and rig counts are only starting to pick up for natural gas 
TMR  Is the  4 MMBtu range where gas is going to live now 
MS  I think so  With the storage levels that we re seeing right now it s hard to see us getting into an oversupply situation any time soon  unless the summer is unusually cool and the next winter is warm  It s not like you can just crank up gas production on a dime  It takes time to move rigs and people to increase that production  and the gas delivery system itself only has so much capacity to deliver gas to storage  We should be stable in this  4 range  maybe even  5 
TMR  So your expectation for the gas price this year is to continue some upward pressure 
MS  Yes  I really try not to forecast gas or oil prices  but directionally I would say my price bias for gas is positive  As an investor I would generally look to be long gas producers 
TMR  You were talking about LNG exports  Is the rising price of gas going to have any influence on that 
MS  Basically it s transportation arbitrage  If you can buy gas cheaper in North America and make money by shipping it to Asia or Europe as an LNG company  you re going to do that  If gas prices go to  8 per thousand cubic feet   8 Mcf  in North America  there s going to be a lot less incentive to ship that gas offshore  However  I don t see those price levels coming to North America any time soon  which is why I would be biased towards the view that LNG projects will move ahead and that will provide more stability in the North American pricing  I think we re unlikely to see those lows that we saw in the past year or so 
TMR  What companies are having luck drilling shale internationally 
MS  One of the themes that I see is that shale oil and shale gas are here to stay  Producers are literally going straight to the source in the hydrocarbon industry  Drilling and completion technology has given us the ability to unlock resources that were previously beyond our reach  It s a paradigm shift  North America is showing us what s possible with the right services and technology  but  geologically  the same resource potential exists elsewhere in the world as well  I ve been looking for resource plays internationally where I can get low cost exposure to companies looking to take North American know how abroad 
Canacol Energy Ltd   TO CNE  is a Colombian producer  Colombia has a long history of hydrocarbon exploration and production  I think that over the next year or so we re going to hear a lot more about the La Luna  Tablazo and Rosa Blanca shales  These Colombian shales are proven and prolific hydrocarbon source rocks and are comparable to the names like the Bakken and the Eagle Ford in a lot of ways  One of the key differences is that they are 1 000 2 000 feet thick  That s anywhere from 3 10 times thicker than any comparable Bakken or Eagle Ford in North America  That means that the oil in place numbers can get very large very fast 
Canacol has over 500 000 net acres of exposure to these plays in Colombia  which puts it second only to the state oil company  Ecopetrol S A   NYSE EC   To put things in perspective  Canacol has seen Exxon Mobil Corp   NYSE XOM   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and Royal Dutch Shell Plc  NYSE RDSa  all farm into its acreage within the last year or so  all in separate blocks  but all in the same play 
The first well  drilled by the Canacol Exxon joint venture into a naturally fractured section of La Luna  was tested at 590 barrels day  590 bbl d  oil earlier this year  The test was short term  but it was under natural flow conditions  which means that the oil is literally free flowing to surface at that rate  I m pretty amazed that the market appears to be completely ignoring this shale option value right now  I can make a case for the company trading at 0 6 0 7 times its net asset value on its existing conventional production alone and there s no lack of running room there either  The company s recent discovery at its Pantro 1 exploration well really firms up the Leono Pantro development area  and I think it s reflective of the overall potential of their LLA 23 block in terms of production growth and prospectivity  I really like the risk reward on Canacol 
Crown Point Energy Inc   TO CWV  in Argentina is similar to Canacol in the sense that the company is backstopped by existing production from its conventional assets while offering huge leverage to another one of the hottest international oil shale plays out there  the Vaca Muerta  We re seeing this trend where the majors are coming into these plays to secure reserves for future growth because it s very hard for them to move the needle any other way  The Vaca Muerta is being pursued by Exxon  Chevron Corp   CVX NYSE   Royal Dutch Shell Plc   Yacimientos Petrol feros Fiscales   NYSE YPF   Petroliam Nasional Berhad  Petronas  and Total S A   NYSE TOT   to name a few 
The Vaca Muerta is very thick and a very proven source rock in the early stages of exploitation  There was a successful Vaca Muerta test by YPF to the south of Crown Point s land in 2012  but YPF hasn t followed up on that despite the fact that there are a number of proven  producing fields in various formations on trend to the south  We know Crown Point s acreage is in an oily area  Crown Point has about 100 000 acres of Vaca Muerta that is modeled as being in the oil window  It s outside of the main area of activity  but the data in the company s area of interest is very compelling  It s 6 kilometers  6 km  from a pipeline in an area of proven historic production and only 4 km from a Vaca Muerta well that tested about 350 bbl d in the 1990s 
Recently  Crown Point drilled into a naturally fractured volcanic section that s embedded within the Vaca Muerta shale  which should be tested probably by the end of May  That well had persistent oil shows during the drilling of that section  That naturally fractured volcanic reservoir is interesting for a couple of reasons  First  it means that development might not require the expensive horizontal drilling and fracking typically associated with shale oil because the natural fractures may act as high permeability conduits for the oil  Second  there s analog production from fractured volcanics in a field directly to the south  where this play type has been proven to be productive  We still need to see a test  but right now I think it looks pretty good 
Industry valuations per acre in the Vaca Muerta can range anywhere from  1 000 to  10 000 acre depending on who you talk to and where the acreage is  My math has Crown Point valued at around  200 acre  I m finding that pretty compelling 
Crown Point is going to start a 10 well drilling program very soon in Tierra del Fuego  which should continue to build on its current core production of about 1 700 barrels of oil equivalent per day  1 700 boe d   It should provide some additional material exploration upside  because eight of those wells are development wells and two of them I would characterize as being low risk exploration wells  One of those exploration wells is a target called Puesto Quince that probably has the potential to double corporate reserves if it s successful  It s covered by a 3 D seismic survey and is flanked on three sides by production  so I like that target a lot 
TMR  There s been a long running civil war in Colombia  and Argentina has a record of nationalizing  What is the political risk for companies operating there 
MS  There s always political risk  I joke sometimes that there s political risk in Canada  A number of years ago we saw Alberta overhaul royalties  which caused a lot of fuss and has since been straightened out  but I see your point  The FARC  a guerilla group  is active in Colombia  typically in the border regions with Venezuela and Ecuador  Since about 2000  maybe 2002  the Colombian government has taken a pretty hard line against the FARC  It started with President  lvaro Uribe  and President Juan Manuel Santos has continued that  I see no sign of that diminishing in the future  It s simmering in the background and it s flared up a little bit lately with elections coming up  From everything I ve seen  though  the FARC has really been marginalized 
People also like to talk about nationalization in Argentina  and it has happened  The Repsol YPF debacle was forefront on everybody s minds  That dispute has been settled  Repsol  REP MC  was recently compensated for the assets that it did lose  There s a relatively long story and history between Argentina and Repsol that surrounds that  I would encourage people to look up some of that history  But a junior company is really too small to be on the radar of the Argentinean government for expropriation  I think 
TMR  You re very impressed with Canacol s shale oil flow rate in Colombia  Why aren t other investors equally impressed 
MS  I think because it s early  for one  The Canacol Exxon well test was literally one of the first well tests from the La Luna Shale in Colombia in recent memory  There have been historical producers out of that formation  but they were viewed more as outliers  and they were drilled back in the days before we really recognized the potential of oil shale resource plays  I also think that the market may have had unrealistically high expectations of something in the 1 000 3 000 bbl d range  Also  Colombia is still working on regulations for unconventional resource plays  It is expected that they will follow a North American model in that regard  and when those regulations are in place  I think it might be a trigger for the market 
Any time you get a well that s free flowing at surface at a rate of 600 bbl d  that s a very good oil well  That means you literally have 600 bbl flowing out of the ground unassisted  There were two 24 hour tests  so some people may find that production test a bit short  but again  it s early days in the play  The well should soon be on long term production test and all signs are positive so far  If I was paying anything for the shale option in Canacol  I might have a different opinion  Like I said  with the core assets underpinning the value of the company  I could see the stock trading at  10 share just based on the existing conventional assets  To also get that kind of leverage to the shale for free  that s what gets me excited 
TMR  Which of the companies you cover offers the best value for an investor and why 
MS  Advantage Oil and Gas Ltd   NYSE AAV  is an interesting value play  It s not the cheapest stock in terms of valuation metrics  but it is just a prime chunk of Montney gas acreage in Alberta  It has 1 7 Tcf of Proven and Probable reserves  and industry leading finding and development costs in the  1 to  1 25 Mcf range  Its operating costs are also industry leading at around  0 30 Mcf  Even though it s generally dry gas  the economics are great  You re talking recycle ratios in the 2 2  times range  even at current gas prices  Advantage has really executed and it has recently been trading really well  so I think the market has started to take notice 
One last company that I d like to touch on is called Athabasca Minerals Inc   NYSE ABM   I ve followed this company for years and I bought it about six months ago  I think it s on the verge of a major rerate by the market  The company has been quietly working away on a frack sand project called Firebag  which is just off a main highway about 100 km north of Fort McMurray  I would expect that project to get permitted sometime this year  Canada uses around 2 5 million tons per year of frack sand and something like 70  or 80  of that comes from places like Wisconsin in the U S  That s a long way to ship sand  Athabasca s deposit is so much closer to the Alberta market  I can t imagine how a foreign sand resource could compete once Athabasca Minerals Firebag project is up and running  Firebag would be one of the closest frack sand sources in a business where proximity is everything and transportation is by far the largest cost in the equation  For perspective  Firebag is about 2000 km closer to the core of the Alberta Deep Basin than any competitor out of Wisconsin would be 
The company has already secured land at the end of the Canadian National Railway Company  NYSE CNI  line just south of Fort McMurray for infrastructure  you need a place to load that sand onto rail  Athabasca s had its sand independently tested and it compares favorably with all the existing frack sand industry benchmarks  I get excited about it  Frack sand is just an absolutely essential component of the energy industry now  For anyone even thinking about LNG shipping from British Columbia in the future  you have to consider that those gas molecules are going to be unlocked by frack sand at some point  and that s on top of the domestic gas market  I think Athabasca s Firebag project could be a strategic asset down the road  It s a real   made in Alberta  solution 
Athabasca Minerals also has a history of profitability from its core gravel operations in the Fort McMurray area  which is closely tied to development activity in the oil sands  I should point out that there is no NI 43 101 on the sand resource yet  but my back of the envelope math says that there are decades of supply there  I expect margins to be quite robust  I think once the market figures out what s in play here  the stock has a very good chance of being quite a bit higher 
TMR  To wrap up  can you recap your investment advice for uranium and then for oil and gas 
MS  For any industry  I would encourage investors to look for a backstop in value and then look for good management teams focused on giving investors exposure to good upside  I like to find companies where I know the valuation is underpinned by the existing assets  To me that s a big deal  The other thing that I look for is long tail optionality on the upside  I highlighted some of those names today with some of the shale oil plays and this frack sand opportunity  If people gear themselves towards thinking about the downside first and then thinking about what they re paying for the upside  it can make for much more successful investing in the long run

189841,411357,COP,ConocoPhillips  New Stock In My Dividend Yield Passive Income Portfolio,opinion,ConocoPhillips  COP  is the company which I selected for my Dividend Yield Passive Income Portfolio  DYPI  ConocoPhillips is a Dividend Contender  a stock that raised dividends over more than 10 years but less than 25 years in a row  The company has hiked its dividend over 12 consecutive years Shale oil and gas could be a good growth drive for the company but more important is the development of future energy prices  If you buy a company like COP  Exxon Mobil  XOM   CHevron  CVX  or something in a related industry you make a commodity bet with several options ConocoPhillips is valuated with a P E of 10 98  The forward P E is in a similar range  Growth for COP is limited and estimated at 5 35 percent for the next five years but I would say that the true growth figure depends mainly on the future oil price and the costs COP has to explore for oil and gas  The dividend yield of 4 32 percent is one of the biggest in the industry  Only yields from European competitors are higher I put 20 shares at  61 06 into the Dividend Yield Passive Income Portfolio  The total purchase amount was  1 221 20  See the tables below The COP position represents around 1 2 percent of the full portfolio which was funded virtual with  100 000 on October 03  2012  The complete portfolio has now 17 stock holdings and generates around  900 per year  I plan to increase the total amount of stocks to a number of 50 70 by the end of this year  As a result  the dividend income should also increase to a value between  3 000 and  4 000 This shouldn t be a big problem with still  76 401 45 in cash  All I need to do is to find some attractive valuated dividend stocks  For the time being  its getting harder to find some solid growing stocks with a big yield  But maybe we got some new ones within the next months when they boost their payments to shareholders  We will see The DYPI Portfolio has a total performance of 0 95 percent including dividend payments  Most of my capital is not invested  around 75 percent or so  The return of the invested capital is at 3 52 percent  That s an underperformance compared to the returns from the Dow Jones and the S P 500  But I ever told you that the portfolio will underperform if the market goes strongly up because of my slow buy algorithm I ever told you that I don t like to show how you can make fast money and get quick rich  I only like to demonstrate that you can build up a long term dividend growth portfolio which could give you a steady growing passive income and solid capital gains over the long term  A minimum investment horizon is at least 10 years or more  Not all stocks from the portfolio will perform well  but others will do  That s the nature of the stock market  personally made a six figure total gross income over the recent ten years   from one of my accounts by the factor of more than 6  only by trading dividend stocks  I am no stock market guru and I don t like to be treated as one  The return was definitly better than the performance of the broad market but it was no wonder or something else   The market has great opportunities to offer  You only need to discover some of the best growth stocks with potential to become a game changer  That s real hard work and you need to be a wise and patience investor  At least the time will bring you wealth ,2013-01-28,Dividend Yield,https://www.investing.com/analysis/conocophillips:-new-stock-in-my-dividend-yield-passive-income-portfolio-152715,152715
189842,411358,COP, Big Energy Feels The Heat,opinion,Yesterday  the leading integrated energy stocks were coming under selling pressure  It is important to note that the energy sector accounts for roughly 17 0 percent of the S P 500 Index  It is now very easy to see why this industry group is so important for the major stock indexes The leading energy stock in the sector is Exxon Mobil Corp  XOM   Yesterday  XOM stock declined lower closing at 89 15  down  89  Short term traders should watch for intra day support around the  88 80  and  88 32 levels  The daily chart is signaling support around the  87 75 area  Traders must remember  XOM has the largest market capitalization in the world around  410 0 billion Some other leading integrated energy stocks that are declined lower yesterday included Chevron Corp  CVX   ConocoPhillips  COP   and BP plc  BP   All of these leading energy stocks are still signaling further weakness on the daily charts  As long as these stocks remain weak it is very difficult for the major stock indexes to trade higher  Often  the leading energy stocks will trade inverse to the U S  Dollar ,2013-02-05,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/big-energy-feels-the-heat-153824,153824
189843,411359,COP,The Best Natural Gas Play In The World ,opinion,Traders and investors are always looking at future trends to make money  One of the latest themes presenting an opportunity to make money in the future is the natural gas sector  Many so called  experts  believe that the United States has more natural gas than any other country on the planet  If this is true  then it is reasonable to assume that the natural gas stocks have future potential of trading much higher once this energy source is readily available for exporting to other countries Sure  there is dozens of stocks in this gigantic sector that traders can play at this time  Some leading stocks in the industry group include Chesapeake Energy Corporation  CHK   Devon Energy Corporation  DVN   Southwestern Energy Co   SWN   Apache Corp  APA   and Comstock Resources Inc   CRK  just to name a few  The large integrated energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation  XOM   Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   and ConocoPhillips  COP  all have a foothold in the business as well  The one company that stands out the most is Exxon Mobil Corporation  XOM  In late 2009  Exxon Mobil Corp bought out natural gas giant XTO Energy for  41 billion  This was Exxon Mobil s largest acquisition in over a decade  Please remember  Exxon Mobil Corp is the world s largest energy company by market capitalization  which is at nearly  400 billion  When the world s largest energy company makes an acquisition as large as this one  it is certainly telling the world where the future of energy will be  Often  investments such as these will take five or ten years to pan out  but it is certainly telling of where the energy sector is going  and that is the route of natural gas Why hasn t the use of natural gas become mainstream already  While there are massive reserves of natural gas in the United States  there is the problem of getting the gas out of the ground safely  The process of retrieving the natural gas is called hydraulic fracturing or hydro fracturing  commonly known as fracking  This is the process of drilling and injecting fluid into the ground at a high pressure in order to fracture shale rocks to release natural gas inside  Some chemicals such as lead  uranium  mercury  ethylene glycol  formaldehyde  methanol  and radium are just a few of the many agents used in fracking fluid  Many reports have claimed that this process pollutes the water supplies around the United States  Therefore  until this process can be accomplished safely  natural gas may have some time to go before we can expect to use it in our motor vehicles  everyday energy needs and exporting to other countries Some other potential natural gas related plays include Clean Energy Fuels Corp  CLNE   Cheniere Energy Partners LP  LNG   Westport Innovations Inc  WPRT   If and when this natural gas sector explodes  all of these stocks mentioned could see significant upside  Traders and investors should view all of these stocks as potential trading vehicles at this time  All of these stocks are likely to be seen in a much more positive light in about three to five years from now when better and safer techniques are used to retrieve the gas  At this time  Exxon Mobil Corp  XOM  is still probably the best way to play the natural gas sector simply because of its diversity and shear size in the oil  and natural gas sector ,2013-02-11,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-best-natural-gas-play-in-the-world-154679,154679

189855,411371,COP,What Is A Better Investment Apache Or Conoco Phillips  An Academic Model ,opinion,Here we model the evolution of Apache  NYSE  APA  share price and evaluate its current level relative to that predicted by our pricing model  We also compare the APA model and the ConocoPhillips  COP  model in order to evaluate their relative performance  In other words  we estimate quantitatively which of these two companies provides a better return  Two main findings can be formulated as follows  1  the current price is slightly lower than that predicted by the model  2  both companies show the same level of return The first finding is not surprising  We have already reported that for many energy related companies  e g  Newfield Exploration  NFX  and Peabody Energy  BTU   our empirical models show that their current prices are highly undervalued  In this group  APA is not the worst  However  it is still slightly undervalued despite our model has accurately predicted the rally between 2003 and 2007  the sharp fall in 2008 and the following recovery up to the third quarter of 2011  The second finding is might be an expected one since the stock market seeks for the best return  Therefore  investments are redistributed in a way to provide some constant return  At least this approach should work for all successful companies in the same industry We assume that a share price of an energy company is likely to be driven by the change in the overall energy price or some of its components  Considering the secular increase  change  in the overall price level it is not the absolute change in energy prices what affects the stock price but the difference between the energy price and some energy independent price  The simplest model can be based on the difference between the headline CPI  C  and the core CPI  CC  without any time lag between these indices and the share price  The headline CPI includes all kinds of energy and thus provides the broadest proxy to the energy price index  The core CPI excludes energy  and food  and thus represents the energy independent and dynamic reference  Four years ago  these two indices were used in our original models for ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil  XOM  and are retained as a benchmark since then During these four years  the best model was that for COP  We use it as a benchmark showing the quality of the concept and its predictive power  Figure 1 depicts the observed and modeled COP prices  Taking into account the character of the defining CPIs  they include many irrelevant components which are measurement noise for the model  the agreement between curves is outstanding  One can consider the predicted price as a fundamental one  These are two broadest consumer price indices which define the fundamental price  Quantitatively  we have estimated the following relationships to minimize the model error between 1998 and 2012 COP t    72 3   5 35 CC t    C t    1 where COP t  is the share price in U S  dollars at time t Figure 1  Historic  monthly closing  prices for COP  black line  and the scaled difference between the core CPI and the headline CPI  red line  Accordingly  we depict in Figure 2 a similar model for APA  The best fit relationship is as follows APA t    110   8 1 CC t    C t    2 The overall agreement is also good with the predicted and observed prices very close near the 2008 peak and the 2009 bottom  The recovery since 2009 has been described with a slight underestimation of the measured price  i e  the actually observed growth was slightly stronger than the predicted one  This undervaluation was quickly compensated by the 2011 fall  Currently  the actual price is undervalued one by a few dollars Figure 2  Historic  monthly closing  prices for APA  black line  and the scaled difference between the core CPI and the headline CPI  red line  Comparing the slopes in  1  and  2  one can estimate relative performance of APA and COP  These slopes define the price reaction to a given change in the CPI difference  For a one unit change in CC C  the COP price changes by  5 35 and the APA price by  8 1  Since the price levels are approximately  67 and  100  respectively  the ratio of the slopes  0 66  completely corresponds to the ratio of price levels  0 67   This means that the returns provided by COP and APA are equal if their prices are driven by the difference between CPIs The original model is very crude  Both CPIs depend on many other goods and services  what introduces high measurement noise in the model  Also  both CPIs have the same weight  1 0  and cannot lead or lag behind the modeled price or each other  Apparently  it can be some non zero lag between the change in energy price and in prices of energy companies  Therefore  we extended the model and described the evolution of a share price as a weighted sum of two individual consumer price indices  or PPIs  selected from a large set of CPIs borrowed from the Bureau of Labor Statistics  We allow both defining CPIs  PPIs  lead the modeled share price  Additionally  we introduced a linear time trend on top of the intercept  As for many already presented companies  we have tested two principal pairs of CPIs  C and CC  CC and the index of energy  E  as well as the pair the PPI and the producer price index of crude oil  OIL  The best fit  as defined by standard error  model is obtained with the pair PPI and OIL APA t   5 83C t    5 81CC t 0    3 81 t 2000    28 53  sterr  9 13  3 APA t   2 69CC t 9    0 57E t    8 25 t 2000    447 41  sterr  8 81  4 APA t   1 66PPI t 0    0

Figures 3 through 5 depict the observed and predicted monthly prices from  3  through  5   For an oil company  it is not excluded that oil controls its price  Interestingly  however  that the index of oil drives the price down  i e  increasing oil price suppresses the return  From Figure 5  we expect the price to rise to  115 in the near future  Oil price may fall in this case  Figure 3  The

189861,411377,COP,Will The Loonie s Popularity Last ,opinion,If we can use the Canadian dollar futures markets as a barometer  speculators have become quite bullish on the loonie  In our recent quarterly review of the volume changes in currency trading  we noted the remaining open interest in the CAD was 207K contracts when the September futures contract expired  This compares to only 97K open when the June futures expired   The big buyers of the loonie have been speculators  In the last COT report  the specs net long had gone up to 139 3K  Trade in the Canadian Dollar is so popular that the open interest was   at 208K   only a little shy of the euro OI at 218K   Speculator rationale for buying the loonie is straightforward  Canada  financially  is a well managed country  and a producer of oil and other commodities  Globally  the big central bankers are going to increase liquidity which has bulled commodities in the past   Since the middle of September  when markets were busy getting ready for helicopter Ben s next dosage of liquidity  both the CAD and the WTI oil have been drifting lower  The November WTI crude has sold off from 100 barrel at the beginning of the month to under 90 barrel this week  The USD versus the CAD was worth  9633 on the 14th and has since strengthened to about  9830    With the end of the quarter upon us  will there be long liquidation   The continued financial turmoil in Europe is negative for those buying the risk assets  In addition  this was followed Thursday September 27 with negative US economic reports  Core US Durable Goods  M M  was a negative 1 6  and the total US Durable Goods was a negative 13 2   Released at the same time was the  Q Q  GDP Annualized at a positive 1 3   down from the expected 1 7   Friday 28 September  the University of Michigan Sentiment Report was a bit lower  and the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index fell sharply to below 50   The economies of Canada and the US are  joined at the hip   and Canada is much more than a commodity producer  Ontario  the big manufacturing providence reported labor negotiations were concluded this week between the Canadian Auto Workers and General Motors  Ford  and perhaps Chrysler   When the CAD was a discount to the USD  many US companies moved their plants north  Now  with the currency advantage gone  so is the incentive to manufacture there  Chrysler claimed that Ontario auto manufacturing costs are the highest in the world  Since the Canadian plants produce their new best selling Jeep and Dodge mid size cars  Fiat will settle  But when the four year contract ends  Fiat  Chrysler s owner  will likely follow others and move the production from high cost Ontario to the US South or Mexico   There is another perplexing issue with Canada  If the oil sands are such a valuable resource  why are many of the original developers trying to sell their interests  Chinese and Indian companies have been buyers from the original developers  and Conoco Phillips  Shell  and Marathon may have more acreage to sell   Currently  China s CNOOC is trying to acquire Nexen  Since Nexen also has leases on acreage in the US Gulf waters  this will be a political squabble   A larger concern  though  is why some big players in the oil patch are reducing their exposure in the oil sands  Could it be that the recent advances in drilling technology represent a threat to the high cost Alberta sands oil  With the new technology  the results of the drilling are immediately transmitted  practically from the drill bit to a computer  Will this technology discover cheaper supplies of better quality oil  The Canadian bond market has been a favorite destination for global bond buyers in recent years  and this has boosted the currency  Avery Shenfeld  the chief economist at CIBC World Markets  says      that since 2007  international investors have purchased Canadian dollar bonds worth  280 billion  compared with  65 billion over the previous five years  That demand is partly explained by a healthy appetite for AAA rated securities  But international investors also are buying Canada because they are being pushed out of other markets by interventionist central banks  Canada s dollar is among the most overvalued in the world  Mr  Shenfeld said  citing calculations by the International Monetary Fund    The AAA rated Canadian bonds has been a comforting place to invest when economic turmoil is plaguing so many countries  This helps the loonie  as does fear the eurozone may no longer be a safe place for currency reserves  This is what caused the rush to the CAD  but the market is now overloaded long  If the IMF calculations are correct and the loonie is overvalued  it would not take much to push the loonie down to parity with the USD  USD CAD  FXE  UUP  UDN  ,2012-09-30,Cash Back Forex,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-loonie's-popularity-last-138174,138174

189881,411397,COP,The Oil Rush In Alaska Has Started Again,opinion,IntroductionThe memories of the explosion of BP s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in 2010 are still fresh  The death of 11 crewmen and the subsequent spilling of 5 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico have raised tough questions about domestic drilling  Can the safety assurances of oil companies be trusted  What risks are we and aren t we prepared to take in order to quench our thirst for oil  Oil companies are attempting to restore offshore drilling s reputation while simultaneously seeking access to environmentally sensitive Arctic regions Shell and AlaskaPrudhoe Bay Oil Field is a large oil field on Alaska s North Slope  It is the largest oil field in both the United States and in North America covering 213 543 acres and originally containing approximately 25 billion barrels of oil  The amount of recoverable oil in the field is more than double that of the next largest field in the United States  the East Texas oil field  The field is operated by BP  BP  and partners are Exxon Mobil  XOM  and ConocoPhillips  COP  Production from Prudhoe Bay and other North Slope oilfields has been in steady decline for years  It was down from 2 million barrels a day in 1988 to 560 000 barrels last year  Not only has that cut into local tax revenue  but continued declines could threaten the viability of the entire North Slope oil industry long before the oil actually runs out In late Aug 2012  Shell  RDS A  was granted permission to begin preparatory work on its first well in the Arctic Ocean  moving the company a critical step forward on its tortuous quest to drill for oil off the coast of Alaska  Ken Salazar  the interior secretary  said that Shell could conduct the initial steps in drilling in the Chukchi Sea  Before sinking a single well  Shell will have already invested  4 5 billion in its Alaska project     2 3 billion assembling the necessary equipment and personnel on top of the  2 2 billion for the leases  The wells Shell will begin drilling in July are exploratory  not producing  Typically  only one out of every two or three exploratory wells drilled strikes oil or natural gas  Such modest success rates make Shell s Arctic bet appear risky  However  Shell knows there is oil offshore in Alaska because it owned leases and drilled wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in the 1980s and 1990s  It abandoned them only because the  20 a barrel prices at the time did not justify the expense of further drilling   They would not have committed so many resources if they didn t believe this was a sure thing   says Eric van Oort  a former Shell engineer who is now a professor of petroleum engineering at the University of Texas One of Shell s strategies in recent years has been to deploy capital in politically stable regions where obstacles to oil and gas development are less daunting than in  say  Nigeria  Shell s Nigerian operations have been hindered by the hijacking of its oil rigs and the all too frequent kidnapping of its employees  In Alaska nobody is going to be brandishing guns at Shell workers  Nevertheless  the U S  permitting process has proved more vexing than anyone at Shell headquarters in The Hague ever anticipated The prize that Shell is chasing is worth the ongoing frustration  We talk for an estimated 27 billion barrels of recoverable oil held in Alaska s outer continental shelf plus another 130 trillion cubic feet of natural gas  At its peak  offshore oil production in the region could top 1 45 million barrels a day   Shell is making big bet there  but I think it s justified based on the geology   says Oswald Clint  an oil analyst at Sanford C  Bernstein and a geophysicist by training Shell says that it expects the 410 Alaskan offshore leases it holds in the Arctic to become the company s biggest source of crude oil globally within 10 to 20 years  The waters of the Chukchi Sea alone are believed to cover a store of up to 20 billion barrels of oil  well over 20 times the amount in the reserve  Oil Spills in AlaskaHopefully Shell will not be the third company whose exploration efforts will be associated with a major oil spill in Alaska  Let s check briefly the two oil spills in the history of Alaska 1  The Exxon Valdez oil spill occurred in Prince William Sound  Alaska  on March 24  1989  when an oil tanker bound for California struck Prince William Sound s Reef and spilled 260 000 to 750 000 barrels of crude oil  It is considered to be one of the most devastating human caused environmental disasters  The Valdez spill was the largest ever in U S  waters until the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in terms of volume released  However  Prince William Sound s remote location  accessible only by helicopter  plane  and boat  made government and industry response efforts difficult and severely taxed existing plans for response  The region is a shelter for salmon  sea otters  seals and seabirds  The oil  originally extracted at the Prudhoe Bay oil field eventually covered 1 300 miles of coastline and 11 000 square miles of ocean 2  On March 2  2006  a worker for BP Exploration  BP  discovered a large oil spill in western Prudhoe Bay  Up to 267 000 US gallons were spilled  making it the largest oil spill on Alaska s north slope to date  The spill was attributed to a pipeline rupture  BP paid a  20M fine for the spill  On November 3  2008 BP issued a response stating that they  had no record that any concerns about corrosion leading to an oil transit line breach in the foreseeable future ever were communicated to BP   This spill raised a new round of questions from environmental groups about proposed plans to open more land in the region to oil drilling  The North Slope region of Alaska borders the Arctic Ocean and contains most of the state s petroleum reserves  It is also home to thousands of migratory birds  caribou  and other creatures The Arctic FailuresThe region s challenges are formidable  They range from icebergs to storms  darkness and fierce cold  There is also no certainty of success as UK listed explorer Cairn Energy  CNE L  spent  1B exploring off Greenland and failed to find commercial volumes of oil The Pipeline ConcernAlaskan crude oil is transported south via the Trans Alaska Pipeline  and a 2011 report by the pipeline s operator  Alyeska Pipeline Service Co   raised doubts about whether the pipeline can operate safely if throughputs continue to decline  The slower the oil moves through the pipeline  the greater the risk that water will separate from the crude and freeze at the bottom of the pipeline during winter  causing corrosion and cracks  This and other risks  according to the Alyeska report   decrease confidence that the pipeline can be reliably operated at throughputs lower than 350 000 barrels per day  In Barrow  Alaska  the northernmost city in the U S  it s hard to tell where the land ends and the frozen Arctic Ocean begins  The average temperature stays below freezing for eight months of the year   It s not looking good   former North Slope Borough Mayor Edward Itta says of the production declines   And if there s no oil going through the pipeline  that oil infrastructure becomes worthless  and our tax base goes down   All of Barrow s infrastructure was built by oil money  and all of it is now maintained by oil money   I started realizing   Itta continues   that my biggest responsibility was maintaining the economic well being of the borough  and that largely has to do with maintaining oil in the pipeline   The low flow threat to the pipeline is a huge state issue as well  given that over 90  of Alaska s state revenue come from oil and gas New Infrastructure NeededAlaska needs infrastructure to handle increased shipping through the Bering Strait  It needs infrastructure to get drilling done on its Outer Continental Shelf  And  it needs infrastructure to deal with what happens if drilling goes wrong  Some of those pieces are already falling into place At its newly opened aviation center in Deadhorse  Fairweather LLC is already servicing oil and gas companies looking at offshore projects  The center boasts a 20 000 square foot hangar  11 000 square feet of office space  24 individual housing quarters  a dining facility  a medical clinic and medevac support center  and a shared office area that could transform into an incident command center in short order  The company is getting ready to expand its facility to include a warehouse  hangar  office space and housing for between 200 and 300 staff and crew members Most of the existing facility has already been rented out  just three months after it opened  said Fairweather business manager Lory Davey  So far  what she s hearing from oil and gas customers is that they want more of what the aviation center offers  You ve had BP and Conoco Philips up here a long time  and they ve got their own infrastructure   Davey said   New companies like Repsol  Great Bear  Stat Oil  all these new entrants up there don t necessarily have the infrastructure built out  A lot of companies don t want to invest in long term infrastructure in their exploration period  Our building has everything one of those companies would need to operate  under one roof  Deadhorse Aviation Center is situated mainly to support oil and gas activity in the Beaufort  Davey said  but could also be a base for operations in the Chukchi  Unlike many northern communities in Alaska  it has the advantage of being on the road system  which makes it cheaper to bring in supplies It s hard to guess where new infrastructure is likely to go as the Arctic oil and gas rush touches the state  But even without taking into account the United States  drilling program  the increase in shipping traffic alone  due in part from neighboring countries  drilling  means Alaska will need new facilities  There s a serious concern over lack of infrastructure to support shipping   Stotts said   There are no ports  no fueling facilities  no search and rescue  They need to put in communications systems  And of course there s always a concern over oil spills or heaven forbid a wreckage  This year  the U S  Coast Guard launched Arctic Shield  a mission meant to increase its presence in northern Alaska where more shipping means more chance of someone needing the Coast Guard s help  But the Coast Guard didn t have a port large enough to host its cutter in the north  In order to conduct its Spill Oil Response System exercise  USCG Alaska had to float a barge alongside the cutter  and move supplies and equipment between the two vessels as if the barge were a port  Our buoy tenders can go into Nome to get supplies and fuel   said USCG Alaska public affairs officer Veronica Colbath   But our national security cutter  she has to go all the way to Dutch Harbor  The Alaska Department of Transportation is already searching for the best place to put an Arctic port that would serve state and federal agencies  as well as commercial shipping traffic  The first round of research for its Alaska Deep Draft Arctic Ports Study started in 2012 and will conclude this November  with additional investigations continuing in 2013 and 2014  According to the Alaska DOT s web page for the project  the port s design  construction and operations would most likely be funded through a public private partnership Other Oil Majors1  Exxon Mobil  ENI  E  of Italy and Norway s Statoil  STO  have also signed deals to explore for oil in Russia s Arctic waters  while others have secured licences to drill off Greenland 2  Total  TOT  has a number of natural gas ventures in the region  including a stake in the vast Shtokman field in Russia s Barents Sea  The Total chief executive said gas leaks were easier to deal with than oil spills  Total s Arctic projects are concentrated in Russia  As well as its stake in Shtokman  it has interests in a number of onshore developments  such as a big liquefied natural gas venture in Russia s far north known as Yamal LNG  It also operates a Siberian oilfield called Kharyaga Total says energy companies should not drill for crude in Arctic waters  marking the first time an oil major has publicly spoken out against offshore oil exploration in the region  Christophe de Margerie  Total s CEO  told the Financial Times the risk of an oil spill in such an environmentally sensitive area was simply too high   Oil on Greenland would be a disaster   he said in an interview   A leak would do too much damage to the image of the company  3  Last spring  Marathon Oil  MRO  announced it was selling substantially all of its Alaska assets to Hilcorp Energy s Alaska subsidiary  including 17M barrels of oil equivalent of net proved reserves across 10 fields in Cook Inlet  plus natural gas storage and interests in natural gas pipeline transmission systems  Marathon estimated the deal at  375M  Marathon Oil has been exploring for  and developing hydrocarbons in Alaska for more than 55 years  with development activities focused on natural gas in the Cook Inlet region Marathon s Alaska manager said that the decision to sell is based on a strategic focus on unconventional U S  oil shales such as Eagle Ford in Texas  and Bakken in North Dakota  Marathon has about 62 employees in Alaska  Some will transfer elsewhere in the company  but he says most will be retained by Hilcorp The drillers Bermuda based Nabors  NBR  is one of the largest drilling companies in the state and it plans on selling its oil field service subsidiary  Peak Oilfield Services which is considered a non core asset  Peak Oilfield Services specializes in rig moving  custom heavy hauling  crane and rigging services and oilfield transportation   Involved in commercial drilling operations in the state since 1962  Nabors has a long and storied history in Alaska  Nabors Alaska drilled both the discovery well and the confirmation well in the giant Prudhoe Bay oilfield in 1968  It s also drilled the only well to date in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  It is worth noting that Nabors Alaska s CDR 2 rig was delivered to ConocoPhillips nearly three years ago at the Kuparuk River unit  It is the first purpose built coiled tubing rig designed for the Arctic Nabors has also been known in Alaska for its tough  anti union stances  In the mid 1990s  when it was the Slope s drilling powerhouse  a group of workers set out to unionize the company  It worked    to an extent  They got the required cards in to the National Labor Relations Board and went on to win the election  But problems began during negotiations  according to Tim Sharp  who was a union organizer at the time and is now the manager Laborers Local 942 in Fairbanks  He says that Nabors dragged out the negotiations so long they ended up dropping the effort ConclusionThe switch is ON and the oil rush in Alaska has just started again  It remains to be seen whether this exploration effort will be beneficial for Shell and whether it will be combined with the lowest negative impact on the environment

189888,411404,COP,Conoco Phillips Share Price Since 1982 ,opinion,One of the commenters made a good remark that any quantitative model fails to predict for extended periods  In other words  the commenter doubts that our concept is valid and is able to provide an accurate description when the modeling period is extended back into the past  Fortunately  we have already addressed this issue in this article  which was also published by the Journal of Applied Research in Finances In order to explain our approach to stock pricing we have to start with an important observation on the difference between the core and the headline CPI  Four years ago we showed that there exist linear trends in consumer and producer price indices  Basically  it was found that the difference between the core CPI  CC  and the headline CPI  CPI  can be approximated by a linear time function dCPI t    CC t    CPI t    A1   B1twhere dCPI t  is the difference  A1 and B1 are empirical constants  and t is the elapsed time  Thus  the  distance  between the core CPI and the headline CPI is a linear function of time  with a positive or negative slope B1 Figure 1 displays this difference from 1960 to 2012  There are three distinct periods of linear dependence on time  from 1960 to 1980  from 1981 to 1998  and from 2002 to 2008  The second period is characterized by a linear trend with slope B1  0 65  and the third one has a larger negative slope of B1  1 52  There are also two turning points or short time intervals   between 1980 and 1981  and from 1999 to 2002  where the trends undergo major changes  In 2008  we expected the difference to form a new linear trend  which would repeat the previously observed by duration and slope  In Figure 1  green solid line represents the expected trend between 2009 and 2015  Currently  there is some deviation from the expected trend  We believe that this deviation is a temporary one and the core CPI will soon to regain its pricing power over the prices of energy and food  For this  oil price has to fall to the level of  70 per barrel  which we observed in October 2011 Figure 1  The difference between the core and headline CPI as a function of time  One can distinguish three periods of quasi linear behavior with two distinct turning points  For second and third periods  linear regression lines are characterized by slopes B1  0 65 and B1  1 52  respectively  Green line represents the expected trend between 2009 and 2015  which we predicted as a mirror reflection of the previous trend This discussion is crucial for our stock pricing concept  It links the change in the difference to the change in pricing power  Apparently  when the difference turns to a trend with an opposite sign the pricing power of the relevant goods and services has to swop as well  As a result linear coefficients in our pricing model have to change their sighs as well The pricing model is a simple one  We assume the presence of a linear link between a stock price  say that of ConocoPhillips  COP   and the difference between the core and headline CPI COP t    A2   B2dCPI t where A2 and B2 are empirical constants  t is the elapsed time  and t2 0 is the time delay between the stock and the CPI changes  i e  the CPI may lag behind or lead the price We have already reported on the recent ConocoPhillips model and estimated all coefficients which best fit the observed price between July 2003 and February 2012 COP t     5 5dCPI t    75Figure 2 depicts the observed and predicted price since 1982  The above model does predict well after 1999  but there is no fit before 1999  Actually  the predicted and observed curves deviate spectacularly  At first glance  one might suggest that the dCPI provides no information about the evolution of the COP price The power of our pricing concept easily resolves this conflict  As we mentioned above  Figure 1 shows that the linear trend before 1999 was positive and after 2002 is a negative one  In terms of econometrics  there was a structural break in the dCPI behavior  The set of long term economic links between goods and services  comprising the CPI and defining the linear trend in the dCPI between 1982 and 1999  underwent a three year long transition to a new set of links and constraints  In turn  this new set defines the trend observed from 2002 to 2008  It s likely that the same trend is observed now  A reasonable assumption is that the sign of slope in the equation for COP t  should also change to an opposite one  Since the positive slope between 1981 and 1999 is only between a half and one third of that between 2002 and 2008  one can expect that the slope observed before 1999 should also be divided by a factor of  3 After reversing the sign and calibrating relevant amplitude and level between 1982 and 1998  we included the transition into the second segment  we have obtained a much better fit as depicted by green line in Figure 2 COP t    1 7dCPI t    5  t between 1981 and 1998Finally  a complete prediction of the COP price between 1982 and 2012 is obtained There is no special need to describe the price in the early 1980s using the CPI difference  All subcategories of the consumer price index  except the index for energy  are parallel before 1982  Therefore  the difference between any two indices  including the headline and core CPI  is constant  i e  it contains no information on the changes in stock prices  Figure 2  Historic  monthly closing  prices for COP  black line  and the scaled difference between the core CPI and the headline CPI  predicted price   green line from 1982 to 1998 and red line since 1998 We expected that COP stocks will follow the new trend in the dCPI  green line  in Figure 1  as is did between 1985 and 2008  one will be able to predict the  trend price  at any given time before 2015  It did not happen yet and we are waiting for a turn to the new trend when oil price will go down  Meanwhile  any large deviation from the trend which will be compensated at a few year horizons might provide a good hint for short term trading Overall  our pricing concept easily matched the challenge of the commenter  The difference between the core and headline CPI gives a good approximation to the evolution of COP price since 1982  There are short periods of rapid and deep fall in stock price which might be associated with the change in linear trends ,2012-04-01,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/conoco-phillips-share-price-since-1982-118827,118827
189927,411443,COP,Earnings Preview  ConocoPhillips  COP  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 82 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27 4  
Revenues are expected to be  7 83 billion  down 24 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 39 11  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ConocoPhillips 
For ConocoPhillips  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that ConocoPhillips will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that ConocoPhillips would post earnings of  0 78 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 82  delivering a surprise of  5 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
ConocoPhillips doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-conocophillips-cop-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200502374,200502374
