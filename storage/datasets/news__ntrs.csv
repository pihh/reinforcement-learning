Financial Officer Thank you  Mike  Good morning  everyone  Let me join Mike and Mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call  Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning  we reported fourth quarter net income of  371 1 million  Earnings per share were  1 70 and our return on common equity was 14 8   The current quarter s results included a  20 8 million charge recorded in other operating income related to the decision to sell substantially all of the leased portfolio and a  6 8 million software disposition charge recorded within equipment software expense  As you can see on the bottom of Page 2  the macroeconomic environment was mixed  While equity markets were strong  short term interest rates in the U S  declined both on a sequential as well as a year over year basis  Let s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter  Year over year  revenue increased 3   with noninterest income up 4  from one year ago and net interest income flat  Expenses increased 5  from last year  The provision for credit losses was a credit of  1 million in the current quarter compared to a credit of  4 million one year ago  Net income was down 9  year over year  In a sequential comparison  revenue increased 1   with both noninterest income and net interest income up 1   Expenses increased 3  compared to the prior quarter  Net income declined 3  sequentially  Return on average common equity was 14 8  for the quarter  down from 17  one year ago and 14 9  in the prior quarter  Assets under custody and administration of  12 1 trillion increased 19  compared to one year ago and were up 4  on a sequential basis  Assets under custody of  9 2 trillion were up 22  compared to one year ago and up 5  sequentially  Assets under management were  1 2 trillion  up 15  on a year over year basis and up 2  on a sequential basis  Let s look at the results in greater detail  starting with revenue on Page 4  Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was  1 6 billion  up 3  compared to last year and up 1  sequentially  Trust  investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were  992 million in the fourth quarter  up 6  from last year and up 2  sequentially  Foreign exchange trading income was  65 million in the fourth quarter  down 17  year over year and up 8  sequentially  The year over year decline is primarily related to lower foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function  Other noninterest income was  70 million in the fourth quarter  down 6  compared to one year ago and down 17  sequentially  Other operating income included the aforementioned  20 8 million loss relating to the lease portfolio  Excluding the lease related loss  the year over year growth was driven by implementation with bank owned life insurance program during 2019 and strong security commissions and trading income  The sequential growth  excluding the lease portfolio loss  was primarily driven by favorability in the visa related swap  Net interest income  which I ll discuss in more detail later  was  430 million in the fourth quarter  flat with the other period    flat with the prior period and up 1  sequentially  Now let s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5  For our Corporate   Institutional Services business  fees totaled  567 million in the fourth quarter and were up 6  year over year and up 1  on a sequential basis  Custody and fund administration fees  the largest component of C IS fees  were  397 million and up 6  year over year and up 1  on a sequential basis  The year over year performance was primarily driven by new business and favorable equity markets  Performance on a sequential basis was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and favorable markets  Assets under custody and administration for C IS clients were  11 3 trillion at quarter end  up 19  year over year and up 4  sequentially  Both the year over year and sequential performance was primarily driven by higher markets  new business and favorable currency translation  Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter s fees  with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C IS custody and fund administration fees  Investment management fees in C IS of  116 million in the fourth quarter were up 10  year over year and up 1  sequentially  The year over year performance was driven by new business and favorable markets  The sequential performance was primarily due to favorable markets  Assets under management for C IS were  917 billion  up 16  year over year and up 2  sequentially  The year over year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business as well as an increase in end of period securities lending collateral levels  We ve had strong success within our liquidity portfolio  with significant growth in our institutional cash funds  The sequential increase is primarily driven by markets  partially offset by a decline in period end securities lending collateral levels  Securities lending fees were  23 million in the fourth quarter  up 4  year over year and up 12  sequentially  The year over year increase is primarily driven by higher volumes  while the sequential increase is primarily driven by higher spreads  Securities lending collateral was  163 billion at quarter end and averaged  164 billion across the quarter  Average collateral levels increased 4  year over year and were down 7  sequentially  Moving to our Wealth Management business  trust  investment and other servicing fees were  425 million in the fourth quarter  were up 7  compared to the prior quarter and up 2  sequentially  Both the year over year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business  Assets under management were  314 billion at quarter end  up 13  year over year and up 4  sequentially  Increases were primarily driven by favorable markets  Moving on to Page 6  Net interest income was  430 million in the fourth quarter and flat compared to the prior year  Earning assets averaged  107 billion in the quarter  down 4  from the prior year  Total deposits averaged  89 billion and were down 4  versus the prior year  The net interest margin was 1 59  in the fourth quarter and was up seven basis points from a year ago  The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the balance sheet mix shift and the impact of lower foreign exchange swap volume  particularly    partially offset by lower short term interest rates versus one year ago  On a sequential quarter basis  net interest income was up 1   Average earning assets increased 2  on a sequential basis  while the net interest margin declined two basis points  It s worth noting that net interest income results for the quarter did include approximately  6 million in various onetime nonrepeating items  During the quarter  we also added to our bank owned life insurance program that was first put in place during the second quarter  Compared to the prior quarter  this quarter s net interest income declined by approximately  900 000 as a result of the additional BOLI  while other operating income benefited by  1 5 million  The full quarterly run rate will be reached in the first quarter of 2020  with an additional net interest income decline of approximately  2 3 million and other operating income increase of  2 7 million on a sequential basis  Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter  U S  dollar deposits represented 68  of our total deposits  This is down from 70  one year ago and 69  in the prior quarter  Turning to Page 7  Expenses were  1 1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 5  higher than the prior year and 3  higher versus the prior quarter  Compensation expense totaled  463 million and was up 4  compared to one year ago  The year over year growth is primarily related to higher salaries  driven by base pay adjustments and staff growth  partially offset by lower incentive expense  On a sequential basis  compensation was up 1   The sequential increase was partially due to higher salary expense  driven by staff growth and unfavorable currency translation  partially offset by lower cash based incentive pools  Employee benefit expense of  93 million was up 2  from one year ago and was up 6  sequentially  The year over year growth was primarily driven by higher payroll taxes  while the sequential growth was primarily due to increased medical costs  As it pertains to our benefits expense in 2020  due to changes in underlying assumptions  we expect to see an increase in full year pension expense of just over  30 million  which represents 0 7  increase in our overall total 2019 expense base  Outside services costs of  206 million were up 5  on a year over year basis and up 6  sequentially  The year over year growth was primarily driven by higher technical services  consulting and legal expense  The sequential increase was primarily due to higher legal and consulting services as well as costs related to increased business volumes  including brokerage clearing  market data  sub custody and third party advisor fees  Equipment software expense of  165 million was up 8  from one year ago and up 9  sequentially  Both the year over year and sequential growth were impacted by the previously mentioned software disposition charge of  6 8 million  The year over year growth also reflects higher depreciation and amortization  while higher software amortization costs contributed to the sequential increase  Occupancy expense of  57 million was up 15  from one year ago and up 8  sequentially  Both the year over year and sequential increases were driven by higher rent and building operation costs related to our workplace real estate strategies  Other operating expense of  88 million was down 1  from one year ago and down 4  sequentially  The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the Northern Trust sponsored golf tournament in the prior quarter  partially offset by increases in advertising  staff related and other operating expense categories  As we ve discussed on previous calls  through our Value for Spend initiative that we started in 2017  we ve been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing  250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020  Our current quarter results reflect approximately  60 million in expense savings or  240 million in annualized run rate savings  Our efforts around Value for Spend and productivity more broadly will not cease as we further embed a culture of sustainable expense management across the company  Expense management is a core emphasis  and we continue to focus on striking the right balance between productivity  growth and investing in the business  Now turning to full year  our results in 2019 are summarized on Page 8  Net income was  1 5 billion  down 4  compared with 2018  and earnings per share were  6 63  flat with the prior year  On the right margin of this page  we outline the nonrecurring impacts that were called out for both years  We achieved a return on equity for the year of 14 9  compared to 16 2  in 2018  The full year revenue expense trends are outlined on Page 9  Trust  investment and other servicing fees grew 3  in 2019  The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets  partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation  Foreign exchange trading income declined 18   driven by a decrease in foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function as well as decreases in market volatility and lower client volumes  Net interest income increased 3   Average earning assets during the year declined by 6   while net interest margin increased 14 basis points  The net result was 2  growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2019  On a reported basis  expenses were up 3  from the prior year  Adjusting for the expense charges in both 2018 and 2019 that are on the prior page  expenses were also up 3  from 2018  Now turning to Page 10  Our capital ratios remain strong where common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12 7  under the standardized approach and 13 3  under the advanced approach  The supplementary leverage ratio of the corporation was 7 6  and at the bank was 6 4   both of which achieved 3  minimum requirement  During the fourth quarter  we declared cash dividends totaling  150 million to common stockholders and repurchased 2 6 million shares of common stock at a cost of  264 million  These two factors combined represent a payout ratio of approximately 113  for the quarter  Also during the fourth quarter  Northern Trust issued  400 million in perpetual preferred stock at a fixed for life dividend rate of 4 7  callable in five years  Fixed rate dividends for this new issuance are expected to be paid on a quarterly basis  with the first dividend declared at our Board of Directors meeting earlier this week and to be paid April 1  2020  Given the November issuance  the initial preferred dividend payment will cover approximately five months and therefore is expected to equal  7 6 million in the first quarter of 2020  Going forward  these fixed rate dividends are expected to be  4 7 million per quarter  The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C preferred stock in January    on January 2  2020  First quarter 2020 results will include  11 5 million in accelerated Series C related costs  Now let me turn the call back over to Mike for closing comments Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Before we open up the call for Q A  I wanted to close by talking about our key financial objectives and our performance against these in 2019  Our primary financial target is to achieve a return on average common equity of between 10  to 15   For 2019  our ROE of 14 9  was at the high end of that range  This was the sixth consecutive year we have achieved our targeted ROE  We are also focused on driving profitable growth and have objectives to achieve both fee operating leverage and positive operating leverage  Although we have achieved positive fee operating leverage in eight of the last 10 years and positive operating leverage in seven of the last 10 years  we did not achieve those for 2019  As we enter 2020  we are continuing to rapidly evolve the company by providing differentiated services and experiences to our clients and investing in innovative capabilities to do more for our existing clients and gain new clients  We combine this with our intense focus on improving our productivity to profitably grow the company and create value for our stakeholders  This concludes our prepared remarks  Thank you again for participating in the Northern Trust fourth quarter earnings conference call today  Jason  Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions  David  could you please open the line  Questions   Answers  OperatorAbsolutely   Operator instructions  And our first question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Hey  guys  Good morning  everybody  Mike  picking up on the last point  I guess when you talk about operating leverage  I guess  over the last few quarters  you guys talked about getting organic expense growth to be in line with organic fee growth  not just total fee growth  I guess  question number one there  is the organic fee growth still in the 3  to 4  kind of range as you look out into 2020  And then secondly  should we expect you to achieve this level of expense growth for the full year sort of despite the fact that markets are starting off on a very strong point  and that should naturally create more kind of pressure or more tailwinds  rather  to fees  And I m just wondering whether or not the sort of level of expense growth could be sustainable into 2020 Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer So Alex  I think you re thinking about the framework the right way  which is  as I mentioned earlier  we are focused on the objective of generating positive fee operating leverage  And underneath that is the goal to achieve that on an organic basis as well  knowing that  that is a higher bar  if you will  But the reason why we focus on an organic basis is because just as you indicated  when markets are stronger  we expect that we ll get more positive fee operating leverage from that  It s more challenging to achieve that in  call it  lower growth environments than when we do have the tailwinds  but that s why it s important to have that primary objective around organic  In 2019  we did not achieve the organic fee operating leverage  And that s something that  certainly  as far as what we re shooting for  we re trying to get that so that if we would have achieved it  we would have positive fee operating leverage here for the year  And going into 2020  it s the same objective  Now as Jason talked about and can go into more detail  there are certain aspects of the expense base that roll in  in this case  pension  as he mentioned  for example   30 million increase for the year  We still look to cover that  if you will  and try to just focus on the productivity objectives to try to overcome things like that as well  So the goals haven t changed  From year to year  we can have different challenges to achieve it  But as far as what we re trying to achieve  it s the same objective Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Got it  Thanks for that  And then  Jason  one cleanup for you for NIR  It sounded like there were  6 million of onetime  I believe it was a benefit in Q4  Can you flesh that out a little bit  So what are those benefits and maybe help us bridge the kind of the right jumping off point for Q1  20 NIR as we zone in an on the quarter here Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Yes  You got the headline number right  It s about  6 million  It s a combination of a couple of different items  There s some premium AM  And then one thing we didn t headline much  but we did have a payoff of a non accruable loan    that was a nonaccrual  We picked up another  2 million in interest on that  And then the FTE adjustment was a couple of million dollars higher  So you add those factors together and you get to the  6 million Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Thank you OperatorOur next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research Jim Mitchell    Buckingham Research    Analyst Hey  Good morning  guys  Can we just talk a little bit about the period end balance sheet  It really kind of spiked  Is that what    should we take that as a sort of transitory  Because if you look at average balances  they weren t up that much  Or is there something that s continuing into 1Q that we should maybe up our assumptions around deposit growth  given Fed actions  etc  Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Yes  You re right  it was high  I actually look back to see if this is a record high  It wasn t but it was close  But more importantly  it did come    it has come back down  The    obviously  as you know  the balance sheet tends to spike at the end of the quarters and particularly the end of the years  This was higher than normal  not a record  but already  we ve seen more normalization as some of the large clients that put money back to work into the market in different ways Jim Mitchell    Buckingham Research    Analyst OK  Thanks  And then maybe just a follow up on the comp line and expenses going forward  Just on    you had headcount growth of 5   So how do we think about that kind of upward pressure from headcount growth versus your desire to kind of the scalable decision  trying to keep core expense growth organic below growth  but we re kind of starting off with a much higher employee base  how do we think about the comp line specifically Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer So a couple of things  And maybe you might be looking at Page 7 of the press release and you get the comp line there  And I look at it more on Q4  18 versus Q4  19 and you ve got a 4  growth rate there  So the first thing that from my lens is to say  what was revenue growth  What was really trust fee growth over that time frame  And it was about 6 25   So first of all  on that comp line  even though it s a tiny bit higher than we d like to see  we did get leverage in that  which is good  And we re in a year where we ve got revenue up  a lot of our expenses are going to bring    a lot of our revenue growth is going to bring with it expense growth  and it s going to hit in just about every one of the key expense line items  including comp  The second thing to    for us to think about is that in general  we ve got a technology investment that we re making  And so that part of the reason that number may be a little higher is that some of the tech investments that we re making in the business are coming through in that top line  And third  just so you guys are thinking about it the right way coming into the next year  we re always going to have effectively  call it   30 million to  40 million base pay adjustment for the top line  And so you think about that on the base of business that we have here  that s going to lead to almost one point  in and of itself  in the growth  So those are just a couple of ways  different lenses to think about that line item OperatorOur next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    Analyst I just wanted to follow up a little bit on that regarding just technology in general  I know in the past  you ve given some insight on what your tech budget is  Maybe you could give us a little sense as to how you see that trajecting over time  I know you don t give guidance but just to understand  do you think that trajectory is accelerating  decelerating  And then how you see that shifting over time  comp versus noncomp as it relates to tech Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Yes  So it s obviously    we ve got a high sense of urgency as we think about expenses in general  and tech is where it is outsized relative to the other areas  And so you re right to hone in on it  A couple of data points as you think about next year  One is  as I take a step back  we thought about what we wanted to convey that we know about  We don t want to give guidance on expenses  but we do want to tell you what we know at this point  And there are some things that we have high degree of certainty of as we sit  at this point  coming into 2020  So I m going to do those in three buckets just to put those out  One  I hinted to a couple of minutes ago  and that comes down to the compensation line  We know that we re going to see  in general  a lot of    somewhere between  35 million   40 million just in base pay adjustments  based on the business that we have  Secondly  we talked about pension being a little over  30 million higher  And then third is  we have a sense right now of what IT depreciation is going to look like  and that s about  40 million higher for the year in 2020 than it was    than it will be as we look back on 2019  Now some of that is reflected in the fourth quarter  And so we can    it s hard for us to develop  Inaudible  but we do know that on a year over year  Inaudible   40 million higher  So those are three key items that I think everybody    we want to make sure everybody is aware of because that we ve got clear line of sight on them at this point  And the second  more broadly  as we think about how do we depict the IT budget and this IT increase  it is actually hitting in a lot of different line items  So just we re talking about Page 7 on the press release a minute ago  stay there for a second and if you look at these different line items  I actually went back and pulled out IT from each of the different components that you can see externally to get a sense of how much they re impacting those growth areas because I do look at not just comp  which we were talking about a second ago  but all of those line items  trying to get a sense of whether we re getting leverage there  And obviously  the biggest    it hits very heavily in equipment and software  which is why you ll see that line item be pretty elevated  But there s also smaller but still meaningful impacts that will hit in obviously  compensation  employee benefits and outside services Betsy Graseck    Morgan Stanley    Analyst And is it still around  1 billion that you re thinking the tech budget was in 2019  I recall that was the estimate that was given most recently Mark Bette    Director of Investor Relations Yes  Betsy  this is Mark  Yes  about    we look at it kind of on a 3 year rolling average  so 2019  2020  2021  a little bit over  1 billion per year  and that includes both operating expense as well as capital investments OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Maybe just a question on NII  Is there any impact on future net interest income from the sale of the leasing portfolio  And if so  if you can quantify that  And then also  if you can talk about what you re seeing for deposit trends into 1Q so far Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer So on    I m just going to write down deposit trends  On the impact of more lease on NIM  very de minimis increase  nothing to really think about  That s pretty clean accounting perspective on how that was hit  And then secondly  on deposit trends coming in more broadly  I know that it s    first of all  it s a strategic focus for us across the business on both the Wealth side and on the C IS side  And we ve talked about on  the Wealth side in particular  we told you about the strategic initiatives we have there to bring    that brought some money out of the 2a 7 funds on to the balance sheet  That s held in pretty well  And then I d say  on the Institutional side of the business  it s more volatile  And there s no    the initiatives that we have there aren t as aggressive as what we ve been thinking about on the Wealth side  but we re still doing everything we can to make sure we re getting a good share of our deposits    of the deposits coming in from clients as the custody book grows and as we re talking to clients across the globe Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Is this still on an averaging basis  Is that    are you expecting growth in 1Q based on those initiatives  I know the end of period was elevated  of course  but if we think about it average to average Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer No  I think there was a    if you think about the asset side and then the funding side  if you think about NIM  the only other item there of note  there was a little bit  and it s a couple of billion dollars higher on that  but didn t really come more from the deposit side  it came more from trading related activity  And so there s nothing I d call out at this point that would lead you to say that deposits would be moderately or significantly different Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    Analyst OK  Great  And then on organic growth  I think you commented on Wealth Management  AUM being up mostly from the markets  Just wanted to get a sense  that s been a strong driver of organic growth for you guys for a while  I just want to get a sense of the cadence of the organic growth trends in Wealth Management versus the asset servicing business  And as you think about expenses  are we still thinking about a comparable growth rate in expense growth  even with those headwinds that you ve mentioned on the comp pension and the IT side  Is that still reasonable to think of a rate of growth that would be similar to the organic growth  if that s still like trending toward the mid single digits Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer When you hit the top side first on the growth side and the trends within the Wealth business  the business is continuing to do well  And Mike touched on it earlier this year  some really nice differentiated approaches that  that business has the market with goals driven Wealth Management  resonates very well  And the trend there that continues to be seen and come through on the financials  and you guys are able to see this actually  is that we re doing well at the very top end of the market  And so the family office business is growing faster  and you can see that in the numbers we report on both a sequential basis and a year over year basis  That trend has been going on for a while  and it s attractive  And then the second component is how we ll see the expenses aligned differently between the business  I m going to separate it in a couple of ways  One is that the tech related expenses apply a little bit more toward the C IS side of the business  As we think about things like matrix and our strategic operating model  those things are going to be allocated a little bit more toward the C IS side of the business  That said  the Wealth side of the business is also investing in different ways  and they re working hard on digitizing the business  Mike talked about that earlier  that we re probably a little ahead in our investments there on the C IS side  Wealth is starting to think more about how to reflect the digital transformation that we ve seen across the marketplace and how we can take our position with things like and Wealth Management  make it even more accessible to clients  have even better interactions and have better foundational technology Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    Analyst And are we still thinking about organic growth in that sort of mid single digit area on a go forward basis  sort of low to mid single digits Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Brian  just to confirm  are you talking about wealth or the corporation as a whole Brian Bedell    Deutsche Bank    Analyst The company as a whole Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Yes  So maybe just to address that  Brian  kind of across the businesses  So Jason talked about Wealth Management  We continued to see  as you mentioned  healthy  solid growth in that business  That s the nature of it  And again  our strategic imperative in that business is to increase or accelerate that growth even more  We re still seeing a higher growth rate in our asset servicing business  And so that continues  It s at the lower end of its range  but it continues to grow at a healthy rate  And the strategic imperative for that business is  yes  to continue that growth but we want to see that growth be more scalable  And then I would just also add  with our Asset Management business  we re all well aware of the secular trends in the industry there  And I would say  that certainly impacted our Asset Management business  although comparatively  the business is performing well  And so it s experiencing positive organic growth  just meaning they re able to increase the flows but also then change the mix in such a way that it is offsetting the fee compression that you re seeing across the industry  So it s positive  Having said that  it is at a lower rate than the other two businesses  So you put that all together  to your point  we ve talked about the organic growth rate for our fees at the company level kind of being mid single digits  That s still the case  We re at the lower end of that right now  So what does that mean  Well  that s why we re focused on our growth strategies and executing on those  But that s why one of our other key priorities for the company is on continually improving our productivity  And when we are at the lower end of the growth side  we have to work just that much harder on the expense side to get more savings  if you will  on the expense side  So that s the strategy  if you will  and again  focused on trying to execute that so that we can deliver the positive fee operating leverage OperatorOur next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies Ken Usdin    Jefferies    Analyst Jason  could you expand a little bit more on    underneath the fact that you said that some of the balances might have gone off the balance sheet  can you help us understand either how much you saw as like the overgrowth in the earning assets this quarter  And then secondarily  if rates stay stable from here  can you talk us through the dynamics of NIM in terms of how much asset repricing has to come through and how much deposit repricing you could still see happen now that we ve gotten to a more stable level of banks Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Sure  So on the first  I think it s    as these spikes happen late in the quarter  it s frankly a relatively short period of time that these spikes are on balance sheet  And so it comes in late and at least pretty early  And so    and we re not doing anything fancy when those dollars come in  And so frankly  it just doesn t impact the overall NIM very much  It does spike that we re obviously looking at the balance sheet on a daily basis  It spikes that and    but it doesn t    I don t think it really drives NIM that much at the end of the day  And then as we look out into next quarter  I don t think that spike should necessarily be reflected in your thought process as you think about    so that s more from a volume perspective  As you think about    although I did hint earlier that kind of that  2 billion increase in the securities portfolio  I do think that s likely to come down  and that had more to do with  I think  more idiosyncratic trading that was happening at the time  Nothing abnormal  we just said we re trading some more longer dated securities and the security settlement process led to higher securities being on  That s really what led to that little bit of an average increase  and I think that will update  As we think about the rates going forward into the first quarter  the thing that we can all see that we ll have maybe more of an impact than what people realize is that Fed funds to LIBOR spread  And that did have an impact in fourth quarter  And when we talked to everyone at the conference we attended and then on the last call  we were looking at the spread there  It was more probably 13 or 14 basis points  And we thought that was going to go away  It actually held in  it even expanded a little bit  But now that compression that we anticipated has actually come to fruition  And if you look at that delta right now  it s more on the 9  10 basis point land  And so that is a factor that if that holds in  that would have an impact on what we would think about for NIM for next quarter Ken Usdin    Jefferies    Analyst OK  And then do you have the ability to reprice much on the right side of the balance sheet  Can you just talk us about customer dynamics outside of just market index type of deposits  Like how is the discussion going with clients  And what opportunities do you still have to reduce rate Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Yes  It s just so incredibly different between the businesses  And so on the Institutional side  first of all  the deposits there are driven a lot more by our EMEA clients  And in that thought  those clients are shopping in real time  And so we re making very tight decisions on those  and we can only    we re going to get what the market gives us  frankly  And so    and we re not in a position to be a price leader there  Now on the other side of the business  the Wealth business  very different dynamics  And there  we talked again about the fact that we sunset at an anchor sweep product  and we brought assets from the 2a 7 funds out of the balance sheet  We re looking much more there and can think about what we want to be strategically in the marketplace  And to give you some headlines on how we talk about it  we do want to    we want to be very attractive for large depositors  And so that s where we re going to be much more competitive  And for more of the retail client base  we re going to be less competitive  And    but at the top end of the market there  we re always trying to figure out how to attract and be extremely aggressive about retaining our top depositors OperatorOur next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research Steven Chubak    Wolfe Research    Analyst So just wanted to start off with a question on capital  I know that in the past  you ve discussed the business need to manage to higher ratios  to ensure you don t deviate meaningfully  at least from some of your GSIB peers are running closer to 12  plus  given that you re competing with some of these firms for RFPs  And I was hoping you can maybe just unpack or speak to some of the competitive considerations  such as RFPs versus regulatory constraints  It looks like the regulatory changes are swinging the right way in terms of SLR relief  potential for the elimination of leverage constraints in CCAR  I m just wondering if some of those changes come through  how that informs your willingness or appetite to manage to a lower target over time Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer It s Mike  Why don t I start off  So first of all  as you would expect  we feel very good about our capital levels and our flexibility with regards to capital  As you ve highlighted  we are always cognizant and focused on what the implications would be on the business for our capital levels  And that can play into formalized RFP processes where  yes  we want to compare favorably to some of our competitors  But also just more broadly  and I ll say even subjectively with our Wealth Management business  dealing with large family offices  they are looking for safety and security  conservative  strong balance sheet  And so it s a part of the business strategy for us  Having said that  like any resource  it needs to be balanced  And so we re comfortable with where we are  To your point  we re cognizant of where our competitor capital levels are  And to the extent that those move  that gives us more flexibility on that front  And then the last thing I would add is from a regulatory lens  as you ve talked about  there are changes on the regulatory front  Having said that  they ve also recently recategorized banks  We re a category 2 bank  We happen to be the only category 2 bank  which we take as a compliment  reflecting the unique nature of our business model  But it also does mean  once again  we have to work our way through whatever changes that may mean as far as capital management for us  We re not concerned about anything per se  but there just is some uncertainty until they fully roll out the implications of category 2 on capital management expectations Steven Chubak    Wolfe Research    Analyst No  very helpful color  And just one follow up for me  just a clean up question on the other income line  Even when we adjust for the one timers in the quarter  it looks like that was a source of revenue strength  And I was hoping to gauge the sustainability of some of that strength versus the  50 million core level in 4Q  And just given some of the guidance on BOLI related impacts  how we should think about what could be a reasonable or appropriate run rate for that line in 2020  recognizing there s always mark to market and other noise Mark Bette    Director of Investor Relations Steven  it s Mark  As you said  if you adjust for the lease  we would have been at closer to the  50 million mark  There was    the BOLI benefit came into that line  That will continue to have a little bit of a bump up in the first quarter  like Jason said  I would say that the mark to market adjustment on the Visa was favorable this quarter  about a  5 million sequential benefit  which there was more of a negative drag on that last quarter for some of the adjustments that we made there  This quarter  when you take that into account as well as the BOLI  we did have a little bit higher miscellaneous income and credit and bank related fees  probably higher than normal  One way that I would say that you can look at that line because it does move around is if you do strip out some of the nonrecurring items that we ve had in that line  You re probably looking at an average of about  35 million over the last several quarters  And then in theory  you could layer BOLI on top of that  That would be one way to look at it OperatorOur next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS Brennan Hawken    UBS    Analyst I just had a follow up from a few of the questions that have been asked so far and just wanted to try and frame it in the best way to think about 1Q NII  And Jason  I know    welcome to the circus  our quarterly circus here with your first call  I know your predecessor had started to help us think about one quarter out NII  I know that was a departure from Northern s normal course of business  I don t know what your plan is going forward  but it does seem like there s a lot of noise  So if you could help us frame how to think about 1Q  You guys sold some of the lease portfolio  so I m guessing we need to shrink that average earning asset bucket a bit  We ve got an over earning of about  6 million  You ve got the tighter Fed funds LIBOR  How should we think about how all this will weigh on NII as we go into 1Q based on what you ve seen so far Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Right  Well  I think    Brennan  I think you ve got all the pieces  The way I think about leading into it  another couple of items  one  you talked about the one timers of really  5 million   6 million  secondly  I mentioned that LIBOR Fed fund spread  I think that s a very important one as you think about how to model this out  And then you mentioned BOLI  which having that in place now for a full quarter because remember  we didn t have it in place last year  The benefit of that  even if you just assume the same type of economics that we experienced this time  should be a positive  5 million  And then lastly  we haven t talked about the day count is going to work against us if you re thinking about it on a sequential basis  We ll go from 92  not to 90 but to 91 with leap year  And    but those are the    in my mind  those are the big four buckets to use as a starting point Brennan Hawken    UBS    Analyst OK  And then when we think about the average balance sheet  it looked like there was a big    a bit of a jump in the other liabilities this quarter  and it s at the highest level that it s been in a couple of years by about  1 billion  Should we    is that temporary  Obviously  it was enough to skew the average balance for the fourth quarter  So is there something unusual happening that will prove sustainable  Or should we just expect that to wind down in 1Q Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer That s as same thing as earlier that had to do with more of the nature of the securities we were trading that had more time and were in settlement mode for longer  And so that s what I think will drive  bringing that    the securities portfolio down to a more normalized level Brennan Hawken    UBS    Analyst OK  Like TBAs or something Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Yes  More TBAs and mortgages  Just some    nothing that we don t normally do  just with a little higher mix of those items that led to a higher level of security setting  And obviously  we re not getting the yield on those as they re sitting  And so the other thing I just mentioned  I think    you re right  there is kind of a lot of question about where NIM is going  and we had gotten in a mode of talking about what we expect and effectively providing guidance  And I ll say at this point  we do think NIM will be down 2  to 4   But   Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer NII Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer NII will be down 2  to 4   And so it s not to say that every quarter  we re going to give that  But I do think    we gave you guys a handful of different items that you had to square up to get a good launch point  And so I think putting it out there this quarter is fair Brennan Hawken    UBS    Analyst OK  Terrific  And that s off the reported number in 4Q  right  the  107 million  what we should base that minus 2  to 4  Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Off of the reported net interest income of  430 million  right Brennan Hawken    UBS    Analyst Sorry  sorry  Yes Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer And so that s not indicating    just to be super clear  it s not indicating the  159 million is going to be down 2  to 4   Just the  430 million in dollars  we d expect to be down about 2  to 4  based on the items I walked through Brennan Hawken    UBS    Analyst Got it  NII  not NIM Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Right OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst I don t want to focus too much on one year  but when you look at the like not hitting the op leverage target  was that more of a function of higher necessary investments that came up during the year  Or was it lighter organic growth than maybe expected  And since you mentioned some of the expense items heading into 2020 on comp  pension and tech  are there any areas like maybe real estate that you could see some savings  given some of the repositioning that you guys have been working on Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Yes  I ll start with the second  which we have mentioned that we expect occupancy to be higher in the short run as we ve got some double leased    double rent payments that we have effectively  And for those who have been as close to it  we re going through a transition of a very large number of seats from a building we ve been in for a long time in Chicago to a new building  We re starting to move people in this month  A lot of the move is going to take place next month  and so we re right in the midst of that  And so you can imagine  we re still obviously paying rent facility  And also  we started a new facility  There s a lot of work that goes around making sure that move is taking place  And there are other areas around the footprint overall from a real estate perspective  that s going to lead to a higher level of rent in the first half of this year  Now in the second half of the year  we should get some benefit from that  and so that s something that we ll actually see come down  We ll eventually grow into that run rate  but we re expecting to actually see that line to come down in the second half of the year  Mike  anything you want to add to that Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Yes  just to the first part of your question there about the year  and again  it is a year but part of the trend there and so what came out of that  One  much broader perspective pulling back from it is  if you look at our expense base overall  the    I m going to call them technology expenses  So this is the expenses for our technology group and the IT  depreciation and amortization represents about 20  of our cost base  and that grew at 8   If you look at the other 80  of our cost base  it grew at about 2   And so I would say  across that 80   for the most part  we hit on the costs related to the business to bring on new clients  and importantly  hitting on our Value for Spend initiatives and the objectives there  So it s not that we didn t achieve those  And then you say  well  on the technology side  what happened there  And there  if you think about technology or as I think about technology  there s three primary things that we re trying to achieve there  one is security  two is stability  and three is scalability within our technology  And if you look at the costs that were related to that in the year  there were costs that we had on the safety and stability part  which ended up being higher than we would have expected going into the year but are things that you absolutely do in order to make sure that you are being able to provide the value proposition  if you will  for your clients  And then likewise on the scalability  there are certain aspects of that  where the greater demand for  I ll call it  just computing power  if you will  on the part of our large asset manager clients on some of the asset owner clients  we re just in an environment where there is greater activity  and we didn t achieve the level of  I would say  scalability on our platform that we need to be able to achieve  So with each of those 3  not only are we trying to ensure we have a strong  safe  stable  secure platform  but we want to increase the scalability on that  So a lot of the focus of our technology strategy beyond kind of digitizing the business and providing new capabilities for our clients is also saying  how do we also get greater productivity out of that platform Michael Carrier    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst OK  That s helpful  And just a quick follow up  Tax rate was a little bit lower  You guys mentioned some of the drivers  Jason  I d    just any like change in terms of the range that you guys typically expect when we think it about going forward Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer I ll start  This quarter had some impact even from newer lease  some other small items  none of which  in and of themselves  we re calling out  But I don t think you should expect us to be at this 22  level  And we talked  I think Biff mentioned last time on the call  it s something in the 24s  I do think 24  is a better longer term assumption at this point OperatorOur next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research Rob Wildhack    Autonomous Research    Analyst On the C IS business  can you give us an update on what you re seeing in the competitive landscape and on the pricing front  And then maybe more broadly  when you think about the conversations you re having with clients  did those discussions change in tone or content at all recently  And how would you expect them to evolve going forward Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Sure  I d be glad to talk about it  So there s a tremendous amount of activity in C IS broadly and specifically  I would say  asset servicing  And I would say a lot of these changes  well  certainly  they create challenges  We re very optimistic about the growth opportunities that are out there  So if you just give me a minute to run across it  I think I can address some of these trends that you re looking for  So if we think about asset owners  even in the parts of the asset owner space that you might think about as being more stable in just their operating models  they have greater needs  and greater needs certainly lead to more opportunities for us  So if you think about the not for profit sector  Health care is an area that continues to grow and presents opportunities for us to manage the assets of large healthcare organization  Universities  where you have endowments  and also the foundation space  they ve increased the mix on the investment side to greater use of alternatives  And then as a result  they have greater needs for how they manage those portfolios and those managers  and that s why we ve invested in and are rolling out what we call front office solutions because that gives them the capability to do that  If you look in Australia  for example  some of the large superannuation fund  not only had that been a great growth opportunity for us over the last decade  but likewise  you re seeing consolidation within the superannuation complex  which again presents changes in the marketplace and opportunities for us  And the last thing I would say in the asset owner space is more of the very large  sophisticated clients  So if you think about the sovereign wealth funds are actually in sourcing some of the asset management as opposed to allocating it all out to asset managers  What that requires is then they need to have the capabilities to operate as asset managers  So they have data    greater data needs  and the nature and timing of what they need is greater  and so that provides opportunities for us  That drives a lot of the investment that you hear about because it s now putting them in a different position  And then if I shift to the asset management space  we talk a lot about the pressure of the secular trends  and we feel that in our Asset Management business as well  but it does create opportunities for us on the asset servicing side because it causes these asset managers to look at every aspect of their business  including the operations side  And so that presents opportunities for us where they re looking to outsource more activities  Now historically  as you know  that s meant mostly middle office and what we do in IOO  We are seeing more of those types of opportunities in the marketplace  But there are also some new activities that previously were just largely done in house by everybody that they re now saying why should they do those and it shouldn t be a part of their outsourcing solutions  So if you think about the trading side  where we have integrated trading solutions  that s really an outsourced trading service that we would provide to them that enables them to essentially move something that s not core to them and that we can do it better and more efficiently for them  And there are other opportunities like that  I would also just continue with the asset managers to the alternative space  where for years  the hedge fund space has presented growth opportunities for us  Our hedge fund services business continues to grow nicely  win large mandates  as you saw this last year  But then also  for us  in the other parts of the alternative space  so thinking private equity  infrastructure  real estate  those are areas where we ve had less of a market share or market position there  but it presents larger growth opportunities for us going forward  So overall  a high level of activity  And that s why when we talk about the growth  we re optimistic about the growth  and we just want to make sure that we re able to bring that on in a scalable way so that we get very profitable growth in the business OperatorOur next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan Vivek Juneja    J P  Morgan    Analyst A couple of questions  Mike  just following up on that last question  So you talked comprehensively about a lot of the volume related opportunities  How about pricing  What are you seeing as you continue to expand into all of these new areas Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Sure  Good point  And there s no doubt  clients want more for less  and that cuts across all parts of that sector there  So we look at the fee pressure in the asset servicing business as just ongoing  So we don t necessarily see  I would say  a repricing cycle per se that starts and then ends and then we don t do anything  It s ongoing for us  And that s part of the organic growth equation  So we re always netting out the    not only if we lose the client or they drop a service  but also if there s repricing that happens in order to maintain the client  Now the other aspect of that  which is just a dynamic with that business is because large portions of it are based on the asset levels  the pricing is based on the asset levels  and so as you see greater appreciation in the market  then that does mean  yes  we get the benefit where the fees go up  but that s then when you see greater fee pressure  So it s terrific for us that the markets are going up  It does then create more focus on the parts of the client base to look at their fees  And that s why overall  what we re trying to do is balance that but also broaden these relationships  do more for them so that there s still very profitable relationships overall Vivek Juneja    J P  Morgan    Analyst And as you re trying to build all of these areas  and as you said  you need the tech capabilities for that  is there room to bend the growth rate of that tech spend a little bit or not quite yet Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer We believe that there is  Mark talked earlier about when we think about our tech spend  you have the expense side of it  which we focus a lot on here and we talk a lot  and Jason s mentioned the increased amortization cost that comes through  Well  the other piece of that is that capex piece that Mark mentioned  which is the capitalization of those costs happen now  They manifest themselves in expenses later  And that s an area where not only we ve been focused  but I think there s much more opportunity when you think about how technology is developed these days to be able to do it in a more cost efficient way  I think you re all familiar with Agile and other methodologies  Well  we re deploying those  but it s still in the earlier stages  That  in my mind  will produce savings  It first hits through more efficient capital spend  and then later over time  it results in lower amortization Vivek Juneja    J P  Morgan    Analyst One more  if I may  on the funding side  Your noninterest bearing deposits did pretty well  They actually turned around and grew again in the fourth quarter  And conversely  your short term borrowings have been shrinking over the course of 2019  So can you comment on both those  Have noninterest bearing deposits basically turned and should be growing  Or what s your outlook on that  And what do you plan to do with short term borrowings Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer You can start  Mark Mark Bette    Director of Investor Relations Yes  On the demand deposits  we did see an increase sequentially  Vivek  I don t think that we re calling this an inflection point  We ve talked before over the last several quarters  we do have  especially  I would say  on the Institutional side  fluctuations that occur quarter to quarter  with clients either positioning their assets on  or our off balance sheet  depending on what they might be doing with their own capital investing  So I don t know that we would call out a specific new trend on demand deposits here  starting with what we just saw in the fourth quarter  We ll have to see how that plays out over several quarters Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Yes Mark Bette    Director of Investor Relations And on the short term borrowing side  I would say there  that is a    if you look back a year ago  three  four  five quarters ago  I would say that some of the discretionary leveraging that we are doing within the treasury area was running at a higher level  And now at this point  over the last couple of quarters  we ve kind of had that down at a lower level  And that manifests itself both in wholesale deposits on the non U S  office line but also in those short term borrowings  So that s    it s really just a function of the leveraging opportunity to kind of gross up the balance sheet  The trade there isn t at the tripping point where we would actually go through with that  so we ve kind of reduced some of that discretionary leveraging that we do Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer And it s not to say we wouldn t do it again Mark Bette    Director of Investor Relations Right Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer The rate environment today just isn t providing that trade for us OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler Jeff Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst Sorry about that  Can you hear me now Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Yes Jeff Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst So a lot of talk about expenses  but kind of with the growth you guys can deliver on the top line  I tend to think a little more of kind of margins  In 2019  X items saw kind of our first pre tax margin compression in what s been a number of years  Looking to 2020 and given that you need to keep investing in the current rate environment and with kind of organic fee growth is near the bottom end of the kind of range  should we expect a return to margin expansion in 2020  even with those kind of things facing us Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Yes  I ll start  Before we get to pre tax margin  we re looking at our expenses relative to our fees  and the reason why we do that is just the nature of the expenses and how they re lined up against the different revenue streams  And so there s no question because we re focused on positive key operating leverage  That s because we re saying we want to bring down that ratio first  And on that front  again  it s affected by markets and other things  but that s why we focus on the organic part because we want to be able to drive that down  Then if you go to the pre tax margin  yes  some of that flows through  But as you know then  it gets much more impacted by what s happening with the other revenues  to some extent  things like FX and the other income line  but mostly net interest income  And we re trying to provide what we see in the marketplace as far as deposits and deposits pricing and things like that and quarter by quarter  but that gives you some indication of as we know  from not only last year  but every year  it s really hard to project interest rates  And that s a big factor that drives in it  and it s also a tougher time to predict client deposit activity  and that drives in it  So that s just saying  it s not that we aren t focused on positive fee    positive operating leverage as well  It s just there are more factors that  frankly  are out of our control and even difficult to forecast to be able to answer a question of like   Well then  is your pre tax margin going to go up or down   We certainly are aiming for it to go up  but there are things that are out of our control Jeff Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst So we think of kind of the interest rate environment holding stable in some of the markets  stuff like FX trading  not really declining  These pre tax margin kind of expansion should    is potentially attainable Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer Yes  dependent on the environment  you re right  It can make it more difficult  or it can give us a tailwind Jeff Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst OK  And secondly  with the preferred issuance and redemption  can you just review what kind of we should be thinking about the net impact on preferred dividends  And that s general to some weird stuff in the first quarter  but then even after that  what kind of run rate we should be looking at Mark Bette    Director of Investor Relations Jeff  it s Mark  Yes  So when you look at    if you look back at what our prepared remarks were  the new Series E will have essentially  call it  a five month dividend in the first quarter  which would be  7 6 million  There s also some costs from Series C that we would also need to recognize upon redeeming it in the first quarter  so that s  11 5 million  And then we have the Series D  which you see in the first and third quarter of each year  So if you take all that into consideration  at this point  our expectation is you re probably looking at a preferred dividend right around  30 million   30 5 million in the first quarter  And then in the second quarter  you come down to the normal new dividend for Series E  which is  4 7 million  and that would be the new run rate in the quarter where we don t have the Series D  Hopefully  that helps  We could talk through it off line  if you d like Jeff Harte    Piper Sandler    Analyst OK  No  that s great OperatorOur next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW Brian Kleinhanzl    KBW    Analyst Just a quick question on all these expenses  I mean you have a normal expense investment that you re doing  Was the three items that you laid out  the pension expense  the base pay adjust and the IT depreciation  included in that growth rate already  Are you saying that you re investing and then you have to still consider these three additional items that are going to be on top of it Jason Tyler    Chief Financial Officer Portion of it  So the base pay adjustments are    that s always factored into how we think about our expectations for expense growth  The pension is obviously anomalous  and that s one that s not forecast  And Mike mentioned earlier  we re not ignoring it  We still want to do everything we can to get leverage in that  And then the depreciation increase  we ve known that we re going to be leaning into more IT spend in the short run  at least  And so I d say the base pay adjustment s fully factored into our long term assumptions  The pension  not  but we re still working hard to try to even cover that  And then the third element of IT depreciation  and part of that s already in the run rate  And so that s the key element there  But the increase itself is one    we have to own it  And we ve got it    there s a high sense of urgency about making sure we get leverage across each of the key expense items  including equipment and software  At some point  that s going to be difficult to do in the near term  given what we re trying to do strategically  But certainly  the BPA and a portion of the depreciation reflected in our long term expectations Brian Kleinhanzl    KBW    Analyst OK  And then separately  in the Asset Management  here again the organic growth  not kind of where you want it to be  I mean at what point do you need to do something bigger with regards to restructuring the unit or taking more strategic actions there Mike O Grady    Chairman  President  and Chief Executive Officer I think within the asset management sector  that our Asset Management business is performing very well  We talked about the environmental line just because it is going through secular change  But if you just looked at the competitive positioning  if you looked at the growth relative to others and then you look at the profitability  it s performing well  And I would say strategically  we feel very good about how the business is repositioning itself  And what I mean by that is  we ve been strong and had scale in certain areas like liquidity  like index for a long time  And what we ve been doing though over the last few years is repositioning toward some of the higher growth but also more value added areas  which I talked about  So quant  ESG  things like that  And so those areas  although they represent a smaller portion of the pie  if you will  they are growing  they are resonating  But like any longer term strategy  it takes time before you see the impact of that from a financial perspective  But as far as thinking bigger  if you will  I would say we are  And I just talked about  I ll call it  the product side of that  We re also looking    not looking at  but have been executing on our strategy on the distribution side as well  And it s going well  I would say  on the institutional side  You saw that not only in the fourth quarter but the second half of the year where that s gone well  But then you also saw last year that we acquired a business  but it s very small but    Emotomy which is essentially a technology platform  which we are utilizing in the intermediary space  And we think again  that s the type of capability that will enable us to accelerate the growth rate that we already have within there  So yes  secular change  but we feel very good about our strategic positioning there Operator Operator signoff  Duration  82 minutesCall participants Mark Bette    Director of Investor RelationsMike O Grady    Chairman  President  and

124786,346301,NTRS,Fed to Keep Rates Steady and Mull Tapering  Decision Day Guide,news," Bloomberg     Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars  Sign up here  
Jerome Powell will likely face questions about the Federal Reserve s plans to slow its asset purchases as well as potential fallout from a deadly virus when he faces reporters after a policy meeting Wednesday 
The Fed is all but certain to keep interest rates steady following December forecasts that showed no change in 2020  and is expected to reinforce the signal that policy is on hold  Officials could tweak a secondary rate  known as the interest on excess reserves  in a technical move 
The Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision in a policy statement at 2 p m  in Washington and the chairman will hold a press conference 30 minutes later  There are no economic forecasts published at this meeting 
Here are six issues investors are watching for 
Some analysts see the Fed lifting IOER by five basis points to help keep the benchmark federal funds rate within its target range  This is currently 1 5  to 1 75   with IOER set at 1 55   A move up would guide IOER back toward the center of the range after officials tweaked it lower  Such a step may have a modest impact on the effective funds rate  which the Fed focuses on to control monetary policy 
Balance Sheet
Investors will also focus on the balance sheet  which the central bank resumed growing in October to relieve strain in money markets  It is buying Treasury bills at a monthly pace of  60 billion but could taper that amount  It has already said purchases will continue at least through the second quarter 
Powell has repeatedly said the buying is not quantitative easing  But Wall Street sees it adding up to similar policy stimulus  stoking stocks and bonds  Some officials  including Dallas Fed s Robert Kaplan  have said there is a cost to growth in asset holdings 
 The market will focus squarely on what Powell will say about the balance sheet   said Roberto Perli  a partner at Cornerstone Macro LLC in Washington   I think Powell will try to communicate that at some point the rate of growth of the balance sheet will slow down and eventually either stop or grow very slowly  
Powell may want to foreshadow changes in the balance sheet so Wall Street is not taken by surprise and avoid any repeat of the 2013 taper tantrum when then chairman Ben Bernanke startled investors with talk of winding down bond buying 
The FOMC could also  if needed  purchase short term coupon securities other than Treasury bills and has considered creating a standing repo facility as a additional source of liquidity to prevent money market strain  Both topics are likely to surface again in the press conference 
Virus
Powell can also expect questions about how officials view the likely economic fallout from the deadly coronavirus in China that has claimed more than 100 lives  World financial markets have been rattled by parallels with the outbreak of the SARS virus and what it might mean for the Chinese and global economy  though U S  equities regained some of their poise on Tuesday after steep losses the day before 
Judging the impact of the coronavirus will depend on how quickly Chinese authorities are able to bring it under control and whether extensive contagion reaches other countries  including the U S  Both are hard to know at this stage and Powell is likely to stress officials are watching the situation closely but avoid delivering any clear signal on what it may mean for monetary policy 
The lesson of SARS  is that disease outbreaks can have a marked negative impact on China s growth  If that happens again  China s larger role in the global economy would significantly increase spillovers   said Bloomberg chief economist Tom Orlik   The other lesson of SARS  a panicked reaction in the early stages of the outbreak can overstate the risks  
Statement Changes
In its policy statement  the committee is likely to repeat language from December that growth has been  moderate   with business spending sluggish and inflation running below the 2  goal  One possible change would be a mention of improvement in housing 
 We expect hardly any changes to their statement   said Julia Coronado  a founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York   The economic data are tracking their forecasts and there is no inflation  so that would leave them patient  
Balance of Risks
In the press conference  Powell is likely to repeat that the U S  economy  and monetary policy  are in a  good place   and it would take a material change in the outlook to cause a move  He could suggest risks have lessened with the U S  China trade agreement announced Jan  15  which may reduce uncertainty for businesses  though other risks have emerged  including coronavirus 
 They are happy with where they are and happy with what markets are pricing for Fed rates   said Stephen Stanley  chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC   The estimates for 2020 growth probably haven t changed  though the downside risks may have diminished a bit  
Investors have slightly increased bets the Fed will ease policy this year  though they still only fully price in one quarter point cut by the end of 2020  according to federal fund futures contracts 
Powell may want to emphasize that policy is data dependent and there s no  predetermined pause   said Lindsey Piegza  chief economist with Stifel Nicolaus   Investors want to be reassured that if economic conditions take a turn downward  the country s monetary policy officials are ready and willing to provide stability  
Long Term Goals
The FOMC  which typically each January puts out a statement of its long term goals for monetary policy  will delay that in light of its ongoing review of its monetary policy framework  Officials are considering adopting an average inflation target  allowing for overshooting to make up for past misses  and Powell may be questioned about the idea 
Carl Tannenbaum   Northern Trust  Corp  NASDAQ NTRS   chief economist  said   The question is  if the Fed is struggling to hit 2   what gives it the confidence that it can exceed this target when called for  ",2020-01-29,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-to-keep-rates-steady-and-mull-tapering-decisionday-guide-2070113,2070113

124789,346304,NTRS, Everything Is Accelerating  in the Climate Fight  Billionaire Investor Warns,news," Bloomberg     More than a year ago  legendary investor Jeremy Grantham  announced he was devoting almost his entire fortune  more than  1 billion  to the fight against climate change 
Humanity is in the  race of our lives   he warned  a terrifying competition between the Earth s rising temperatures and the many ways people are responding to the crisis  Since then  the race has only sped up  the 81 year old co founder of Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo  GMO  now says 
 Everything is accelerating   Grantham said in an interview at Bloomberg s New York headquarters   The disasters are terrible  one ugly event after another  and they seem to be happening quicker and quicker   he said  He called the recent fires in Australia  apocalyptic    
But also  he said  there is progress in combating such an overwhelming problem   The technology is just amazing  One pleasant surprise after another   he said  noting that innovations like electric cars and lab grown food are transforming energy  agriculture and other fields 
Grantham  who predicted the tech bubble and financial crisis  discussed how the climate race is rapidly altering the world s economic and investing future  
What s your reaction to Larry Fink s  vow that BlackRock  NYSE BLK   the world s largest asset manager  will make climate change a priority I say   Brilliant well done  Larry   That was necessary and incredibly welcome and may set a good example  And now we know you can bark loudly  Can you bite  And will you perhaps think about having your giant index funds vote a little greener  They re right at the bottom of the list  Legal   General in the U K  is way at the top of the list  and  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  is not so bad  and right at the bottom is BlackRock  So they can do better  You re not going to lose business in the index business because you become a little greener in how you cast your proxies  It s the one area I can think of where there s no real cost to either the buyer or the seller 
What s been holding back companies and investors from doing more 
Capitalism has this strange ability to kind of paralyze the altruistic part of humans  So at the weekends  they re altruistic  they love their grandchildren  Then during the week they take on the character of the corporation whose only job description  says Milton Friedman  is to maximize short term profits  If a human being does nothing except maximize their self interest  they re a sociopath  That s how it s defined  So during the week you behave like a sociopath and as if you have no grandchildren or as if you hate the ones you have  And then at the weekend you become a loving grandfather again  That is apparently what capitalism does to us  based on the evidence You ve argued that investors should sell oil and gas investments  What does it mean if more investors start to divest 
Divestment is not an economic issue in terms of how it affects the oil companies  The economic impact is for the person who is dumping the stock  He is getting out of an industry that has been put on notice that they re going out of business  
In the last 10 years they re up 5  or 10  and the S P 500 has tripled  It has been absolutely awful and I am proud to say that for those 10 years I ve been saying   Don t buy oil stocks   Forget the ethics for a second  It s a bad economic idea  Going forward  if they rolled with the punches and they tried to redesign their business as an energy provider rather than oil they could do okay and get a decent return 
But they fight it  If you want to lose money in a capitalist system  that is how you do it  You underestimate the forces you re dealing with  
Which of the major oil and gas companies has the most potential to pivot 
The Europeans are always thinking greener thoughts  and longer term thoughts  than their American brothers  The Americans have not been good at this stuff  They have held us back at least 10 years  Without that push back  we would be perhaps a leader in this field and life would be quite different 
The long term goal is to make them a pariah industry  It took us 20 years on tobacco  Until they were pariahs  politicians would not take a bite out of them  They had misrepresented the dangers of their product  They knew it was causing cancer  et cetera  and they denied it  Energy companies knew that oil was a dangerous product and they obfuscated it  It will take us a while  but they have to become pariahs 
What would you do about investments in the chemical industry 
I think chemicals are about to engage in a war of a thousand cuts  Plastics will get banned  The growth rate will become negative within five years  if not sooner  Sometimes these flashpoints are very rapid  Pesticides will be banned in enlightened countries and their health will immediately improve  Europeans already ban lots of chemicals  We do not  
When you sit down with foundations  endowments and other institutional investors  how have their attitudes shifted on climate change 
When I gave my first climate change talk at a GMO annual conference dinner 10 years ago  there was  to say the least  some eye rolling  A few people who were visibly upset 
This 10 years has been a revolution in a typical group of clients  They ve begun to realize they have to take it into account  that it has portfolio implications  And the last two years has seen an acceleration in that  as the general public has gotten more involved in Europe and North America  particularly last year  Things are beginning to happen much faster 
Why aren t college and university endowments divesting from fossil fuel stocks 
I ve spoken to over 1 000 investment committees  and they are the most conservative organizations on the planet  And that is the reason that almost all of the universities have had problems divesting  although they re now beginning to 
But at the top end  what about MIT  Harvard and so on  They receive hundreds of millions of good research dollars to do perfectly good  valuable research from the oil industry  One of the leading university s leading people said to us and I m sure she d be happy to deny it  we simply can t afford to step away   I m mildly sympathetic  You can do a lot of terrific research for  200 million  You wouldn t lightly walk away from it  would you  But having said that  you re still bought  You sold out for a high price  but you re still bought ",2020-02-05,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/everything-is-accelerating-in-the-climate-fight-billionaire-investor-warns-2076578,2076578

year over year  However  the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  257 million Net interest income was down 5 4  year over year to  235 9 million  The fall mainly resulted from elevated

124792,346307,NTRS,5 Solid Dividend ETF   Stock Picks That Yield 5  Or More,opinion,Investors have once again turned defensive and are chasing dividend stocks   ETFs ahead of the tariff hike on Dec 15  The President previously stated that he will impose tariffs on  160 billion worth of Chinese goods from Dec 15  as announced  if a deal is not reached   Trump said that he will wait until the November 2020 election to strike a deal Additionally  Trump is planning to restore tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina and proposed tariffs of up to 100  on  2 4 billion worth of products from France Further  the bouts of latest data signals mixed picture of the economy  The U S  manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth straight month in November with a steep drop in new factory orders  U S  construction spending also unexpectedly fell in October as investment in private projects tumbled to its lowest level in three years  However  the job market strengthened in November with the fastest pace of job additions and unemployment falling to the lowest level since 1969  read    The combination of these factors has made investors jittery Why Dividends Dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors  creating wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk  This is because the companies that pay dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis With lower interest rates and the stock market trading at near all time highs  the high dividend paying stocks   ETFs could be excellent picks at present  In fact  these could be viewed as a safe haven in case of a market pullback as

124811,346326,NTRS,QE on the QT  Fed says no  economists say maybe so,news,"By Howard Schneider  Ann Saphir and Jonnelle Marte  Reuters    Stop with the  50 Bs   Start with the 60  The U S  Federal Reserve s quick pivot from shrinking its balance sheet by around  50 billion per month to now expanding by  60 billion monthly  has shown both the difficulty the Fed has faced under a shifting political environment  as well as the risks of experimenting with market sensitive systems in real time  The process of paring the balance sheet from its crisis era levels of more than  4 trillion in assets  effectively  unwinding  some of the stimulus put in place to battle the worst financial crisis in a century  was agonized over for years by policymakers who were under sometimes intense pressure from Republicans on Capitol Hill who wanted a smaller central bank not so deeply engrained in private markets  The careful shedding of  50 billion a month was lauded by those lawmakers as the Fed rolled it out in 2017  and was intended  as former Chair Janet Yellen said  to be so boring and non disruptive it would be  like watching paint dry   And so it was  until President Donald Trump took notice near the end of his second year in office  chucked standing Republican concerns over the size of the Fed s asset holdings  and criticized central bankers for doing what leading members of his party had demanded   Stop with the 50 B s   Trump tweeted in December  Far from the traditional GOP concerns over  easy money   Trump felt the Fed s withdrawal from bond and mortgage markets was adding even more of an economic drag beyond what were then ongoing rate hikes  By July  the  50 billion monthly rundown had ended  Two months later  the Fed confronted a new problem  one which had nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with its new system for managing interest rates  That system depended on the Fed knowing roughly how much banks would demand in deposits at the central bank  which financial institutions may want to hold for a variety of reasons  PAINTED INTO A CORNER  But as time passed  Fed officials realized they weren t sure quite what the demand would be and would have to feel their way   Last month  Yellen s paint drying exercise was upended  and raised questions about how prepared the Fed was to manage a central bit of its business   ensuring adequate liquidity in financial markets   I ve been really surprised at the struggle the Fed has had getting overnight rates to where they want them to be    Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  economist Carl Tannenbaum said   The Fed has had a hell of time  steering overnight rates to the midpoint of its target range of 1 75  to 2 00    Part of the problem  he said  is that the Fed was so intent on shrinking the balance sheet on  autopilot  that it  probably pushed the balance sheet reduction further than it should have done    But the fact that reserves were becoming scarce  Tannenbaum said  should have been obvious   To Tannenbaum  the new operation should definitely be considered under the umbrella of monetary policy   Monetary policy is implemented with a combination of steps   he explained   The steps taken recently by the Fed are part of monetary policy  and have to be considered that    Not so  said Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan   It is not intended to create more accommodation or create more stimulus   told reporters after a talk at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco   This is not intended to have any impact on monetary policy  It s not designed that way    The two interest rate reductions passed by the Fed this year have also been characterized as  insurance cuts  meant to extend the recovery and protect an economy that is in a  good place   But regardless of the intention  the steps taken this year to reduce rates and now to expand the balance sheet may amount to an unwinding of the monetary policy adjustments made last year  some investors say  If the Fed reduces interest rates twice more this year  it would completely undo the four interest rate hikes passed in 2018    It s effectively quantitative easing  Investors should look at this as yes  a complete reversal of Fed policy from a year ago   said Chad Morganlander  senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park  New Jersey   It confirms to investors that the Fed has their back  They ll do whatever it takes to keep the U S  financial system calm   Powell and other policymakers stress that the messaging is important  The Fed chair said Tuesday that the balance sheet expansion  should in no way be confused  with the asset purchases made during the financial crisis   Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari echoed that message in New York Friday morning  He said that the central bank would be operating with a large balance sheet  for the foreseeable future   And he was careful to point out that purchases of short term Treasury bills are different from purchases of long term bonds   
 QE was designed to also move long rates by us buying long  term assets   he said   If the Fed is buying short term bills just to provide liquidity to the system  there is nothing QE about that  ",2019-10-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/qe-on-the-qt-fed-says-no-economists-say-maybe-so-1995393,1995393

The Tour did not specify what substance Every tested positive for and said it will have no further comment on the suspension at this time  Every  who will be eligible to return to competition on Jan  7  2020  said in a statement to GolfChannel com that he tested positive for cannabis 
 I have been prescribed cannabis for a mental health condition by my physician whom has managed my medical care for 30 years   he told GolfChannel com   It has been determined that I am neither an acceptable candidate to use prescription  Z  class drugs nor benzodiazepines

Every has missed nine of 21 cuts in 2019  but did tie for second at the AT T Byron Nelson in May    his best finish since that 2015 victory  After a string of three missed cuts and a withdrawal in four events beginning with The  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  to kick off last season s FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup Playoffs  Every tied for 18th at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open and tied for 28th at the Houston Open earlier this month 
Every is currently ranked 256th but is fully exempt for the 2019 20 PGA Tour season after qualifying for last season s playoffs  He said he has  no choice but to accept this suspension and move on   and will be eligible to return the week of the Sony Open 
 I don t agree with it for many reasons  mainly for my overall well being  but I m excited for what lies ahead in my life and career   he told the GolfChannel com   Over the last few years I have made massive strides and I know my best is still in front of me  I can t wait to come back better than ever in January

124813,346328,NTRS,Fed Prepares to Pause After Third Rate Cut  Decision Day Guide,news," Bloomberg     Jerome Powell may be getting ready to pause this year s monetary easing campaign 
The Federal Reserve chairman and his colleagues are expected to cut interest rates a quarter point on Wednesday for a third straight meeting  to provide insurance against global risks  while signaling that the committee has probably done enough for now  The decision will be announced at 2 p m  in Washington with Powell facing reporters 30 minutes later 
Investors are pricing a 90  likelihood of a cut though economists surveyed by Bloomberg put the odds at 75   betraying a bit more doubt that reflects divisions on the committee about the need to lower borrowing costs much further  While policy makers all see risks from trade uncertainty and weakness abroad  some view the Fed s reductions in July and September as already sufficient to offset those headwinds absent additional shocks 
Powell will likely use his press conference to communicate that message of a pause while emphasizing flexibility if the economic outlook shifts significantly 
 What they want to provide is a hawkish cut    said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist with  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Co  in Chicago and a former Fed researcher   Expressing that properly will require some deft expression  which the Fed hasn t always been able to provide   
Powell is following the playbook of a mentor  Alan Greenspan  who cut rates three times in midcycle adjustments in 1995 1996 and in 1998 to counter risks  September forecasts showed the FOMC saw interest rates hitting bottom this year before rising slightly in 2021 
Investors are slightly more dovish and have fully priced in another quarter point cut by mid 2020  The Fed will update its quarterly forecasts in December 
What Bloomberg Economists Say
 Bloomberg Economics expects officials to adopt a  meeting by meeting  approach to evaluating the need for additional stimulus  so as to appease hawkish leaning members of the committee  However  from meeting to meeting in a slow growth  low inflation environment  officials will see greater need to provide additional support  
   Carl Riccadonna  Yelena Shulyatyeva  Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger  Click here to read full article 
The FOMC is divided between policy makers who favor insurance against risks from a manufacturing slump  the trade war with China  Brexit and slower global growth  versus those who see domestic data largely supporting their outlook for solid growth 
The latter camp includes Kansas City Fed s Esther George and Boston s Eric Rosengren  both likely to dissent again if the Fed cuts rates on Wednesday  They have some company  The Fed s September dot plot of interest rate projections showed five officials didn t favor the cut delivered at that meeting and another five who saw no need for another cut this year 
That creates the possibility of a surprise  and economists put 20  odds that the FOMC will decide not to cut Wednesday  Any pause would also certainly be opposed by President Donald Trump  who s pushed publicly for lower rates to rev up the economy 
 This meeting will be very contentious    said Jonathan Wright  economics professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore  who previously worked at the Fed   The overall data since the last meeting aren t that negative  and a lot of FOMC participants  mostly nonvoting  will be unconvinced of the wisdom of cutting again   
The last time the Fed reduced rates three times while the economy was growing was in 1998  After the third cut  it sent a strong signal it was done  announcing that financial conditions following 75 basis points of easing  can reasonably be expected  to sustain the expansion 
Wednesday s statement might also suggest  we have done enough    said Stephen Stanley  Amherst Pierpont chief economist   If they ease and want to send a pause signal  it will be up to Powell to flesh it out   
The FOMC may consider tweaking its assessment of current conditions to slightly weaker wording  noting that the job creation has eased and inflation expectations have moderated  said Lindsey Piegza  chief economist with Stifel Nicolaus in Chicago 
One concern Fed officials may have with too strong of a pause signal is that it could flatten the Treasury yield curve  and an inverted yield curve    where short term rates are higher than long term ones    is traditionally viewed as a recession warning that could alarm investors 
 The market is likely to increasingly question the Fed s resolve to prop up a faltering economy which could translate into lower rates on the longer end  perpetuating the need for further Fed action to stabilize the shape of the yield curve    she said 
The central bank was not seen making much news on its balance sheet following an Oct  11 announcement it would buy Treasury bills at an initial  60 billion a month pace to lift bank reserves in the system  The Fed has repeatedly called the measure  undertaken after sharp spikes in overnight money market rates  a technical step that did not alter the stance of monetary policy ",2019-10-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-prepares-to-pause-after-third-rate-cut-decision-day-guide-2007355,2007355

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to signal again this week that monetary policy is on hold  buttressing the belief that he may steer clear of action through 2020 
Surprisingly  that would be an historic anomaly for a U S  presidential election year  Rather than keeping its head down  the Fed has changed policy in one direction or another in each of the last 10 presidential polling years    though in 2016 it didn t act to raise interest rates until after the November election 
In 2012 the Fed didn t move its benchmark rate  which was already at zero  but did announce its third round of large scale asset purchases in September 
 If you look back in history and see what the Fed did in election years  the Fed did everything they had to do    said Roberto Perli  a partner at Cornerstone Macro in Washington  The best way for them to preserve their independence and credibility  is to do what they think is right   
That hasn t always shielded them from criticism  President George H W  Bush famously blamed then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan for costing him re election in 1992 by failing to cut interest rates more aggressively  But it s particularly vital now for the Fed to make the case that its policies are warranted by the economic outlook because of the relentless public assault on the institution by President Donald Trump 
Breaking with more than a quarter century of precedent  Trump has repeatedly lambasted the Fed and accused it of keeping credit too tight  most recently on Oct  31  the day after it reduced rates for the third time this year 
Powell will have a chance to make his case twice this week  on Wednesday before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and on Thursday to the House Budget Committee  He s likely to echo the message he delivered after the latest Fed rate cut  The economy and monetary policy are in good place in the 11th year of America s longest expansion 
Investors seem to agree  Stock and bond prices have risen in recent days on signs that the U S  economy is weathering a slowdown abroad and on hopes of a phase one deal in the U S  China trade war 
 Things feel a lot less threatening than they did two months ago    said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist with  Northern Trust  Corp  NASDAQ NTRS   in Chicago   The data for the U S  has suggested that we re not on the edge of falling off a cliff  
Front and center in that regard was the October employment report  which showed payrolls rising by 128 000 despite the loss of 41 600 jobs due to the since ended General Motors Co  NYSE GM   strike 
Solid Payrolls
The solid jobs report allayed fears that companies spooked by the worldwide slowdown would chop payrolls just as they have done to capital outlays 
It also bolstered the Fed s hopes that the consumer will continue to have the staying power to keep the expansion on track in the face of cutbacks by businesses 
Coupled with the policy message coming from Powell  the improved economic data prompted such Fed watchers as Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  and Matthew Luzzetti of  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  Securities to rescind their forecasts of further rate cuts 
 Material Reassessment 
Powell told reporters on Oct  30 that it would take a  material reassessment   of the economic outlook for the Fed to change its current 1 5  to 1 75  interest rate target range 
In their September forecasts  policy makers saw the economy growing by 2  in 2020  inflation rising to near their 2  target and unemployment ending the year at 3 7   according to their median projection  They ll update predictions at their Dec  10 11 meeting 
Speaking to Bloomberg Television on Nov  1  Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said if the central bank saw  accumulating evidence  that it was missing on its mandate for maximum employment or stable prices  or the growth needed to sustain both goals   we would have to factor that in  
Never Better
While saying that he still saw downside risks to the outlook  Clarida also highlighted the financial strength of U S  households   In the aggregate  the U S  consumer s never been in better shape   he said 
Deutsche s Luzzetti said it would take a real crack in the labor market and the consumer for the Fed to resume reducing rates  He expects policy to remain on hold next year even though he sees slowing growth pushing unemployment to 3 9   It was 3 6  in October 
The bar to a rate hike seems even higher  Powell said that any decision to raise rates would be tied to the behavior of inflation  which remains stuck below the Fed s 2  target 
 We would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns    Powell said 
In describing the Fed s current strategy  Powell has referred to the mid cycle policy adjustment in 1995 and 1996  when Greenspan lowered rates three times after raising them previously 
The final cut back then came in January 1996  the start of a presidential election year  The central bank then kept rates unchanged for the rest of 1996 
 The Fed is probably on hold for a very long period of time    Northern Trust s Tannenbaum said ",2019-11-12,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-likely-to-defy-history-with-rates-steady-through-elections-2018604,2018604

Germany narrowly dodged its first recession in six years  putting a damper on speculation that the government will add fiscal stimulus any time soon 
The surprise expansion doesn t change the fact that the economy is going through a torrid period that s turned it from the euro area s traditional growth engine into a source of weakness  A pile up of trade tensions  weaker global demand and turmoil in the automobile sector has led to the worst manufacturing slump in a decade and put question marks over the country s role as an economic powerhouse 
The 0 1  increase in gross domestic product was led by consumer and government spending  Construction and exports also rose  while investment in machinery and equipment fell  The contraction in the second quarter    which had sparked months of recession speculation    was revised to 0 2  from 0 1  
The euro rose after the report and traded little changed at  1 1001 at 8 18 a m  Frankfurt time 
 I would put mild positive as a descriptor on the German GDP report   said Jim McDonald  chief investment strategist at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Bank   German is the point of the spear when it comes to manufacturing and especially exposure to China   but  but consumer spending across all of Europe has been holding up better  
There have been some signs recently that the economy may be through the worst of its downturn  Business sentiment appears to have stabilized  and investor confidence about the outlook is improving  But it s far from an all clear  with most key indicators still at multi year lows and the economy expected to post sub 1  growth in 2019 and 2020 
The global economy also remains under pressure  Separate data Thursday showed Chinese growth spluttering  with factory output slowing  investment growth at a record low and consumption coming off the boil  In Japan  expansion cooled sharply in the third quarter 
The pain has been felt across the major names in German corporate royalty  with firms from Siemens to BASF repeatedly warning that trade fights are hitting sentiment and investment 
Upheaval in the car industry from emissions and the switch to electric engines have compounded the slump  and there s little end in sight  Parts maker  Continental AG   DE CONG  said two days ago it sees no material improvement in global car production in the next five years 
What Bloomberg s Economists Say
 The question remains how much of the weakness in manufacturing will spread to services  Our base case is that some of the damage will be transmitted  keeping growth slow  but that a downturn will be avoided  
  Jamie Rush  Read the GERMANY REACT
Economic concerns weighed on bond yields  and German 10 year borrowing costs have been below zero for six months  It also meant Germany faced a growing chorus of calls to unleash fiscal stimulus  Among those voices was the European Central Bank  which loosened monetary policy in September to help the euro area and upped its push for public spending 
The German government s response was that it would act if there was a crisis  and that wasn t the case now  Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said the country is in a  stable economic situation   and he s likely to feel vindicated by Thursday s figures 
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier  speaking on ARD television shortly after the data were published  said characterized growth as  still too weak  
 That means the upward trend has started but it s proceeding very slowly   he said 
Much hinges on developments in the U S  China trade battles that have dominated the global economic landscape  The danger of U S  levies on European automobiles isn t fully off the table  suggesting manufacturing momentum will remain subdued 
Consumers have also become wary  Households  assessment of the growth outlook is at a seven year low  financial expectations are deteriorating rapidly and fears of unemployment are rising 
 In a trade war  tariffs are only part of the problem   Bloomberg economists David Powell and Dan Hanson wrote   Uncertainty    damping consumers  appetite to buy and businesses  incentives to invest    can create a bigger drag on growth

Todd and Vaughn Taylor were locked at 20 under par overall with four holes remaining when play was suspended because of darkness on Sunday 
Thursday s washout meant the tournament at the Mayakoba Resort in Playa del Carmen was taken into a fifth day 
Todd  who claimed his first win since 2014 at the Bermuda Championship earlier this month  began with a long birdie putt on the 15th hole but a three foot par miss meant he gave back the advantage on the next hole

Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 52 billion On a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income of  425 3 million was up 2   year on year  This was driven by higher net interest margin  partly mitigated by decreased earning assets Net interest margin  NIM  was 1 61   up 14 basis points from the prior year quarter  The upside chiefly reflects higher short term interest rates  the impact of

expenses flared up 3  year over year to  1 04 billion in the quarter  This upswing mainly resulted from an elevation in compensation  employee benefits  outside services  equipment and software

124844,346359,NTRS,PGA Tour review slow play policy in wake of controversy,news," Reuters    The PGA Tour is considering expanding its pace of play policy in the wake of vocal criticism by players and fans of recent slow play 
Current policy only addresses pairings and threesomes with all the players in a group having to complete a hole within a set time to stay  in position  and avoid a potential penalty 
The tour is thinking of expanding the policy to also address individuals whose groups are  in position  but who take an excessive amount of time to hit a shot 
The issue reached critical mass over the weekend when American Ryder Cup player Bryson DeChambeau took more than two minutes lining up a putt during the second round at the  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  tournament in New Jersey 
He was pilloried and ridiculed on social media by fans and fellow players 
 We know that the individual habits of players when they are preparing to hit a shot can quickly become a focal point in today s world  and our players and fans are very passionate about this issue   said PGA Tour chief of operations Tyler Dennis 
 We are currently in the process of reviewing this aspect of pace of play and asking ourselves  is there a better way to do it 
 We think technology definitely plays a key role in all of this and we are thinking about new and innovative ways to use it to address these situations  
Leading players  including Brooks Koepka and fellow four times major champion Rory McIlroy  have been among vocal critics of the tour s inaction over slowpokes 
It took the last pairing just over four hours to complete the final round at the Northern Trust on Sunday 
Dennis said pace of play was a complex issue because of the many factors affecting it    including the number of players on the course  tee time intervals  amount of daylight  course set up and the weather 
Rowdy fans can also contribute to slow play 
Under the tour s current pace of play policy  players are  on the clock  when their group falls out of position 
Players are given an allotted time between 40 and 50 seconds to hit a shot  The first bad time results in a warning  while a second bad time in the same round results in a one stroke penalty 
There are fines of an undisclosed amount for a second bad time in a season  and each bad time thereafter  and for each time players are put  on the clock  after the 10th time 
Only one penalty stroke has been handed out in the last two decades  however  and while fines are more common  it has been argued they are hardly a deterrent to multi millionaire players 
The European Tour s experiment at the aptly named Shot Clock Masters in Austria last year was generally deemed a huge success by players and officials alike  with play speeding up considerably compared with the previous year ",2019-08-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/pga-tour-review-slow-play-policy-in-wake-of-controversy-1952206,1952206

 Seems my comment regarding Bryson s slow play has garnered plenty of attention and I just want to sincerely apologize to Bryson for being personal and referring to him as a  twit    the 28 year old English golfer wrote on Twitter   That was unnecessary and something I shouldn t have said  
Pepperell made his original comments Friday after videos surfaced of DeChambeau taking more than two minutes to attempt  and miss  an 8 foot putt 
 Just look at Tommy  Fleetwood  and Justin  Thomas   both looking completely bored   Pepperell said   Slow players do this to their playing partners  making the game less enjoyable  Problem is  the unaffected single minded twit in this instance doesn t care much for others  
 Eddie Pepperell  not fair to say   DeChambeau told reporters after seeing the comments   I would love to speak to him personally and talk about it

A shot behind the leading pair were 49 year old Jim Furyk  Lucas Glover  Brandt Snedeker  Patrick Cantlay and Joel Dahmen  while Rickie Fowler and Australian Adam Scott headline a group of nine on 67  two back on the leaders 
The birdies were flying at Medinah Country Club as an elite 69 player field took advantage of ideal scoring conditions  and both Kokrak and Thomas could do little wrong on the rain softened course on the outskirts of Chicago 
Thomas turned in an error free scorecard  highlighted by a storming finish of three straight birdies from the 14th 
Kokrak  who is still chasing his first PGA Tour win  had only once blemish  a bogey at the ninth  to go along with an eagle and six birdies 
Their stellar rounds came despite both players appearing out of touch in their warmups

Woods  ranked 38th when the day began  has won two of his 15 major championships at Medinah and he got off to a roaring start with three birdies in his opening five holes  including one at his opening hole for the first time this season 
But the 43 year old  who pulled out of last week s  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Open after the opening round due to back pain  saw his hot start cool off quickly 
He added one more birdie to make it four for the round but his card also came with three bogeys 
 Didn t chip it  didn t make that many putts and consequently I m one under   said Woods  who swung freely and showed no signs of discomfort 
 It s just not sharp  I m trying to make changes in my swing and it s just not quite there yet 
 I need reps and I just haven t put in a lot of reps 
 I didn t feel any tightness in my oblique at all  I didn t feel any pull and so that was a positive  I just need to clean up my rounds and get going

124848,346363,NTRS,Golf  Course record 63 lifts Matsuyama to halfway lead at BMW,news," Reuters    Hideki Matsuyama had one of the best putting days of his career to take the halfway lead with a course record nine under 63 in the second round at the BMW Championship in suburban Chicago on Friday 
The putter  so often the weak link in the Japanese player s game  did not let Matsuyama down as he cranked out nine birdies at Medinah  five times holing out from outside 15 feet 
He capped off his day by sinking a 25 footer at the 17th and then a 30 footer at the last for a 12 under 132 total  one stroke better than Americans Tony Finau  66  and Patrick Cantlay  67  in the penultimate event of the PGA Tour season 
Tiger Woods languished equal 48th in the 69 man field  10 strokes off the pace after a second straight 71 
Matsuyama  ranked as high as second in the world two years ago  was delighted for a change with his form on the greens 
 I made a lot of long putts today and that was the difference   he told PGATour com 
 It started yesterday during my round  Halfway through I was able to see what I was doing  wrong  on the greens and I fixed it and it carried over to today 
 Honestly I thought I pushed that putt  at the 18th  but somehow it found the bottom of the cup  
Matsuyama is 33rd in the FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup standings and needs a strong finish on Sunday to advance as part of the 30 man field for next week s Tour Championship 
It would be his fifth successive appearance in the exclusive event 
He has nine rivals within three strokes starting the weekend  including former world number one Justin Thomas  69   two behind 
Equal second  Finau has set the foundation for a tilt at what would only be his second PGA Tour victory  though what he lacks in silverware he makes up for in consistency 
 I know there s a lot at stake this week but the best I can do is try to stay in the moment   said the prodigiously long hitter  who has had a pair of runner up finishes this season 
World number nine Cantlay  who tasted victory this season at the prestigious Jack Nicklaus hosted Memorial  rated a par at the 15th hole as important as any of his birdies on Friday 
 I made some good par saves  especially after driving the ball into the water on 15   he said   It s always nice to go bogey free  
Ten strokes from the lead was Bryson DeChambeau  who became the poster boy for slow play when a video of him taking two minutes to line up a putt went viral during last week s  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  event 
DeChambeau was targeted by some heckling on Friday according to broadcaster Golf Channel  which reported that a police officer had ejected a spectator from the course on the 18th hole ",2019-08-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/golf-course-record-63-lifts-matsuyama-to-halfway-lead-at-bmw-1957538,1957538

 I figured I  was  going to have to do something in mid 60s for two straight days there   Woods said afterward   Left myself pretty far behind after the first two rounds  At least  I ve got a shot at it  
He sits four strokes back of four players who are tied for ninth 
The 43 year old put together his first bogey free round all season  birdieing the fourth and seventh holes on the front nine and Nos  10  14 and 16 on the back  Woods hit 12 of 18 greens and 10 of 14 fairways  needing just 27 putts to complete the round 
He had totaled seven bogeys and nine birdies through two rounds to start the week  scoring 71 in both 
 Basically  the only difference between today and the last couple of days  I was able to clean up the card   Woods said   I didn t have any stupid mistakes where I made bogey from bad spots or from easy spots I converted a nice up and down on five  I did the little things that was able to keep the momentum going and made a couple putts here and there  
The score was Woods  lowest since the final round of the Memorial Tournament in early June and tied for his lowest since the second round of the WGC Mexico Championship in February  The event is only his fourth since the Memorial  including a missed cut at The Open Championship and a withdrawal from The  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  last week due to an oblique injury 
The injury wasn t enough to keep Woods out this week  and he said he felt considerably better during Saturday s round 
 It s just one of those things where some days I feel better than others  but also  then again  it s what I do with the golf club  too   he said   Able to swing the club properly  Body feels better

124856,346371,NTRS,3 High Performing Funds With Fees Around 1 ,opinion,Mutual fund investors who aspire to make the most out of their investments with the least amount of fees could focus on funds that offer a low expense ratio It s no doubt prudent to invest in funds with low expense ratios since this is the amount investors are charged in exchange for fund managing services  An expense ratio comprises operating costs and management fees  Therefore  the lower the expenses  the higher will be the return  Usually  an expense ratio close to 1  is considered ideal However  lower expense ratios are a characteristic of passively managed funds  But these funds are not necessarily known for providing higher returns This is where actively managed funds mark their entry  First  these funds focus on outperforming the broader markets and so  mutual fund investors can always count on them for higher returns Second  actively managed funds can quickly respond to market gyrations  The funds can under weigh the losing stocks and over weigh the gaining ones  thus lowering risks and improving the portfolio s outcome So  wouldn t it be ideal to invest in funds that have low expense ratios and at the same time are actively managed  It would definitely be a win win situation for mutual fund investors This is why we have considered three mutual funds that offer expense ratios near and about 1  along with solid returns  All these funds carry a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Additionally  the minimum initial investment is less than  5000  We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future Now we come to the most vital question  why should investors consider mutual funds  Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking money in mutual funds  read more    Northern Small Cap Value Fund   a Zacks Mutual Rank  1  Strong

124875,346390,NTRS,Tiger battling back stiffness ahead of playoff opener,news," Reuters    Tiger Woods on Wednesday said stiffness in his surgically repaired back had limited his ability to practice ahead of the  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Open  which kicks off the PGA Tour playoffs on Thursday in Jersey City 
The American played what he called a  modified  nine holes at the Liberty National Golf Club on Tuesday with Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson but limited his shots to chips and putts on the back nine at Wednesday s pro am 
 Some days I m stiffer than others  Yesterday I was out there hitting it great  driving it out there with Brooksy and DJ  and today I m stiff  Hopefully I m not that way tomorrow   he told reporters 
Woods  who has played just four times since his Masters victory in April  said past experience had taught him to take a cautious approach when it comes to his health 
 I learned a lot last year by playing too much after coming back from my procedure and not really knowing what to expect   he said 
 I pushed it pretty hard and vowed I d never do that again 
 And that s the challenge now because I cut my schedule back  But the problem was the season changed 
 We have a more condensed season and trying to figure out how to stay sharp  practice and also have my back feeling good all the time  It is a challenge  
Woods said he could no longer practice as much as he would like to and was unable to even  sniff  the level of preparation he used to put in before a tournament 
The 43 year old is hoping to earn the right to play in the 30 player Tour Championship  which he won last year to end a five year title drought

 I still have to go out there and do my own thing  play my own game and see where it leaves me  
The 32 year old from Clara said he had been embraced like never before back home and hoped his success would encourage the next generation to pick up a club 
 The support I ve got back home has just been incredible   he said 
 Hopefully I can move forward and become more successful and make kids want to start playing golf too  
As an added bonus  he said  he was no longer being mistaken for fellow players Andrew  Beef  Johnston or J B  Holmes  who also sport beards 
 I m definitely more recognized now and even coming over here to events     it makes you feel more comfortable   he said 
 They re not calling me Beef or they re not calling me J B  Holmes out there  anyway  That s a plus  ",2019-08-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/lowry-ready-to-get-back-to-work-after-british-open-win-1948810,1948810

124880,346395,NTRS,Critics blast DeChambeau for slow play,news,"Bryson DeChambeau isn t doing much this weekend to defend last year s title at The  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS   the first stop of the PGA Tour s postseason 
He s also not making many friends among his colleagues 
DeChambeau rankled several players with slow play during Friday s second round  including two shots that led to viral videos  at Liberty National Golf Club in Jersey City  N J 
In one instance  DeChambeau spent about three minutes before hitting a 70 yard chip shot  first walking off the distance from the hole to where his ball rested before beginning his lengthy pre shot process 
In another  he took two minutes to line up an 8 foot putt before finally taking  and missing  the shot 
According to PGA Tour rules  players are expected to take shots within 40 seconds  though penalties are rarely applied 
Among critics speaking up were world No  1 Brooks Koepka and England s Eddie Pepperell 
 It has just got out of hand   said Koepka  who has specifically called out DeChambeau for slow play in the past 
 Just look at Tommy  Fleetwood  and Justin  Thomas   both looking completely bored   Pepperell wrote in a tweet  referencing DeChambeau s playing partners   Slow players do this to their playing partners making the game less enjoyable  Problem is  the unaffected single minded twit in this instance  doesn t care much for others  
Pepperell called for officials to start getting serious about punishing DeChambeau and others 
 When it s as egregious as Bryson was last night  and if they re already behind  then shot penalties should be handed out  Fines don t mean anything to these guys   wrote Pepperell   You d only need to hand out a few penalties and things would improve quickly

124883,346398,NTRS,Northern Trust  NTRS  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Northern Trust in Focus
Headquartered in Chicago  Northern Trust  NTRS  is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 4 28  so far this year  The wealth management firm is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 6 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 75   This compares to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 2 9  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 94  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 40 is up 23 7  from last year  Northern Trust has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11 25   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Northern Trust s payout ratio is 36   which means it paid out 36  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  NTRS expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 72 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 1 20  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  NTRS is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northern-trust-ntrs-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200432205,200432205
124884,346399,NTRS, Complete and utter you know what   DeChambeau hits back at slow play critics,news," Reuters    The hot topic of slow play boiled over on Saturday when renowned slowpoke Bryson DeChambeau hit back at one of his peers who had noted the glacial pace of his play during the second round at the  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  in New Jersey 
Slow play has been a major topic of conversation recently  with world number one Brooks Koepka and fellow four times major champion Rory McIlroy among those speaking out and pleading with officials to do something about it 
On Friday  outspoken Englishman Eddie Pepperell took to his Twitter account to call out DeChambeau after the American had taken more than two minutes to line up a putt once it was his turn to play at the eighth hole 
World number 40 Pepperell  who is not playing in the event at Liberty National  thought DeChambeau s dilly dallying unfair on playing companions Justin Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood 
 Just look at Tommy and Justin  both looking completely bored   Pepperell tweeted 
 Slow players do this to their playing partners making the game less enjoyable  Problem is  the unaffected single minded twit in this instance  doesn t care much for others  
At another hole  DeChambeau paced off a 70 yard approach shot  again taking a couple of minutes 
It clearly did not take long for the criticism to get back to DeChambeau  who was not amused 
He approached reporters after the third round on Saturday to put his side of the story  according to golfchannel com 
 Let s talk about slow play  I ll introduce this and talk about it   said the American Ryder Cup player  who has a physics degree and  critics say  a habit of over analyzing shots 
 When people start talking to me about slow play and how I m killing the game  I m doing this and that to the game  that is complete and utter you know what  
DeChambeau acknowledged he occasionally took more than his allotted 40 seconds to play but guessed it was only five percent of the time

124886,346401,NTRS,Why Northern Trust  NTRS  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Northern Trust in Focus
Northern Trust  NTRS  is headquartered in Chicago  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 9 91  since the start of the year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 6 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 61   In comparison  the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield is 2 84   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 88  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 40 is up 23 7  from last year  In the past five year period  Northern Trust has increased its dividend 4 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 12 66   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Northern Trust s current payout ratio is 36   meaning it paid out 36  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  NTRS expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 68 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 0 60  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  NTRS is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-northern-trust-ntrs-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200436790,200436790
124887,346402,NTRS,Analysts Estimate Northern Trust  NTRS  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Northern Trust  NTRS  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This wealth management firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 51 billion  up 0  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 89  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northern Trust 
For Northern Trust  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 42  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Northern Trust would post earnings of  1 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 48  delivering a surprise of  1 37  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Northern Trust doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-northern-trust-ntrs-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200440724,200440724

124905,346420,NTRS,Fed Looks Locked In for Quarter Point Cut  Decision Day Guide,news," Bloomberg     The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates by a quarter point at its meeting that concludes Wednesday and leave the option open for additional moves despite demands by President Donald Trump for a  large  rate cut 
 We may get a dissent or two  but it seems like a 25 basis point cut is pretty much locked in   said Julia Coronado  president and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York 
The Federal Open Market Committee will issue a policy statement at 2 p m  after the two day meeting concludes and Chairman Jerome Powell will brief reporters 30 minutes later 
The immediate outlook for policy has been made crystal clear thanks to a communications flub by New York Fed President John Williams  NYSE WMB  in a July 18 speech 
Odds for a half point cut rose after he recommended swift policy action if the economy weakens when rates are low  but fell back after the bank later clarified that he was not discussing upcoming policy moves  Trump weighed in on Williams s remarks  saying a day later that he liked his first statement much more than his second 
Rate Outlook
The meeting still contains drama  It s unclear how much opposition even a quarter point cut will face within the FOMC  or what signal will emerge about the scope for further easing 
Underlying both questions are uncertainties about just how much the U S  economy is likely to slow and how monetary policy should respond 
 For a lot of them  25 will feel like a down payment   said William English  a professor at Yale University and former senior Fed economist   But I think they ll be willing to wait to get more information and make a decision about how much easing to do over time  
What Our Economists Say
 Uncertainty toward the timing and scope of additional action leaves markets more sensitive to signals of future policy measures than the well telegraphed rate cut looming at present  Policy makers would be wise to take advantage of recent upbeat economic data to outline the parameters for a modest recalibration of rates in order to avoid getting pressured into a more pronounced easing  
   Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva  Bloomberg economistsClick here for full note 
Before Williams spoke on July 18  investors were pricing in a quarter point cut  Powell had laid out the case for easing amid global economic uncertainties and muted inflation  Other policy makers argued for lowering rates in a  risk management  approach 
In his remarks  Williams reviewed his long standing belief that central banks should move aggressively in a downturn when rates are near zero  Investors took it as a signal that a half point move might be on the table  until the New York Fed issued the clarification 
That steer  combined with a solid    though not spectacular    report on second quarter economic growth  reduced the chances of a half point cut to  almost zero   said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist at  Northern Trust  Corp  NASDAQ NTRS   in Chicago 
The data showed the U S  economy expanded at an annualized pace of 2 1   slower than the first quarter but above the 1 8  expected by economists 
Central bank watchers anticipate some regional Fed presidents will argue against any cut at all  That group includes two current FOMC voters  Kansas City s Esther George and Boston s Eric Rosengren  so resistance could spur two dissents  The meeting s minutes will be released on Aug  21  providing a fuller picture of any divide  and officials may detail their views in public in the meantime 
Several economists expect the committee s post meeting statement will repeat language from June promising to monitor incoming data and to  act as appropriate to sustain the expansion   That will likely lead investors to expect another quarter point cut as early as September  without committing the Fed to such a move 
 The intention is likely to do another 25  but the data will ultimately determine the willingness to do more   said Michael Gapen  chief U S  economist at  Barclays   LON BARC  Plc in New York 
Powell can then use his press conference to further shape rate expectations  Another challenge will be to explain why the committee went ahead with a cut despite a slew of positive news  Since the Fed last met  the U S  and China have returned to the trade negotiating table  and fresh U S  employment and spending numbers have come in strong 
 That s a tricky issue for him   said English   Since June  the data s been pretty good  
He may also get questions on whether the Fed would join the U S  government in intervening to weaken the dollar to aid U S  exports after Trump told reporters last week that he had not ruled it out 
Balance Sheet
Financial markets will also watch for an early end to the runoff of securities from the Fed s balance sheet  That process  scheduled to conclude at the end of September  modestly tightens policy by removing downward pressure on long term bond yields 
Economists were divided on whether officials will want to halt the runoffs when they cut interest rates  Few saw an immediate cessation as likely  but some said it would simplify communications about the direction of monetary policy 
 The markets won t be affected either way  but it s a cleaner message  if the Fed halts the runoffs  Coronado said ",2019-07-31,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-looks-locked-in-for-quarterpoint-cut-decision-day-guide-1940089,1940089

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Northern Trust in Focus
Northern Trust  NTRS  is headquartered in Chicago  and is in the Finance sector  The stock has seen a price change of 16 62  since the start of the year  The wealth management firm is paying out a dividend of  0 6 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 46  compared to the Banks   Major Regional industry s yield of 2 77  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 93  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  2 40 is up 23 7  from last year  In the past five year period  Northern Trust has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 25   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Northern Trust s payout ratio is 36   which means it paid out 36  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for NTRS for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  6 80 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 2 41

124910,346425,NTRS,Game in disarray  Spieth misses 54 hole cut at Wyndham,news,"By Andrew Both
GREENSBORO  N C   Reuters    Barely a year after being ranked a lofty third in the world  Jordan Spieth made an ignominious early departure from the Wyndham Championship on Saturday  a pale shadow of his former self  his game and confidence in tatters 
Spieth has been battling an inconsistent swing most of the year  with a tendency to hit a couple of awful and costly shots each round  and nothing he did at Sedgefield this week suggests he is any closer to solving the problem 
Three double bogeys in a birdie free third round led to a seven over par 77  the worst score of the day by three shots  and he did not survive the 54 hole cut 
Spieth had teed off only four strokes from the halfway lead  despite having hit a ball out of bounds in each of the first two rounds 
He went out of bounds again on Saturday at the par four 10th  where his drive sailed way right 
 On the front nine I had decent looks at birdie on a lot of holes  and then on 10  when I hit that one out of bounds  it was like  man  I don t know what s going on   the ever polite Spieth said in a short interview with reporters 
 It was just a bad day  I putted  extremely well  for two days to be where I was  
A fateful decision on the first tee led to a wretched start that knocked the stuffing out of the 26 year old Texan 
After initially planning to hit a hybrid club  Spieth decided instead to go with a three wood  a decision he would immediately rue 
He tugged his shot a little and the ball ended up just below the lip in a fairway bunker  a fate that he would have avoided had he stuck with his original club because he would not have been able to reach the sand 
He could only advance his second shot 90 yards  and from there he flicked a low wedge shot that skipped over the elevated green and down a bank 
After a sublime chip to inside three feet  it seemed he had done enough to salvage what under the circumstances would have been a pretty good bogey at the par four hole 
Using his normally assured cross handed putting stroke  he took a couple of peaks at the hole  settled his eyes on the ball and pulled the trigger 
It missed  and the tone for the day had been set 
INSULT TO INJURY
Spieth s long game on the front nine after that was not too bad  although he hit driver only once  a poor chip at the easy par five fifth cost him a birdie and a three putt bogey from 15 feet at the next added insult to injury 
Going out of bounds on the 10th led to another double bogey  and he dropped two more shots at the 13th  where his tee shot sailed way left 
On Friday  another former world number one David Duval observed that Spieth was rushing the transition from his backswing to his downswing  and that his technique was often breaking down in the process 
 It is a mechanical failure but you also through this process tend to lose confidence and if you don t know if it s coming out right  coming out left or it s going to go straight  where do you aim   Duval said in his role as a Golf Channel analyst 
 That s the difficulty he is facing  There is a bit of a breakdown  
Only four years ago Spieth had a realistic chance of completing the calendar grand slam  He won the Masters and U S  Open and came close at the British Open and PGA Championship 
He added the 2017 British Open to his trophy cabinet but has not won any tournament since and arrived at the Wyndham ranked 67th in the FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup standings 
Spieth said he would not go home to Dallas en route to the first PGA Tour playoff event  the  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  in New Jersey 
 It s a long way to go home and come back   he said 
His game it seems is also a long way from coming back ",2019-08-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/game-in-disarray-spieth-misses-54hole-cut-at-wyndham-1944885,1944885

124914,346429,NTRS,Golf   Spieth risks oblivion unless he stops tinkering says Chamblee,news," Reuters    Slumping Jordan Spieth might never find his way back from the wilderness unless he stops analysing his swing in such detail and returns instead to his natural ways  PGA Tour winner turned television analyst Brandel Chamblee said on Monday 
Chamblee  citing British Open champions David Duval and Ian Baker Finch as prime examples  pointed to a long list of players whose games went into permanent decline when they started tinkering with their swings 
  Spieth  is part of a problem that is going on in golf right now  almost an epidemic of players  aged from the mid 20s to mid 30s  who just disappear off the planet   Chamblee said 
 If you put  Spieth  on a range and leave him alone he ll put two and two together better than anybody else  You have to protect your talent and genius and do that at all costs  I see right now an onslaught of information overload  
Chamblee and former major champion Paul Azinger were speaking on a conference call promoting NBC and Golf Channel s coverage of the PGA Tour s three event FedEx  NYSE FDX  Cup playoff series  which starts with the  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Open in New Jersey on Thursday 
Spieth  who won three major titles before the age of 24  was ranked second in the world as recently as last year but enters the playoffs way down in 69th on the FedEx Cup points list 
He might not even qualify for the second playoff event next week  which will include only the top 70 in the standings 
The Texan is coming off one of the worst rounds of his career  a seven over par 77 at the Wyndham Championship on Saturday that was the day s worst score by three shots 
NOT COMPLICATED
Azinger sounded more confident that Spieth would find his way back  but like Chamblee urged the 26 year old to keep it simple 
Azinger cited the late Byron Nelson  who once said there were two kinds of players  those who needed to know a little and those who needed to know it all 
 It s not that complicated   Azinger said 
 He s a smart guy and I think at this point you ve just got to let him be young here for a little while and figure it all out 
 He s two or three swings away from piecing it back together  He s going to be around for a long time  
Chamblee  meanwhile  urged Spieth to rediscover his youthful athletic self 
 I believe he needs to get back to the softness and athleticism that he had when he first came out   Chamblee said 
 You could call it a wise ignorance that he had then  or an ignorant wisdom  There s a lot to be said about just going out and being an athlete 
 He doesn t need to work on anything at all  This incessant tinkering comes with a cost  Some get better but more have disappeared  It could happen very easily that he never finds his way back home  ",2019-08-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/golf--spieth-risks-oblivion-unless-he-stops-tinkering-says-chamblee-1946412,1946412

 I learned a lot last year by playing too much  coming back from my procedure and not knowing what to expect  I pushed it pretty hard and vowed I d never do that again   he told reporters 
 And that s the challenge now because I cut my schedule back  but the problem was the season changed  We have a more condensed season and trying to figure out how to stay sharp  practice and have my back feeling good all the time is a challenge  
Woods added   I can t practice as much as I d like  I can t even sniff as much as I used to practice  
Woods played nine holes on Tuesday with Brooks Koepka  Dustin Johnson and Harold Varner III  and said he was  hitting it great   but he limited his play in Wednesday s pro am and admitted he was stiff

124927,346442,NTRS,Fed Chair Powell s unscripted approach sets up for rocky 2019,news,"By Jason Lange and Ann Saphir WASHINGTON SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Jerome Powell had a bumpy first year as Federal Reserve chairman when it came to talking policy  by turns spooking and comforting investors even as economic data offered increasingly mixed signals and President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on the U S  central bank   And as 2018 closes out with a dramatic slump in stocks and a drop in bond yields  financial markets will need to brace for next year  when Powell is scheduled to make more unscripted public remarks than any Fed chief in history   A lawyer and former investment banker whose long career in markets and government gave him the real world perspective Trump sought in a Fed chair  Powell took office in February determined to improve the Fed s communications with Congress and the public  He meets frequently with legislators  and speaks about policy in a style that is less economic textbook and more folksy than past Fed chiefs  who in recent decades have all been economists   That style may have been part of Powell s appeal to Trump  but it has arguably contributed to market volatility as investors hang on Powell s every word for clarity on how much further the Fed may raise rates    I have people in my building who are just furious about this   said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS   referencing Powell s recent description of the Fed s current situation as walking through a dark room   Though the metaphor was meant to show Powell s appreciation of the uncertainty the central bank faces and a reason for caution  Tannenbaum said it left investors in the lurch   The problem is  the Fed can t just sit there in the dark  The Fed has to make an effort to shed light on what s going on   Powell has continued to advertise the Fed s  uncertainty   using the word four times at his Dec  19 news conference following the Fed s rate hike at its last policy meeting of the year  But with Powell sending one set of messages in his remarks   that risks are mounting and rate hikes may need to go slower   while still producing Fed forecasts that show rates continuing to rise next year   The message in here is a little bit sloppy   said University of Oregon economics professor Tim Duy   Crystal clear guidance  meanwhile  has its own drawbacks   At the December news conference following the Fed s fourth rate hike of 2018  Powell said definitively that the Fed s balance sheet downsizing was on  automatic pilot  and he did not anticipate any changes  Though the remarks were consistent with past Fed guidance  stocks sank on disappointment that he did not indicate more flexibility  A couple days later  New York Fed President John Williams  NYSE WMB   a close ally of Powell and a permanent voter on the Fed s policy setting committee  conveyed a softer approach  Stocks rose  All Fed chairs have stumbled  and roiled markets across the globe as a result  Ben Bernanke in 2013 sent world stocks plummeting when he suggested the Fed would slow its bond buying stimulus  Alan Greenspan back in 1996 tried to deflate stocks by noting  irrational exuberance  in asset values  though the effect was short lived  But past Fed chairs have never operated under the current level of open scrutiny from the White House  with Trump s own commentary roiling markets as well  Complicating matters further  weaker global growth may threaten what have been powerful gains in the U S  job market and strong domestic growth  Add to that a trade war with China and a shutdown of parts of America s federal government over a budget impasse  and the result is a potent blend of uncertainties that have markets betting the Fed will not raise rates even once next year   It is against this background that starting in January Powell will hold a news conference after every Fed meeting to provide more clarity about Fed actions and thinking  as he explained when he announced the change in June  The change will mean that Powell will hold eight news conferences in 2019  up from the current practice of four per year  But the change also increases the odds of a stray market rankling remark   It might be a good time to say even more forcefully that the Fed does not have all the answers  said former Fed Vice Chair Alice Rivlin   
 That s always difficult   Rivlin said  recounting Greenspan s reaction when she used the word  guess  in a speech    He  said  don t use the word  guess  because it sounds like we don t know what we re doing  And I thought well  okay    but we don t  ",2018-12-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fed-chair-powells-unscripted-approach-sets-up-for-rocky-2019-1733341,1733341

124935,346450,NTRS,Bond yield curveball stalls global stocks rally,news,"By Josephine Mason LONDON  Reuters    This year s roaring rally in world equities ran into sand by the end of the quarter  with warning signs from bond markets  U turns from central banks and persistent trade worries scattering consensus about what happens over the rest of 2019  The pan European STOXX 600 index has climbed 12 2 percent in the first three months of the year  its best quarter in four years  while the S P 500 is on track for its biggest quarterly gain in nearly a decade  A bounceback was expected after the historic rout in late 2018  but few investors predicted the size of the rebound or the scale of the about turn by European and U S  central banks on interest rates that helped fuel it  The majority of the gains were logged in January   between 6 and 8 percent   as dovish comments from the Federal Reserve  economic stimulus in China and easing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington soothed worries about slowing economic growth  In March  however  the pace slowed to 1 percent as euphoria over slower rate hikes turned to worries about what the uber dovish Fed and ECB stance said about the world economy amid tepid U S  and euro zone growth  Now few are taking a strong view   People are wondering if they ve missed the rally and then they think it doesn t make sense to invest when the curve is inverted and the economy is slowing   said Willem Sels  chief market strategist at HSBC Private Banking  He reckons global stocks have the potential to rise another 5 to 7 percent  with the inversion of the bond yield curve overdone   The next few weeks will be more volatile  people are going to be concerned until they see the data improve and Q1 earnings might not be very good so we re in a zone of higher volatility   he said  A poll of investors across the globe in February revealed the wide dispersion of views about how equities will fare over the next 12 months  illustrating the lack of consensus across the market  Take the estimates for the S P 500  The highest called for the index to rise 25 percent  while the most bearish pegged the market falling by around 10 percent by mid 2020  Europe displayed a similar disparity  with estimates ranging between a 15 percent rise and a plus 20 percent increase for the STOXX 600  In the end  the median forecast for the pan European

 which plunged investors deeper into confusion  With 10 year U S  bond yields below 3 month T bill rates for the first time in more than a decade  recession fears were swirling  But the 2  to 10 year yield curve steepened  offering conflicting signals that there was no cause for alarm  After all  the world economy is actually chugging along at a decent clip  company earnings are still growing  albeit more slowly  and leading central banks are increasingly dovish  While it might take months before the markets settle   and it s dependent on decent macroeconomic data   Wouter Sturkenboom  chief investment strategist for EMEA and APAC at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS   reckons the bond moves have been overplayed   We believe government bonds are overdoing it right now  That s a vote of no confidence in the Fed and its communication strategy  That s why we are not de risking right now   he said   Graphic  U S  yield curve inverts for first time since 2007     To break stocks out of their lethargy  investors need some decent macroeconomic data and first quarter earnings to restore battered confidence   We ve gone a long way now toward pricing in the central banks  and for risk assets to push on into Q2 we are going to need growth to pick up the baton   said Paul O Connor  head of Janus Henderson s UK based multi asset team   The way risk assets have begun to react to the yield curve is further confirmation that risk assets have probably extracted as much positivity as they can from lower yields    But analysts have slashed their 2019 earnings forecasts to their lowest in three years  and most expect the coming earnings season to be weak  Companies listed on the S P 500 index are expected to report a 1 9 percent contraction in earnings in the first quarter  down

concerned that stocks are now taking a breather   We have had such a strong bounceback  but markets don t go in a straight line  It is inevitable you will get some kind of respite   he said

124942,346457,NTRS,The Fed Fights a New Bank It Fears  The Startup Sees Nothing to Worry About,news," Bloomberg     The Federal Reserve is trying to kill a fledgling bank before the newfangled business takes root  arguing it s a dangerous idea  The nascent company says there s no reason to fret about its plan to give big investors access to the central bank s highest interest rates 
Figuring out who s right is no easy task 
James McAndrews  once the New York Fed s co director of research  created the bank in 2016  hoping to give pensions  insurers and other large institutional investors higher yields on their cash by parking money at the Fed  Currently  only a select few banks can receive that top tier rate  now at 2 4 percent  The best that money market funds    a popular cash receptacle for the firms McAndrews is targeting    can get from the Fed is 2 25 percent 
The New York Fed has prevented his company  TNB USA Inc   from opening the type of account it needs to make the business model work  That prompted the firm to sue the central bank last year  saying it was obstructing the project  The Fed found another way to fight back as the case continues to unfold  Last month  it proposed rewriting its rules so TNB or any other potential narrow banks    so named because they are solely focused on taking deposits    could only get lower interest rates  sabotaging their raison d  tre 
Setting the legal merits aside  the Fed has reason to be conservative when considering the core of its mission  keeping the U S  economy and financial system safe and healthy  A spokesperson for the New York Fed declined to comment 
 The Fed basically finds itself with a Rube Goldberg machine that happens to be working pretty well   said Brian Smedley  the head of macroeconomic and investment research at Guggenheim Partners LLC  which manages more than  265 billion   They don t want to tinker with it too much because it may break  which is why they seem to find the narrow bank model to be so problematic  
TNB disagrees  saying that narrow banks would safely increase interest rates for depositors   These actions will improve the transmission of monetary policy  much as the Fed itself has done through its overnight reverse repo facility   McAndrews said Tuesday 
What follows are three problems the Fed has with narrow banks  TNB s rebuttals and an assessment of the arguments 
Issue  1  Monetary policy

Fed s view  Narrow banks might place a large amount of reserves  or excess deposits  at the Fed  That could undermine the central bank s goal of paring back the assets it s hosting as it seeks to move toward normalcy and end an emergency measure used to revive the banking system after the financial crisis a decade ago 
TNB s view  TNB sees no  looming policy disaster   explaining that the money it anticipates adding as reserves will be a  modest fraction  of the approximately  1 5 trillion in reserves currently parked at the Fed 
Assessing the argument  Policy makers keep reiterating they need an ample supply of reserves to keep their interest rate benchmark under control  a return to lower pre crisis levels is unlikely  And Alex Roever  head of U S  rates strategy at JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    says the Fed will keep more reserves than what banks actually need  So TNB contributing a trivial amount doesn t seem like much of a risk 

Issue  2  Market volatility

Fed s view  Trading volume in funding markets    particularly fed funds    could dry up if money shifts to narrow banks  causing volatility  In other words  short term rates might meander far from where central bankers want them to be 
TNB s view  There would actually be less volatility  TNB says it would actually help keep the fed funds rate from moving outside the Fed s desired band  strengthening control over monetary policy  How  If  like conventional banks  TNB could get the Fed s interest on excess reserves rate  IOER   that would place competitive pressure on large banks to boost rates on deposits for all customers  That would enhance the Fed s ability to steer the fed funds rate using IOER 
Assessing the argument  To some extent  the argument is moot  The fed funds market has already shrunk  to  71 billion a day last quarter from hundreds of billions before the financial crisis  As a result  the Federal Open Market Committee in November started discussing potential alternative policy benchmarks to control short term interest rates  an indication the Fed believes the fed funds market is broken  The fed funds market is  essentially dead because banks are holding a huge supply of reserves   John H  Cochrane  a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University  wrote in a blog post last month  Cochrane also said that if fed funds were to become more volatile  indexes could move to Libor  general collateral repo or other rates 

Issue  3  Financial stability

Fed s view  In times of stress  haven seeking investors would flock to the central bank instead of scooping up high quality assets like Treasury bills  The Fed says that s bad because when the financial system is strained  investors that would typically provide funding to myriad financial and non financial institutions could withdraw from the funding markets in favor of narrow banks   greatly amplifying systemic risk  
TNB s view  There would be no threat to stability  Investors already have havens besides bills  including the Fed s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility  RRP  and the foreign reverse repo pool  and the world hasn t ended 
Assessing the argument  Post financial crisis  institutions from central banks to money market funds have found higher yielding alternatives to funding markets like repo and Treasury bills  Peak usage of RRP hit almost  475 billion in 2015 as institutions ranging from money market funds to banks used it to secure additional funding  The foreign reverse repo pool    where central banks invest cash at the New York Fed at a rate that is comparable to market based repo rates    is averaging about  240 billion a week  If during a crisis investors pull deposits from conventional banks and put them into TNB  it could cause financial stability issues  according to Peter Yi  head of short term fixed income at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Asset Management   The real challenge and risk to the financial system of this narrow bank is that its business model can present itself as a flight to quality asset class for depositors   said Yi  whose firm manages  402 billion in fixed income assets   That could create a run on the traditional banks

124943,346458,NTRS,Fed likely to resist pressure to cut U S  rates this week,news,"By Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider SAN FRANCISCO WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Federal Reserve  facing fresh demands by President Donald Trump to cut interest rates  is expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged at a policy meeting this week but possibly lay the groundwork for a rate cut later this year  New economic projections that will accompany the U S  central bank s policy statement on Wednesday will provide the most direct insight yet into how deeply policymakers have been influenced by the U S  China trade war  Trump s insistence on lower interest rates  and recent weaker economic data   Analysts expect the  dot plot  of year end forecasts for the Fed s benchmark overnight lending rate   the federal funds rate   will show a growing number of policymakers are open to cutting rates in the coming months  though nowhere near as aggressively as investors expect or Trump wants  The Fed is also widely  though not universally  expected to remove a pledge to be  patient  in taking future action on rates  opening the door to a possible cut at its coming policy meetings  Risks may be rising  but  I don t think they want to box themselves into a corner   said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS    The markets are set up for a cut in July  and if they don t get it  financial conditions will tighten    The federal funds rate is currently set in a range of 2 25  to 2 50   The Fed s policy setting committee is due to release its latest statement and economic projections at 2 p m  EDT  1800 GMT  on Wednesday after the end of a two day meeting  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference shortly after  MIND THE DOTS The Fed s last set of economic and policy projections  released in March  showed most policymakers foresaw no need to change rates this year and only very gradual rate hikes thereafter   For a graphic of the gap between market and Fed expectations  please see    But since that meeting the economic outlook has become cloudier  Recent U S  retail sales numbers were strong  But while unemployment has held near a 50 year low of 3 6   U S  employers created a paltry 75 000 jobs in May  Inflation  which Powell says is low in part because of temporary factors  continues to undershoot the Fed s 2  target  The Atlanta Fed forecast on Friday that gross domestic product will increase at a 2 1 percent annualized rate in the April June quarter  a drop from the 3 1 percent pace of the first three months of the year   Trade uncertainty has increased as well  with Trump using the threat of tariffs on goods from Mexico to force the country to curb the number of mostly Central American immigrants crossing the U S  Mexico border  He has also vowed to slap more tariffs on Chinese imports if no trade deal is reached when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Group of 20 summit at the end of this month in Japan   Concern that mounting tariffs could further slow U S  and global economic growth is one of the chief reasons traders in interest rate futures loaded up on contracts anticipating three U S  rate cuts by the end of the year   Fed officials may have reason to trim their rate outlook a bit  but meeting market expectations would involve a dramatic shift  Nine of the Fed s current 17 policymakers would have to move their rate projections downward for the median to reflect a single cut  let alone three   Powell will do what he can to try to downplay the dots especially if they don t show what the markets want them to show   said Roberto Perli  economist at Cornerstone Macro   He will have a tough time   Adding to the pressure for a rate cut is a yield curve inversion in parts of the market for U S  government debt  historically a precursor of recessions  The three month Treasury bill  for instance  has paid out a higher rate than a 5 year Treasury note for the last several months running   And Trump  who has said that rates should be lowered by perhaps a full percentage point or more  continues to publicly berate the Fed and Powell  his handpicked chairman  for refusing to act   I ve waited long enough   Trump said in an interview with ABC News last week  talking favorably of the  old days  when Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon intervened forcefully in Fed policy   and set the stage  many economists argue  for the high inflation  economic volatility and recessions that followed in the 1970s  DOWNWARD SHIFT Most of the more than 100 economists polled June 7 12 by Reuters say they are not penciling in a rate cut until the third quarter of next year  But views are shifting rapidly  Forty respondents expected at least one rate cut sometime in 2019  up from just eight who did in the previous poll  Within the U S  central bank  St  Louis Fed President James Bullard is the only policymaker who has said a rate cut may be needed  soon    Several others have signaled a readiness to move off their wait and see stance  with Powell saying earlier this month in a speech in Chicago that the Fed will act  as appropriate  in the face of risks posed by the global trade war and other developments  The word  patient   which had been repeatedly used by the Fed since early this year to signal its willingness to hold off further rate hikes  was notably absent from Powell s remarks  though the Fed chief stopped well short of suggesting a rate cut was coming soon  The Fed raised rates four times in 2018 but has since abandoned plans to continue lifting borrowing costs this year  It is likely to avoid signaling any move to cut rates until it is ready to deliver  predicted Bruce Monrad  a high yield bond portfolio manager at Boston based Northeast Investors Trust   
Nevertheless  Monrad added  Fed policymakers may have tied their own hands by letting bets in financial markets stray so far   They have had six months to control the rhetoric  They really haven t walked back the market  ",2019-06-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fed-likely-to-resist-pressure-to-cut-us-rates-this-week-1899067,1899067
124944,346459,NTRS,How Have Full Year 2019 SP 500 Earnings Estimates Changed ,opinion,"The number of  positive revisions  to SP 500 estimates outnumber  negative revisions  Here is the data and the graph 

The above is a spreadsheet of the weekly number of positive and negative SP 500 EPS estimate revisions 
The Street has been negative   for some time   on EPS estimates until this week 
That s a good sign 
Here is the graphical display of the same data  but the IBES graph data only goes back to early Feb  19 

So  how have 2019 sector growth rates changed for the SP 500 

Note how the overall SP 500 expected earnings growth rate for 2019 was revised slightly lower since April 1  19  BUT several sectors have been revised higher  meaning that as of Friday  April 26   19  the expected sector earnings growth is higher today than it was on April 1   19 
Which sectors are looking for better earnings growth for full year 2019 today than they were on April 1   19 

Energy
Financials
Health Care
Real Estate
Technology

Which sectors are expected to show faster earnings growth than the SP 500 as a whole for 2019 

Financials at 9  expected growth for 2019 
Health Care at 5 7  expected growth for 2019 
Real Estate at 4  expected growth for 2019 

Gary Morrow   garysmorrow  one of my favorite technicians noted yesterday on Twitter that the BKX would likely close above it s 200 day moving average since last September  18 and on Friday  April 26th  2019 the BKX did close above that key average 

Summary   conclusion  SP 500 earnings data is getting more positive   the first week since late November  18 where positive revisions outnumbered negative revisions by a substantial margin   is a big positive  Last night s post about  upside surprises  left out the raw data  but readers get the point  Clients remain overweight Financials  with The Charles Schwab Corporation  NYSE SCHW  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  as the largest Financial holdings 
Of all 11 SP 500 sectors  the Financial sector is expecting the strongest sector growth at 9  for full year 2019 
I still think that Q1  19 earnings will show 3    4  growth against a very strong comp a year ago  by mid May  19 
Full year 2019 SP 500 earnings growth should be closer to high single digits at least  by year end   but we ll know more by the summer

124967,346482,NTRS,Atlantis Japan Growth Fund  Plenty Of Attractive Investment Opportunities,opinion,"Atlantis Japan Growth Fund Ltd  LON AJG  is advised by Atlantis Investment Research Corporation  AIRC   Lead adviser Taeko Setaishi says that although consensus Japanese corporate earnings growth is being revised downwards  she is still able to identify primarily smaller cap companies with promising growth prospects that are trading on attractive valuations  As an example  Setaishi highlights changing dynamics within the Japanese economy  which are generating growth in the widely diverse services sector  AJG s portfolio is trading on higher valuation multiples than the TOPIX index but has meaningfully higher forecast earnings growth and a superior return on equity  which have contributed to the fund s medium  and long term outperformance versus the benchmark 


The market opportunity
While overall economic activity in Japan is muted  there are pockets of higher growth  both on a company specific and sector basis  and in aggregate  Japanese corporates are increasing cash returns to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases  Meanwhile  Japanese equities look reasonably priced  both compared with other developed global markets and versus their own history 
Why consider investing in AJG 
  Specialist fund offering exposure to higher growth  often under researched  companies in Japan 
  AJG now has greater overlap with the highly rated open ended Atlantis Japan Opportunities Fund  where Setaishi has been lead adviser since inception in 2003  the trust s investment performance has improved since she became lead adviser on 1 May 2016 
  Average annual NAV and share price total returns between 13 4  and 16 7  over the last three  five and 10 years 
  Simplified capital structure following cancellation of the subscription rights programme in 2017 
Potential for narrower discount
AJG is currently trading at an 8 5  discount to NAV  which is broadly in line with the 8 8  to 9 5  average discounts over the last one  three  five and 10 years  There is potential for the discount to narrow if lead adviser Setaishi is able to build on her record of outperformance versus the benchmark  or if there is increased demand for Japanese  particularly smaller cap  equities  Similar to the majority of its peers  AJG does not pay a dividend  Gearing up to 20  of NAV is permitted  net gearing of 2 9  at end February 2019  

Market outlook  Valuation provides margin of safety
The lack of overall growth in the Japanese economy is well documented  as the nation struggles with a lack of inflation and an ageing population  Indeed  2018 was affected by several natural disasters  and Q318 corporate profits fell at the sharpest rate since the period following the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami in 2011  The Japanese economy is also being negatively affected by the economic slowdown in China  which can be partially attributed to the escalating trade dispute with the US  However  there are Japanese companies  operating in niche businesses  that have attractive growth profiles  and in general  the corporate sector is utilising its cash flow more efficiently and returning capital to shareholders via higher dividends and share repurchases  There is potential for an improvement in the macro environment  the Chinese authorities are working to stimulate their domestic economy  measures include lower bank reserve requirements and reduced personal tax rates   and if the US president wishes to be considered for re election in 2020  it is in his interests to ensure a robust economy and a buoyant US equity market  which may lead to a resolution in the trade dispute with China 
Exhibit 2  LHS  shows that over the last five years  Japanese small cap equities have outperformed the wider Japanese stock market  which has broadly kept pace with global equites  However  Japanese equities continue to look attractively valued  Exhibit 2  RHS   which provides a margin of safety in an uncertain macro environment  They are trading on a forward P E multiple of 12 9x  which is an 11 6  discount to world equities  and this is noticeably wider than the 4 2  average discount over the last five years  Japanese equities are also trading on an earnings multiple that is 11  lower than its five year average  unlike US and European equity indices  which are trading at premiums of 11  and 5  respectively 

Fund profile  Smaller cap Japanese equities
Launched on 10 May 1996  AJG is a Guernsey registered investment company  listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange  Its investment manager is Quaero Capital  with Atlantis Investment Research Corporation  AIRC  acting as investment adviser  AIRC is an independent boutique fund adviser based in Tokyo  established in 1996   employing four investment professionals  three portfolio advisers supported by an analyst  with an average of more than 30 years  investment experience  Since 1 May 2016  AJG s lead adviser has been Taeko Setaishi  who was formerly its deputy fund adviser for 20 years 
AJG aims to generate long term capital growth from a diversified portfolio of 60 70 primarily small  and mid cap Japanese equities  and is benchmarked against the TOPIX index  At the time of investment  a maximum 20  of NAV may be allocated to equity warrants or convertible debt  AJG s current portfolio is entirely invested in publicly listed Japanese companies  including REITs  with no structured product exposure   No more than 10  of the portfolio may be held in a single company  Gearing up to 20  of NAV is permitted at the time of borrowing  at end February 2019  net gearing was 2 9   AJG does not typically hedge its currency exposure  Data from Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  and Bloomberg show that from the fund s inception on 10 May 1996 to end January 2019  AJG s NAV total return in sterling terms was  229 9   which is meaningfully ahead of the benchmark s  48 1  total return 
The fund s lead portfolio adviser  Taeko Setaishi
The lead adviser s view  Pockets of growth opportunities
Setaishi says that over the last few weeks  there has been increasing evidence that the Japanese economy is slowing  She notes a deterioration in the export market  especially in terms of demand from China and South Korea  and the lack of a pick up in consumer spending  making her more cautious on the overall Japanese growth outlook now than at the beginning of the year  However  she highlights that private sector capex remains robust as companies are investing in software and machinery to try to combat the effects of labour shortages  and capacity is being increased in anticipation of future demand  Japan s consumption tax is scheduled to increase from 8  to 10  in October 2019  However  unlike in April 2014 when the tax increased from 5  to 8   this time around  the government has committed to a  4 7tn stimulus package to offset the negative effects of the tax rise  Setaishi believes that the government is fully committed to the stimulus  with the bulk of spending due in the second half of Japan s FY20  ending 31 March 2020  
In terms of investor sentiment towards Japanese equities  the lead manager says that while February 2019 marked the seventh consecutive month of non resident outflows on a cash basis  it was also the third month where there were net inflows on a futures basis  on a combined cash and futures basis  February 2019 saw net inflows into the Japanese market   Setaishi says that looking at domestic demand  Japanese equities will continue to be supported by Bank of Japan exchange traded fund and pension fund purchases  while non financial corporates are buying equities as part of their share repurchase plans  evidence of improving corporate governance in Japan   The lead adviser also notes a recent large uptick in short selling activity  however  the Japanese equity market has been able to absorb this without a noticeable decline in any key indices 
While in aggregate  the outlook for corporate profits growth has moderated for the coming Japanese financial year  Setaishi says that on an individual company basis  among both small  and large cap companies  there are pockets of higher growth  While the lead adviser selects stocks purely on a bottom up basis  there are a number of themes represented in AJG s portfolio  such as demand growth in the healthcare sector resulting from Japan s ageing population  along with the diverse services sector  The fund holds a number of companies in this area  including Tosoh  an operator of sports club facilities  hotels  and a golf course  which is a beneficiary of demand from Japan s ageing population  as well as consulting services companies that are benefiting from labour shortages  such as Creek   River and Fullcast  Setaishi also highlights the infrastructure sector  where she has found several interesting investment opportunities  The adviser notes that rising industry capex is partly due to ageing infrastructure  she expects spending to remain robust as companies are experiencing demand for the decommissioning of old plants  which requires specialist resources  Setaishi reiterates that  although Japan s economic growth could be described as  pedestrian   there are many dynamic growth companies in the country  which are providing  good  exciting investment opportunities  
Asset allocation
Investment process  Four stage process
AIRC s investment philosophy is that over the long term a company s share price is driven by the level of its earnings growth  Stocks are selected on a bottom up basis  the adviser seeks well managed companies with growing businesses and a strong competitive position  which are generating free cash flow and trading at a discount to their perceived intrinsic value  AIRC s proprietary fundamental research can add meaningful value  particularly when identifying attractive small  and mid cap companies  which tend to be under researched by the wider market  As part of its research process  the team undertakes c 800 company meetings each year  this high level of interaction is viewed as an effective risk control 
There are four stages to AIRC s investment process 
  Periodic screening   the investible universe of c 2 000 companies is screened quarterly  Key criteria include  at least double digit sales and operating profit growth  improving returns  and valuation multiples such as P E to growth  PEG   EV EBITDA and price to book  relative to the sector  are a focus 
  Company visits   these are viewed as critical  to enable a good understanding of a company s business model  its competitive position and future strategy 
  Evaluation   diligent fundamental research  including construction of an earnings model to assess a company s long term sales and earnings growth potential  and determination of an appropriate valuation 
  Buy list   typically c 125 companies considered for inclusion in the portfolio  c 40 are included on a watch list   companies with attractive fundamentals  but less compelling valuations  
Position size is a function of the adviser s level of conviction in the investment thesis  as well as taking into consideration a stock s liquidity  Holdings may be sold outright if there is an earnings disappointment  an unjustified change in a firm s business model  a downturn in a company s operating environment  or if a position becomes too large  The fund has a high active share of 97 6   a measure of how a portfolio differs from the benchmark  with 100  representing no commonality and 0  full index replication  

At end February 2019  AJG held 64 stocks  four less than a year earlier  Looking at the portfolio s top 10 concentration in Exhibit 1  it was 27 2  at end February 2019  2 8pp lower year on year  three positions were common to both periods   In terms of market cap  Exhibit 4   over the last 12 months  exposure to larger cap companies  above  5bn  has declined by 6 4pp 
In Exhibit 5  we highlight AJG s sector exposure  using Global Industry Classification Standard rather than TOPIX classifications   The largest changes year on year at end February 2019 are consumer discretionary   4 4pp  and industrials   3 4pp   The largest active weights in sectors owned are industrials   20 7pp   IT   9 4pp  and financials   8 2pp   while the fund has no exposure to the consumer staples  energy and utility sectors  which collectively make up 12 3  of the TOPIX index  Setaishi explains that over the last 12 months  the percentage of the portfolio invested in exporters  companies with more than 40  overseas sales  has declined from c 45  to c 30   due to both selling and reducing positions  but also because of individual share price performance 

Setaishi highlights a few of AJG s positions that have been initiated in the last 12 months 
Japan Elevator Service Holdings  JESH    while industry growth is low at 1 2  pa  this company has annual sales growth in the high single digits range  with mid  to high teens percentage projected annual earnings growth  JESH provides maintenance services to the five main elevator companies in Japan  and is benefiting from market consolidation  as the management of smaller operators reach retirement age and are selling their businesses  The adviser says the company is well managed and sees clear potential for margin improvement 
Kyoritsu Maintenance   operates and manages business and resort hotels  as well as dormitories for students and young employees throughout Japan  The company is benefiting from increased demand for dormitories from universities and corporates that are struggling to attract or retain their staff in a tight labour market  as well as high hotel demand from Japan s tourism sector 
TKP   a real estate company that is benefiting from the trend towards outsourcing  which is occurring at companies across the market cap spectrum  TKP provides meeting rooms that companies are able to rent by the hour  and also offers catering options  Setaishi says the firm has attractive growth attributes  with a high percentage of repeat business  she says that TKP s break even rate is very low  making money if only 15 20  of its available rooms are utilised  
Complete sales from AJG s portfolio over the past year include Istyle and Star Mica  Istyle is an ecommerce company specialising in cosmetic products  the position was sold as its business was not recovering as rapidly as Setaishi had expected  Star Mica is a real estate company that had been held in AJG s portfolio for a number of years  The adviser believed that the slowdown in new home sales in Japan would likely spread into Star Mica s areas of operation  and some of its businesses have more  lumpy  rather than steady growth  so she took the opportunity to realise profits on the holding 
Performance  Solid medium  and long term returns
While AJG was not immune from the volatility in global stock markets during 2018  it has generated solid medium  and long term returns for investors  Over three  five and 10 years  its NAV total return has ranged between 14 0 16 5  pa  while its share price total return has ranged between 13 4 16 7  pa  Exhibit 6  RHS  

Looking at relative performance  AJG has outperformed its TOPIX benchmark index over three  five and particularly over 10 years in both NAV and share price total return terms  while lagging over the last 12 months  the figures in Exhibit 7 include AJG s more than 10pp performance dilution from subscription share issuance from October 2015 to October 2017   For UK investors  it is interesting to note AJG s significant outperformance versus the FTSE All Share index over the last three  five and 10 years 


Setaishi explains that over the last year  the best contributors to AJG s performance include construction firm Phil Company  outsourcing company Benefit One and Japan Elevator Service Holdings  Positions detracting from performance include Nittoku Engineering  Yamashin Filter and medical equipment company Cyberdyne  Commenting on the fund s strong relative performance in February 2019  the lead adviser notes that small cap stocks performed particularly well versus the broader market 
Discount  Broadly in line with historical averages
Having briefly traded at a premium in early 2018  AJG is currently trading at an 8 5  discount to NAV  which compares with the 3 3  to 14 6  range of discounts over the last 12 months  The current discount is broadly in line with the 9 2   8 9   8 8  and 9 5  average discounts over the last one  three  five and 10 years respectively 
The company adopted a hard discount control mechanism in 2013  whereby a continuation vote will be held if its shares have traded  on average  at a greater than 10  discount to NAV during any rolling 90 day period  in normal market conditions   If triggered  the vote will be held no later than the next practicable AGM  There is also a confirmed continuation vote at the October 2019 AGM  AJG has the authority  granted annually  to repurchase 14 99  of outstanding shares to help manage the discount  the most recent buyback was for 175k shares in December 2018 

Capital structure and fees
AJG is a Guernsey incorporated investment company with one class of share  there are currently 44 3m ordinary shares in issue  The company has a  1 5bn  c  10m  credit facility with Royal Bank of Scotland  LON RBS  International  of which  1 0bn  c  7m  is drawn  At end February 2019  net gearing was 2 9   AJG s subscription share mechanism was discontinued in November 2017  having successfully raised c  11m in FY16 and c  15m in FY17  the board believes the simplified capital structure is more appealing to shareholders  The company has a facility  at the board s discretion   enabling shareholders to sell all or part of their holdings via a regular six monthly redemption of up to 5  of AJG s outstanding shares  At each redemption point  the board may notionally allocate assets and liabilities into a redemption pool or use available cash to fund redemption requests  On 28 March 2019  AJG announced that 3 8m  8 27  of the share base  had been lodged for redemption  which will be scaled back  Results were released on 1 April 2019  after offsetting excess redemptions  the trust s share base was reduced by 1 8m shares  3 8    AJG will be subject to a confirmed continuation vote at the October 2019 AGM 
AJG s investment manager  Quaero Capital  is paid an annual management fee of 1  of NAV  and is entitled to the same rate on the NAV of any redemption pool  no performance fee is payable  In FY18  ongoing charges were 1 57   FY17  1 52    which is meaningfully lower than 1 91  in FY16   primarily due to the company s larger size  spreading fixed costs over a larger asset base 
Dividend policy and record
AJG focuses on long term capital growth rather than income  Its last dividend was immaterial and was distributed in FY12  the board intends to continue with a zero dividend policy  as income tends to be offset by expenses  On an underlying basis  AJG s portfolio yields 1 7   This is lower than the 2 4  yield on the benchmark TOPIX index  which is unsurprising given the company s focus on smaller cap companies that are less likely to pay dividends 
Peer group comparison
AJG is a member of the AIC Japanese Smaller Companies sector  In Exhibit 10  we show the three closed end funds in the sector that have been trading for more than a year  AJG s NAV total returns are below the averages over the periods shown  only modestly below over one and three years   however  the company s performance was diluted by more than 10pp over the two years of the subscription share issuance  October 2015 to October 2017   AJG has the highest ongoing charge of the three funds  the lowest level of gearing and is one of two peers that does not pay a dividend  To enable a broader comparison  we also show the six open ended funds in the IA Japanese Smaller Companies sector that have been trading for more than one year  AJG s total returns are above the open ended averages over the last one and three years  while trailing over five and 10 years  readers should be reminded that Setaishi became lead adviser nearly three years ago  

The board
AJG s board comprises four independent non executive directors  The chairman is Noel Lamb  who joined the board on 1 February 2011 and assumed his current role on 1 May 2014  Philip Ehrmann was appointed on 25 October 2013  Richard Pavry on 1 August 2016 and Michael Moule on 5 February 2018  The directors have backgrounds in investment trusts  fund management and the legal profession ",2019-04-04,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/atlantis-japan-growth-fund-plenty-of-attractive-investment-opportunities-200403767,200403767

However  the minutes do not hint at rate cuts  The  that  some participants indicated that if the economy evolved as they currently expected  with economic growth above its longer run trend rate  they would likely judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year  
But even in this situation  rates rate is likely to remain subdued in the near term  Investors should note that  in March  federal funds rate projections for 2019 were trimmed to 2 4  from 2 9  while the same for 2020 and 2021 was cut to 2 6  from 3 1   For the longer term  the rate is projected at 2 8   unchanged from the December forecast 
The accommodative Fed should do good for stocks as there will be a few more months of cheap money inflows  Among stocks  income producing securities might do even better for investors in search of solid and steady current income  The past decade was especially favorable for dividend ETFs as central banks including the Fed has been ultra dovish  read

124969,346484,NTRS,Loan   Fee Income Growth To Aid Citizens   CFG  Q1 Earnings,opinion,"Citizens Financial Group   NYSE CFG   is slated to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 18  before market open  Its revenues and earnings are expected to rise year over year 
Before we look at the factors that might influence first quarter earnings  let s take a look at how the company performed in the past quarters 
In fourth quarter 2018  this Providence  RI based bank displayed organic growth  Rise in revenues and loan growth were the key highlights  Also  the company recorded higher deposits and lower expenses and provisions 
Notably  Citizens boasts an impressive surprise history  It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 3 1  
Citizens Financial Group  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at Play
Net Interest Income  NII  to Exhibit Growth  The first quarter witnessed growth in commercial and industrial  and consumer lending scenarios  thus some support to NII is expected  Further  rise in earning assets is likely to boost interest income  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of  145 1 billion for the to be reported quarter indicates a 4 6  rise year over year 
In addition  margins are likely to expand due to higher interest rates  further boosting NII  However  flattening of the yield curve during the quarter is likely to offset the benefit to some extent 
The consensus estimate of  1 16 billion for NII reflects 6  year over year growth 
Moreover  management expects 1  sequential average loan growth for the quarter  Further  margin is expected to remain stable 
Capital Market Fees to Rise  TheFed s dovish stance on future rate hikes must have led to a slight increase in debt issuances during the quarter  thus supporting debt underwriting fees 
Also  while M A deal value and volume witnessed a fall due to higher borrowing costs and several geopolitical concerns during the first quarter  Citizens  might have bagged higher advisory fees due to its solid business profile  Further  the strong M A deal pipeline from the previous quarters might have offered some support  The consensus estimate for capital market fees of  49 20 million indicates a 26 2  rise 
Fee Income to Register Growth  Per the Fed s   deposits improved in the first quarter and is likely to have aided Citizens in bagging higher service charges and fees  The consensus estimate of  128 million for the same indicates 3 2  year over year jump 
Further  the trend of consumer spending was decent during the quarter  which is likely to provide some support to the company s top line  The consensus estimate for card fees of  65 million indicates a 6 6  increase 
Due to higher interest rates  mortgage refinancing activities and fresh originations might have remained muted in the first quarter as well  However  driven by the impact of the Franklin American Mortgage acquisition  Citizens is expected to report higher mortgage banking fees  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for same is  51 million  up significantly year over year 
Furthermore  with strong equity markets  trust and investment services fees are expected to rise 6 3  year over year to  42 5 million 
Given expectations of rise in most components  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non interest revenues is  421 million  up 13 5  
Expenses to Trend Higher  Despite its TOP V efficiency initiatives Citizens  expenses are expected to increase in the first quarter due to investments in enhanced data analytics and technology to improve customer experience  Also  seasonal rise in compensations will keep costs elevated 
Earnings Whispers
According to our quantitative model  we cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for Citizens in the upcoming results  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better for this to happen  which is not the case here as elaborated below 
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Earnings ESP  Earnings ESP for Citizens is 0 00  
Zacks Rank  The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3 
Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to be reported quarter is 89 cents  which reflects year over year improvement of 14 1   Also  the consensus estimate for sales of  1 58 billion indicates 8 3  growth 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around 
Northern Trust Corporation   NASDAQ NTRS   is scheduled to release results on Apr 23  It has an Earnings ESP of  0 57  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  
Fifth Third Bancorp   NASDAQ FITB   is scheduled to release results on Apr 23  The company  which carries a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy   has an Earnings ESP of  0 34

124970,346485,NTRS,Northern Trust  NTRS  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Northern Trust  NTRS  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This wealth management firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 46 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 46 billion  down 1 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 69  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northern Trust 
For Northern Trust  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 57  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Northern Trust will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Northern Trust would post earnings of  1 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 82  delivering a surprise of  11 66  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Northern Trust appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northern-trust-ntrs-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q1-release-200407236,200407236

124978,346493,NTRS,Jobs Report Set to Seal September Fed Hike But Not Future Path,news," Bloomberg     An August rebound in U S  payrolls would all but cement a Federal Reserve interest rate increase this month  Yet investors will probably retain doubts about another hike this year  barring a surprise acceleration in wages 
Employers added 198 000 workers last month after 157 000 in July  helping to trim the jobless rate to 3 8 percent to match the lowest level since 1969  according to a Bloomberg survey ahead of Labor Department data due Friday  Average hourly earnings likely rose 2 7 percent from a year earlier for a third straight month  only slightly above the 2 5 percent average in 2017 
While low unemployment and a solid economy mean a September interest rate hike is a near lock  lackluster pay is among reasons why investors aren t fully convinced the Fed will deliver on its outlook for a fourth 2018 hike in December  There s also an escalating trade war  turmoil in emerging markets and the risk that Fed rate increases will push short term Treasury yields above long term rates    the so called yield curve inversion that preceded previous recessions 
 The labor market is in a good place   and a solid advance in jobs would be  Goldilocks enough  to help seal a September interest rate hike  said Michael Gapen  chief U S  economist at  Barclays   LON BARC  Plc in New York and a former Fed economist  At the same time  given where investors stand on a December move   markets would react very strongly to any indication that wage growth is picking up  and mark up odds of another rate rise before year end  he said 
Markets are fully priced for a hike when policy makers gather Sept  25 26  yet give just about a 70 percent probability of another move in December  Futures traders are currently wagering for less than two hikes in 2019  The Fed s quarterly projections  seen as dots on a plot  indicate four total total increases this year and three in 2019 
For now  the U S  economy and job market  juiced by President Donald Trump s tax cut stimulus  look resilient to the risks from his administration s trade war  Weekly filings for unemployment benefits are near the fewest in almost five decades  while the Institute for Supply Management s August manufacturing survey showed its index of employment climbed to a six month high 
Economists project that factories added 24 000 workers in August  according to the median estimate  which would mark the 11th straight month of at least 20 000 
August payrolls may benefit from a fading of some transitory factors  Store closings at Toys  R  Us Inc  imposed a drag in July  one reason why the category representing sporting goods  hobby  book and music stores lost 31 800 jobs  the biggest decline in data back to 1990  Economists also expect a rebound in local government education payrolls  which tend to be volatile in the summer and fell in July 
Despite robust demand for workers  pay gains have remained disappointing by many measures throughout the economic expansion that began in mid 2009  They ve also become a contentious issue for Republicans and Democrats heading into midterm congressional elections in November 
Figures released Aug  10 showed price adjusted wages were unchanged in July from the previous month and fell 0 2 percent from a year earlier  The White House issued a report Wednesday arguing that compensation looks better when accounting for factors such as employment benefits  retiring baby boomers and this year s tax cuts 
Even so  companies  concern over tariffs will keep a lid on wages  according to Peter Yi  head of short term fixed income at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Asset Management  which oversees  946 billion in assets  That  along with Fed concern over inverting the yield curve  has him projecting the central bank will stand pat in December and hike just once in 2019 
 The Fed s tightening cycle is going to be much shallower  than the central bank is indicating  Yi said   Companies are going to continue to focus on using temporary workers and keeping wages just at modest increases until they get better clarity on the economic environment and what these tariffs look like  
While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has indicated tightening plans remain unaffected by the yield curve    and its usefulness as a recession predictor is being debated    Yi said the central bank  is really afraid of inverting  the curve 
The gap between two  and 10 year yields is near the smallest since 2007  the year the curve was last inverted  just before the worst economic slump since the Great Depression 
For this week  though  wages remain key in the employment report 
Average hourly earnings could come in higher than expected  given the building tightness around the labor market and anecdotal evidence from business leaders  on plans to boost pay  Sam Bullard  senior economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Securities LLC in Charlotte  North Carolina  wrote in a note

125001,346516,NTRS,Northern Trust  NTRS  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This wealth management firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 50 billion  up 5 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 18  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northern Trust 
For Northern Trust  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 20  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Northern Trust would post earnings of  1 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 58  delivering a surprise of  1 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Northern Trust doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/northern-trust-ntrs-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376214,200376214

Our Viewpoint
New York Community Bancorp failed to put up an impressive performance in the fourth quarter  However  persistent decline in revenues is a major concern  Furthermore  rising interest rates continue to hamper the top line owing to the company s liability sensitive balance sheet 
Nevertheless  lower expenses reflect prudent expense management  At the same time  a strengthening capital position is anticipated to favor the company s near term prospects  In addition  we believe its efforts to originate loans for investment will augur well for earnings in the subsequent quarters

125006,346521,NTRS,New Cryptocurrency Custodial Services Could Attract Institutional Investors,opinion,"Despite the enduring crypto bear market  some new tech launches in the space are thriving  Of note  banks and exchanges have been keenly focused on improving custodial services for digital currency investors  Many believe that if there are more trustworthy and secure options for the safekeeping of digital assets  both institutional and retail investors would more willingly diversify into this newest  and some think riskiest of asset classes 
Recent reports indicate that Fidelity  one of the biggest investment management companies globally  is preparing to launch a limited release of their own custodial service for Bitcoin and Ethereum in March  Coincentral com writes 

 There were reports that the firm was looking to offer custodial services to institutional investors who are believed to be the required catalyst behind future upward price corrections  

The website says that Fidelity is reportedly going to offer cold storage facilities  meaning customer crypto assets would be stored offline  reducing hacking threats since the holdings wouldn t be on the internet  Though this method is considered safer  it can also be less fluid  Perhaps Fidelity s solution will provide some innovation on that front 
Fidelity s push to find ways to enable new  more lucrative investors is hardly unique  A number of high profile asset management firms are also entering the fray 
In January  Swiss investment bank Vontobel launched its Digital Asset Vault  According to the bank  its solution incorporates its own banking infrastructure  to  allow Swiss banks and asset managers to utilize the banking framework and support for their customers  digital asset purchasing and storage desires  
Germany s second largest stock exchange B erse Stuttgart offers a custodial service called Blocknox  that s available for its users  digital funds  As well  in late October  San Francisco based Coinbase received a license under New York State s banking law to operate as an independent custodian  The off line service it offers is being marketed as  institutional grade  
Effective Safeguarding Services Still Lacking 
Given the increasing number of crytpocurrency related hacks and attendant losses  it s obvious why this segment of the digital arena would be a growth industry  The recent headlines about Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX is the freshest example to highlight the problem of who should hold digital assets  and how 
The exchange s 30 year old CEO died unexpectedly while on a trip to India  He alone knew the password to the exchange s cold storage  As a result  almost  190 million in client holdings  including fiat and cryptocurrencies  remains inaccessible  
The safeguarding of crypto assets has been overlooked up till now  says Jae Choi  CEO of Pledgecamp  In fact  it s been severely lacking and he says  quite frankly non existent 

 In  the  current landscape two hacker groups have been responsible for stealing roughly  1 billion in cryptocurrency from exchanges  Surely that s enough to recommend the secondary option of  securing  your crypto assets under cold storage  which lacks significant convenience overall  but in order for the public to recognize cryptocurrency  the industry itself needs to provide all the market infrastructure that traditional equity currency provides  One of the key missing pieces has been a custodian service  

Choi expands on his point  the lack of custody services has kept larger institutional players away from cryptocurrency investing  including hedge funds and family wealth management services   If you want cryptocurrency to be treated as a traditional asset  you need to offer regulation and custody options that resemble those available for traditional financial instruments or models   he says 
Varying Views of Custodial Requirements 
Hugo May  an investment analyst at Invictus Capital points out that cypherpunks  the term for die hard crypto fans  are all for the anonymity  privacy  and personal freedom which is at the heart of the movement and their technology 

 Custody is a contentious subject within that overall community  The cypherpunk movement has strongly rooted itself in the principle that cryptographically secured digital assets are to be kept in self custody  The famous saying is  not your keys  not your coins   but if we are to grow the market by opening the doors to institutional investors  certain criteria have to be met 
Institutional tier capital is extremely limited in terms of flexibility  Several requirements have to be satisfied by the asset class before capital could enter the space and also comply with the regulation  

In the U S   regulation requires advisers to keep client funds with a qualified custodian  The European Securities and Markets Authority  ESMA  recently raised the issue that right now there is no harmonized definition of safekeeping and record keeping for securities ownership  This makes it difficult to apply custodial requirements to cryptocurrency 
Commenting on U S  and EU regulation  May says 

 One of the most important regulatory requirements is sufficient custody solutions The topic has been a very prominent talking point by the SEC in regards to Bitcoin ETF applications 
It has become apparent that regulators are not willing to compromise on U S  statutes that ensure institutions store client s assets with a qualified custodian  The EU on the other hand has slowly started to revise directives that govern crypto assets  and this includes custodian requirements  

Traditional players beyond Fidelity  such as Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK   JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM   and Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  are all exploring ways to enter the crypto arena  says Frank Wagner  CEO of crypto fund manager INVAO  This of course bodes well for the future of the asset class 

 Custody solutions are important to the growth of the crypto eco system  especially considering crypto s reputation as a risky investment  

It looks like cryptocurrencies have the potential to be  tamed  as additional ways of handling digital coins take hold  That could indeed lead to a transformation with digital currencies becoming a mainstream asset class ",2019-02-08,Tanzeel Akhtar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crypto-custody-services-increasing-200384169,200384169

125044,346559,NTRS,Quality ETFs   Stocks To Outperform Amid Volatility ,opinion,"The U S  stock market has been exhibiting heightened volatility ahead of Christmas  Notably  the S P 500 witnessed its best start to December in eight years followed by the best week since 2011 while posting its worst one day performance in nearly a month by falling more than 3  on Dec 4 The sell off was triggered by the flattening yield curve  a phenomenon in which longer dated debt yields fall faster than their shorter dated counterparts  that has sparked fears of recession  Notably  the spread between the 10 year yield over its two year counterpart shrank to the smallest since the start of the financial crisis in January 2008  signaling a slowdown in the world s largest economy Although the trade truce between the United States and China at the Group of 20 meeting in Argentina renewed the appetite for riskier assets at the first day of trading in December  conflicting comments from President Trump and some senior officials led to uncertainty over trade talks  However  the Fed s dovish view  an accelerating economy and hopes for fresh cuts in oil supply when OPEC meets in Vienna on Dec 6  bode well for the stock market  read    
Powell recently said that interest rates were  just below  the level that would be neutral for the economy   meaning they will neither speed up nor slow down economic growth  This is in contrast to October remarks   the rate was  a long way  from neutral   which led to worries that the rate increases will crimp growth  Additionally  the subsequent minutes from the central bank s latest meeting suggest that the Fed will likely raise rates this month but may stall rate hikes next year Further  the U S  economy has been on a solid growth track with robust job creation  strong GDP growth  a 50 year low unemployment rate  solid wage gains  and rising consumer and business confidence  Given the bullish fundamentals amid bouts of uncertainty  investors should focus on high quality investing Why Quality Investing Quality stocks are rich in value characteristics with healthy balance sheet  high return on capital  low volatility  elevated margins  and a track record of stable or rising sales and earnings growth  These products thus reduce volatility when compared to plain vanilla funds and hold up rather well during market swings  Further  academic research shows that high quality companies consistently deliver superior risk adjusted returns than the broader market over the long term Given this  we have highlighted five ETFs   stocks targeting this niche strategy  These could

125078,346593,NTRS,Furyk won t commit to Tiger making Ryder Cup team     yet,news,"Jim Furyk tried to keep the focus Monday on the eight automatic qualifiers for the United States Ryder Cup team following the PGA Championship  but even the captain acknowledged that Tiger Woods  is a story   Brooks Koepka vaulted into first place in the standings with his third major title  and will be joined by Dustin Johnson  Justin Thomas  Patrick Reed  Bubba Watson  Jordan Spieth  Rickie Fowler and Webb Simpson at next month s event at Le Golf National in Paris  What remains is for Furyk to determine his four captain s picks  He will announce the first three on Sept  3 after the Dell Technologies Championship  and will fill the last spot on the team on Sept  9 following the BMW Championship   I m excited  and I know these eight players are excited as well   Furyk said at Monday s press conference officially announcing the top eight spots   I ve been waiting 18 months to get a touch  to get a feel  for who our eight qualifiers would be  who the eight players would be  That 18 months has flown by in some respects  and it feels like it has taken forever in others   I wanted guys who really enjoy that atmosphere  and these eight guys  when I look at them  they re guys that enjoy that challenge  This eight is exciting for any captain  and I love having this group  They bring a lot to the table   As much as Furyk wanted to focus on the top eight  the attention quickly turned to the final four spots  Bryson DeChambeau sits in ninth  followed by Phil Mickelson  who missed the cut at the PGA  and Woods  who climbed nine spots to No  11 with his second place finish in St  Louis  Prevailing wisdom says Woods has done enough to make the team  although Furyk would not commit to that decision Monday   That s a good question   Furyk said   He s playing very well  I think there are a lot of folks out there who probably think that he can help us  Really what we wanted to talk about today was the top eight players  I realize Tiger is a story  I realize that he s playing very well and I m excited to see that   Woods  who will be at Le Golf National as a vice captain  has a 13 17 3 record in seven previous Ryder Cup appearances as a player  and is 4 1 2 in singles   I m not sure that numbers are always that important when I look down the list   Furyk said when asked if Woods  chances of making the team are far greater at No  11 in the rankings rather than the 20th he was last week   What is important is how well Tiger has played  Sixth place at the Open Championship  second at the PGA    his game  I think the word he used was  trending   His game is trending  so it s great to see him playing well   Furyk said there is no defined number of players vying for the captain s picks and that the door is open for players currently not on the radar to put themselves in position during the FedExCup Playoffs  which begin with next week s The  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  in Paramus  N J   The reason we put this system in place was to identify hot players  identify the players who are playing well right now   Furyk said   If a guy gets hot and starts playing well  he ll definitely catch the team s eye  he ll definitely catch the vice captain s eye and mine  I would say the door is open in a lot of respects  but we re still looking at this year and a body of work as well   Furyk said he was going to give the top eight a few days to  decompress  following the final maje not only who is playing well  but who is a good fit for the team and in pairings for group play  Furyk has toured Le Golf National significantly over the past year  and believes it s a course that suits a certain style of player   although he declined to specify what type of player that is  He also straddled the fence when asked whether he will be looking for more veteran presences like Woods  Mickelson and Matt Kuchar  who is currently 13th in the standings  or more youth to cultivate with Thomas being the only Ryder Cup rookie currently on the squad  Not far behind DeChambeau  who missed the cut at the PGA  is reigning Rookie of the Year Xander Schauffele  12th  and Tony Finau  15th   Both played the first two rounds of the PGA with Furyk  and rallied to make the cut after poor starts   We are investing in the future and we are looking ahead  But we re trying to identify the four players that fit with these eight   Furyk said   So when I look at my captain s picks  I ll be looking at guys that have had a great body of work this year  guys that are playing well and maybe hot players at the time   I m looking at pairings  who fits in well with these eight players  I m also looking at the golf course  Le Golf National is a great golf course in my opinion  but it suits a certain style of player  It s my job  I think  to round this team out the best possible way   The eight European automatic Ryder Cup qualifiers won t be known until Sept  2  England s Ian Poulter jumped from 12th place to eighth place in the standings Sunday after tying for 31st in the PGA  England s Paul Casey  who missed the cut in the PGA  dropped to ninth place on the Euro

125105,346620,NTRS,U S  Rates Up  Weak Currencies Blow Up  Global Week Ahead,opinion,"For the Global Week Ahead  let s look into Reuter s in London s five big themes  These are the ones likely dominate the thinking of investors and traders I have left them in rank order below 
 1  Fresh U S  Inflation Readings Come Out
The Federal Reserve has acknowledged U S  inflation has perked up  adding to the conviction that interest rates will rise faster this year than previously anticipated  Price data due next week might cement investors  view 
While leaving the benchmark Fed funds rate unchanged at its last meeting  the central bank included somewhat more hawkish language in its statement  noting   On a 12 month basis  both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent  
Data out last Friday showed the U S  economy added  164K jobs  fewer than forecast  while wages barely rose  However  the Fed s preferred inflation measure  the so called core PCE  rose  1 9  in the 12 months through March  the biggest increase since February 2017 
Producer price  PPI  and consumer price indexes  CPI  are due next Wednesday and Thursday  respectively  Investors fear that stock and bond markets won t get much reprieve from the rate hike concerns of recent weeks 
The Fed is currently signaling two more rate rises this year  But the inflation figures  if strong enough  could confirm expectations that it will add a third 
 2  The Bank of England  BoE  Meets
The big central banking event of next week is the Bank of England s May 10 meeting  with market expectations now overwhelmingly in favor of interest rates being held at the current 0 5 percent rate 
Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early April when investors priced a 90 percent chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points 
But a spate of weak economic data is almost certain to stay the BoE s hand  Banks have slashed rate rise forecasts  with some not expecting one at all in 2018  That has taken sterling more than six percent lower in two weeks  tipping it into the red for 2018 
Investors will monitor Governor Mark Carney s language for signals on what the appetite is for hikes further out in 2018  More dovish remarks from the BoE could send sterling even lower 
 3  The Argentine Peso Blow Up Continues
Almost exactly five years after the taper tantrum selloff in emerging markets  a resurgent dollar and rising global borrowing costs are smashing through Argentina and Turkey s currencies like a wrecking ball 
With the peso and the lira hitting record lows  Argentina has had to jack up interest rates to 40 percent in the third emergency hike in a week  Turkey too raised rates recently by 75 basis points after keeping it overly loose for years 
While most emerging markets are suffering to some degree  Turkey and Argentina stand out for their rampant inflation and a dependence on foreign funding   both have large current account deficits and double digit price growth  25 percent in Argentina s case 
Higher interest rates should help  But with the U S  dollar showing little sign of wilting and U S  yields staying close to four year highs  the pain could last a while longer 
 4  Watch the Euro and European Stocks
The U S  dollar s sudden surge has come as an unexpected spring gift for the Eurozone stock market after first quarter results took a hit from the single currency s strength 
The euro s recent fall to four month lows helped euro stocks outperform Wall Street for the second month running in April  May is off to a good start and a three month streak of outperformance  if it materializes  would be the longest since Jan March 2015 when the euro hit 12 year lows to the dollar 
Earnings growth for Eurozone firms in the STOXX 600 index is seen accelerating to 4 5 percent in the second quarter from the 1 4 percent expected for the first  In the last two 2018 quarters  they are seen rising 18 7 percent and 13 7 percent respectively  according to Thomson Reuters data 
True  there are other variables too  in particular the speed at which the European Central Bank will phase out stimulus  But a hawkish turn there looks a distant prospect and in the meantime  euro equity investors should enjoy the ride 
 5  Could We See Asia s Small Currencies Get Spooked 
For all the talk of Asia s resilience to shocks  foreigners took fright at the first signs of a rise in U S  yields and oil prices  Indonesia  India  Thailand  South Korea and Malaysia have all seen outflows from bond and equity markets 
That s forcing central banks to intervene to limit currency depreciation  while simultaneously taking steps to keep domestic markets as liquid as possible  They are reluctant to raise rates  But that means delving into the hard currency reserves they have rebuilt since past bouts of volatility   and Indonesia has already spent  6 billion of these reserves over February and March to stem the rupiah s slide 
Both the Philippines and Indonesia release FX reserves data next week  We will also get a tally of foreign flows into their bond markets during April  Those data points should show how much further these economies can rely on intervention alone to defend their markets as the dollar keeps rising 
Top Zacks  1 Rank  STRONG BUY  Stocks Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    This  87B market cap Chinese stock has a an F long term score from Zacks  but the  1 Rank means it has earnings estimate fuel in the tank Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS    This is a U S  Chicago based  23B market cap bank  It gets an F as a long term score from Zacks  But again  the earnings estimates are rising  giving its  1 rank Koninklijke DSM NV   OTC RDSMY    This is an  18B Dutch diversified chemical firm  But they do some oil exploration and development in the North Sea too  It has an A rating from Zacks  and a  1 Zacks Rank short term score  That sounds much better  for a long term investment

125106,346621,NTRS,Is First Trust STOXX European Select Dividend Index Fund  FDD  A Hot ETF Right Now ,opinion,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the European Equity ETFs category of the U S  equity market  the First Trust STOXX European Select Dividend Index Fund  FDD  is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 08 27 2007 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market 
Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes  as they replicate market returns in a low cost  convenient  and transparent way 
But  there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds  these funds track non cap weighted strategies  and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market 
This kind of index follows this same mindset  as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk return performance  non cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics  or a mix of such characteristics 
Methodologies like equal weighting  one of the simplest options out there  fundamental weighting  and volatility momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space  but not all of them can deliver superior returns 
Fund Sponsor   Index
Because the fund has amassed over  573 47 M  this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the European Equity ETFs  FDD is managed by First Trust Advisors  FDD  before fees and expenses  seeks to match the performance of the STOXX Europe Select Dividend 30 Index 
The STOXX Europe Select Dividend 30 Index consists of 30 high dividend yielding securities selected from the STOXX Europe 600 Index 
Cost   Other Expenses
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF s expense ratio  Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost  assuming all other metrics remain the same 
Annual operating expenses for FDD are 0 60   which makes it the most expensive product in the space 
The fund has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 2 87  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF s holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
When you look at individual holdings  Sse Plc  SSE  LON SSE  LN  accounts for about 6 47  of the fund s total assets  followed by Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc  class B   RDSB LN  and Glaxosmithkline Plc  LON GSK LN  
FDD s top 10 holdings account for about 45 22  of its total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 4 43  so far this year and it s up approximately 12 24  in the last one year  as of 05 10 2018   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  12 94 and  14 77 
The ETF has a beta of 0 86 and standard deviation of 15 61  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium choice in the space  With about 31 holdings  it has more concentrated exposure than peers 
Alternatives
First Trust STOXX European Select Dividend Index Fund is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the European Equity ETFs segment of the market  However  there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider 
FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund  IQDE  tracks Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  International Quality Dividend Defensive Index and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Index Fund  IQDF  tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index  FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund has  101 35 M in assets  FlexShares International Quality Dividend Index Fund has  1 08 B  IQDE has an expense ratio of 0 47  and IQDF charges 0 47  
Investors looking for cheaper and lower risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the European Equity ETFs

125133,346648,NTRS,Congress Moves To Repeal Dodd Frank  Custodian Banks To Gain,opinion,"Of the two major pre election promises made by President Donald Trump  his supporters are on a roll to ease some provisions of an important financial regulation   the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010  This follows the achievement of a major milestone in late 2017 in the form of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act 
The Senate passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 67 to 32  promising it to be beneficial for smaller banks  It would now be presented to the House for its requisite approval 
Recapitulation of the Dodd Frank Act
As a response to the 2008 financial crisis  caused partly by improper lending activities and investments by big banks  strict regulations were imposed on them through this law  Banks with assets of more than  50 billion were placed under stricter regulatory scrutiny  which included an annual stress test to prove that they could survive another financial meltdown 
Further  a new regulatory board  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  was established in order to safeguard consumers against predatory practices by companies offering mortgages  credit cards  student loans and payday loans 
Such heightened regulations have kept compliance costs elevated for the banks so far  Also  higher capital requirements might have dampened investment to some extent  Moreover  some large institutions moved operations overseas to less regulated jurisdictions in order to avoid high regulatory costs 
How Custody Banks Stand to Benefit From the Proposed Bill 
The Dodd Frank Act contained a provision that required banks to calculate supplementary leverage ratio  considering cash or customer deposits held with the Federal Reserve at the same level of risk as assets like subprime mortgages or junk bonds  It was aimed at keeping banks from taking big risks without proper plans to handle any downturn 
However  this rule had a major adverse impact on the custody banks like State Street Corporation   NYSE STT    Northern Trust Corporation   NASDAQ NTRS   and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation   NYSE BK    Custody banks safeguard assets and securities of large asset managers  hedge funds and other banks rather than conducting traditional banking activities  Despite sending these deposits to the Fed for safekeeping  these financial institutions had to factor them in while calculating the amount capital it requires to hold 
The bill proposed by Senate makes an exception to this rule  It allows the custodian banks to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately sent to the Fed or some other central bank for safety  Thus  it would lead to a comparable reduction in the amount of capital they would require to hold 
On the other hand  major banks such as JPMorgan Chase   Co   NYSE JPM   and Citigroup   NYSE C   that perform custodial functions as part of their business have put forth objections  They want the exception to include all those banks that accept custodial deposits  However  this demand has some lawmakers worrying that these tweaks might be used by banks for their own purposes 
Other Key Points in the Bank Deregulation Bill
The most controversial change is uplifting of the SIFI threshold from  50 billion to  250 billion  This would result in a reduction in the number of banks considered  too big to fail  that are closely looked after by the Fed  to 12 from 38  Further  it frees banks with less than  10 billion in total assets from the Volcker rule  This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money 
While some Democrats regard the bill to be compatible with the tax act  some consider it to be  extraordinarily dangerous   Further  the bill along with the changes made so far have to be approved by the House and Senate once again  before being presented to the President 
Conclusion
With this exemption  the custody banks will be able to utilize the excess capital toward expanding their businesses and diversify the product offerings  Also  shareholders of these banks might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends 
Of the above mentioned companies  Citigroup and Northern Trust hold a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  while JPMorgan  Bank of New York Mellon and State Street carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

Also  improved lending scenario  rising interest rates and bottom line benefits from tax reform will provide further support to quarter s results  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 45 billion for sales for the to be reported quarter reflects a year over year improvement of 13  
Moreover  Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees  i e  the computations are based on the prior quarter end valuations  Since the performance of equity markets was relatively better in the first quarter  the company will likely be able to register growth in custody  servicing and management fees 
Here are the other factors that might influence the company s first quarter performance 
Modest Rise in Net Interest Income  NII   Overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter  Backed by improvement in loan balances  along with the effect of rising interest rates  Northern Trust is likely to record an increase in NII 
Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Increase  Due to the rise in foreign exchange  FX  trading volatility and volumes  the company s revenues from FX trading might increase 
Custody Fees Might Rise  As Northern Trust uses lag effect in calculation of custody and investment management fees  expansion of three month LIBOR rate along with higher trading activities are likely to drive related fees 
Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  custody fees are likely to increase 23 1  to  379 million 
Marginal Increase in Expenses  Though Northern Trust has a cost saving initiatives underway  continued investments in new business activities and seasonally higher compensation expenses may lead to a marginal rise in expenses

125144,346659,NTRS, Beyond Coins  Financial Enterprises put Blockchain through its Paces ,news,"Cryptocurrency evangelists make it sound as if blockchain will overturn the entire financial industry  The central banking system will be rendered obsolete  along with our traditional systems of voting  online purchases  and even identity verification  On the other hand  there is the push back against the hype that Bitcoin s meteoric price rise has caused  Some observers have held that it s not just the press around coins that s a problem  the underlying technology  blockchain  is problematic as well  and that distributed ledger technology is useless at best 
Between the evangelists and the old guard  who is right  Maybe neither  but there is money being poured into blockchain projects by some world leading companies  These are early days for blockchain technology  and separating the back page core technology from the various headline grabbing coins is a difficult task  We can help 
Consider these facts 
Many of the projects are still in the pilot phase  e g   Nasdaq  Visa  Mastercard  Depository Trust   Clearing Corp  DTCC   
Most use cases are in the business to business arena  where processes can benefit from standardization among the various participants  These projects are often private blockchains  however  which raises the question about what fundamentally defines blockchain technology 
Applications currently focus on three main areas  clearing and settlement  cross border payments and proxy voting 
Let s take a look at those areas 
Clearing and settlement 
Bank of New York  BNY  Melon is the only bank thus far to create a distributed ledger technology for clearing transactions  It is called BDS 360 and has been operational since 2016   While BNY Melon has embraced blockchain technology  BDS 360 is not a complete overhaul of its clearing system  Rather  BNY Melon created BDS 360 as a way of backing up its data  with an eye to boosting resiliency  The blockchain takes a snapshot of transactions every ten minutes  providing a record in case of a catastrophic event 
Nasdaq has also been working on applications in this area  One of its early blockchain projects was Nasdaq Linq  which it developed in partnership with the San Francisco based startup Chain as a way of clearing private securities 
Cross border payments 
These types of payments have traditionally been cumbersome and opaque  as funds sometimes pass through a series of middlemen on their way to the ultimate recipient  Visa s and Mastercard s blockchain supported system seek to tackle these issues by recording transactions on a permissioned blockchain and sending them from the bank of origin directly to the recipient bank  The payments  however  are still processed through the Visa and Mastercard network  As in the case on BNY Melon  blockchain technology is not completely replacing the existing systems used by Visa and Mastercard  but rather enhancing them 
Proxy voting 
In February 2016 Nasdaq announced a project that offers a blockchain based e voting service to shareholders of companies listed on Nasdaq s Tallinn Stock Exchange in Estonia   About a year later  Broadridge  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM    Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  and  Banco Santander   MC SAN  announced that they had separately completed a pilot using blockchain to enhance proxy vote transparency 
Proxy voting seems like a process well suited to moving to blockchain  since some companies conducting proxy votes still use paper ballots  and their shareholders might be in diverse locations  Blockchain provides a secure  transparent way of tallying results anonymously  and many of its proponents believe it could vastly improve voting in political elections as well 
Even if it doesn t turn the world upside down or make headline news  Blockchain is unquestionably innovative and has real world applications  The lasting impacts of its disruptions might be greater than the technology itself  Specifically  it has the potential to transform the standardization and modernization of processes across financial institutions and the growing acceptance of distributed systems ",2018-04-24,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/beyond-coins-financial-enterprises-put-blockchain-through-its-paces-1410010,1410010
125146,346661,NTRS, Santander Succeeds in Blockchain Trial to Count Investor Votes ,news,"Multinational bank Santander  MC SAN   blockchain technology for the company s voting process at its annual general meeting held on March 23  The Eurozone s largest bank by market cap collaborated with tech firm Broadridge Financial Solutions to test the technology  Investors and shareholders voted as usual  but the bank created a shadow register to speed up the counting and ensure the accuracy and transparency of the process 
The bank concluded that blockchain was efficient at supporting corporate democracy and simplifying the voting process 
JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  and  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  participated in the experiment as custodian banks  The distributed ledger technology used at the annual general meeting was developed based on JPMorgan s Quorum platform in collaboration with Santander s own blockchain lab  The test covered 21  of institutional votes during the meeting  Santander has over 4 million shareholders with 60 7  of shares being owned by institutional investors 
Investors could see their votes counted and confirmed in real time rather than having to wait for about two weeks  as it usually happens during such events 
Sergio G mez  Santander s global head of shareholders and investor relations stated that the annual meeting in March was one of the most important governance events for a listed company 

 In the case of Santander  having very fragmented capital  it is important to ensure the participation by investors and shareholders  This year using blockchain technology for the institutional vote has been a great help in terms of transparency and agility   he said 

It is not the first instance when the Spanish company leverages blockchain  Last month  the giant  a blockchain powered forex cross border payments system  The platform was developed based on Ripple s xCurrent technology  The One Pay FX system  as the platform is called  can now be used by customers in Spain  Poland  the UK  and Brazil 
Justin Chapman  global head of market advocacy and innovation research at Northern Trust  which also took part in the test  commented

125148,346663,NTRS,Congress eases post crisis bank rules in victory for Trump,news,"By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  House of Representatives passed on Tuesday bipartisan legislation that would ease bank rules introduced in the wake of the 2007 2009 financial crisis  giving President Donald Trump a major legislative victory   The vote eases some of the 2010 Dodd Frank rules that have hurt smaller banks and community lenders and keeps the Republican president s promise to try to spur more economic growth by cutting regulation  but does little for Wall Street   It is a far cry from the repeal that Trump pledged on the campaign trail  leaving largely untouched the core Dodd Frank provisions designed to ensure financial stability and other rules most hated by banks and conservative Republicans   But industry lobbyists say Trump s administration played a key role in getting the bipartisan legislation  which had been under discussion for years  across the finish line  The bill  which was approved by the Senate in March after securing the backing of 17 Democrats  marks the first attempt to revise rules that aimed to prevent a repeat of the crisis that saw Wall Street lenders bailed out to the tune of  700 billion   Republican critics say Dodd Frank went too far and curbs banks  ability to lend  hurting economic growth  while many Democrats say it provides critical protections for consumers and taxpayers  Speaking to reporters on Tuesday evening  White House officials hailed the legislation as another  milestone  in the administration s mission to  revitalize the U S  economy  by lifting barriers to business   They said Trump aims to sign the bill into law at a formal ceremony within the week   The bill  approved 258 159 in the House on Tuesday  raises the threshold at which banks are considered systemically risky and subject to stricter oversight to  250 billion from  50 billion  It also eases trading  lending and capital rules for banks with less than  10 billion in assets  But it does not weaken the top U S  consumer watchdog created by Dodd Frank that has been consistently attacked by Republicans who say it oversteps its mandate   Touching the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a red line for Democrats  according to lobbyists  Nor does the bill weaken Wall Street s obligation to comply with the so called Volcker Rule banning banks from making risky bets with their own money  or limit the ability of regulators to apply stricter rules to large institutions they deem critical to the financial system  Speaking to Reuters on Tuesday  Democratic U S  Senator Heidi Heitkamp  a key backer of the bill  said it aimed to fix problems with Dodd Frank  not to weaken it   That s going to improve Dodd Frank not diminish or begin to erode Dodd Frank   she added  Still  some larger players secured a handful of niche provisions  most notably the nation s largest custody banks  The bill will allow the likes of BNY Mellon  N BK    State Street  Corp  N STT  and  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  to exclude customer deposits they place with central banks from a stringent capital calculation requirement  potentially offering major capital relief  They were able to successfully differentiate themselves from the Wall Street titans like  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS    Morgan Stanley   N MS  and JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM   in order to win over some skeptical lawmakers  said lobbyists  The draft legislation also offers more favorable treatment for municipal bonds  a measure that analysts say is likely to help  Citigroup  Inc s  N C  bond trading business and help lower financing costs on infrastructure projects nationwide  Consumer advocates and Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren have warned big banks will exploit these provisions  potentially increasing systemic risk  But independent regulatory experts said the big banks were better off focusing their efforts on the regulatory agencies where Trump s appointees are better positioned to cut them material slack   This is a legislative win for the banks  but the biggest deregulatory bang for the buck is changing the referees  not the rules   said Dan Ryan  PwC Banking   Capital Markets Leader

Per the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009  credit card issuing companies are required to review the accounts of customers whose interest rates had risen after a missed payment or bounced checks  The companies are to determine whether the customer has resumed making timely payments or has displayed some other creditworthy behavior 
On being satisfied of the customer s financial standing  the rates are supposed to be lowered 
In one such review  Citigroup discovered to have kept overcharging about 1 75 million accounts  The bank said to have found flaws in the methodology it used to calculate the reduced rates in some accounts 
Majority of the affected accounts witnessed smaller rate cuts than they were eligible to  while the rest did not get the reduction at all  The New York based lender will be making average refunds of  190     
Also  the bank disclosed to have found no wrongdoings on part of its employees  Further  it apologized for having delayed in identifying the issue and promised to make amends at the earliest 
Previously in 2015  the financial regulators had made Citigroup pay nearly  700 million to credit card customers who were made to buy unnecessary add on services  Per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau s findings  seven million accounts had been targets of  deceptive  marketing 
The recent disclosure is likely to have a little impact on the Citigroup s reputation  Moreover  the company  with its global footprint and attractive core business  seems to be well poised for growth

After facing inquiries from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require  Wells Fargo agreed to do a detailed investigation of the segment 
In its latest 10K filing  the bank revealed that it is currently assessing whether there has been unjustified referrals or recommendations  including with respect to rollovers for 401 k  plan participants  certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank s investment and fiduciary services business 
So far in the review process  the bank has found that in some cases customers have been overcharged fees in connection with certain assets and accounts  There have been issues of incorrect set up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets 
Wells Fargo is yet to determine the number of accounts that were affected along with the reason that led to the wrongdoing 
Recently  Wells Fargo faced another lawsuit filed by the city of Sacramento  for conducting discriminatory lending practices  It accusedthe bank of targeting African American and Latino communities in Sacramento for issuing loans with more expensive and higher risk compared to loans made to white borrowers  Also  per the complaint  Wells Fargo has been accused of practicing discrimination against minority borrowers for more than a decade with the aim of recording higher earnings 
Currently  the bank has a lot to deal with on the litigation front  Further  growing intolerance of the regulators with regard to the violations Wells Fargo s has made over the past years can act as a key negative for the bank  Also  increasing legal hassles keep putting pressure onthe financials

from the year ago quarter to  1 04 billion  Rise in trust  investment and other servicing fees  along with foreign exchange trading income  other operating income  security commissions and trading income  were the primary reasons for this upswing  These were partially offset by lower treasury management fees and investment security losses Non interest expenses flared up 15  year over year to  1

125191,346706,NTRS,Fed s Fischer resigns  leaving Trump earlier chance to shape central bank,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer  a veteran central banker who helped set the course for modern monetary policy  said on Wednesday he will step down from his position in mid October  potentially accelerating President Donald Trump s opportunity to reshape the direction of the central bank 
In a letter to Trump  Fischer  73  said he was resigning for personal reasons effective on or around Oct  13  eight months before his term as vice chair expires in June 
In the letter  Fischer said jobs growth had returned to the United States and that  steps to make the financial system stronger and more resilient  had been taken   actions that may now be weakened by the Trump administration 
His departure leaves the seven person board of governors with as few as three sitting members  depending on whether and when the Senate confirms Trump nominee Randal Quarles to the role of vice chair for supervision  a job distinct from Fischer s vice chairmanship 
The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination on Thursday 
The White House said it had no immediate comment on Fischer s departure or on the timing for filling his spot or other positions at the Fed 
Though the Fed often operates with fewer than its full complement of seven governors  it has never dipped as low as three  Fischer s earlier than expected departure intensifies the urgency for Trump to decide how deeply he wants to overhaul U S  monetary policy 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen s term expires in February  While Trump has spoken approvingly of her performance he has also kept the door open to naming his top economic adviser Gary Cohn  or someone else  to the job 
The sense of confusion over the Fed s future leadership heightened with the controversy surrounding Trump s response to a white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville last month  as pressure mounted on Cohn  who is Jewish  to respond 
Yellen and Fischer are also Jewish  and Fischer served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 2005 to 2013 before joining the Fed  In the closing days of his presidential campaign  Trump ran out an advertisement featuring Yellen and other prominent Jewish financial figures that was criticized for its anti Semitic overtones 
 This will certainly leave us all scrambling to understand the new calculus of the Board   said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  in Chicago 
In the shorter term  Fischer s departure in October may lower the likelihood of another Fed interest rate increase this year 
As some of his colleagues began wondering about a permanent downshift in global inflation and interest rates  Fischer maintained an underlying faith in the macroeconomic models   which he helped refine   that showed falling unemployment ultimately raising inflation and requiring higher interest rates in response 
 We generally saw him as a centrist on the Committee   said JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  economist Michael Feroli   At the margin his absence may lower slightly the odds of a December hike  
The drop in board membership to three should not impact the Fed s workflow despite what Tannenbaum called the  lack of bench strength  
A SMALLER BOARD
The Fed s supervisory functions can be conducted with as few as two of the seven members  according to the board s rules  The Fed s rate setting policy committee can also continue to meet  though with the five regional bank presidents on the committee in a majority 
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after Fischer s announcement 
Over his career Fischer  a native of Zambia  helped to shape modern economic theory as an academic  trained many of today s top central bankers and put his ideas into practice in a series of jobs  He was chief economist at the World Bank  and first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund during the Asian financial crisis 
He was also a vice chairman at  Citigroup   NYSE C  from 2002 to 2005 before taking over as governor of the Bank of Israel ",2017-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/feds-fischer-announces-resignation-to-leave-midoctober-526044,526044

125196,346711,NTRS,Death and the discount rate  UK companies weigh pensions tweaks,news,"By Simon Jessop and Carolyn Cohn LONDON  Reuters    Some of Britain s biggest companies are considering wiping millions or even billions of pounds from their pension deficits by changing a couple of key assumptions  including when staff are expected to die  Retailer  Tesco   L TSCO  paved the way last month by slicing more than three billion pounds from the pensions deficit in its accounts  citing data showing slower rises in life expectancy as well as predictions of higher interest rates   A lot of other companies will be asking to do something similar   said Martin Hunter  principal at investment consultants Punter Southall  Pension shortfalls are a common problem around the world and in Britain  two thirds of almost 6 000 company defined benefit  or final salary  schemes are in the red  a drag on some share prices as investors worry about how they will be funded  Improving the assumptions underlying its pension scheme gives a company more freedom to raise dividends or expand  but runs the risk of future problems unless caution is applied   Of 22 UK listed companies contacted by Reuters  some with large deficits and some in surplus but with large liabilities  seven said they could use updated numbers for their next six monthly accounting or more conservative triennial pension valuations  Those among the seven with large deficits were BT  L BT   TUI  L TUIT   International Consolidated Airlines Group  L ICAG    Barclays   L BARC  and  Severn Trent   L SVT   Two companies with large pension liabilities  but with schemes currently in surplus   Aviva   L AV  and RBS  L RBS   also said they may use the new longevity statistics  issued in March  and or new assumptions for their discount rate  which fixes the money needed now to pay future pensions  Six companies declined to comment and nine did not reply  FROM DEFICIT TO SURPLUS Industry funded pension lifeboat the Pension Protection Fund  PPF  puts Britain s collective shortfall at 150 billion pounds   199 07 billion   a gap that can force listed companies to raise capital or cut dividends  making them less attractive to investors  India s  Tata Steel   NS TISC  spent more than a year trying to cut its liabilities to push through a merger of its European steel operations with Germany s Thyssenkrupp  DE TKAG   A large deficit has also hurt debt laden UK construction and support services firm  Carillion   L CLLN  Tesco said its pension fund was realigned to more appropriately reflect expected returns and had no link to its plan to take over wholesaler Booker  L BOK   The degree to which other companies can follow Tesco is not straight forward  though  As well as varying staff demographics  the age of the scheme  its assets and existing discount rate could all stymie the accountants  plans  Tweaking the number in the six month review of liabilities in company accounts  closely watched by investors  as Tesco did  is also easier than changing the  triennial valuation   a three yearly deal with scheme trustees agreeing how much a company must add  While Tesco s accounting pension scheme deficit is now 2 4 billion pounds  down from 5 5 billion pounds  its triennial deficit  also published last month  has gone up to 3 billion pounds from 2 75 billion pounds  even though the company said that also took changing mortality trends into account  Companies have been forced to pay more into their schemes due to a decade of falling interest rates since the financial crisis  but Britain s schemes are still only 91 percent funded  the PPF said  Those of the biggest 350 listed firms are in their weakest position since 2009  a PwC report in June said  After the Bank of England raised rates this month  many corporate pensions advisers will be looking to reflect the brighter outlook from rising yields  said Ameet Patel  senior research analyst at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Capital Markets  FTSE 100 schemes had a total deficit of 36 billion pounds at end 2016  according to RBC calculations  though rising stock markets have helped their positions since then  If every FTSE 100 company followed Tesco  using updated mortality statistics and increasing the discount rate by 0 3 percentage points  they would enjoy a total accounting surplus of 54 billion pounds  RBC analyst Gordon Aitken said  ROOM FOR MANEUVER Who is in the scheme is key  While there has been a slowdown since 2011 in improvements in life expectancy for people in England and Wales  longevity assumptions have improved for richer men  something their employers need to bear in mind  the regulator said   Defined benefit schemes have a preponderance of older male members   said Lesley Titcomb  chief executive of The Pensions Regulator   If you have a higher proportion of affluent males in your membership  using a general assumption about longevity would not be right   The regulator and trustees look at the triennial rather than the accounting pensions scheme figure  Trustees may also be cautious about approving a too big  too quick change in assumptions in case the trend reverses   Are you prepared to add the more generous longevity assumptions and be proved wrong in five years   said pensions consultant and independent trustee John Ralfe  pointing out that longevity assumptions have proved wrong in the past  Douglas Anderson  partner  Club Vita  which assesses longevity statistics  agreed   We shouldn t get hung up about the last two years but about how long the trend is going to continue   for the next 30 40 years   Tesco s use of estimated long term corporate bond yields rather than its previous use of longer dated  lower yielding government bonds was the biggest help in cutting its deficit  Not all schemes may have previously taken such a conservative approach  however  potentially leaving them less scope to follow suit  While BT s discount rate is 2 5 percent  other firms with large pension deficits such as  BP   L BP  and Shell  L RDSa  use higher rates  of 2 7 percent and 3 percent respectively  RBC said  And with any changes needing auditor or regulatory approval  companies will need to consider them carefully despite the  nudge  from Tesco  said Joe Dabrowski  head of investment and governance at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association  which represents pension scheme professionals   Although there s some flexibility  it doesn t mean you can just stick anything you want in it and magic your deficit away   Your assumptions will have to be grounded in realistic assumptions    They need to be in the bounds of realism and backed up by some supporting evidence

125199,346714,NTRS,Powell faces early test of policy view as tax cuts near approval,news,"By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON  Reuters    Incoming Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell  chosen by U S  President Donald Trump to keep the recovery humming  appears set to let an expected trillion dollar tax cut run its course through the economy as weak wage growth and inflation buttress his view that the economy remains underpowered  Powell in statements throughout the year  culminating with his recent Senate confirmation hearing  has been clear he sees little risk of inflation that would prompt the Fed to raise rates faster than expected  and takes weak wage growth as a sign that sidelined workers remain to be drawn into jobs  New data added evidence to that view on Friday  Employment in November grew faster than expected  but wage growth remained muted  The share of working age adults with jobs continued a steady  six year recovery that is approaching its pre crisis peak  Even with the unemployment rate at a 17 year low of 4 1 percent   there s no sense of an overheating economy or a particularly tight labor market   Powell told members of the Senate Banking Committee  saying that the Fed should raise rates only gradually   Debate among Powell s colleagues  meanwhile  has highlighted other risks if the Fed speeds its pace of rate increases  Some policymakers feel the central bank has already undercut its credibility by raising interest rates while inflation remains so weak  Others have noted that if the Fed continues raising short term rates while long term rates remain stalled  it could turn the shape of the bond yield curve upside down  a typical signal of recession    If the Fed gets its paradigm wrong and sees inflation that ultimately doesn t materialize  and they take rates too far  then markets would feel aggrieved   said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  in Chicago  and a former senior risk official at the Fed Board  Other analysts are starting to see a potential dovish surprise when Powell takes over in February  the tax cuts could kick in  and the Fed stands aside    MORE DOVISH FED  With a background as an investment banker rather than as an economist rooted in a particular analytical framework  Powell will lead  a more data driven Fed  which at the current juncture means a more dovish Fed   until and if inflation recovers  said Robin Brooks  chief economist at the Institute of International Finance   He expects the Fed under Powell to only raise rates twice next year   Policymakers will give an initial reading on the impact of the Republican tax plan when they meet next week  They are expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year  They will also update their economic and interest rate projections for 2018 and beyond  the first such forecasts since the outlines of the tax overhaul became clear  Top Republicans from the House and the Senate are rushing to complete negotiations to push the tax plan into law   Though Janet Yellen remains Fed chair until February  her final scheduled press conference on Wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop Powell inherits  The 64 year old lawyer will attend the meeting as a sitting governor  and help shape the statement issued that day by the Federal Open Market Committee  It is a group struggling with a fundamental issue  The economy is arguably as much as a half a percentage point below full employment  a condition in which prices and wages should be rising  Yet both remain weak  Into that mix  the tax cut legislation would put tens of billions of dollars back in the hands of corporations and households   If there is still  slack  in the economy  that could produce faster real growth as spending and investment increase  and more workers are hired  However  if the economy is near or above its potential  as some measures indicate  it may merely cause faster than desired price increases  or a jump in stock and other asset values that raise concerns of a bubble   As the tax plan advanced in Congress  forecasting shops at Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   JP Morgan and others penciled in a faster pace of Fed rate increases   essentially expecting the Fed would need to lean against the inflationary outcome  The tax package is  ultimately worth almost two additional Fed hikes  in coming years  Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Alec Phillips wrote in a recent analysis  But the new chair s own public speeches and comments throughout the past year have shown an evolving faith that the Fed s go slow approach can continue  giving more time for workers to rebound from the 2007 2009 crisis without creating other economic risks   Accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth  rather  it helped restore full employment   Powell said in June in his last extensive speech on monetary policy before he emerged as a contender for the top Fed job   His outlook is consistent with positions Trump and current chair Janet Yellen have taken  and the depth of his commitment to that view will be a critical part of the Fed s debate about whether and how to react to the tax plan  At his confirmation hearing  Powell avoided any direct critique or endorsement of the pending legislation  telling lawmakers fiscal policy was their domain  But when asked about Fed staff research that challenged a key Republican premise that corporate tax cuts generate jobs  Powell kept his distance  
 It s just someone s research   Powell told senators   Don t associate that with a position of the board  ",2017-12-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/powell-faces-early-test-of-policy-view-as-tax-cuts-near-approval-975451,975451

125208,346723,NTRS,5 Quality Dividend ETFs Crushing The Market On Tax Reform,opinion,While a rise in interest rates would diminish the attractiveness of dividend stocks  investors are chasing these on optimism surrounding the biggest tax overhaul in decades  In particular  stocks that have a long track of profitability  history of raising dividend year over year along with prospects of further increases  good liquidity  and some value characteristics will likely outperform This is especially true  as lower corporate taxes would boost companies  profitability leading to fatter and faster dividend hikes  Additionally  the proposed tax policy will allow companies to bring back their overseas cash at reduced rates that will in turn pave the way for special dividends  read      Apart from the excitement surrounding tax cut  quality enriched stocks generally outshine in a rising rate environment  Additionally  quality dividend stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with other high yield dividend paying stocks  which are currently being ruffled by rising rates Further  these stocks have a strong potential for growth with better risk adjusted returns over the long term  This is because quality dividend stocks offer safety and stability in a choppy stock market as they ensure regular income to investors in the form of dividends  At the same time  they also have the potential for capital appreciation when the market is on an upswing  Investors should note that these are mature companies that are less vulnerable to the large swings in stock prices  and therefore well protected than others in a tumbling market As a result  we have highlighted five ETFs that offer better dividend growth opportunities compared with the other products in the space but might not necessarily have the highest yields  These funds hit their all time highs in the last trading session and have the potential to move even higher given that the enactment of tax reform in 2018 is most likely  read    WisdomTree U S  Quality Dividend Growth Fund This fund tracks the WisdomTree U S  Quality Dividend Growth Index and offers diversified exposure to U S  dividend paying stocks with both

low cost choices in the dividend space  charging 7 bps in fees per year  The ETF touched an all time high of  51 33 per share  and has returned about 20 1  so far this year  read    First Trust NASDAQ Rising Dividend Achievers ETF This fund provides exposure to 50 U S  stocks with a history of rising dividend and that are expected to continue doing so in the future  In addition  it also screens for

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Philip Morris International  PM   Amgen  AMGN  and Union Pacific  UNP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Shares of Philip Morris have outperformed the Zacks categorized Tobacco industry on a year to date basis   27 6  vs   9 3    primarily due to its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and pricing power  It is encouraging that the company is churning its portfolio and taking steps to develop smoke free products as customers are shifting away from tobacco products  In fact  Philip Morris remains focused on the growing e cigarettes and less harmful alternative products such as heatsticks and iQOS products 
Furthermore  the marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group  NYSE MO  is also boosting the businesses of both the companies and will help them maintain the market share  However  strict government regulations  declining demand for cigarettes and currency headwinds remain major concerns for the company 
 You can   
Amgen s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year  increasing  29 6  vs   15 4   Amgen is well positioned for growth with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio  Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Vectibix  Nplate and Sensipar   are all performing well  Additionally  Amgen s restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient  Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline  including biosimilar drugs 
However  the company has some challenges in store  given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products  Volume growth of new drugs may not be enough to offset lost sales due to the decline in mature brands  While Neupogen is already facing U S  biosimilar competition  Neulasta and Epogen could start facing the same next year  Also the softness in Enbrel sales due to stiff competitive pressure is a key cause for concern  Meanwhile  uptake of Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions 
 You can   
Shares of Union Pacific have underperformed its industry as well as fellow railroad operator Norfolk Southern  NYSE NSC  on a year to date basis  While the company has gained  6 9   the industry in belongs to and Norfolk Southern have rallied  17  and  17 5   respectively  so far this year  Notably  the bleak outlook for the third quarter of 2017 unveiled by Union Pacific on its automotive unit is a matter of concern  Units like agricultural products and chemicals are also expected to registar below par volumes in the same quarter 
However  the company s efforts to cut costs to drive the bottom line are encouraging  In fact  we are also impressed with Union Pacific s plans to reward investors through share buybacks and dividend payouts  Additionally  improvement in the coal related scenario raises optimism  going forward

125283,346798,NTRS,Northern Trust s  NTRS  Q2 Earnings Miss  Revenue Rises,opinion,Impacted by low non interest income and high expenses  Northern Trust Corporation   NASDAQ NTRS   reported a negative earnings surprise of 4 8  in second quarter 2017  Adjusted earnings per share came in at  1 18  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 24  However  the reported figure compared favorably with  1 07 recorded in the year ago quarter Escalating operating expenses and fall in non interest income were recorded  However  top line growth aided by higher net interest income and credit provisions was positives  In addition  the quarter witnessed a rise in assets under custody  as well assets under management Net income came in at  267 9 million or  1 12 per share compared with  263 million or  1 10 recorded in the prior year quarter  Results include certain one time items Margins Improve  Non interest Income Falls  Costs EscalateTotal revenue of  1 33 billion was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The reported figure was slightly up year over year On a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income of  350 4 million was up 14  year over year  This was driven by increased levels of average earning assets and higher net interest margin Net interest margin  NIM  was 1 28   up 12 basis points from the prior year quarter  The increase chiefly reflected higher short term interest rates and reduced premium amortization  The positives were partially mitigated by an unfavorable mix shift in earning assets Non interest income declined 4  from the year ago quarter to  979 7 million  Fall in foreign exchange trading income  other operating income and treasury management fees were the primary reasons for this decrease  These were partially offset by elevated trust  investment  along with rise in security commissions and trading income Non interest expenses were up 1  year over year to  937 4 million in the quarter  The rise was mainly driven by an elevation in mostly all components of expenses Improvement in Assets Under Management and CustodyAs of Jun 30  2017  Northern Trust s total assets under custody increased 16  year over year to  7 38 trillion  while total assets under management rose 14  to  1 03 trillion Credit Quality  A Mixed BagTotal allowance for credit losses came in at  178 8 million  down 21  year over year  Net charge

directors also approved a new common stock repurchase authorization of up to 9 5 million shares  replacing the authorization approved in Apr 2015 Our ViewpointResults of Northern Trust display a decent performance in the reported quarter  We remain optimistic by the consistent growth in assets under custody  revenues and an improving credit quality to some extent  Moreover  positive impact of

125302,346817,NTRS,Struggling hedge funds still expense bonuses  bar tabs,news,"By Lawrence Delevingne NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors are starting to sour on the idea of reimbursing hedge funds for multi million dollar trader bonuses  lavish marketing dinners and trophy office space  Powerful firms such as Citadel LLC and Millennium Management LLC charge clients for such costs through so called  pass through  fees  which can include everything from a new hire s deferred compensation to travel to high end technology  It all adds up  investors often end up paying more than double the industry s standard fees of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains  which many already consider too high  Investors have for years tolerated pass through charges because of high net returns  but weak performance lately is testing their patience  Clients of losing funds last year  including those managed by Blackstone Group LP s  N BX  Senfina Advisors LLC  Folger Hill Asset Management LP and Balyasny Asset Management LP  likely still paid fees far higher than 2 percent of assets  Clients of shops that made money  including Paloma Partners and Hutchin Hill Capital LP  were left with returns of less than 5 percent partly because of a draining combination of pass through and performance fees   For a graphic on the hedge funds that passed through low returns  click    Millennium  the  34 billion New York firm led by billionaire Israel Englander  charged clients its usual fees of 5 or 6 percent of assets and 20 percent of gains in 2016  according to a person familiar with the situation  The charges left investors in Millennium s flagship fund with a net return of just 3 3 percent  Citadel  the  26 billion Chicago firm led by billionaire Kenneth Griffin  charged pass through fees that added up to about 5 3 percent in 2015 and 6 3 percent in 2014  according to another person familiar with the situation  Charges for 2016 were not finalized  but the costs typically add up to between 5 and 10 percent of assets  separate from the 20 percent performance fee Citadel typically charges  Citadel s flagship fund returned 5 percent in 2016  far below its 19 5 percent annual average since 1990  according to the source who  like others  spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information is private  All firms mentioned declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment  In 2014  consulting firm Cambridge Associates studied fees charged by multi manager funds  which deploy various investment strategies using small teams and often include pass throughs  Their clients lose 33 percent of profits to fees  on average  Cambridge found  The report by research consultant Tomas Kmetko noted such funds would need to generate gross returns of roughly 19 percent to deliver a 10 percent net profit to clients   STUNNING TO ME  Defenders of pass throughs said the fees were necessary to keep elite talent and provide traders with top technology  They said that firm executives were often among the largest investors in their funds and pay the same fees as clients  But frustration is starting to show  A 2016 survey by consulting firm EY found that 95 percent of investors prefer no pass through expense  The report also said fewer investors support various types of pass through fees than in the past   It s stunning to me to think you would pay more than 2 percent   said Marc Levine  chairman of the Illinois State Board of Investment  which has reduced its use of hedge funds   That creates a huge hurdle to have the right alignment of interests   Investors pulled  11 5 billion from multi strategy funds in 2016 after three consecutive years of net additions  according to data tracker eVestment  Redemptions for firms that use pass through fees were not available  Even with pass through fees  firms like Citadel  Millennium and Paloma have produced double digit net returns over the long term  The Cambridge study also found that multi manager funds generally performed better and with lower volatility than a global stock index   High fees and expenses are hard to stomach  particularly in a low return environment  but it s all about the net   said Michael Hennessy  co founder of hedge fund investment firm Morgan Creek Capital Management  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Citadel has used pass through fees for an unusual purpose  developing intellectual property  The firm relied partly on client fees to build an internal administration business starting in 2007  But only Citadel s owners  including Griffin  benefited from the 2011 sale of the unit  Omnium LLC  to  Northern Trust  Corp  NASDAQ NTRS  for  100 million  plus  60 million or so in subsequent profit sharing  two people familiar with the situation said   Citadel noted in a 2016 U S  Securities and Exchange Commission filing that some pass through expenses are still used to develop intellectual property  the extent of which was unclear  Besides hedge funds  Citadel s other business lines include Citadel Securities LLC  the powerful market maker  and Citadel Technology LLC  a small portfolio management software provider  Some Citadel hedge fund investors and advisers to them told Reuters they were unhappy about the firm charging clients to build technology whose profits Citadel alone will enjoy   It s really against the spirit of a partnership   said one  A spokesman for Citadel declined to comment  A person familiar with the situation noted that Citadel put tens of millions of dollars into the businesses and disclosed to clients that only Citadel would benefit from related revenues  The person also noted Citadel s high marks from an investor survey by industry publication Alpha for alignment of interests and independent oversight  Gordon Barnes  global head of due diligence at Cambridge  said few hedge fund managers charge their investors for services provided by affiliates because of various problems it can cause  
 Even with the right legal disclosures  it rarely passes a basic fairness test   Barnes said  declining to comment on any individual firm   These arrangements tend to favor the manager s interests  ",2017-01-19,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/struggling-hedge-funds-still-expense-bonuses,-bar-tabs-454180",454180
125303,346818,NTRS,U S  stock investors say don t worry  be happy,news,"By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK  Reuters    The latest leg of the relentless rally in U S  stocks since Donald Trump was elected president has all the hallmarks of being driven more by sentiment than sense  but that doesn t mean the ride is over  although it could well be a bumpier one from here  The U S  stock market  which has been hitting new highs almost every day  is more expensive than it has been since 2004  Trump s address on Tuesday to Congress sparked another buying frenzy  as the reset in the president s often bombastic tone to an uncombative stance ignited investor optimism   even though his speech was light on details of waited for initiatives  Growing expectations of faster interest rate rises at the Federal Reserve helped fuel the rally  with bank shares leading Wednesday s gains  The stocks rally since November has been driven by an expectation that Trump s push for deregulation tied to increased infrastructure spending and corporate tax cuts will jolt economic growth   and company earnings  However  investors caution that the tough job is now to come  pushing promised policy changes through Congress  which has proven less than easy even on issues Republicans agree on such as repealing Obamacare    If Trump delivers on some milestones that are relatively meaningful   corporate tax reform  deregulation     then I think the markets continue to rally  but if none of that happens people start to take risk off the table   said  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  chief investment officer Bob Browne  who is overweight U S  equities  Equities are surely richly priced  Since the 12 percent advance on the S P 500 since the Nov  8 election  investors are now paying  18 for every  1 in expected earnings over the next 12 months   the highest forward price to earnings valuation in 13 years according to Thomson Reuters Datastream  Still  large investors such as Warren Buffett are optimistic  Buffett told CNBC earlier this week that the U S  stock market was cheap with interest rates at current levels  although he conceded that U S  shares could conceivably  go down 20 percent tomorrow   But Buffett said he was  baffled  about who would buy a 30 year bond at current yields  Rich valuations are not a sell signal in themselves  since in the later stages of a bull market   which can last years    corporate earnings are cyclically elevated and the multiple that the market assigns to those earnings is often elevated as well   according to a note from analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Wednesday  The BAML analysts raised their year end target for the S P to 2 450  or about 2 percent above the current level  noting that they expect the benchmark to slide below 2 230 at one point before 2018  Even so  the high expectations on policy execution and the elevated valuation leave stock investors exposed   Expectations today are quite optimistic relative to the likelihood of delays  friction and more negative offsets than the market is currently pricing in   wrote the BAML analysts  The lack of detail on Trump s speech Tuesday regarding tax reform concerned some investors  Scott Clemons  chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York  said tax reform got  really  really short airtime  and it appeared to be a  secondary priority   But Clemons said any market pullback on that front would be short lived because of the expected strength in corporate earnings  Earnings for the S P are expected to rise more than 10 percent over the full year  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S data  But that number has been trending lower  For the current quarter  analysts see earnings rising 10 6 percent  down from an 18 percent estimate in April and a 13 8 percent gain seen in January  FED HEADWINDS With Trump s speech light on details  the market focused on the growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates sooner and maybe more times this year than previously thought  Investors now see a 65 percent chance that the Fed will move to raise rates later this month  up from 35 percent Tuesday  But higher rates  which buoyed investor optimism because a March rate hike would signal policymakers  growing confidence in the economy  would be a double edged sword for equity investors  The dollar has risen on the view of higher interest rates  with the 100 day average of the dollar index  DXY  at its highest since 2003  Every 5 to 6 percent increase in the dollar results in negative earnings revisions of about 3 percent on the S P 500  as sales in other currencies are converted to fewer dollars  Higher rates at the Fed also mean companies spend more on credit  After a period of nearly a decade in which the Fed did not raise rates  increases can creep up in a company s expenses and generate unwanted risk for investors  Plus there s the added risk of uncertainty over how the Fed will shape its policy in the coming year  as six of the eight permanent voting positions at the Fed could all have new occupants due to term endings and currently open spots   I m more worried a year from now when we have no idea what the Fed board will look like   said David Kotok  chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors

 It s not easy to find somebody who is going to have credibility in that job   he said of Yellen and her possible replacement   The confirmation process is not an assured thing these days  And the markets weigh in if they were to nominate somebody who didn t share the Fed s view of itself as independent  ",2017-04-12,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-won't-rule-out-second-yellen-term,-signaling-drift-to-the-mainstream-473976",473976
125306,346821,NTRS,Trump backs away from labeling China a currency manipulator,news,"By David Lawder WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that his administration will not label China a currency manipulator  backing away from a campaign promise  even as he said the U S  dollar was  getting too strong  and would eventually hurt the economy  In an interview with The Wall Street Journal  Trump also said he would like to see U S  interest rates stay low  another comment at odds with what he had often said during the election campaign  A U S  Treasury spokesman confirmed that the Treasury Department s semi annual report on currency practices of major trading partners  due out later this week  will not name China a currency manipulator  The U S  dollar fell broadly on Trump s comments on both the strong dollar and interest rates  while U S  Treasury yields fell on the interest rate comments  and Wall Street stocks slipped   FRX   US    N  Trump s comments broke with a long standing practice of both U S  Democratic and Republican administrations of refraining from commenting on policy set by the independent Federal Reserve  It is also highly unusual for a president to address the dollar s value  which is a subject usually left to the U S  Treasury secretary   They re not currency manipulators   Trump told the Journal about China  The statement is an about face from Trump s election campaign promises to slap that label on Beijing on the first day of his administration as part of his plan to reduce Chinese imports into the United States  The Wall Street Journal paraphrased Trump as saying that the reason he changed his mind on the currency issue was because China has not been manipulating its yuan for months and because taking the step now could jeopardize his talks with Beijing on confronting the threat from North Korea  Separately on Wednesday  at a joint news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg  Trump said the United States was prepared to tackle the crisis surrounding North Korea without China if necessary  The United States last branded China a currency manipulator in 1994  Under U S  law  labeling a country as currency manipulator can trigger an investigation and negotiations on tariffs and trade   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that Trump s decision to break his campaign promise on China was  symptomatic of a lack of real  tough action on trade  against Beijing   The best way to get China to cooperate with North Korea  is to be tough on them with trade  which is the number one thing China s government cares about   Schumer said   TRUMP OPEN TO REAPPOINTING YELLEN AS FED CHAIR Trump also told the Journal that he respected Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and said she was  not toast  when her current term ends in 2018   That was also a turnaround from his frequent criticism of Yellen during his campaign  when he said she was keeping interest rates too low   At other times  however  Trump had said that low rates were good because higher rates would strengthen the dollar and hurt American exports and manufacturers   I think our dollar is getting too strong  and partially that s my fault because people have confidence in me  But that s hurting   that will hurt ultimately   Trump said on Wednesday   It s very  very hard to compete when you have a strong dollar and other countries are devaluing their currency   Trump told the Journal  The dollar fell broadly Trump s comments on the strong dollar and on his preference for low interest rates  It fell more than 1 0 percent against the yen  sinking below 110 yen for the first time since mid November   FRX    It s hard to talk down your currency unless you re going to talk down your interest rates and so obviously he s trying to get Janet Yellen to play ball with him    said Robert Smith  president and chief investment officer at Sage Advisory Services in Texas   Trump s comments about the Fed were his most explicit about the U S  central bank since he took office in January  and suggest a lower likelihood that he plans to try to push monetary policy in some unorthodox new direction   Some key Republicans have advocated an overhaul of how the Fed works  using a ruled based policy that would likely mean higher interest rates   not the lower ones Trump said he prefers  The Fed in mid March hiked interest rates for the second time in three months  increasing its target overnight rate by a quarter of a percentage point   Maybe he s learning on the job   said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist at Chicago based  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS   noting that with Trump s transition from candidate to president he is now being counseled by more orthodox voices sensitive to what is needed to keep global bond markets on an even keel

125317,346832,NTRS,New Technologies Adding to Pressure On Fees,opinion,"proposes that emerging technologies  blockchains  Big Data and artificial intelligence  have increased pressure on the traditional hedge fund fee structure of 2   20 
Its author is Wulf A  Kaal  an Associate Professor at the University of St  Thomas and director of the Private Investment Fund Institute 
Kaal  who worked for both Cravath Swain and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  before beginning his academic career  operates from the generally acknowledged fact that fees are of late under downward pressure  The historical annualized management fee of 2  of assets under management has become just 1  for new managers  and has fallen into a range between 1 5  and 1 8  even for established managers 
There is pressure on the incentive fee side  the 20  on returns  as well  although it shows itself in different ways  There is a trend for example  especially within the PE world  toward  blackened carry   This means that managers cannot collect their  carry  until all the LPs have had their capital returned to them   A similar trend   Kaal writes   is observable in the hedge fund industry  
Ways to Use Blockchains
Another important data point  then  is the recent trend in the private investment industry toward the use of blockchains  a technology associated with  but broader than  cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin  Kaal writes   While some funds simply focus on trading bitcoins  GDAXUSD    to avoid market fluctuations others go much further by fully automating a hedge fund secured by blockchain technology to improve administrative procedures of private equity dealmaking   In February 2017  for example  Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  partnered up with IBM  NYSE IBM  to create a blockchain that would offer a more efficient approach to the administration of PEs 
The current deal practice in much of the PE world  Kaal says  involves the reconciliation of a lot of copies of documents  whereas the new Northern Trust IBM blockchain allows all the involved parties to look at a single tamper resistant compiled version of the transaction and related data 
Incentives and Game Theory
Another use of blockchain is as a way of awarding and co ordinating incentives  February also saw an example of this use  a press release by Numerai  a hedge fund with a global equity strategy  Numerai operates on the Ethereum blockchain  and the press release said it had issued one million crypto tokens to its data scientists by way of encouraging competitive cooperation among them to make the predictions out of which it will in time create a meta model 
Numerai itself has explained its system as akin to a solution to the  prisoner s dilemma  at the foundations of game theory  In that dilemma  each prisoner has a simple choice  rat on the other prisoner  or keep silent  The interrogators keep the prisoners isolated  so each thinking of his own options in isolation comes to think of ratting as the opimal solution  If each rats on the other  though  they get the worst possible result  Thus  in the classic PD scenario individual self interested behavior harms the interest of both parties 
Numerai  in an article posted on its website  says that in order to understand its own plans  one should  suppose the prisoners are issued a cryptocurrency similar to normal money except for one small change  it is programmed to self destruct whenever anyone goes to prison   This would change the incentives by making it impossible for either prisoner to consider his own options in isolation from those of the other 
Numerai  likewise  believes its currency  Numeraire   makes collaboration compatible with self interest  So 
Theoretically and Empirically
But let us return to Kaal  Although his paper is a brief one  Kaal looks at the consequences of blockchains for fees both theoretically and empirically  Theoretically  the use of blockchain and related technologies enables the hedge funds that make use of it to undercut their competitors on fees  and thus contributes to the downward fee pressure  One way it does this is by allowing manmagers to switch to a transaction fee model  which prior to the development of this technology involved  a prohibitive amount of work  and the risk of human error in calculation or settlement 
Empirically  matters go as theory indicates they should  The majority of private fund advisors that use blockchain technology  artificial intelligence  and big data in different aspects of their operations or strategy charge their investors lower fees   Kaal concludes 
The bad news  then  for those who derive their income from those fees  is that if Kaal is at all correct  the downward pressure will intensify ",2017-06-26,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/new-technologies-adding-to-pressure-on-fees-200197350,200197350

125335,346850,NTRS,Amid election jitters  many big funds stay aggressive but cash tempts,news,"By Tim McLaughlin and Jamie McGeever BOSTON LONDON  Reuters    Stocks are listing  bonds are drifting and suddenly gold is back in vogue  Global investors appear to be facing the prospect that next week s U S  presidential election may not play out as they have been expecting  Until last Friday  when the FBI said it had re opened a probe of Democrat Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state  the prevailing view among the investment set had her coasting to victory  And most investors have said in surveys they were more comfortable with that outcome than a victory by Republican Donald Trump  Now  though  several polls depict an ever tightening race as the clock counts down to Election Day on Tuesday  although the latest Reuters Ipsos poll showed Clinton still with a 6 point lead  Investors generally see Clinton as a known quantity who would not make major changes that would upend financial markets  while Trump s positions have been difficult to nail down  Yet against the tumultuous political backdrop  some of the biggest American stock funds remain either too sanguine  too confused or too focused on extending the bull market to guard against an Election Day result that could shock the world like the Brexit vote did in June  U S  large cap mutual funds  which oversee  4 trillion in assets  are heading into the showdown for the White House with only a thin layer of cash to absorb any potential shocks from the stock market   Gerry Sullivan  who runs USA Mutuals   234 million Barrier Fund  said it would be hard to reposition his portfolio even if he knew the election results ahead of time    There is so much confusion   Sullivan said  U S  funds that invest in stocks with large market capitalizations are not showing any drastic moves toward precaution  Overall  they have only 3 1 percent of their assets dedicated to cash  according to the latest data from Morningstar Inc  These same funds held more cash  about 3 4 percent  before Barack Obama defeated John McCain in 2008  Multi asset investors are more defensively positioned  especially those outside the United States  according to the latest Reuters asset allocation poll  Funds in Europe held 8 1 percent of their portfolios in cash in late October  while U K  based funds had some 9 6 percent of their holdings parked on the sidelines   Investors are holding higher than normal levels of cash   said Mark Haefele  global chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management in London  who oversees around  2 trillion in assets   That s one way of hedging the uncertainty   Nonetheless  Haefele said   We ve not seen significant de risking around the election  but we have seen generally a consistent level of caution in the global client base   With uncertainty about the outcome on the rise  a risk off mood has enveloped markets around the world   The S P 500 index has declined for eight days in a row  its longest losing streak since the market crash in October 2008  while a benchmark for global stocks  the MSCI All World Index  has dropped for seven of the last eight sessions  Both sit near four month lows   Safe haven bonds  recently under pressure from expectations the U S  Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates this year  have seen only a modest boost in the meantime  but gold has surged to a one month high near  1 300 an ounce   The trades you re seeing in the market at the moment will go further in the event of a Trump victory   said Mike Bell  global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London   You d expect more downside to U S  equities  the dollar and Treasury yields   NOT AN  INVESTABLE EVENT  More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility  Prices for certain S P 500 index options expiring in the days after the election indicate a market swing of between 2 and 4 percent  in either direction  by then  Still  portfolio managers sitting on a lot of cash  some with more than 20 percent of assets  say the stockpile is not a sign of worry about the outcome of the race    It s due to the diminished risk reward profile of investment opportunities in a mature profit cycle   said Meggan Walsh  a portfolio manager at the  18 billion Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund   We do not feel the election is an investable event   Some value oriented large cap fund managers say the stock market is over valued and they are on high alert for a market correction as the election coincides with a bull market nearing completion of its eighth year    It can be tempting to forget that nasty downturns happen with some regularity  and there is never a bell rung to announce their arrival   portfolio managers Arik Ahitov and Dennis Bryant recently warned investors in the  800 million FPA Capital Fund   After Britain surprised the world with a vote to leave the European Union  the S P 500 Index tumbled nearly 4 percent on June 24  It soon recovered  however  and had regained record territory by mid August  Even in Britain  the referendum s unexpected outcome has yet to show it has long lasting effects for investors outside of the currency market  where the British pound has sunk to a three decade low against the dollar  London s FTSE 100 index is up around 14 percent from its post Brexit trough  The FPA Capital Fund managers had nearly 28 percent of the fund s  800 million in assets in cash during the third quarter  They see the stock market as too expensive and are ready for a high level of panic  if that happens  according to their October letter to investors   An elevated level of forced selling  combined with a lack of liquidity  might result in challenges for many fully invested products such as index funds  many ETFs  and funds that have no to very low levels of cash cushions   the FPA Capital Fund portfolio managers said

125344,346859,NTRS,Wells Fargo  WFC  Hit With Lawsuit On Discriminatory Charges,opinion,"In a federal lawsuit filed against Wells Fargo   Company   NYSE WFC   on Monday  the City of Philadelphia claimedthat the bank was engaged in discriminatory lending practices 
The city argues that the bank purposely provided the minorities with riskier loans carrying high interest rates  even though they were eligible for cheaper loans  In an analysis conducted on the bank  it was revealed that about 23  of loans given to the African American and Latino borrowers were risky and costly  while for the whites it represented only 7 6  The complaint also says that the officials of the bank were aware of such practices 
It was noted that the U S  Department of Justice and some of the other cities such as Los Angeles  Oakland  Miami  Baltimore  Memphis and Miami Gardens filed similar lawsuits against Wells Fargo 
The lawsuit pursues  equitable relief  by asking the bank to end these unfair lending practices  Further  on the back of city s loss of property taxes on abandoned properties and lowered value of foreclosed properties  the city seeks monetary compensation 
However  the bank declined the charges and called them  unsubstantiated accusations   It promises to have fairly conducted business in Philadelphia over the last 140 years 
Recently  the bank settled the lawsuit which charged that its employees made fake customer accounts without their knowledge in order to meet the impossible sales goals  However  the count of fake accounts opened is increasing to date  Also  evidence of involvement of some executives has also been found 
Moreover  in a unanimous vote  Philadelphia City Council removed Wells Fargo as the bank that handles the city s payroll  Though the city assures that none of the lawsuits triggered the decision  the bank s involvement in them hurt its reputation  These negatives might affect its performance going forward

125357,346872,NTRS,Rocket Internet s sales growth slows as seeks to stem losses,news,"By Emma Thomasson BERLIN  Reuters    Shares in German ecommerce investor  Rocket Internet   DE RKET  slid on Tuesday after it reported that revenue growth slowed sharply in the first quarter at most of its top start ups as it took steps to try to reduce their losses  Founded in 2007  Rocket has spent heavily on marketing and logistics to build up dozens of businesses ranging from online fashion to food delivery to try to replicate the success of Amazon  O AMZN  and  Alibaba   N BABA  in emerging markets  However  the firm has shifted its focus towards improving profitability this year  even at the expense of slower revenue growth  after investors have expressed concerns that its main start ups are overvalued and are making unsustainable losses  Rocket has pledged that the 1 billion euros   1 12 billion it burnt through in 2015 will mark a peak for losses and promises to make three start ups profitable by the end of 2017  On Tuesday it reported progress towards that goal as the quarterly absolute loss at its main start ups fell 23 percent on the previous year to 140 million euros  However  revenue growth slowed as it reined in its marketing spend to limit losses and was also hurt by a fall in emerging market currencies  Sales were up 34 percent at 532 million euros  but down from the 217 percent growth rate of a year ago    Every attempt to deliver significant business operating leverage is not coming through without significant growth degradation   said Neil Campling  head of technology research at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Securities  who rates the stock a  sell    These businesses don t offer scale  competitive differentiation or high barriers to entry   he said  Rocket s shares were down 5 2 percent by 1034 GMT  valuing the firm at 3 7 billion euros  well shy of the 5 3 billion euros valuation Rocket put on its portfolio at April 30  The stock is down 25 percent this year after major investor Kinnevik  ST KINVb  slashed the valuation for its fashion sites by two thirds in April  prompting questions about the worth of the other start ups  On Tuesday Rocket highlighted improvements towards profitability at Middle East fashion site Namshi and furniture site Westwing  but admitted that losses widened at ingredients delivery firm HelloFresh   its biggest investment   due to spending on marketing and warehouses  It did not give figures for losses at its second biggest holding Delivery Hero  although sales rose 91 percent  Chief Executive Oliver Samwer told a conference call for analysts that HelloFresh should narrow its losses this year and has enough cash to get it through to breakeven point  He added that HelloFresh  which pulled plans for an initial public offering at the last minute last year  was still a candidate for a possible flotation  but said listing any of its start ups was very unlikely this year  Revenue dropped 37 percent at African general merchandise retailer Jumia and 51 percent at Latin American site Linio  hit by weak currencies as well as a shift from selling their own inventory to becoming commission based marketplaces  While still upbeat on Jumia  Samwer said Rocket s investment in Linio was limited and it was considering a possible sale

125358,346873,NTRS,Landing with a bump  Germany s Rocket falls back to earth,news,"By Emma Thomasson and Chijioke Ohuocha BERLIN LAGOS  Reuters    When German e commerce investor Rocket Internet launched Jumia in 2012 as a would be African Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   it was optimistic that a rapidly expanding middle class would quickly shift from street markets to shopping online  Four years on  falling sales for sites like Jumia and slower growth from Nigeria to Russia and Brazil is casting doubt on Rocket Internet s ambition to become the world s biggest Internet company outside the United States and China  Jumia made a loss of 17 million euros   18 8 million  in the first three months of 2016 on sales that fell more than a third  The devaluation of Nigeria s naira last week is a new blow for Jumia  which now operates in more than 20 countries in Africa  Revenue growth has also slowed at most of Rocket Internet s other 11 leading start ups  ranging from furniture e commerce and food delivery in Europe to online fashion in markets from India to Latin America and the Middle East  That is the consequence of Rocket s shift to rein in spending on marketing and logistics as it seeks to stem losses which it said peaked at 1 billion euros in 2015  As a result  shareholders have cast doubt on the valuation Rocket has put on its portfolio and questioned the strategy of sending business school graduates to set up 150 start ups in more than 110 countries in just a few years  Exclusive interviews with shareholders reveal growing scepticism about Rocket s sprawling empire as emerging markets sour and technology stocks cool  Its share price has fallen 39 percent this year   People have started to question whether the company portfolio is really as good as we first thought   said a top 20 shareholder  who declined to be named as they expect to trade stock   A lot of trust has been destroyed over the last 12 months   Founded in Berlin in 2007 by brothers Oliver  Alexander and Marc Samwer  Rocket Internet aims to replicate the business models of Amazon  China s  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  and ride service Uber in new markets  With few other tech companies listed in Europe  investors jumped at the opportunity to gain exposure to an array of fast growing businesses when Rocket went public in 2014  pushing the stock up by more than 50 percent in the first few months  However  the stock has been on a downward trajectory since peaking in February 2015 after it surprised investors with a new capital hike and shifted strategy to invest in the food delivery business in developed markets  The latest share price tumble started in April when Sweden s Kinnevik  Rocket s second biggest shareholder after the Samwer brothers  slashed the valuation for its emerging market fashion websites by two thirds  That unsettled investors  especially after Kinnevik said its representatives were stepping down from the board  citing potential conflicts of interest over future investments  Kinnevik  which has hedged its bets on Rocket in Africa by investing in Jumia s main rival Konga  declined to comment for this article  It has said it will work closely with Rocket although it could review its stake in two or three years  Martin Weber  a partner at venture capital firm Holtzbrinck  which has a 1 9 percent Rocket stake  says the company has struggled to provide enough information about its holdings   The stock market loves transparency  And that is not practically possible at Rocket   Weber told Reuters   Rocket needs to prove that it can get profitable companies on their feet   Samwer has admitted Rocket had initially done too little to communicate with investors after the firm went public  but he is not worried about the share price   We planted a lot of seeds and I believe in the next 24 months a lot of investors will see it the same way   he told a Berlin tech conference this month  He says the sale in April of Lazada   Rocket s loss making Amazon clone in Southeast Asia   for  1 billion to Alibaba underlines the logic of going into frontier markets before more established rivals  Some investors are prepared to give him more time   We believe that the portfolio is worth a lot more   said Ralph Dommermuth  chief executive of United Internet  Rocket s third biggest shareholder  even after he took a 157 million euro writedown on his firm s Rocket stake in May   Among European investors in young Internet firms  Rocket Internet is the broadest and has the most experience in the sector   CEO S PROMISE Rocket now has a market capitalization of 3 billion euros  well below the 5 3 billion valuation it put on its portfolio at April 30  and only just above the 2 8 billion in cash held by Rocket and its operating companies as of March 31  Most Internet start ups burn cash in early years as they pour money into marketing  logistics and technology to pursue revenue growth above all else  hoping to move into the black once they reach scale  That approach has worked for the likes of Amazon  Alibaba and European online fashion site Zalando   Neil Campling  head of technology research at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Capital Markets  who rates the stock a  sell   doubts the Rocket businesses can replicate Amazon s success because their markets are so underdeveloped and the cost of logistics so much higher   As soon as they reduce marketing  you see revenue growth decline substantially   he said   They haven t got the scale   However  Samwer says Rocket has more than enough capital to fund its main start ups until they turn profitable  Samwer promised last September to make three start ups profitable by the end of 2017  with Middle East fashion site Namshi  online home furnishings store Westwing and food takeout firm Delivery Hero seen as the most promising  Jumia  which predicted in late 2013 it could turn a profit within 18 months  is far from that goal  It lost 111 million euros in 2015 on sales of 135 million  But Jumia Nigeria CEO Juliet Anammah believes the company can make a profit within three to five years   Africa is a long term play   she said  Samwer has now changed tack for his Amazon clones  shifting from buying and shipping their own stock   more suited to countries with well established logistics   to providing a commission based marketplace for third party retailers  like Alibaba   You are tapping into the supply capacity that exists in the country  So you are not dependant exclusively on your working capital to source and bring in retail products   Anammah said  Samwer remains optimistic for Jumia   The people are still there even if emerging markets are cold    They still have some money   he said   The offline to online shift continues

Revisiting the Trump Trade

Introduction

	The 16 company strong Major Regional Bank industry stands out in Zacks Industry Ranks    these late spring days  The niche ranked  47 out of 265 Zacks industries this week  That rank was  35 last week  For the final spring week of April  I count 6 upside analyst earnings revisions and just 2 downside revisions 
	What have Regional Bank share prices done    recently  To answer succinctly  study the group s top Exchange Traded Fund  ETF  trading performance 
	The iShares U S  Regional Bank ETF  IAT  shot up from  36 a share   at the time of the U S  Presidential Election   to  46 by the end of 2016  The ETF then hit a spiky high of  49 a share on March 1st  Now  shares trade at  45 
	That s a  Tell     Regional Banks are an outstanding example of a  Trump Trade  
	What does that mean  It meant that last November  covering analysts thought the new business friendly President would provide broad tangible earnings upside across this group of companies  Given the spurt up in share prices  traders drank that policy driven Koolaid too 
	For this banking niche  Trump Trade tangible benefits took two forms  One was a lower corporate tax rate  enhancing profit margins  The second was less Dodd Frank regulation  cutting costs 
	In late April  after a March Fed rate hike enhanced bank interest margins  Zacks still ranks this top Regional Bank ETF a  1 Rank  STRONG BUY   The ETF dividend yield rests at 1 46   With respect to specific ETF share holdings we care about for this piece  PNC is a high 11 2  ETF weight  Comerica is 2 35  weight  Northern Trust is not included 
	Finally  realize this    covering analyst s annual forward earnings estimate revisions drive our Zacks Rank system  In light of that reality  let s take a very close look into what one leading analyst covering this banking niche had to say A Covering Analyst s View

	Matt Olney is a regional banking analyst  He works at the respected banking boutique investment firm Stephens  He made these comments to Barron s on Jan 10th  2017  
	 For the community and regional banks  we did some work within our coverage and over 80  of those today are trading above their average levels on price to tangible book value  TBV   That s not to say they are too expensive  it just means we re at the high end of historical valuations and I can make a case that we probably belong there 

	It can be warranted  but it assumes lots of macro tailwinds that are still coming into focus  So  for example  higher interest rates are great for these community and regional banks  and it feels like at this point  the valuations assume some benefits from that  And as a whole  the bank sector stands to benefit more than most other sectors if there is a move to lower corporate tax rates 
	Those two things are probably the biggest drivers  Then within them there are some soft items  call them regulatory expenses  It is tough to understand exactly how much the regulatory issues have affected the banks  There have been higher expenses  and it kind of distracts the executives 
	At this point all signs suggest that  reforms  are moving forward and there is going to be some benefit to the banks to a certain degree  I just can t tell you how much it is going to be  how many more rate moves we re going to see  or how low corporate taxes are going to be 
	But there is risk at this point that those two items don t come through as positively as we re hoping  There is risk that the banks have some downside if those two items don t see results we re looking for 
	So it is time to be more selective  It is time to go and look at some banks that can benefit in this current environment and not just wait around for higher rates and lower corporate tax rates  

My Thoughts
	With the latest pullback in the iShares Regional Bank ETF  one has to ask the question  Are traders becoming more skeptical on the benefits of the Trump Trade  In particular  are they revisiting policy changes that matter to Regional Banks  Are proposed corporate tax cuts getting less tasty  Are proposed Dodd Frank reform benefits getting downsized 

	Tidy answers are not forthcoming  Maybe the latest share price pullback was an overdue profit taking exercise  The 6 positive analyst estimate revisions in late April    after Trump held a press conference offering a proposed 15  rate on corporate taxes    did generate modest excitement 
	Nonetheless  let s take the advice of Stephens  regional banking analyst  Mr  Olney  Be more selective with your Regional Bank picks 3 Top Zacks Rank Picks in Regional Banking

125394,346909,NTRS,Yellen steers Fed with cautious hand  despite hints of inflation,news,"By Jason Lange and Jonathan Spicer
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Federal Reserve policymakers urging caution over interest rate hikes have gained the upper hand in the central bank s internal debate  but the risk for the U S  economy is that they are wrong to downplay a recent rise in inflation 
In words that echo those of colleagues on the Fed s dovish wing  Fed Chair Janet Yellen told a news conference on Wednesday that  caution is appropriate  when it comes to raising interest rates  She said she was not convinced underlying inflation had accelerated 
If Yellen is right  financial markets have ample warning for the gradual pace of rate hikes she said was likely 
But many private economists buy into the argument by an opposing faction within the Fed that U S  inflation is indeed stirring 
They point to a range of recent data to back their view  including a reading Thursday showing underlying U S  inflation rose 2 3 percent in the 12 months through February  the biggest increase in more than three years  The Fed s target is 2 percent inflation 
Faster price gains would likely trigger more aggressive rate hikes which Yellen in the past has warned could cause a recession 
 If we got to a point where the Fed had to raise  rates  quickly  it could be very destabilizing   said  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  economist Carl Tannenbaum  formerly an economist at the Chicago Fed 
Yellen s comments sounded much like those of a vocal faction of Fed policymakers  led by Governor Lael Brainard  who have argued publicly that the global economic slowdown could knock the U S  economy off course  Brainard just last week counseled against assuming that a tighter labor market would boost inflation 
However  the chair s assessment that inflation may not yet have turned the corner to a more healthy trajectory runs counter to the view of Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer  who warned this month that faster inflation might well be stirring 
If Fischer is right  Fed Chair Janet Yellen may have to change her tone as soon as the next policy meeting in April 
 Yellen will have a noticeable faction of the committee that s anxious to tighten again   said David Stockton  the Fed s former research director who is now a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics   They will need to be persuaded that the process is still in place  that this is not an indefinite pause  
DIALING BACK
After Wednesday s decision and fresh forecasts from the Fed that showed most officials prefer just two rate hikes this year  investors and economists dialed back their own rate hike expectations  with traders of interest rate futures now seeing no rate rise before September 
The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in December  the first time it lifted rates in nearly a decade  Its target now stands as between 0 25 and 0 50 percent 
With the market view for just one rate hike this year at odds with the Fed s view that at least two will be needed  Yellen could find herself in a box particularly if global markets remain relatively calm and threats to the United States dissipate 
 This could reinforce the market s belief that a dovish Fed is not all that interested in walking the talk  and when the June  Fed  meeting comes around skepticism could still reign  said Scott Anderson  chief economist at Bank of the West 
Some economists  like JP Morgan s Michael Feroli  have even concluded that the Fed is  becoming inherently more dovish   for a number of reasons  including increasing comfort with a tight labor market 
Yellen sought to discount the significance of the slower path of rate hikes suggested by the Fed forecasts  saying they should not be seen as a consensus Fed view 
And she said that the Fed s decision to refrain from noting  downside risks  to its forecasts reflects the fact that global economic headwinds could become tailwinds if easing by central banks abroad successfully stokes growth 
The prospect that inflation could perk up further   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  economist Sam Bullard said  means that  there is risk to the market having just one rate hike priced in

 It s a different feeling on the grounds having won that tournament  Masters   It s a special place for me  and I m really happy to be going back there as long as I m capable of playing golf  ",2016-04-03,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/spieth-cashes-in,-but-at-what-price -393239",393239

125409,346924,NTRS,We Like Banks,opinion,"As clients know  we have liked and continue to like exposure to banks  We favor the big banks and have a position in the PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio Fund  KBWB  an ETF that captures the big banks  We also hold KRE and KIE  We are overweight the sector  We will get to why in a minute 
First we want to offer a plug for our longtime friend Chris Whalen  He has a new book out  the result of years of effort  It s Ford Men  From Inspiration to Enterprise  And he is again writing at theinstitutionalriskanalyst com  We followed Chris s work on banks at the IRA for years  it has been very helpful 
Now let s get to the situation with the banks as we see it 
Earnings
The quarterly earnings parade of the banks is underway  We mostly like what we see  Results being reported are not bad and in some cases are really good 
Among the big banks  only Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  is continuing to experience embarrassment over its behavior  Claw back of the compensation of former leaders is the latest headline  The credit card sales affair and subsequent penalty has haunted WF 
Among the 15 important middle sized regional banks  only Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  failed its  living will  test  according to the Fed and the FDIC  Note that Wells Fargo was previously a  living will  casualty and endured some restrictions because of it 
The Upside
Here are some reasons why we think the banks are headed for an extended bull market recovery cycle 
1  Banking sector returns on assets  returns on equity  and quarterly net income have recovered to about the pre financial crisis level  The same is true for loss provisions  while nonperforming real estate loans have been in decline for several years  Net interest margins are in recovery  In sum  the picture of the banking sector is a lot better than it was coming out of the financial crisis 
2  American banks have the ability to fund themselves with low cost deposits  In a world that wants US dollar funding  American banks have this idiosyncratic advantage over other global banks 
3  The final issue is in the arena of regulatory relief  Here there is debate  Some relief must come through legislation  and this requires accommodation between the Trump administration and the Congress  So far this prospect looks problematic 
4  But other relief can come from what the Wall St  Journal calls the administration s  power to interpret and enforce financial regulations   The WSJ analysis notes how this could occur without Congress  Example  Changing the liquidity classification of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that they count just as US Treasury securities do would allow banks to hold more GSE paper  Goldman estimates this change would add 2 5  to annual earnings at the largest banks and 1 8  at the regionals  Separately  this rule change would make it easier for the Fed to reduce the size of its balance sheet by allowing the market to absorb its holdings of GSE paper 
5  Another dramatic change could occur with regulation  Currently  when calculating the coverage ratio  banks have to count their holdings in extremely safe assets like Treasury bills or reserve deposits at the Fed  If regulators were to change the calculation method to exclude these items  the impact would be huge  Keefe  Bruyette  and Woods estimates that this single change could raise earnings at the big eight banks by over 13  next year  2018    
In sum
The banking system has improved and continues to do so  Only a few banks now cause industry embarrassment  Earnings appear to be stabilizing in the post crisis period  Regulation can give banks a large boost in earnings without Congressional action  If President Trump can obtain Congress s help  the boost may be even larger

125425,346940,NTRS,Economy s weak spell puts Fed at crossroads over liftoff plans ,news,"By Howard Schneider and Jonathan Spicer WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal Reserve s plan to raise interest rates this year  forged over months of strong jobs growth and a seemingly durable expansion  now faces an economy that no longer follows the script and may push the  liftoff  far into the future  The world s largest economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter and may actually have contracted   That was initially dismissed as a winter lull  but recent data may point to a more substantial slowdown just as the Fed plots its exit from a zero interest rate policy maintained since Dec  2008   Lackluster retail sales and investment  sagging consumer confidence  a ballooning trade deficit and stagnant industrial output have all cast doubt over the central bank s plans    The Fed has been telling us for some time that they want to be data dependent  and the numbers are nothing to run up the flagpole   said Conference Board economist Kenneth Goldstein  The Conference Board is one of three organizations in a Reuters poll of economists that see liftoff in 2016  compared to 50 of 62 that expect the first rate rise in the third quarter of this year  For traders  the weakened 2015 has complicated any guess at the Fed s direction  Treasury yields will probably fall if it becomes clear the central bank has to once again delay its plans  but that raises the risk of steeper and faster rate hikes down the road   The penance for a delay of the hike is a much steeper hike   That s the balance the market s been playing with   said Aaron Kohli  an interest rate strategist with  BNP Paribas   PARIS BNPP  in New York   The longer the Fed stays on hold  the more risk there is that factors like inflation will build up   CRUNCH TIME The next few weeks will be key  heading into a June 16 17 Fed meeting when policymakers update their official forecasts   Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks about the economy on Friday and investors will look for either confirmation that she believes things remain on track  or a nod to the latest poor data  So far  most policymakers have stuck to the mantra that the Fed will watch incoming data and assess  meeting by meeting  whether to raise rates  and have telegraphed September as a likely date for the first increase  One of the few to advocate keeping monetary policy loose or longer  Chicago Fed president Charles Evans took his argument a step further on Monday  Not only should the Fed wait until at least early next year to raise rates  he said  but it should set a more aggressive standard on inflation   The odds should favor modestly overshooting our 2 percent target   before rates are increased  Evans said in Stockholm   But he also acknowledged the fork in the road the Fed faces  A rate rise will be on the table beginning in June  and a surge in economic performance   housing starts and permits rose sharply in April as spring weather set in   could still cause the Fed to move faster    If the Fed s going to wait  they are going to make a bigger policy mistake   said Guy Haselmann  head of U S  interest rate strategy at the Bank of Nova Scotia in New York   They could miss the business cycle  in which case they get put on hold even longer  and they create bigger asset bubbles   In a recent interview  San Francisco Fed President John Williams  who is seen to be close to Yellen s thinking  said that even if the economy were soft  it may be time to raise rates if only so future increases can proceed more slowly  Williams said that if the economy continues progressing as he expects  and  Say I wait one meeting longer  two meetings longer   If I then decide to raise rates  I m going to say  uh oh I am behind the curve   I ve got to get going  I am going to have to move faster    Recent central bank research even suggests that the grim first quarter numbers are more a result of how the economy is measured and less a sign of true weakness  CONSENSUS SLOW TO MOVE For the majority of economists expecting a September hike  continued job growth means that at some point the country will reach full employment and wages and prices will rise    Conditions certainly don t feel overly robust   right now  said Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist at  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  in Chicago and a former Fed official  But  if we continue to see job creation of 200 000 250 000 per month   the Fed  under their mandate  would think it would be a good time to start the process   of raising rates  The Fed last raised interest rates in 2006  at the tail end of a tightening cycle that had begun on a textbook note with market expectations closely aligned with the Fed  Conditions this time are more treacherous   Japan and Europe continue battling a risk of deflation with aggressive quantitative easing  while larger developing nations are slowing or fighting a mix of local problems  Organizations such as the International Monetary Fund have warned of a risk of financial volatility once the Fed begins  diverging  towards higher rates  The recent rise in Treasury yields showed markets on a knife edge  some  3 2 billion was pulled out of seven top emerging markets in the first half of May  according to data released on Tuesday by the Institute of International Finance  For investors  all of that points against a rate hike anytime soon  Markets in Fed Funds futures show investors have pushed back their expectations and are now divided between December and January as the date of liftoff

125429,346944,NTRS,Yellen says expects rate hike this year  but cites labor weakness,news,"By Howard Schneider and Ann Saphir CLEVELAND  Reuters    Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Friday said she expects the Fed to raise interest rates at some point this year  but pointed strongly to her concerns that U S  labor markets remain weak and that more workers could be encouraged back into the job market with stronger growth  In her speech Yellen gave no direct hint about whether she anticipates more than one rate hike over the Fed s four remaining meetings of 2015  But her focus on domestic economic developments looked beyond recent market turbulence over Greece and China  and keeps the Fed s plans on track  She said she expects the economy should grow steadily for the remainder of the year  allowing the Fed to move ahead with its first rate hike in nearly a decade   I expect it will be appropriate at some point later this year to take the first step to raise the federal funds rate and thus begin normalizing monetary policy   Yellen said in a speech to the City Club of Cleveland  a civic group that sponsors high level speakers   But I want to emphasize that the course of the economy and inflation remains highly uncertain   We will be watching carefully to see if there is continued improvement in labor market conditions  and we will need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent in the next few years   U S  Treasury yields rose and the dollar rallied against a basket of currencies after Yellen s remarks  while stocks modestly pared gains  Despite the improvement of recent years  she said labor markets remain out of line  with high levels of part time work and weak participation rates  The low unemployment rate  does not fully capture the extent of slack   she said   I think a significant number of individuals still are not seeking work because they perceive a lack of good job opportunities and that a stronger economy would draw some of them back into the labor force   Analysts saw Yellen s comments deviating little from the central bank s recent policy statement  Though global markets have been turbulent in recent weeks since the Fed s June meeting  Yellen focused on U S  growth she feels is likely to continue and will push the economy closer to the Fed s full employment and 2 percent inflation goals   If the economy continues to improve  the Fed will raise rates this year  It clearly wants to   said Jim McDonald  chief investment strategist at Chicago based  Northern Trust   NASDAQ NTRS  Asset Management  Yellen s remarks come less than a week before she is to appear before Congress for a biannual briefing on monetary policy  and as the central bank approaches a likely rate hike decision   It is a step that will have global implications  putting the Fed on a path separate from central banks in Europe and Japan that continue fighting economic crises  and potentially drawing capital out of developing economies   According to the individual economic projections released by Fed officials at their June meeting  there was a roughly even divide between those who expect only one interest rate increase this year   and might thus be prepared to wait until late in the year to hike   and those who expect two and would want to move sooner   Yellen s position on that point remains uncertain  though her influence as chair is likely pivotal in the ultimate decision  Fed officials seem to have set the stage for an initial increase as early as September  But recent events   the stock market collapse in China and the confusion in Greece in particular   have raised fresh concerns over how the world economy may hurt U S  growth  Investors now believe an initial hike is not likely until next year  The Fed has kept rates near zero for almost seven years  Though it will likely take years for the central bank to gradually return rates to more normal levels  the initial step    liftoff    has attracted outsized attention as a symbol that the Fed is ready to declare the crisis over  Yellen said she felt that initial step will have a small impact  and that the Fed would be raising rates only gradually from that point on  Yellen said she agreed that a slow start to the year was likely the result of temporary factors  such as low oil prices undercutting investment in the U S  energy sector  and a rising dollar pushing up the international price for U S  exports  
But she also said the economy faced constraints that could hold it back  from a still underperforming housing market to the unresolved crisis in Greece ",2015-07-10,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fed's-yellen-says-expects-rate-hike-this-year,-but-cites-labor-weakness-350634",350634

125436,346951,NTRS,4 Bank Stocks Show Promise Despite Multiple Threats,opinion,"It s quite a task luring investors toward the banking space  which has been tainted by the recent disruptions at Deutsche Bank AG   NYSE DB   and Wells Fargo   Co   NYSE WFC    The obscurities associated with the rate hike don t bode well for banks either 
Investors have taken away  6 billion from banking ETFs this year  The broader Financial Select Sector  XLF  has also seen three straight quarters of withdrawals  the longest stretch since the Bull Run began  Despite such pessimism  certain banking stocks have shown an upward trending price over a considerable period of time  At the same time  such stocks are fundamentally solid and are resistant to gyrations in the financial market 
Hence  if you have a penchant for banking shares  take a long position in such stocks  But  before we select such super banks  let us look at what s plaguing the industry 
Deutsche Bank Woes
Concerns about Deutsche Bank s liquidity rattled investors  sentiment  The German lender endured questions like whether it will be able to withstand the cost of any settlement with the U S  Department of Justice  The bank needs to settle civil claims  which are related to the sale of structured mortgage bonds during the 2008 2009 financial crisis  German Chancellor Angela Merkel had already refused to offer state aid to the giant lender 
According to a   handful of hedge funds that clear derivatives through the bank had already withdrawn excess cash and positions  while back in June  the International Monetary Fund had described Deutsche Bank as the greatest threat to the global financial system  In fact  the German lender plunged more than 40  this year as investors remain worried about the institution s thin capital cushion  read more    
Wells Fargo Scam
Wells Fargo added to the mistrust after it was accused of creating fake accounts that led to its CEO John Stumpf s resignation  The bank was accused of cross selling  in which it created around 2 million unauthorized customer accounts to achieve its sales goal 
In fact  cross selling have become a common thing for the entire banking system  Federal regulators and policymakers opine that Wells Fargo is not the only bank which is engaged in cross selling  read more    
When it comes to deceitful practices  Massachusetts  finance regulator has also charged Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   for being  dishonest and unethical  that put pressure on brokers to sell loans to their clients  read more    
Fed Minutes  Fails to Confirm Rate Hike
Minutes from the Fed s September meeting  meantime  showed that policy makers were divided in opinion over the timing of a rate hike  They kept a hike on hold last month despite a  reasonable argument  for an increase  While some officials called for a rate hike  relatively soon   others wanted to see further progress toward full employment and faster inflation 
Ahead of the release of the minutes  New York Fed President Bill Dudley had said that  slack  in the labor market was a reason that the central bank hasn t been more aggressive in raising rates  Even though it is widely expected that the Fed will hike rates after the U S  presidential elections  traders believe there is a mere 9  chance of a hike in the month of November  read more

125464,346979,NTRS,Northern Trust  NTRS  Tops Q2 Earnings  Expenses Rise,opinion,"Northern Trust Corporation  NASDAQ NTRS   delivered a positive earnings surprise of around 1  in the second quarter 2016 on higher revenues  Earnings per share came in at  1 06  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Moreover  the reported figure compared favorably with  1 01 per share in the year ago quarter 
	Results were primarily driven by higher revenues  The quarter also witnessed a rise in assets under custody  However  on the flip side  results exhibited escalating operating expenses and decreased assets under management 
	Including certain non recurring items  net income came in at  260 7 million or  1 09 as compared with  269 2 million or  1 10 in the prior year quarter 







Top line Grows  High Costs
	Total revenue for the second quarter came in at  1 32 billion  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 22 billion  Moreover  the reported figure was up 5  year over year  due to a rise in non interest as well as net interest income 
	On a fully taxable equivalent basis  Northern Trust reported net interest income of  306 6 million  up 19  year over year  This was driven by increased levels of average earning assets 
	Net interest margin  NIM  was 1 16   up 16 basis points from 1 00  in the prior year quarter  The increase mainly reflected higher yields on earning assets 
	Non interest income grew 1  from the year ago quarter to  1 02 billion  The key catalysts for the rise were improvement in trust  investment and other servicing fees  which came on the back of new businesses and reduced money market fee waivers  slightly offset by the unfavorable effects of equity markets and movements in foreign exchange rates  However  the company recorded a decline in foreign exchange trading income and treasury management fees 
	Non interest expenses were up 8  year over year to  925 million in the quarter  The rise was mainly due to an elevation in all components of expenses  partially counteracted by reduced employee benefits Assets Under Management and Custody
	As of Jun 30  2016  Northern Trust s total assets under custody increased 3  year over year to  6 35 trillion while total assets under management decreased 4  to  906 2 billion Credit Quality  A Mixed Bag
	Northern Trust s overall asset quality was a mixed bag during the quarter  Total allowance for credit losses were  227 1 million  down 17  year over year  Further  non performing assets fell 23 9  year over year to  166 4 million as of Jun 30  2016   
	Also  net charge offs were  2 4 million  down from  2 6 million in the prior year quarter figure  However  provision credit was  3 0 million in the quarter while it was   10 million in the prior year quarter Strong Capital Position
	Northern Trust s capital ratios remained strong  Under the Advanced Approach  as of Jun 30  2016  Tier 1 capital ratio  total capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio were 12 0   13 5  and 7 4  respectively  each exceeding the regulatory requirements 
	During the second quarter 2016  Northern Trust repurchased 1 97 million shares for  140 8 million at an average price of  71 52 per share Our Viewpoint
	Results of Northern Trust display a decent performance considering the quarter s challenging backdrop with volatile markets and global concerns  We remain optimistic by the continued growth in assets under custody  revenues and an improving credit quality  However  increase in expenses might pose a threat to its profitability  Further  the new regulations could put strain on the company s fundamentals

 By Natsuko Waki
 LONDON  Jan 22  Reuters    World stocks rose from this
week s 7 week low on Thursday as banking shares recovered after
a heavy sell off  while European government bonds tumbled on
concerns the countries may borrow more to boost the economy 
 The yen rose towards a 13 1 2 year high against the dollar
and a seven year peak versus the euro  while sterling fell again
towards the previous day s 23 year low against the dollar 
 Wall Street jumped from a two month low on Wednesday  helped
by surprisingly healthy earnings reports from IBM and Apple and
financials including Northern Trust  the custody bank and asset
manager 
 In Europe  major gainers were banking and energy stocks 
  The market is yo yoing again  The good news is it hasn t
touched new lows  and all the bad news is already priced in  
said Marc Touati  chief economist at Global Equities in Paris 
MSCI world equity index rose 1 percent  having hit its
weakest since early December on Wednesday 
 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares rose
2 1 percent  Emerging stocks rose 0 9 percent

major currencies 
 
 GOVERNMENT DEBT CONCERNS
 Government bonds were under pressure across the board as
investors unwound safer trades as stocks rebounded 
 Also pressuring sovereign debt is concerns that the
governments would have to borrow huge amounts to help fund their
package designed to support the economy  
 The euro zone s second largest economy  France  will issue
up to 7 5 billion euros of new 2010  2011 and 2014 paper  as
well as up to 1 billion euros of inflation proof securities 
 Worries about fiscal balance have driven the cost of
insuring sovereign debt of many major economies to record highs
in recent sessions  according to credit default swaps data 
 Investors are also demanding more compensation to hold less
liquid euro zone debt than benchmark German government bonds 
 Spreads of French 10 year bonds over German Bunds are around
60 basis points  their widest since the introduction of the
euro 
 Portugal became the third euro zone economy this year to be

125477,346992,NTRS,GLOBAL ECONOMY WEEKAHEAD Arresting the free fall in global trade,news,"By Emily Kaiser
 WASHINGTON  April 5  Reuters    If recent signs of life in
the global economy are for real  we should soon start to see
some stabilization in world trade too 
 The collapse in trade since Lehman Brothers imploded last
September has shocked even veteran economists  and alarmed
world leaders so much that they committed  250 billion to
support trade financing at last week s Group of 20 summit 
  I am terrified by the numbers I have seen so far on
trade   said Uri Dadush  a senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace and former director of
international trade for the World Bank   I am truly taken aback
by the speed and the breadth of this decline  
 At the Port of Long Beach in California  where a large
portion of U S  imports from Asia land  the number of
containers arriving in February dropped 43 percent from a year
earlier  Exports  which kept rising last year long after
imports faded  fell 37 percent 
 That would suggest this week s trade reports may be grim
reading  The United States  Germany  China and Britain are all
scheduled to release monthly figures  and economists polled by
Reuters expect the data to confirm that exports are hurting all
over the world 
 Trade is typically one of the later economic indicators to
rebound  which is why these reports are likely to stay ugly
even when some other readings are suggesting the severity of
the global economy s downturn may be starting to ease 
 The plight of global trade  which the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said was in  free fall  
clearly illustrates how the global upheaval has claimed
casualties well beyond the financial sector 
 Countries whose banks never touched the sort of souring
assets that dragged down the rich world nevertheless have
suffered steep declines in exports  which in turn is curbing
domestic production and demand 
 Over the last five months alone  the world economy has lost
15 percent of its industrial production  said Hans Timmer  a
World Bank economist 
  That is really unheard of that it happened so suddenly  
he said   It happened in every country  It happened in the
high income countries and it happened in the developing
countries  
 THE NEW NORMAL
 Outside of trade  there have been some indications that the
worst of the global recession may be over  and that has spurred
stock markets worldwide 
 Recent surveys of factory activity in the United States 
Europe and China have recovered from record lows  and U S 
consumers have resumed buying more than just the basics 
 China in particular has shown promising signs that a  585
billion government spending program is reviving growth  China s
manufacturing sector expanded in March for the first time since
September  New export orders still showed contraction but
improved from the previous month 
 China s trade report  which may come as early as Friday 
bears close watching to see whether it confirms those upbeat
readings  Some economists aren t yet convinced 
  For all the energy of China s export recovery  few
countries are showing any increased import demand these days 
and those countries that supply China with economic inputs have
not been bragging about a recovery in sales   said James
Pressler  an economist with Northern Trust 
 Still  China s trade data is especially useful because its
report will cover March  while the U S   German and British
reports are for February and therefore provide less real time
insight into whether the recession is truly easing 
 Even when the global slump ends  trade may not resume its
pre crisis trajectory any time soon  As President Barack Obama
pointed out to fellow world leaders last week  the days of the
 voracious  U S  consumer underpinning strong growth are
probably over 
 Consulting group AlixPartners recently polled 5 000 U S 
consumers to see whether the current crisis had long term
implications for their spending plans 
 The result was that Americans said their spending will
return to just 86 percent of pre recession levels  which would
work out to a drop of 10 percent  or about  1 4 trillion  in
annual gross domestic product 
  The future size and shape of virtually every business in
America as well as those businesses that export goods to
America rests upon a simple equation    how much Americans
think they need to save versus how much they think they can
afford to spend   said AlixPartners Chief Executive Fred
Crawford 
  It would appear that this recession has dramatically
altered the mindset of Americans vis a vis that equation

125478,346993,NTRS,WRAPUP 1 New U S  homes inventories plummet,news,"  New home sales drop 0 6 percent
   Inventories of homes plummet
   Durable goods orders slip 0 8 percent
 By Lisa Lambert
 WASHINGTON  April 24  Reuters    The inventory of new U S 
homes for sale at the end of the March plummeted at a record
pace  government data showed on Friday  bringing a glimmer of
hope of improvement in the housing market even as data on
durable goods sales showed weakness in the economy as a whole 
  Housing is probably forming a bottom  because even the
supply of homes  the inventories  declined   said Asha
Bangalore  an economist with Northern Trust in Chicago   I
think the housing market is stabilizing  
 The stock of new homes shrank to 311 000 from 328 000 in
February  That left the supply of homes available for sale at
10 7 months  worth  compared to February s 11 2 months 
 The Commerce Department said the monthly change in
inventories  of 5 2 percent  was the largest drop in more than
45 years and the year on year plunge of 33 7 percent was the
largest on record 
 Builders appear to be burning through their supply and
holding off on adding to their stocks  A separate Commerce
Department report on Friday showed that applications for
permits to build new homes dropped 8 5 percent in March from
February and were off 44 6 percent from March 2008 
 Sales of new homes dropped 0 6 percent in March  according
to the Commerce Department  but February sales were much
stronger than originally thought  with the report showing they
rose 8 2 percent  compared to the 4 7 percent gain previously
registered 
  What we are seeing on a moving average basis is a gradual
improvement from very low numbers in new home sales   said Kurt
Karl  chief U S  economist for Swiss Re in New York   It s not
taking off like a rocket  but it s not looking to be heading
south either  
 U S  equity indexes extended their gains after the report
was released  while U S  Treasury debt prices fell 
 The March drop brought home sales to a 356 000 annual pace 
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast sales at 340 000 
The median sales price for a new home fell to  201 400 from
 208 700 in February  The average price  however  rose slightly
to  258 000 from  255 100 
 Still  a separate report on new orders for long lasting
manufactured goods in March showed the recession that has
ground on for more than a year in the United States may not yet
be abating 
  It confirms that conditions in the economy remain weak 
the economy is still contracting  but it suggests it s doing so
at a slower pace  which is something that we have seen from a
number of indicators   said Anna Piretti  senior economist at
BNP Paribas in New York 
 According to the Commerce Department  U S  durables goods
orders fell 0 8 percent  which was much slimmer than the 1 5
percent drop analysts polled by Reuters were expecting 
 Orders have now fallen for seven months out of the last
eight  the Commerce Department said  The sole rise in that
period  in February  was revised to 2 1 percent from the 3 5
percent previously reported 
 Non defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft  a
closely watched proxy for business spending  gained 1 5 percent
in March after rising 4 3 percent in February 
 Transportation equipment orders experienced the largest
drop in March  the Commerce Department said  falling 1 4
percent to  37 9 billion  That category has now dropped for
five of the last six months 
 Jack Bauer  a senior economist at Manning   Napier in
Rochester  New York  said the key to economic recovery would
not be found in orders for manufactured goods 
  You want to see the financial sector stabilize   he said 
 That is the first thing you would need to see the economy
improve

125479,346994,NTRS,BoNY  Northern Trust vie for Lloyds unit  sources,news,"  Sale agreement expected in next few weeks
   Insight 3rd party business to fetch up to 250 million pounds
 
 By Victoria Howley and Joel Dimmock
 LONDON  Aug 3  Reuters    Bank of New York Mellon and Northern Trust are late stage rivals
to buy the bulk of Insight  one of Lloyds Banking Group s asset management businesses  people
familiar with the matter said on Monday 
 Both have entered binding bids for the third party asset management business of Insight 
It is expected to sell in the next couple of weeks for between 230 million and 250 million
pounds   385 million to  419 million   the people said 
 It was not clear if another potential buyer  private equity firm Hellman   Friedman 
remained in the auction  H F  which owns fund manager Gartmore  had offered less than 200
million pounds  another person said 
 Two other potential buyers  Affiliated Managers Group and British fund manager Schroders 
were earlier looking at the business but decided against continuing with their bids  two of
the people said 
 The process is being driven by Insight Chief Executive Abdallah Nauphal  who does not want
the business to be absorbed into a larger fund management group  sources have said 
 Insight is valued for its liability driven investment  LDI  business  designed to align
investment strategy with future pension liabilities    a potential growth area but one with
relatively low margins 
 As at March 31  Insight had total assets under management of 116 6 billion pounds 
including 70 billion pounds managed on behalf of third parties 
The sale of the unit is sensitive  as state backed Lloyds could face criticism over any
deal that involves job losses or is seen to enrich executives 
 Nauphal joined Insight as head of fixed income after the firm bought Rothschild Asset
Management in April 2003  He became chief executive in 2007 
 Insight became part of Lloyds after the bank acquired troubled mortgage lender HBOS last
year  The group  which reports half year results on Wednesday  also owns Scottish Widows
Investment Partnership and decided earlier this year to keep the units separate in
anticipation of a possible sale 
 Lloyds declined to comment  Insight  Nauphal and the other companies involved declined to
comment

 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK  June 3  Reuters    Wall Street stocks slid on
Friday and the dollar tumbled after U S  jobs growth for May
came in way below market expectations  heightening worries that
the world s largest economy is in a protracted slowdown 
 Other stock markets were flat to down slightly 
 However  a report showing encouraging expansion in the U S 
services sector  one of the few bright spots in a week
inundated with gloomy data  helped trim losses in equity and
commodity markets 
 The euro hit a one month high against the dollar on news
that international aid would be available for Greece as early
as next month 
 Stock and oil prices traded off their lows after the
Institute for Supply Management noted a modest recovery in the
U S  services sector in May from April s slump

about  650 billion in assets under management   I don t think
that s a surprise

 The Labor Department said the U S  jobless rate rose to 9 1
percent in May as high energy prices and the effects of Japan s
earthquake bogged down the economy 
 Closely watched nonfarm payrolls increased 54 000 last
month  Private employment rose 83 000  the smallest amount
since June  while government payrolls dropped 29 000 
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected payrolls to rise
150 000 and private hiring to increase 175 000 in May  The
government revised employment figures for March and April to
show 39 000 fewer jobs created than previously estimated 
 Wall Street s benchmark S P 500  was down about 0 4

mid April earlier  For the week  it was poised to close about
2 5 percent lower  marking a fifth straight week of declines 
 While some fund managers brooded over the depressing jobs
report  others were looking ahead 
  People have come to the conclusion that the economy is in
a slow patch right now  and people are trying to figure out how
temporary this slower growth is    whether it s actually a
change or a bump in the road for the recovery  and right now
it s a bump in the road   said Giri Cherukuri  head trader at
Oakbrook Investments in Lisle  Illinois 
 Some wondered whether the Federal Reserve will send more
cheap money their way to extend support given to markets since
the financial crisis 
  It doesn t matter what the reality is  it matters what the
perception is  and the perception is that QE3 will at least be
debated again instead of being tossed on the fire   said Dennis
Gartman  author of a markets commentary letter 
 The Fed s  600 billion bond buying program  known in the
market as QE2  is scheduled to end this month  The program had
flooded financial markets with dollars since October  driving

 U S  crude oil  was down 0 2 percent  returning above
the  100 per barrel level  It fell 2 percent earlier on worries
that any further erosion of the U S  labor market would hit
consumer spending  reducing fuel demand 
 The benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury note  was up
8 32  its yield at 3 0023 percent 
 Ten year Treasury yields fell below 3 percent this week for
the first time since December as investors became wary about
the near term economic outlook 
 The euro surged to a one month high against the dollar

Fastenal Company  NASDAQ FAST 
Fastenal pulled back hard in October with the market  It then had an equally fast bounce before settling into a Head ans Shoulders top pattern  it broke below the neckline with a strong move lower in early February and nearly hit the price objective of at 39 10  falling just 10 cents short  Price action since February has been a  W  bottom and it is testing resistance at the top of the  W  now  The RSI is bullish and rising while the MACD is also rising  both support a break through higher 
The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company  NASDAQ GT 
Goodyear Tire   Rubber is back at the resistance range that has held it 3 times in the past  This time it arrives after a series of higher lows  The RSI is in the bullish range and rising and the MACD is crossed up and rising  supporting upward price action 
Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS 
Northern Trust had a run higher through most of 2014 before a  W  that completed in February  After some consolidation it rose again and is now in a tightening consolidation  The Bollinger Bands  are pointing higher  allowing a move up  while the RSI is bullish and the MACD rising 
Novo Nordisk  COP NOVOb 
Novo Nordisk  consolidated through the end of 2014 and into the first two months of 2015  It started higher in March and has slowed the pace in a steady trend up since the beginning of April  against rising tend support  The MACD has been diverging lower while the RSI is bullish 
NXP Semiconductors NV  NASDAQ NXPI 
NXP Semiconductor jumped off of the October bottom into a consolidation zone in December  it took some baby steps higher in January and February before a gap higher  Since then it has consolidated again in a descending triangle  with a wide strong candle Friday that tested both ends of the triangle range  The RSI has turned back up after making a lower low while price made a higher low  a Positive RSI Reversal  The MACD is falling though 

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  heading into May sees the equity markets continuing to look better on the longer timeframe but a bit shakier on the shorter timeframe 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with a downward bias while Crude Oil continues higher  The US Dollar Index has pulled back to a critical level where a reversal could be expected but more downside a character change while US Treasuries continue to be biased lower  The Shanghai Composite may finally be consolidating in its uptrend while Emerging Markets are showing some downside risk due to a wider consolidation 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  ARCA SPY   iShares Russell 2000  ARCA IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts look a bit vulnerable in the short term despite the support and moves higher Friday  with the IWM the weakest and the SPY and QQQ in consolidation zones  The QQQ chart looks the best on the longer timeframe  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

125487,347002,NTRS,3 Numbers  Upbeat German Industrial Activity  EZ Sentiment  U S  Labour,opinion,"The key event for European economic news today is Germany s monthly update on industrial production  which follows last week s better than expected monthly gain in factory orders  Later  Sentix publishes a new estimate of investor sentiment for Europe  followed by the Federal Reserve s monthly release of its Labor Market Conditions Index for the US 
Germany  Industrial Production  06 00 GMT   April was a strong month for factory orders  the Economics Ministry reported last week  The surprisingly strong 1 4  gain vs  the previous month suggests that today s number for industrial production will follow suit  The Ministry suggested as much in a statement on Friday   that  German industry looks bound to experience a boost   Maybe  but business sentiment in the manufacturing sector suggests that today s numbers may not impress the crowd on par with factory orders  Markit s purchasing managers  index for manufacturers dipped to a three month low in May  which follows April s mild decline  The PMI is still signalling a modest degree of growth  but companies noted a further slowing of new order growth last month  Markit 
The hard numbers on factory orders for April paint a brighter profile  which raises the question of which data set s misleading us about the trend  Economists are voting on the side of optimism  Today s monthly release on industrial activity is on track to post a solid rebound in April vs  March s retreat  according to Econoday com s consensus forecast  The crowd s looking for a 0 6  monthly advance in output and a modest 0 8  rise for the year over year change Thinking positively aligns with the latest outlook from the Bundesbank  which raised its economic forecast  The central bank expects Germany s GDP will grow 1 7  this year  modestly higher than the previous 1 4  estimate   These are the first signs that the improvement in business sentiment in the Eurozone translated into higher demand and arrived in Germany   a Frankfurt based economist at UniCredit told Bloomberg on Friday  The question is whether today s numbers for industrial production agree 

Eurozone  Sentix Investor Sentiment  08 30 GMT   Speaking of sentiment  today s numbers from Sentix offer a fresh look at the mood in the investment community  One clue for thinking that we ll see a slightly softer number is the recent weakness in the German stock market  which continues to trend lower after its mid April peak The Eurozone recovery is still intact  but the drama that accompanied the initial revival in recent months has faded a bit  Now casting com s current estimate for second quarter GDP still projects a 0 5  quarter over quarter rise  which represents a slight improvement over Q1 s 0 4  advance  But Grexit risk is still lurking 
Meanwhile  the initial phase of euphoria that greeted the early days of renewed optimism that Europe was recovering has passed  The focus now turns to the hard work of building on the limited progress to date  The ongoing uncertainty bound up with Greece continues to weigh on the Eurozone  Last week the Greek government announced a delay on the repayment of an IMF loan and the deputy prime minister raised the possibility of new elections  It s just another chapter in the ongoing soap opera  but it s enough to keep the crowd guessing  In any case  it s not helping boost confidence that Europe s fragile recovery is about to accelerate  Given this backdrop  a degree of backsliding in Sentix s sentiment index shouldn t come as a surprise  The currency bloc s recovery will likely prevail  but for now it s still shaping up to be a sluggish rebound with no shortage of bumps along the way 
US  Labor Market Conditions Index  14 00 GMT  Payrolls rose more than expected in Friday s surprisingly strong payrolls report for May  The crowd was looking for a gain of 220 000 and instead the government advised that jobs increased by a much stronger 280 000 last month The news was interpreted by the Treasury market that the Federal Reserve would likely begin raising interest rates  perhaps as early as September  In the wake of the bullish report  the benchmark 10 year Treasury yield topped 2 40  on Friday for the first time since last October  The upbeat numbers on jobs for May  certainly brings a September rate increase into much clearer focus   Carl Tannenbaum  chief economist at Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  in Chicago Today s monthly release of the Fed s Labor Market Conditions Index will be a relatively sleepy affair by comparison  but this broad measure of 19 indicators is on track to deepen the case for anticipating a stronger run of economic growth 
Econoday com s consensus forecast calls for a rise to 2 3  the first positive reading since February  That s not particularly surprising at this point  but the news will provide more evidence that the US economy may be stronger than previously assumed

125488,347003,NTRS,Alternative Investments By The Numbers  Top 5 2015 YTD Takeaways ,opinion,"As the half way point of the year passes  we thought it would be a good time to take a look and see where things stand with the hedge fund and private equity markets  including five important takeaways from the first half of 2015 


Capital raising continues to be strong across all asset classes  Total hedge fund assets topped  2 94 trillion in Q1 with  18 2 billion in new capital allocated according to HFR  The majority of those assets  though  continue to go to the largest managers  with only 22 managers controlling 25  of all assets  In fact  almost 70  of all new capital went to firms with greater than  5 billion in AUM  This trend might be reversing though  as institutional investors are taking a closer look at smaller  upcoming managers  Indeed  63  of FoHFs made an allocation to a start up manager in 2014  With capital continuing to flow into the space  it s only logical that the new generation of managers look to step up to join the ranks of those truly global  institutional level players 
For 1H 2015  Preqin reported that private equity managers closed on  234 billion representing 457 funds vs    272 billion and 580 from the same time last year  Real estate fundraising fared well in the first half with  60 billion raised  However  like their private equity brethren  the lion s share of capital is being allocated to the largest managers  with mid market funds struggling to capture assets  This follows the trend of investors consolidating their private capital allocations into fewer managers with larger tickets  in the attempt to gain leverage on fee reduction as well as better transparency 
PE exits remain strong in 2015   less so for venture backed IPOs
PE exits are on track for a record breaking year  following the robust overall M A environment  With over  185 billion of deals completed in the first half  2015 could easily surpass 2014 s  264 billion  With higher interest rates on the horizon  corporate and sponsor activity continues unabated  driven by a potentially narrowing window as the Fed looks to increase the cost of capital later this year 
Venture backed IPOs  though  have not followed suit  While the overall IPO market was fairly healthy in the first half  only 17 of the 116 IPOs so far in 2015 were venture backed  With a plethora of private financing available  companies are less in need of taping into the public markets   and the associated complications of a public listing 

M A and valuations drive strong PE returns   hedge funds outpace the S P YTD
Increased valuations coupled with record breaking M A activity has fueled returns in the private equity and venture sectors  Venture  real estate and private equity posted returns of 21 5   14 1  and 11 3  respectively for the one year period ending 12 31 2014  according to Cambridge Associates  As noted earlier  exit opportunities for buyout funds remain healthy  with deal making robust across all capitalizations  Although the IPO market for venture backed companies has remained muted  higher late stage financing valuations  some would say too high  has allowed managers to mark their books accordingly  How this plays out for the rest of the year only time will tell  as companies flush with capital may well continue to delay their public market debuts 
Meanwhile  hedge fund indices have caught up to the equity markets as tracked by the S P 500  while easily outperforming the bond indices  as the potential for interest rates hikes from the Fed has dampened both liquidity and performance in the global fixed income markets  The CS Hedge Fund Index posted a 2 0  return YTD  with the S P coming in at 1 2   The equity L S index had the highest return across all hedge fund sectors at 3 5   Multi Strat was second highest at 3 2   The Barclays  LONDON BARC  Agg  by comparison  posted a  0 1   Trend following strategies fared the worst in the second quarter as geopolitical concerns  as well as the downturn in the Chinese markets  bumped up volatility considerably  Low beta strategies obviously fared better given this environment 

Liquid alternatives are here to stay 
With over 73  of financial advisors using some form of alternative investments in their clients  portfolios  the  240 billion invested in  liquid alts  at the end of 2014 is estimated to grow to  1 2 trillion by 2018  109 new funds launched in 2014  with 57 new launches so far in 2015  according to DailyAlts  This torrid growth may slow  however  with the rise of a number of online platforms designed to give RIAs and wealth managers access to non traded hedge and private equity funds  Firms like iCapital Network  CAIS  Artivest  Venovate and ACE Portal have begun to attract interest from the HNW community for their lower minimums and easier access  How these firms are able to engage the investor community successfully and validate their business models remains to be seen  however 
Investors are still not satisfied with the level of transparency they are getting from their managers  
There is a major disconnect in the hedge fund industry as to what managers perceive as proper transparency and what investors think  In fact  55  of investors would like more information from their managers while 98  of managers themselves think their investors  information needs are complete  according to Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS   Clearly  finding some kind of middle ground between investors and managers is needed ",2015-07-24,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/alternative-investments-by-the-numbers:-top-5-2015-ytd-takeaways-259327,259327
125489,347004,NTRS,A Fed Rate Hike In September  No Yes Maybe ,opinion,"Treasury yields held on to their modest rebound this week through Thursday s close  ahead of the Federal Reserve  that begins today in Jackson Hole  Wyoming  No doubt the discussions will center on whether the central bank will begin raising interest rates at its Sept  16 17 policy meeting  Earlier this week  New York Fed chief Bill Dudley threw cold water on the prospects for tightening next month   that the case for a rate hike looked  less compelling  relative to two weeks earlier  The catalyst for his cautious view  of course  is the recent market turbulence  But in the wake of this week s  it s not obvious that the macro trend is stumbling for the world s largest economy  even if Mr  Market s hysterics of late suggest otherwise   The United States relies more than any other developed economy on demand within our own borders   the chief economist at Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS   The New York Times   While the focus in the past three weeks has been on international instability  this should position us to withstand the consequences of recent market volatility   explains Carl Tannenbaum 
The Treasury market appears to agree reluctantly  cautiously and ever so gently this week  After the benchmark 10 year yield briefly dipped below 2  on Monday on an intraday basis the lowest level since late April the rate has bounced back  settling at 2 18  yesterday  Aug  27   according to Treasury gov data  That s just below the level that prevailed before the latest selling wave began a week ago  In short  the key Treasury yield has effectively dismissed this week s market turbulence as noise 

Ditto for the 2 year yield  which is considered the most sensitive spot on the yield curve for rate expectations  The hefty U turn for this maturity in recent days suggests that the market s not yet willing to completely dismiss the idea of raising rates at next month s Fed meeting  It s still a long shot  or so the  is telling us as of Aug  27  Yet it s also clear that the odds for squeezing are a bit higher compared with this past Monday  when markets were in free fall 
Kansas City Fed President Esther George is certainly inclined to pull the trigger next month  although she s a non voting member of the committee that sets interest rates and so her comments fall into the category of theoretical  In any case  she  on Wednesday that

Policy makers are always trying to divine whether the forecast should adjust because of what they ve seen  I think you have to be particularly careful when markets move  whether that is a signal of something more fundamental or whether it is a readjustment of some sort 
This week s events complicate the picture but I think it s too soon to say it fundamentally changes that picture  so in my own view  the normalization process needs to begin and the economy is performing in a way that I think it s prepared to take that 

Nonetheless  it s unlikely that any hard decisions will be made one way or the other before next week s employment report for August hits the streets on Sep  4  Yesterday s encouraging slide on new jobless claims for last week s tally suggests that the labor market is still poised to grow at a 200 000 plus rate this month  Yet it s not obvious that this news alone  assuming it s confirmed  will suffice to convince the Fed to start tightening next month 
Recent updates suggest that the US economy will continue to grow  although the Atlanta Fed s  is currently projecting a sharp slowdown in third quarter GDP growth to 1 4  vs   But it s still early for this quarter s hard data and so it s possible we ll see upward revisions for the near term outlook 
Meantime  keep your eye on the  which has been creeping higher lately  Economist Bob Dieli at  pointed out this upward trend  wondering if it s a clue of the Fed s efforts for laying the groundwork for tightening  That s a thin reed for seeing a rate hike next month  although if this rate continues to rise  it may be a sign that there s a major attitude adjustment coming for decisions regarding Sep  16 17 
The bottom line  there s still enough skepticism about the US macro outlook to argue that it s premature to raise the Fed s target rate  The problem  however  is that the economic case for hiking will remain debatable for the foreseeable future if we re using historical metrics that were relevant and widely accepted prior to the Great Recession  In the post crisis world  however  the trend is weaker  which raises the critical question  Are the standards for tightening policy different  Yes  or so it seems  until  or if  Janet Yellen and company tell us otherwise ",2015-08-28,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-fed-rate-hike-in-september-no…yes…maybe-263318,263318
125490,347005,NTRS,The World s Safest Banks,opinion,"Not long ago  my colleague  Alan Gula  wrote that the U S  banking system was the envy of the world 
Is this right  Well  it all depends on how you measure banks  After all  there are many ways to peel an onion 
As anyone in finance or economics knows  ranking banks is always controversial  as there are many tools to use   and it can be forever argued which of those tools holds more weight  Alan s article  based on their tangible common equity  TCE  ratios 
Another tool is  
In order to be named one of Global Finance s 50 safest banks in 2015  financial institutions must hold two credit ratings of at least AA  and one no lower than A   or an equivalent combination from among the three major international credit rating agencies  Moody s  Fitch  and Standard   Poor s  
Furthermore  each qualifying institution must be among the 500 largest banks in the world by assets 
Eligible banks are then scored based on their rating  with 10 points awarded for an AAA rating down to one point for a BBB  rating  If a bank is rated by only two of the agencies  an implied score for the third rating is created by taking an average of the other two scores and then deducting one point 
Finally  banks that are wholly owned by other banks aren t eligible  If multiple banks score the same number  they re further ranked by asset size as of the end of 2014  This approach underscores the strong positive correlation between a bank s high credit ratings and its size 
Here are the highlights from the Global Finance 2015 report 
The safest bank in the world is in Germany  With assets of  594 billion  KfW reigns supreme  taking the No  1 position with an AAA rating from all three agencies 
Three other banks were also awarded AAA ratings across the board  Switzerland s Zurcher Kantonalbank   2   Germany s Landwirtschaftlich Rentenbank   3  and Germany s Landeskreditbank Baden Wurttemberg   Forderbank   4  
The three S  banks that made the cut were AgriBank Securities JSC  HN AGR    30   FinecoBank Banca Fineco SpA  MI FBK   45   and AgFirst   50  
European banks dominate  accounting for 22 of the top 50  In fact  government owned banks or those with ties to state or regional authorities occupy the first nine places on the list 
Other countries with multiple listings include Canada  six   Australia  four   and the Gulf States  three   but none from other Middle Eastern nations or sub Saharan Africa made the list  One Chilean bank  BancoEstado  48   represented the only Latin American bank 
Emerging Market Banks
Other bank safety studies had a regional focus  In the North American top 10 study  Canadian banks hold the first three places  Only four U S  banks made the list   the three mentioned above plus U S  Bancorp   10  
A further study lists the top 50 safest banks in the emerging markets  One A rating and two A  were sufficient to ensure inclusion in this study  Here  banks based in the GCC  Gulf Cooperation Council  and Asian nations represented 44 of the 50  with the GCC holding 23 spots  In Asia  Korean banks held nine positions and Chinese banks held eight 
The National Bank of Abu Dhabi is ranked No  1 here and is the only one to hold three AA ratings  no banks on the list hold a rating higher than AA  
The reason being  many large banking systems in emerging markets   such as those in Brazil  India  Russia  and Turkey   are penalized by being in countries with low sovereign credit rankings  In practice  a bank s rating can t exceed its country s sovereign rating  Middle East countries are generally investment grade 
Note that Global Finance performs country by country bank rankings that provide insight on a far larger range of banks   with the exception of some countries where there are information gaps  such as Laos  Honduras  and parts of sub Saharan Africa and the Middle East 
U S  Fares Better in Commercial Bank Study
Another Global Finance study ranked the 50 safest commercial banks for 2015 
This study is made up of financial institutions not majority owned by a government or state agency  with all other criteria being the same  For the second year in a row  Canada s Toronto Dominion Bank  TO TD  ranks No  1 
Here  the U S  had a bigger presence  eight banks  than the other studies  In addition to the four U S  banks mentioned above were BNY Melon   33   Wells Fargo  N WFC    41   State Street   43   and Northern Trust  O NTRS    45  
Lastly  when looking at the 50 biggest global banks by size  European banks make up the largest geographic group  with 21 banks from eight different countries  The U S   by contrast  holds seven spots 
The combined total assets of all 50 were just shy of  69 trillion at the end of 2014  The increase in size of Chinese banks was offset by a decline in eurozone banks  as the euro lost 10  of its value against the U S  dollar  Japanese banks also faced a similar devaluation 
Note that a rating isn t a recommendation to purchase  sell  or hold a security  If  however  you re looking to hold the debt of one or a group of financial institutions  it s always important to know the appropriate rate of return for the risk being taken 
Needless to say  a number of macro economic factors this year  particularly the strengthening U S  dollar and the sharp drop in crude oil prices  should make for quite an interesting study in 2016

125491,347006,NTRS,Treasury Yields Reflect Macro Worry,opinion,"Treasury yields have made a sharp U turn lately  The 2 year yield considered the most sensitive to rate expectations has been sliding this month  falling to 0 90  yesterday  Jan  14   based on daily data via Treasury gov  That s the lowest in about a month  The benchmark 10 year yield has lost even more ground  slipping to 2 10  the lowest since late October 
The softer yields so far this year reflect renewed worry about a variety of factors that may weigh on economic growth in the US and around the world  The short list includes concern about China s economy  ongoing instability in the Middle East  and a fresh round of concern that the US recovery has decelerated  again 

Market based inflation expectations are in retreat again too  The implied estimate via the yield spread on the conventional 10 year Treasury less its inflation indexed counterpart has been bumping along at 1 43  in recent days the lowest since late September and well below the Federal Reserve s 2  target for inflation 

The counterpoint to all this  the US economy doesn t appear to be sliding into a recession  based on the current numbers  see yesterday s analysis for details   Nonetheless  growth has softened lately  perhaps sharply  The Atlanta Fed s GDPNow model projects that fourth quarter GDP growth weakened to just 0 8   as of Jan  8  less than half the rate in Q2 
A new survey by The Wall Street Journal highlights the current state of macro 

Most economists think the American economy will continue to expand  but weakness abroad is heightening their concern about U S  growth  Forecasters in The Wall Street Journal s latest survey of economists say there is a 17  chance the U S  will enter recession in the next year  the highest risk in three years  And 80  of forecasters said they see risks to the economy to the downside 

But if there s reason for concern  there was no sign of distress in the US stock market yesterday  The S P 500 surged nearly 1 7  on Thursday  albeit after previously falling sharply since the start of the year 
One fundamental reason for thinking that US growth will endure and perhaps pick up  the upbeat data in the labor market in recent months  The three month average for growth in private payrolls through last month is a robust 276 000 the strongest gain for that rolling time frame since January 
The healthy gain in job creation implies that anticipated soft patch in last year s fourth quarter will give way to firmer comparisons in 2016 s first half  The Treasury market  however  is skeptical 
Economists at Northern Trust  O NTRS  this week labeled current conditions as a  Tale of Two Economies  

U S  economic growth appears to have shifted to a lower gear in the final months of 2015  It has left many concerned about the well being of the economy and raised questions about the Federal Reserve s recent hike of the policy rate  In this context  it is important to note that the recent slowing reflects a lopsided development not a widespread deceleration of economic activity 

Northern Trust s Carl Tannenbaum and Asha Bangalore add that favorable  domestic fundamentals support hiring and consumer spending trends   As a result  they predict that  the fourth quarter deceleration is most likely a passing event  with growth predicted to pick up in 2016  
Yesterday s stock market action certainly supports their outlook  The question is whether the Treasury market will fall in line with the outlook for an acceleration in growth  That may be a tall order  given the weakness in China  which favors a risk off environment that s likely to keep demand for Treasuries high and yields low  Until the crowd s convinced that China s recent turbulence has passed and the macro outlook is stable  the global demand for the safe haven of Treasuries will remain firm 
 The market perception of China remains fragile and the pressures on emerging markets remain significant   Guillaume Tresca  a strategist at Credit Agricole  PA CAGR  in Paris  tells Bloomberg   It is still not yet time for an EM turnaround as the uncertainties lingering ahead are still numerous  ",2016-01-15,James Picerno,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/treasury-yields-fall-in-the-new-year,-reflecting-macro-worry-380204",380204
125493,347008,NTRS,U S  Stock Market Climbing Out Of A Hole,opinion,"The US stock market continued to climb out of a hole yesterday  The S P 500 closed at its highest level so far this year  Yesterday s rise comes a day after the Federal Reserve decided to hold off on rate hikes  citing increased macro risks here and abroad  But if equities are reacting positively to revived expectations for keeping interest rates lower for longer  is the commensurate rise in the Treasury market s inflation forecast a potential spoiler for the newly minted party in the stock market 
The Treasury market s 10 year inflation estimate based on the 10 year nominal yield less its inflation indexed counterpart is holding near a three month high of 1 57   as of Mar  17  via daily data from Treasury gov  The implied inflation forecast via the 5 year maturities is even firmer  ticking up to 1 46  yesterday the highest since last summer 
It s no surprise that the market s pricing in higher inflation expectations  again  Earlier this week the government reported that core consumer inflation prices excluding energy and food inched up to a 2 31  annual pace in February  marking the highest increase in nearly eight years  blue line in chart below   Headline inflation is still weak  running at around 1  on a year over year basis  red line   But if core CPI s track record as a relatively reliable predictor of headline inflation holds up  pricing pressures are set to firm up in the months ahead 


 There s absolutely no denying that there are inflationary pressures   Tom Porcelli  chief U S  economist at RBC Capital Markets   Bloomberg on Wednesday the day before the central bank s monetary announcement   The Fed can no longer be dismissive on inflation  They re going to have to raise their inflation forecast  
Perhaps  but the outlook for inflation in Thursday s  from the Fed revealed a slightly lower forecast for personal consumption expenditures  PCE  inflation on a headline basis for this year and in 2017  For instance  the median forecast for headline PCE inflation is on track to rise 1 2  in 2016  down from the December s 1 6  estimate 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen  speaking at Thursday s press conference  suggested that the recent rise in inflation pressures may be transitory   Core inflation  which excludes energy and food prices  has also picked up  although it remains to be seen if this firming will be sustained   she   In particular  the earlier declines in energy prices and appreciation of the dollar could well continue to weigh on overall consumer prices  
The Treasury market  by contrast  is raising its implied inflation outlook  What s more  the stock market is fine with that view  As you can see in the chart below  the S P 500 s recent rally has been tightly correlated with the Treasury market s rising inflation forecast  It s been a roller coaster for year overall  with equities tumbling when inflation expectations collapsed to seven year lows at one point last month  But the sharp reversal in recent weeks in expected pricing pressure has been accompanied by a hefty rise in the S P 500 off the mid February lows 


The question is how long will higher inflation expectations inspire the equity bulls  At some point  higher inflation will force the Fed s hand and unleash a new round of rate hikes  Assuming  of course  that economic growth holds up  Otherwise  we re talking about stagflation higher inflation without a commensurate increase in output  Putting that possibility aside for now  let s assume that modest growth endures and inflation creeps higher  At what point will equity optimists rethink the case for raising stock prices in line with firming inflation 
There s probably still room to run on that front  courtesy of the still low inflation data  But core CPI has been running above the Fed s 2  target for three months and there appears to be a modest but persistent upside tailwind blowing  Is this another head fake or an early sign of regime change 
No one knows the answer at this point  but if inflation continues to surprise on the upside there may be a new round of volatility lurking in the near term future  As Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  economist Carl Tannenbaum noted earlier this week   if we got to a point where the Fed had to raise  rates  quickly  it could be very destabilizing  ",2016-03-18,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-stock-market-likes-higher-inflation…-for-now-200122088,200122088
125497,347012,NTRS,Data Exploitation For Asset Managers  A Survey And White Paper,opinion,"A new survey sponsored by Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS  suggests that asset managers need to capture more value from available data  and that in order to do so they need both a more flexible strategy and stronger leadership than many now have 
The surveyors talked to more than 200 executives in insurance companies and asset managers  in both the United States and Europe  About half of the respondents were based in the United States  about 15 percent in the United Kingdom  Slicing it differently  about half of them work for firms with assets under management of more than  5 billion 
Only 13 percent of their respondents thought that they do successfully capture the full value of their data 
 Whether they are looking for ways to manage their investment decisions  monitor their risks  or improve their reporting  they need to extract more value from their data to gain actionable insights   said Pete Cherecwich  America s Head of Corporate and Institutional Services at Northern Trust  in a statement accompanying release of the survey 

The white paper attributes one trenchant summary of the field to Ugo Catterina  Senior Vice President and Head of U S  Internal Audit at Allianz  DE ALVG  Asset Management   If you don t have a solid strategy and you consider everything at the same level  there is no prioritization  and the ensuing mayhem makes it exceedingly difficult to find direction in this ocean of data  
Droughts and Floods are Both Bad 
The sheer volume of data now available has exploded  especially in the last five years  Data about individual securities performance  for example  or the trading patterns of investment professionals  has been tracked much more effectively in recent years than ever before  This explosion requires that prioritization Catterina referenced  Priorities in turn follow from a strategy  Such a strategy may incorporate several goals  among them  improving investment decisions  managing risks  modelling or otherwise assessing risks  improving internal reporting  managing cost  improving external reporting  In order to execute strategy and achieve such goals  the data handlers of the investing institution require effective leadership 
A majority of the respondents to the survey expect to be spending more money and time on data three years from now than they are at present  Fortunately  a majority believe that their return on investment in this area will increase over those three years  In the words of Dan Shoenholz  Managing Director of Parthenon EY Strategy Services  Ernst   Young LLP   We ve seen a lot of investment in the last few years in costly infrastructure to enable data analytics   and we re on the cusp of seeing more activity in the integration and utilization of this information  
Does one hand know what the other hand knows  This is one problem discussed in the white paper  an organization receives data from a lot of different directions  into a number of different internal organs  with different formats  collected for different purposes 
The Greatest Difficulties 
Surveyors asked the asset managers what they thought were the three greatest difficulties on getting and sharing data  The graph below shows the percentage of respondents who listed each of the listed problems as one of those top three

125514,347029,NTRS,Bernanke Says  08  Worse Than Great Depression ,opinion,"The is based on a Wall Streeet Journal  Real Time Economics   on Tuesday after after Ben Bernanke testified in the AIG litigation recently 
I think former Fed Chair Bernanke was right in concluding that 2008 s recession  if left to run its course  would have been a far greater calamity for the US economy than the Great Depression  but for different reasons 
1   The money markets and the commercial paper market was at real risk of failure  which means that S P 500 companies couldn t have rolled short term  high quality CP 
2   Far more Americans through 401 k  s and pensions had exposure to the stock and bond markets than Americans had in the late 1920 s and early 1930 s 
3   A 70 year bull market in home prices came to a crashing halt    the first national real estate depressions since the 1930 s  While the US economy was thought to be a primarily agrarian economy during the Great Depression  single family homes as a percentage of household net worth would have been far greater in 2007   2008 than in the 1930 s 
4   The truly shocking action for me wasn t the Lehman default or even the Bear Stearns default  but the drop in Northern Trust s  NASDAQ NTRS  and State Street s  NYSE STT  stock in late September  early October  2008  Northern Trust traded up to  88 in September  08 only to collapse to  33 within a two week time frame  NTRS and STT are  global custodian  banks and thus are huge custodians  recordkeepers  for corporate pension plans and such  with far bigger assets in custody and administration than assets under management  If The Reserve Fund had broken the buck  there would be have been true calamity in the Street and although it is simply a guess  I would have thought that the US unemployment rate would have seen 50  easily  at least over the near term 
5   The Reserve Fund was  at that time  I believe  in 2008  one of the world s largest money market funds and if the Reserve Fund had  broken the buck   which means that if the Reserve Fund s NAV had moved below  1 per share  it could have resulted in a run on money markets that would have made the bank run and the Bailey Building   Loan run   It s A Wonderful Life   look like a day in the park   The aftermath of what happened with the Reserve Fund in 2008 is that today  the SEC is contemplating and is close to letting money market fund NAV s  net asset values  float  The thought is that the  1 money market price creates a  moral hazard  and what I told a client recently is that what retail investors will likely wind up with is whole array of  ultra short  bond funds as money market funds  which do fluctuate minimally in price  
6   Although some of the fiscal policy has been horrid since 2008  I do think that one of the root issues in the economic recovery following 2008 has been the true  shock  of the drop in real estate and household wealth  Remember consumption is 2 3rd s of GDP and with the capital markets and the real estate markets  being two of the greatest wealth creation vehicles post WWII  not to mention the value of an education   it is taking years for the consumer to restore their savings and confidence 
7   The fact that  disinflation   a declining rate of inflation  and deflation continue to be an issue 5 years after the stock market low and the substantial economic recovery  is indicative of lingering overcapacity  Part of that is due to the life cycle of technology  which has dramatically accelerated productivity and shortened tech product cycles  not to mention kept a lid on inflation  and in part could be due to demographics and the Aging of America  a bigger debate  
8   The Great Mistake in the 1930 s by the Federal Reserve is that it actually withdrew liquidity sometime in 1935   1936  which resulted in another downturn in the US economy in the late 1930 s just prior to WW II  In other words  Fed policy errors actually exacerbated the Great Depression  rather than shortened it  Both Janet Yellen  I m sure   just like Ben Bernanke are   were both aware of the Fed s policy mistakes and are obviously loathe to make the same mistake  The fact that there isn t any meaningful inflation today just makes the Fed s ability to maintain ZIRP  zero interest rate policy  and low rates that much easier  However it will end at some point and we will get some inflation  I would suspect 
It s Complicated
Most intelligent investors blame leverage on the 2008 collapse  but I think it was far more involved than that  It just wasn t that simple 
In client meetings the last few years  Ive been telling clients that there is less than a 5  chance that they will see the 2008 confluence of events happen again in their lifetime  probably less  
Certainly I could be wrong  but I continue to think the US economy  and the US stock market    particularly the SP 500    is in a perfect glide slope of healthy    albeit subdued    growth  low inflation coupled with a healthy respect for stock volatility and negative sentiment on the part of retail investors 
Too Soft  Too Hard  Just Right
One commentator from PIMCO called it the  Goldilocks economy  and the metaphor seems appropriate 
We will see SP 500 corrections over time  but I bet that in 10 years we will look back and see this period of time as similar to post WW II economic stability and growth  Perhaps that conclusion is somewhat of a stretch given the demographics of the US economy today  but we ll see 
Thanks for reading today  We ve been contemplating this commentary on 2008 for some time  Watching NTRS and STT trade in late September  early October  2008 was one of the few times  I ve felt true fear watching the stock market  The potential collapse of the money market as was being telegraphed by the global custodian banks  would have been a horrific scenario to conceive  let along experience 
When all the books are written about the  near Great Collapse of 2008  after 20   30 years of hindsight  I do think Ben Bernanke  then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner will be due a huge debt of gratitude 
For a few days weeks  educated American s had a brief look into the abyss  It wont be forgotten by those of us that sat through it ",2014-08-27,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bernanke-says-'08-‘worse-than-great-depression’-224000,224000
125515,347030,NTRS,These 3 Stocks Benefit From A Fed Rate Hike,opinion,"Many investors were biting their nails waiting for 2 00pm to come yesterday  This was done in anticipation of the Federal Reserve s monetary policy statement  The results showed that the Fed has dropped a key word from their statement that everyone was looking for  Indeed  the word on everyone s mind was  patience   which the Fed has been using in each of their statements in recent history  That is until yesterday 
Now that that word has been dropped  there seems to be some consensus that interest hikes will be coming soon  maybe as early as June  Although some stocks stand to lose from this  such as REITs  there are tickers which have much to gain  Such stocks include insurance companies and banks  as they heavily rely on interest rates to turn over profits 
Below  we outline three high ranked stocks  2 insurance companies and one banking institution  We recommend these stocks for their criteria of rising consensus estimates  as well as other valuation and growth criteria  When the Fed finally raises interest rates  these companies stand to directly benefit from that 
Allied World Assurance Company Holdings  NYSE AWH 
Allied World Assurance Company is one of Bermuda s major property and casualty insurers  The company has a global reach thanks to its subsidiaries  and offers insurance across the world  AWH is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Expect less volatility with this stock  as it has a beta of 0 43 
There has been significant movement in our EPS consensus over the past 60 days for the current quarter  Two months ago  our consensus called for EPS of  0 73  The current consensus is  0 77  Allied World Assurance also has a nice track record of beating our EPS consensus in 3 of the last 4 quarters by an average of 48 89   The positive momentum and history with regards to earnings makes AWH a candidate which is likely to beat our consensus when it reports its earnings on 4 22 15 
Northern Trust  NASDAQ NTRS 
Northern Trust is a multi bank holding company that provides a multitude of financial and banking services for clients across the globe  The company holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This favorable rank paired along with a positive ESP of 3 49  making Northern Trust a likely candidate to beat on our consensus estimate when it reports its earnings on 4 21 15 
It is worth noting that the company doles out a 1 85  dividend  NTRS also has a nice PEG of 1 93  suggesting that it has a superior growth rate for the price that it trades for  In the last 60 days  our consensus has seen positive movement  going from an EPS consensus of  0 83 to a current consensus of  0 86  The company beat on our EPS consensus last quarter by 16 05  
Heritage Insurance Holdings  NYSE HRTG 
Heritage Insurance Holdings provides property and casualty insurance  The Florida based insurer has gone from a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  in the last week  The company appears to be undervalued on the surface when comparing its P E to the industry average  which are 7 99 and 16 7 respectively 
Heritage insurance has a year over year EPS growth estimate for next quarter of 81 7   There has been considerable movement in the consensus estimate in the last 90 days  Estimates have moved from  0 61 three months ago to a current consensus of  0 80 for this quarter  The company has beaten our consensus in each of the last 3 quarters by an average of 37 8   HRTG reports its earnings on 6 3 15 ",2015-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-benefit-from-a-fed-rate-hike-245695,245695

subtle shift in monetary policy making is afoot with a new generation of central bankers  striving to secure global economic recovery  prepared to challenge the old doctrine of Inflation fighting at all costs  Mark Carney  the governor of the Bank of Canada and soon to be head of the Bank of England  may or may not have intended to spark a high level debate last week over how diligently central banks should fend off inflation  reported Reuters  Policymakers from the U S  Federal Reserve to the Bank of Japan have reconsidered or relaxed their inflation targets    long the raison d etre of monetary policy    and have given more emphasis to economic growth  even if that is not an official mandate  They have reduced their slavish devotion to the sole goal of inflation targeting  said Carl Tannenbaum  a former Fed official who is now chief economist at U S  asset manager Northern Trust  No central banker is going to tolerate an inflation spike in order to boost employment or foster more growth  Policymakers have also largely dismissed some of the more radical alternatives to achieving their goals  most notably targeting levels of nominal gross domestic product  real GDP plus inflation   Yet with the financial crisis having starkly exposed central banks  failure to stave off danger  and policymakers having responded by flooding world markets with trillions of dollars in cheap funding  a small run up in inflation may no longer be the anathema it once was In the world s largest economy  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has unleashed some  2 5 trillion in asset purchases in the last few years to boost hiring and economic growth  squarely focusing on the employment side of the U S  central bank s dual mandate  His approach differs to that of his veteran predecessor Alan Greenspan  The same goes for Mario Draghi who took over from Jean Claude Trichet at the ECB and it looks like Carney  replacing Britain s Mervyn King  fits the same pattern  The Fed last week tied low interest rates to a drop in the jobless rate to 6 5     it stood at 7 7  last month    as long as inflation did not threaten to top 2 5   The unprecedented move may represent the culmination of its departure from the inflation centric model pursued by former Fed chairmen Greenspan and Paul Volcker and gave a clear signal that it would tolerate inflation above its 2  target if that was the cost of getting more Americans back to work  Carney has emphasized the idea of  flexible targeting  in which inflation could be allowed to stray from the target for longer than would normally be tolerated in order to stabilize financial markets or the economy  Carney said earlier this month that the BoC explored the idea of changing its inflation targeting mandate altogether but decided that was too risky  He stressed he was not dropping hints about his plans for Britain yet BoE policymakers were quick to push back on any notion the country should change its approach to policy  Paul Fisher  the BoE s executive director for markets  said Britain should be wary of changing the central bank s two percent inflation target and had no need to adopt the longer term commitments its North American counterparts have made on interest rates  But while BoE Chief Economist Spencer Dale warned there is no free lunch when it comes to changing the central bank s target  British finance minister George Osborne surprised some when he welcomed Carney s opening of the debate  If you want to change the regime you have to make a pretty strong case for doing so  Osborne told members of parliament  In July  Carney will replace King  considered among the last of the old guard of inflation fighting central bankers    despite mixed success in that regard    which also included BoJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and former ECB head Trichet  Draghi  who succeeded Trichet last year  has been careful to stick to the ECB s price stability mantra  which is enshrined in the EU treaty and fiercely defended by Germans who are still haunted by the memory of hyperinflation in the 1920s  Yet he has also flooded the financial sector with more than one trillion euros this year and pledged to buy Euro zone government bonds in whatever amounts are needed to shore up the currency bloc  Two hard line ECB policymakers  Axel Weber and Juergen Stark  resigned last year over the bank s previous bond buying program  The pair said they felt it strayed into the realm of fiscal policy and could ultimately pose inflation risks ,2012-12-24,Commodity Trade

125543,347058,NTRS,Dollar In The Driver s Seat,opinion,With the initial jobless claims released yesterday in the U S  climbing to a six week high  and with the continuous claims figure also missing estimates  one would have expected the dollar to have weakened yesterday  since the labour market weaknesses will likely postpone the Fed s tapering off of QE  Dollar bearish news  though  came from other fronts as well  as April s housing starts also missed forecasts  being the least since November  and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey reinforced the negative picture painted by the Empire State Index on Wednesday  thus hinting to a disappointing future ISM Manufacturing reading  However  this burst of negative U S  data left the dollar index virtually unchanged from yesterday morning  As a matter of fact it was up by 0 08   greatly due to the euro s and the yen s inability to capitalise on the news  with both losing 0 06  versus the greenback since yesterday morning  with the commodity currencies plunging  NZD  AUD  and CAD down 1 73   1 23  and 0 54  respectively   despite the mixed picture on the commodities  crude  copper and palladium gain  with the other precious metals losing  Indeed  not all news from the U S  was dollar negative yesterday  as the continuous jobless claims showed the second lowest reading since April 2008  with April s building permits  a leading indicator  being the most since the pre Lehman era  The euro s inability yesterday to effectively gain versus the dollar  though  adds to a similar phenomenon witnessed on Wednesday  with the euro underperforming versus the other majors on the announcement of dollar bearish news  The movement of the EUR USD 50 day Moving Average below the 200 day MA  which signals a technical  death cross  that is bearish for the pair  and the pair s inability to rebound off the neckline of a head and shoulders formation  which holds since September 2012  also add to the euro s apparent difficulty to gain versus the dollar U S  equity index traders may want to note that the indices closed slightly lower yesterday  with the SPX and the NYA indices closing lower for only the second time in more than two weeks  However  with the McClellan Oscillator  a breadth indicator based on a Moving Average of the number of shares rising with those falling  downward sloping on the NYA since May 8th  it is on the verge of turning bearish lying slightly above zero  A negative reading usually signals a limit to the up move potential with a correction taking place In the US  the U of Michigan consumer confidence indicator is forecast to rise to 78 0 from 76 4  The leading indicators are forecast to be up 0 2  vs a  0 1  decline in March  Is this important  A 1998 study by the Fed found that the Conference Board s indicators  have both economically and statistically significant explanatory power for several categories of consumer spending   But they found that  by contrast  measures available from the University of Michigan generally exhibit weaker forecasting power for most categories of spending  1 A 2003 study of the two indices by the Congressional Research Service found that  These indicators are not  apparently  insignificant  On their own and in concert with other economic variables they have been shown to contribute to forecasts of future consumer spending and hence of overall economic growth  But their contribution may be somewhat more modest than the attention they get would suggest  2 Nonetheless  so long as the FX market pays attention to them  you do too Elsewhere today  Canada s CPI for April is forecast to be unchanged mom  vs  0 2   while the Bank of Canada s core CPI is forecast to be up 0 2  mom  the same as in March The MarketEUR USD EUR USD  title  EUR USD  width  1715  height  747      The Eurozone s CPI figures did not affect the pair as they came in line with expectations  as is usually the case  The weak U S  data  however  caused a rebound from the 1 2855 head and shoulders neckline  with trendline resistance coming at 1 2920  with the pair shedding 45 pips soon after resistance was hit  with a rebound that followed failing to challenge resistance again driving the pair back to the 1 2855   1 2875 support area  A breakdown from the support neckline may have the pair finding brief support at 1 2795  with 1 2750 being the March low following the February plunge and with 1 2680  being a 6 month low and the 61 8  retracement level of the July 2012   February 2013 bull run  Resistance today may come lower  around 1 2915  with further resistance at  USD JPY  title  USD JPY  width  1713  height  747      USD JPY formed a doji candlestick yesterday  reinforcing the view that there is a tug of war between bulls and bears  with resistance again coming around 102 70  though slightly lower than on Wednesday  with support yet again at 101 95  a level tested following the release of weak U S  data  The technical rebound that followed looks to have found resistance at 102 30  with the 1 hour chart resembling a double top  It is interesting to note that the surprising improvement in Japanese machinery orders only caused negligible  short lived gains for the yen  which failed to even test support  Support below 101 95 comes at 101 65 and 101 35  with a breakout of 102 70 resistance seeing the next notable resistance at   title  USD CAD  width  1714  height  746      The loonie lost yesterday despite oil gaining  with USD CAD finding resistance at 1 0217  the 23 6  retracement level of the January   March rally  A slightly downward sloping trendline  which holds since February 2010  may act as resistance at 1 0240  with Fibonacci resistance at 1 0275  Support comes at 1 0180  near the 50 day MA and the 1 0140   1 0155 area  which sees the 38 2  retracement level of the aforementioned rally  RSI looks to be following an upward trendline with the Stochastics in overbought levels Gold  Gold is having its worst weak in a month  having lost 5 5   falling for a sixth consecutive day as the  smart money  reduce their holdings of gold ETFs  with Soros  BlackRock and Northern Trust added to the list  That said the  smart money  did not prove very smart in 2012  when close to 90  of hedge funds underperformed the SPX Index  Gold s technical plunge following the breakdown from the  1400 and  1385 support levels drove the asset to  1370 support   1385  the 23 6  retracement level of the April crash  looks to interchange as support and resistance  with support below the recent low coming in at  1350 and  1330  Notable resistance levels are the  1423   1431 area and  1445  the 38 2  retracement level of the post financial crisis bull run WTI  WTI confirmed the hammer candlestick that formed on Wednesday  as it was a major gainer yesterday  It rebounded from  93 40 trendline support in spite of the poor U S  fundamentals since the news weakened the dollar  However  the rally that followed was chiefly technical  driving price to  95 50 trendline resistance  despite the dollar gaining overall yesterday   94 50 may act as an initial support  with  93 40 seeing trendline and Fibonacci support  while the 200 day MA lies at  92 35  A breakout may find initial resistance at  96 60 with strong trendline resistance at  97 30 BENCHMARK CURRENCY RATES   DAILY GAINERS AND

125549,347064,NTRS,Marketing Closer Or Poseur ,opinion,A universal theme in alternative assets is investor money looking for a place to land  Uncommitted cash  underperforming assets and professional laggards throughout the alternative channels all contribute to a common investor desire to find purposeful options to meet their objectives  It should be a marketer s dream  money wanting to be placed and hungry managers actively seeking new investor partners  So why is the connection between the two missing So Much Water Yet So Little To DrinkInvestors are clearly voicing their desire for smaller managers who can provide returns that outpace the lackluster performance of the alternatives industry establishment  Northern Trust s recent Wealth in America Survey  2012  profiled 1 700 wealthy households across the U S  to understand what is important to them  Some of the key findings included that 63  are willing to take a calculated risk  52  are always looking for a new investment and 30  are now more likely to seek out alternatives than they were five years ago Smaller managers lacking in house marketing talent seek sales representation that will connect them to these HNW investors  Ask emerging managers across the strategy spectrum what one of the hardest things to manage in their business is  and the consensus is that  Getting in front of the right investors  remains a top challenge So the question remains  where are all the sales people ready to connect emerging managers with investors eager to place their money in alternatives  Are there not enough of these marketers  Are alternatives marketers not incentivized to meet the needs of the market  Several of the issues that seem to interfere with third party marketing of emerging managers follow I m Not Big Enough To Play   Or Do You Mean I m Not Big Enough To Warrant Your Effort An obvious challenge for smaller managers is the size of their business  and the relative risk that may pose to some investors  The scale for managing  and placing money clearly factors into the decision of both marketers  as well as managers having the operational capacity to accommodate investment inflows while preserving performance Many emerging managers turned down for third party marketing representation are told that until their AUM is of sufficient size  they cannot be put in front of investors  While this is often true  certainly so in the case of most institutional investors  there exists a large strata of HNW and smaller institutional investors with both a desire and an investment mandate to invest with smaller alternatives managers who are suitable and attractive from their objective standpoint These investors are often at the front end of their alternatives learning curve and require more sourcing  educating and relationship building than the long standing institutional clients many third party marketers carry in their relationship base  Quite frankly  it takes more work on the part of marketers to develop and ultimately match these HNW and smaller institutional investors with appropriate alternative managers  Additionally  the sales ticket will likely be substantially smaller per each successful matching  The amount of marketing work to add an investor is comparatively the same when seeking  100 000 as  1 000 000  but the payoff is one tenth Despite the end result for both parties  that being a successful marriage of investor and manager  the third party marketer may be reluctant to put in the work that is required on these smaller sales  Nevertheless  a marketing opportunity exists for substantial growth of these investors into alternatives  and the shortfall seems to lie in the third party resources capable or willing to match managers with these investors Past Performance Is Not Necessarily Indicative Of Future Performance  But It Is The Best PredictorAnother one of the frustrating push backs heard by emerging managers from third party marketers  is that while their performance looks good on the relatively small amount of capital with which they founded their business  it might be difficult to convince an outside investor to join the fund as a significant portion of the capital base whether the manager can  handle it   This argument is often a smoke screen for a reluctance to ramp the manager up in AUM with small and frequent inflows of HNW capital that adds to the outside capital mix in increments of  100 000 or  200 000 at a time  rather than inflows that come in the form of millions For most managers who have a strategy deployed in markets with plentiful liquidity and capacity  such as equities or commodities  there is little risk of degradation of performance based on a rise in the fund s capital base  This is not to imply that degradation of performance cannot happen as a manager grows the asset base  The reasons are often due to operational challenges  investment personnel gaps  lack of business management planning and other non investment related issues  With small steady inflows of outside capital  an emerging manager can establish a track record of  handling  the larger AUM with consistency and undiluted performance attributed to the size of the fund Third party marketers should be highly skilled at describing the manager s strategy and business development plans for scaling growth at the earliest stages of discussions with prospects  This is one of the fundamental reasons that the sales process takes more time than it did a decade ago  The truth is that investors require more details  data and discussion at every point in the sales process to gain confidence in their evaluation and decision process for each new investment they seek I d Like To Work With You  But Your Strategy Is Not A Top Interest To Investors Right NowHNW investors are universally interested in diversification and risk modification  They are eager to learn about ways to preserve and protect their money so that they can execute legacy planning and maintain long term philanthropic interests  They are motivated overwhelmingly by establishing trust and integrity in the relationships they build with their financial partners  both advisors and providers  They are looking for advice and value added service that will help them position themselves more defensively against tail risk events that potentially could derail years of conservative planning and execution On the alternatives side  they are not typically focused on following trends in strategies or identifying the best stock picker in the markets  Their interest in alternatives centers on owning something that is different from their equities and fixed income holdings  They want insurance against more of the sameness by which they feel their portfolio is already threatened  This means that marketers selling alternatives to these HNW investors should be focused on describing and illustrating how alternatives can achieve this diversification and risk modification  and not on short term performance comparisons There are many alternatives avenues to achieving these goals and strategies across the market spectrum that can create this form of non correlation  The market is currently being populated by a variety of  liquid alternatives  products that provide transparency and liquidity for investors to satisfy the need for access to capital  while still allowing for a range of strategies to achieve diversified investment objectives Marketers who refuse to work with managers based on the fact that their strategy would be hard to sell because it s not  in favor right now  with investors are looking for a short cut to sales closings  They are relying on popular trends to do the initial work of getting investors to pay attention to a strategy or approach that allows them to cut the time it takes to make a sale No One Ever Said It Wasn t Hard WorkTrend selling  whether in alternatives or in traditional markets  is also counter intuitive  what is hot eventually cools and a relationship based on the short term is exposed to disappointment and a misalignment of expectations that can lead to a termination of the relationship as trends shift  A commitment built on alignment of investor manager goals within a strategy  a clear understanding of how the strategy is expected to perform under a variety of market conditions  and an ongoing dialogue about the progress and status of the fund s performance is a more resilient relationship that can span many market cycles It should be incumbent upon third party marketers to foster more of these committed relationships within the HNW community because they serve both the investors and the managers who need each other  There really isn t a shortcut to this process  These investors will always need portfolio options that improve diversification and reduce risk exposures  Emerging managers require a larger capital base to grow Dedication to the relationship process and a true exchange of goals is critical to gaining access to the HNW investor base  TMarketing talent is crucial to the process  and third party alternatives marketers would be well served in recognizing the underserved needs of both HNW investors and emerging managers  who together form this mutual relationship Diane Harrison is principal and owner of Panegyric Marketing  a

125564,347079,NTRS,Best Recession Forecaster  Robert F  Dieli,opinion,Since last May I have been reviewing the record of those who forecast the business cycle  I developed a stringent list of requirements   Jeff s Acid Test   and I frequently invited nominations  Here were the stated requirements Openness    with the potential for peer reviewSmall number of input variables   Most people do not understand that  small is good    If you have a lot of variables  it is easy to do back fitting on a few cases   Beware Real time performance   This means that you do not go back in history doing any data mining   You create an indicator and live with it through time I received a number of suggestions in the comments and by email  I very much appreciate the help from readers   One result is that I am monitoring a number of new and promising forecasting methods  I plan a later article on the honorable mention winners Somewhat to my surprise  there was only one candidate who met all three criteria  and Mr  ModelMost people think they know about recession forecasting  but they are often responding to someone s last good call or who has the best PR team   The Dieli method hits a winning trifecta    it is based on sound intellectual premises  it has worked better than any other method in real time  and it is open for our review   What more can we ask BackgroundThis is Part 2 of a planned five part series on recession forecasting  Part 1 is     I know that many will want to dig into the nuts and bolts of the Dieli method  and I will start that in the next segment   There will be plenty of opportunity to for comparison and discussion of various methods For now  let us just think about the results in terms of the long term track record  and learn a little more about how the model was developed Track Records Let s start with a look at Mr  Model The key variable is the Aggregate Spread  depicted by the blue line   It depends upon monthly data  and will be updated next week   The trigger point is the 200 level   Whenever the blue line crosses 200  it is a forecast of a  cycle event    The forecast horizon is pretty close to nine months   This means that when the line crosses 200 moving lower  it is a nine month warning of a peak  AKA recession as defined by the NBER  When the line crosses moving higher  it provides a nine month warning of a trough Doug Short does an excellent job with the two most popular candidates in his update article     There are several excellent charts  and I recommend reading the entire article   For our current purposes  I am selecting the one that best matches the Mr  Model forecasts I invite the reader to scroll from left to right  looking at the lead times for both the onset and the end of recessions    I understand that the ECRI uses both an acceleration term and other indicators to augment their calls  but we have to start somewhere  It would be nice to put all of these indicators on a single chart  but I think the strength of Mr  Model is apparent The Man behind the ModelAs background for the record  I have known Bob Dieli only for a few months  Since we both reside in the Chicago suburbs  it was convenient for us to meet for lunch after a joint appearance on a panel I appreciated his openness  honesty  and intellectual rigor   I was even more impressed by the results of his method  When I learned that he had not tinkered with it over the years  I really perked up This is a very unusual combination  helping to define someone as the  real deal   Here is the interview I later conducted Q   Bob  tell us a little bit about how and when you first conceived the ideas behind Mr  Model The origins go all the way back to graduate school at the University of Texas in the 1970s  when I first became interested in the business cycle   I began to work on the model in its current form while I was doing economic research at the Continental Bank from 1978 to 1984 and at the Northern Trust from 1987 to 1994   Both were financial institutions with major exposure to the risks associated with business cycle peaks and troughs Q   You have had a number of high profile jobs   Did your economic research on this topic continue through all of these experiences Over the course of my corporate career I spent time in staff assignments in economic research and later in line assignments in credit risk management at the Continental during the crisis that led to its implosion   In 1987 I became a fixed income portfolio manager at the Northern  where my clients were mostly high net worth individuals Can you tell us a little more about how these positions helped you develop your skill as a forecaster The combination of those experiences gave me some important insight on the preparation and use of forecasts   I learned that details of great interest to the forecast originator may not be very important to the forecast user   The bottom line was that accurate and insightful forecasts  delivered in a timely and usable manner  were the most sought after by decision makers Q   You feature a chart of economic performance and model signals  with an excellent real time record   Can you elaborate on that a bit My objective was to find a format that allowed the user to draw conclusions quickly   This turned out to be charts with long historical tails that provide perspective and context at a glance Q   You also write extensively on employment   This actually represents a second approach for your economic analysis  I think   Is it giving you a similar signal right now The employment figures are among the most informative statistics we have   They are the best coincident indicators of economic conditions and  as such  give you a great place to start on figuring out where we are in the business cycle and what is likely to happen next Q   How much lead time do you usually see between a signal from Mr  Model and an economic peak or trough The Aggregate Spread  which is the principal forecast statistic  operates with a constant nine month forward look   Unlike other leading indicators which operate with a variable lead time  the Aggregate Spreads looks ahead nine months at all times   Think of it in the same terms as the beam on the radar on your local weather channel   The historical record has shown that when the Aggregate Spread gets to 200 Basis Points  from either direction  we have reason to think there will be a cycle event  either a peak or a trough  some time in the time period nine months ahead of the arrival of the Aggregate Spread at the 200 Basis Point boundary Q  Making those calls out nine months must lead to some interesting conversations with your clients Indeed they do   For example  the signal for the peak of the 2001 recession that began in March of that year  came from model readings obtained in June of 2000   Telling folks  in the middle of the tech boom  that the business cycle had not been repealed and that we would have a recession the following year was a tough sell   Similarly  the indications that the recession of 2007 would end in the middle of 2009 began to emerge late in 2008 and in early 2009   Trying to tell folks that the economy would turn up while it was in the midst of what looked like a free fall in the first quarter of 2009 was even more difficult   But  because the model has the track record that it does  by the end of the first quarter of 2009 most of my readers were convinced that the worst of the recession was over and that a bottom would be forming Q  To make this clear  while you talk about markets  you are not making market predictions  You are predicting the economy  right That is correct   What I am out to do is anticipate the dates of business cycle turning points as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research  NBER  with enough warning to allow effective planning   The stock market  the fixed income market  and the housing market  to name just three  all have their own cycles  Sometimes those cycles match up closely with the NBER turning points  and other times they don t   But you can t know that until you know the NBER dates  The Aggregate Spread has an excellent record of showing  as much as a year ahead  when an NBER event is likely to take place  Armed with that information  and the specifics of their industry  or market  informed decision makers can make appropriate plans Q  Could you tell us a little be about your firm and its clients I d be glad to    was started in 2002   My clients consist of three main groups  money managers  companies that make things  and individual investors   I send my monthly reports  which are available by subscription on my website  to all of these groups  I am available to all my subscribers for additional interpretation of the report contents  I also have a consulting practice in which I function as their economic research department   The assignments are as varied as the firms themselves  which makes the work very interesting to me   I also do public speaking before trade groups and gatherings arranged by and for my clients  Q  Why do you call your site  Nospinforecast  Because the forecasts and viewpoints expressed there are completely data driven   I talk about what is on the charts   I don t rant and I don t take sides   I report the information and provide complete access to my forecasting methods   While I do talk about possible future outcomes  I do so within the context of numbers themselves   My objective is to provide my readers with information they can use to assess other views and forecasts as well as information they can use to effectively manage their business and financial affairs   One of the reasons I do this is because of lessons I learned while working with the trading desks at both the Continental and the Northern   The same piece of economic information might be reason for one desk  say short term fixed income  to buy and another desk  say foreign exchange  to sell the instruments they traded Q   Thanks  Bob  for your helpful and informative comments Thank you for the chance to talk about Mr  Model Conclusion    Part 2There is plenty more to discuss   I will get into the workings of Mr  Model in Part 3   We will revisit the comparison with the ECRI in part 4   These are tentatively on the agenda for next week Meanwhile  everyone should note that a  cycle event      aka recession    is not expected for at least nine months   Unlike those who ascribe 0  or 100  chances of events  I understand that bad things can happen Nevertheless  you should keep this in mind In the 50 year history of Mr  Model  when the indicator is at current levels  there has NEVER been a recession within nine months   In fact  we are not even close to the nine month signal ,2012-01-13,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/best-recession-forecaster:-robert-f.-dieli-111109,111109
125565,347080,NTRS,Why I m Bullish Equities  But Not Too Bullish  Right Now,opinion,Although it didn t happen until after the U S  market had closed   funny how that happens   there is   The Greek leaders  who were discussing the austerity measures   agreed on all the points of the program with the exception of one which requires further elaboration and discussion  with the Troika  The  discussion  seems to be brought about because Greece was told it needs to cut pensions  and the socialist party said they won t agree to such a thing  I wonder how they ll discuss that thing out  Equities managed another small gain before that news came out  on still ephemeral volume  After the close  stocks slipped  but not terribly  We will see what today brings  I have been  bullish  on equities for a few weeks  I put the word in quotes because although I believe stocks have a better chance to rise than to fall while the Fed and ECB  and everyone else  are pumping away  I recognize that equities are still richly valued and I am not completely sure that being long is worth the risk  I must say that for all the consistency of the advance in the S P since mid December  see Bloomberg chart below   the steady step higher on tiny volume scares me  It scares me because of the old market maxim that  the stock market goes up on the staircase and down on the escalator  I am also frightened by    He suggested that investors should have 100  in equities  According to Mr  Fink   I don t have a view that the world is going to fall apart  so you need to take on more risk  You need to overcome all this noise  When you look at dividend returns on equities vs  bond yields  to me it s a pretty easy decision to be heavily in equities   It doesn t scare me because it s a unique thought  the talking heads on CNBC often advocate ridiculous concentrations to equities and don t care about the price  It doesn t scare me because he s wrong to look at relative valuations of dividend yields versus bond yields when making a call on future performance of either asset class   the absolute level of both of them augurs poorly for future returns  Although the Chairman of a firm that supposedly has quant DNA should know better than to say something that wrong  in his role he s really chief marketing officer and he s trying to sell product  No  what scares me  perhaps  saddens me  is more accurate  is that anyone in a position of authority who might be listened to would actually be so cavalier as to advocate a 100  investment in anything  especially given the huge list of global risks  and especially in a market that isn t exactly priced with a margin of safety  By contrast  Enduring Investments  asset allocation model currently has 3 4  in equities  But all of that aside  the stock market isn t going up because of heavy buying  It is going up because there is rotten liquidity and so any buying pressure pushes prices higher  and there are plenty of people who see the money spigots open and reflexively buy real assets  I don t mind that for a trade  and I admit to being long some stocks myself just in case I am wrong and Fink is right  And I suppose that is the point  I feel I need to protect against the possibility that I am wrong  Fink doesn t feel the same need  One thing I am not worried about is the price of gasoline  This is not to say that I am excited about the fact that gasoline futures are right about at  3 and retail unleaded gas is nearing  3 50  If this is a demand side phenomenon  then it could actually be good news  However  as far as I can tell  domestic gasoline demand is actually down  not up  according to the Department of Energy  see Chart below  source Bloomberg  Demand in Europe can t be strong right now  and the large emerging economies are struggling as well  This is all bad news  because collectively it takes away the demand side explanation  But the answer isn t necessarily supply side  that is  peak oil  Hormuz fear  or low inventory levels   I think at least some of the answer is monetary policy side  The chart below  source  Bloomberg  shows retail gasoline versus the stock market for the last five years  Some of the correlation  for example in 2008  is clearly demand related  But the equity run up into and through QE2  from mid 2010 into early 2011  I think we all know was mostly inspired by cheap money  Gasoline responded in the same way at that time  as did of course most commodities I think the gasoline and equity rallies right now are occurring for the same reason  It wouldn t be my first guess   my first guess would be demand side  but that argument is clearly flat  I think loose monetary policy is at least part of the story here  And speaking of loose monetary policy  I must share the following exchange with you  Bloomberg published a provocatively titled article      that was so lopsided the article is either a plant or the author s kids just broke Chairman Bernanke s window and she s trying to make it up to him  Quoting John Lonski  Moody s how have they done with forecasting   and Mark Gertler  the article bashes a number of fairly successful forecasters  such as   who is consistently one of the nation s top forecasters  by essentially saying that the failure of inflation to immediately surge following aggressive Fed easing meant that all of those forecasters were  clueless   One of those economists  Stephen Stanley of Pierpont Securities  took umbrage at being called  clueless  and fired back a broadside that is fantastic in that it points out clearly many of the weaknesses in the reasoning of the  I heart Bernanke  lobby  readers of this column will be familiar with many of these arguments   I have not always agreed with Stanley s perspective on the economy   no honest economist always agrees with anyone   but he hits the nail on the head here and I will quote a large part of his response  He first points out that the article attacks a straw man because no reputable economist forecast a huge immediate surge in inflation just because of a surge in bank reserves  He then notes    And keep in mind that the inflation rate accelerated in 2011 by roughly a full percentage point for both headline and core   That is in fact a pretty  rapid  pickup in inflation that would get us into trouble if it persisted Importantly  this acceleration in inflation in 2011 was absolutely not predicted by the Fed or its apologists   The Phillips Curve model that dominates the FOMC s thinking  and evidently Lonski s and Gertler s  does not even allow for the acceleration in inflation seen in 2011   In fact  the Fed models are unambiguous that inflation should be falling substantially now  because there is a lot of slack in labor markets   which is a main reason that Fed officials had such unwarranted concerns about deflation in recent years and why they now so confidently predict that inflation will decelerate from here  even as growth improves and  slack  diminishes   And herein lies the problem   We have a central bank that apparently believes that inflation is driven by wages which are in turn driven by the degree of slack in labor markets  i e  the unemployment rate    I had thought that this dusty old Phillips Curve framework was thrown in the dustbin of history after the disaster of the 1970s  but clearly  like some bad 1950s horror film  a new generation of academic economists has dug it out of the trash  cleaned it off  and attempted to dress it in new clothes and sell it as the unquestioned consensus of the economics community   When the central bank does not allow for an important role of money in the determination of inflation  an acceleration in prices is a clear and present danger   The problem with the Fed is not so much that inflation is currently way too high  it is that the reaction function from economic and inflation data to policy is radically easier than it has been at any time in the Fed s history   I do not disagree that policy should be accommodative  but there is no credible framework to defend the notion that it needs to be as or more accommodative in late 2014 than it is now   This is a train wreck waiting to happen  but it is a train wreck that will play out over years  not minutes   Happily  this means that much of the damage is preventable reversible if the proper course correction is taken soon enough   If not  the latter part of this decade may look a lot like the 1970s  As I say  he makes some powerful points that you have read in this space before  Economists who say we don t need to worry about inflation because of slack growth  the Phillips Curve argument  need to explain away several data points that don t fit that model  For example  the 1970s  They also need to explain why prices haven t fallen over the last few years  outside of energy  despite immense slack in the economy  And he absolutely nails the vulnerability now  which is less that the transactional money supply is growing at a steady 10  rate  although it is  and more that there is no reason at all to expect that the Fed is about to take drastic actions to trim its balance sheet and begin to restrain the money supply  Indeed  quite the opposite is true We will get money supply later today  and next week CPI  But no matter what those numbers say  some of us will still be called clueless  I guess I don t mind being clueless  as long as I m right ,2012-02-09,Michael
