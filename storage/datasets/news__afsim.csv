5803,227318,AFSIM,Insurance Stocks Q2 Earnings Due On Aug 8  AFSI  PRI  STFC,opinion,The second quarter earnings season is busy wrapping up with only 16  members of the elite S P 500 Index left to be reported  Per the latest   the performance of 420 index members  accounting for 86 7  of the index s total market capitalization   having already reported their financial numbers this quarter  indicates that total earnings have increased 11 6  on 5 6  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 74 3  companies surpassing the bottom line expectations and 68 3   outperforming with the top line The  sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has delivered a strong performance till now and is almost done with results  99  companies on the S P 500 Index  accounting for 88 7  of the index s total market capitalization  that have already reported quarterly results  shows 8 7  earnings growth on 3 6  increase in revenues  both on a year over year basis  The beat ratio of 77 9  for the bottom line and 68 4  for the top line compared favorably with that of the S P 500 The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses  likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers  Per Aon Benfield  the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc  NYSE AON    the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is  53 billion in the first half of 2017  A few insurers have incurred losses due to severe wind and hail catastrophe events  occurred during April May in the U S Nonetheless  prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against the capital reserve erosion  conserved on a benign catastrophe environment  Net investment income  a major component of an insurer s top line  has witnessed improvement  albeit far lower than the historical highs  The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates  reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions  In fact  the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters  A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields Higher rates should offer some respite to the life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continual low rates  Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates  However  life insurers have considerably curbed their exposure to interest sensitive product lines Notably  an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment  This in turn might have also prompted more policy writings  thus driving the premiums higher to generate a lion s share to an insurers  top line  Besides  core business growth  geographic expansion  strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably encouraged the insurers On the flip side  we do not expect robust pricings  To write new business and retain renewals  insurers have been reducing the pricing pressure  Commercial property  workers  compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing this low pricing Let s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 8 AmTrust Financial Services  Inc    NASDAQ AFSI   underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance in the United States and globally  Last quarter

5830,227345,AFSIM,Oil  Fed And Politics Pressure Markets,opinion,"U S  equities finished lower ahead of tomorrow s highly anticipated monetary policy decision from the Fed  with expectations high for a 25 basis point rate hike  while political uncertainty across the pond continued to fester  Energy issues came under pressure amid a drop in crude oil prices in the wake of a bearish OPEC report showing a jump in production from Saudi Arabia  Treasury yields declined despite a hotter than expected producer price inflation report  while the U S  dollar was higher and gold lost ground 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  declined 44 points  0 2   to 20 837  the S P 500 Index lost 8 points  0 3   to 2 365  and the NASDAQ Composite decreased 19 points  0 3   to 5 857  In moderate volume  748 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 6 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil fell  0 48 to  47 72 per barrel and wholesale gasoline was unchanged at  1 58 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price declined  5 16 to  1 199 14 per ounce  and the dollar index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 4  higher at 101 69 
Hd Supply Holdings Inc   NASDAQ HDS  41  reported 4Q earnings per share  EPS  of  0 26  or  0 44 ex items  compared to the FactSet estimate of  0 43  as revenues rose 3 2  year over year  y y  to  1 6 billion  roughly in line with forecasts  The industrial distributor issued 1Q EPS guidance that missed expectations and shares were solidly lower 
Shares of Moneygram International Inc   NASDAQ MGI  16  surged after the company received a takeover proposal from Euronet Worldwide Inc  NASDAQ EEFT  83  for  15 20 per share in cash  valuing it at more than  1 billion  EEFT said the offer represents a 15  premium over MGI s previously agreed upon takeover by AmTrust Financial Services Inc  NASDAQ AFSI   MGI has not commented on EEFT s offer 
Producer price inflation hotter than expected  small business optimism dips slightly The Producer Price Index  PPI  showed prices at the wholesale level in February were up 0 3  month over month  m m   above the Bloomberg expectation calling for a 0 1  gain and compared to January s unrevised 0 6  rise  The core rate  which excludes food and energy  rose 0 3   versus forecasts of a 0 2  advance and January s unrevised 0 4  increase  Y Y  the headline rate was 2 2  higher  north of projections of a 1 9  increase  and the core PPI rose 1 5  last month  matching estimates  In January  producer prices were 1 6  higher and up 1 2  for the headline and core rates  respectively 
The National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  Small Business Optimism Index for February dipped to 105 3 from January s 105 9 level  compared to forecasts calling for a decline to 105 6 
Treasuries finished higher  as the yield on the 2 year note was flat at 1 37   while the yield on the 10 year note declined 3 basis points  bps  to 2 59   and the 30 year bond rate decreased 4 bps to 3 17  
The markets are awaiting tomorrow s conclusion of two day monetary policy meeting from the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC   expected to deliver a 25 bp hike to the target for the fed funds rate  The statement and accompanying updated economic projections are poised to also garner heavy attention  with the markets looking to see if the pace of rate hikes is expected to accelerate beyond current expectations  This will be followed by the customary press conference by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen  which typically garners scrutiny 
The FOMC decision will be preceded by a plethora of economic reports such as MBA mortgage applications  the Empire Manufacturing Index  the Consumer Price Index  CPI   retail sales  the NAHB Housing Markets Index and business inventories  The read on consumer inflation will likely garner the heaviest attention  Core CPI is estimated to come in at 2 2  y y for last month  a slight deceleration from the 2 3  gain in January  but the FOMC s favored core PCE Index remains slightly below its longer run objective of 2 0  
Earlier this month  FOMC Chairwoman Janet Yellen bolstered rate hike expectations by noting that the economy is close to meeting the Fed s goals of maximum employment and price stability and that gradual increases in the fed funds rate will likely be appropriate in the months and years ahead to keep the economy from significantly overheating 
The economic picture continues to look good  but inflation is heating up  and we are watching to see if this could force the Fed s hand  History compiled by Strategas Research Partners shows that the best stock market performance during a rate hiking cycle comes when the Fed moves slowly in the first year  but quicker in the second year  That pattern appears to be panning out in this cycle 
Europe dips as political uncertainty festers  Asia mixed
European equities finished lower  with oil   gas and financial stocks leading to the downside amid some caution ahead of tomorrow s highly expected rate hike in the U S   while crude oil prices fell on an OPEC report showing a jump in production from Saudi Arabia  Political uncertainty in the region also garnered heavy attention to likely hamstring sentiment  with U K  Brexit uneasiness continuing to flare up as Prime Minister May was granted the right to trigger Article 50  which will begin the formal process of negotiating the nation s exit from the European Union  following Scottish First Minister Sturgeon s news yesterday that she will start the legal process of preparing for a second independence referendum  Also  the markets are paying attention to tomorrow s Dutch election  which will set the stage for next month s key French Presidential election 
In economic news  eurozone industrial production rose by a smaller amount than expected for January  while German investor confidence improved by a smaller amount than forecasted for this month  The euro dipped and British pound fell compared to the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed  with the markets digesting some diverging Chinese economic data and as the markets appear to be treading cautiously ahead of tomorrow s highly expected rate hike in the U S  Moreover  European political uncertainty continues to ramp up  likely weighing on conviction  Japanese equities dipped  despite some weakness in the yen  while those traded in Australia finished flat 
South Korean securities rose  extending a run that has ensued in the wake of last week s court ruling to uphold a parliamentary vote to impeach President Park  and markets in India jumped in a return to action following yesterday s holiday and following the weekend s state elections that showed Prime Minister Modi s party won by a larger amount than expected  Stocks in mainland China ticked higher and those traded in Hong Kong were little changed following reports that showed the nation s industrial production and fixed asset investment topped expectations  though retail sales missed forecasts for last month 
Tomorrow  the international economic calendar will offer employment data from South Korea  India s trade balance  industrial production and retail sales from Japan  CPI from France and Italy  and employment figures from the UK ",2017-03-15,Marvin Clark,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil,-fed-and-politics-pressure-markets-200178981",200178981

1  Dollar Stalls Amid U S  Tax Reform Jitters
The dollar steadied against other major currencies on Wednesday following reports that a key corporate tax cut currently under discussion in U S  tax reforms plans could be delayed for one year 
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Senate Republican leaders are thinking of postponing the implementation of the major corporate tax cut to comply with Senate rules 
The U S  dollar had been supported in recent session by hopes the U S  administration s tax cuts could boost the economy  If enacted  the bill would be the biggest overhaul of the U S  tax system since the 1980s 
It would also be the first major legislative achievement since Republicans took control of the White House and Congress in January  but doubts remain over the scale of borrowing needed to finance the bill and the timetable for its passage this month 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  was little changed at 94 76 by 05 50 a m  ET  09 50 GMT  
2  Crude Prices Weaken Ahead of Inventory Data
Official data from the Energy Information Administration was set to be released later Wednesday  amid forecasts for an oil stock drop of around 2 8 million barrels  which would mark the second weekly decline in a row 
On Tuesday  the American Petroleum Institute said crude stockpiles declined by 1 6 million barrels in the week ending November 3  disappointing expectations for a drawback of 2 7 million barrels 
The U S  West Texas Intermediate crude December contract was down12 cents or about 0 21  at  57 08a barrel by 05 50 a m  ET  09 50 GMT   not far from Monday s two year peak of  57 55 
Elsewhere  Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was steady at  63 69 a barrel  just off a two year high of  64 42 hit on Tuesday 
Prices were also hit by data showing that China s oil imports dropped to 7 3 million million barrels per day  bpd  in October from an almost record high of 9 bpd the previous month 
China is the world s second biggest oil consumer 
3  Trump Asia Tour Reignites Tensions With North Korea
In an address to the South Korean parliament on Wednesday  U S  President Donald Trump addressed tensions with North Korea  saying that it  has interpreted America s past restraint as weakness  
 This would be a fatal miscalculation  This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past   he added 
Trump arrived in South Korea on Tuesday after meeting with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend 
Donald Trump is the first U S  president to speak before South Korea s parliament since Bill Clinton in 1993  The U S  president is scheduled to continue his tour in China later on Wednesday 
4  Gold Benefits From Softer Dollar  Geopolitical Worries
Gold prices edged higher on Wednesday  as concerns over the implementation of a potential U S  tax overhaul and especially its timing dampened demand for the dollar 
Meanwhile  safe haven demand was also boosted by U S  President Donald Trump s most recent comments on North Korea  saying that the U S  would defend itself against Pyongyang s nuclear threat 
Markets were also jittery as Saudi Arabia over the weekend launched an anti corruption purge among the highest levels of the establishment  In a separate event  the Saudi Kingdom accused Iran of being responsible for a ballistic missile attack carried out in Yemen  adding to local geopolitical tensions 
In addition  Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri surprised markets on Saturday by announcing his resignation  citing assassination threats and blaming Iran for interference in Lebanon

5852,227367,AFSIM,Berkshire Hathaway Insurance   Energy Units Drive Growth,opinion,"On Nov 19  we issued an updated research report on Berkshire Hathaway Inc  NYSE BRKa   The company reported third quarter operating earnings of  1 91 per share  way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 70  Earnings also compared favorably with  1 49 per share reported in the year ago quarter  


Earnings growth came primarily from the insurance business which benefited from higher underwriting income thanks to the absence of catastrophic claims and from the energy business  which benefited from last year s acquisition of NV Energy in Nevada  Other segments at Manufacturing  Service and Retailing and Finance and Financial products also contributed to earnings growth albeit at a lesser degree   


Though Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate  housing a number of businesses  its property and casualty insurance business has been the engine behind its growth  The segment has successfully released huge moat  investible surplus   making numerous acquisitions possible for the company  This strength differentiates Berkshire s insurance companies from its competitors 


Berkshire s economically sensitive non insurance businesses   utilities and energy  and manufacturing  service and retail   are performing well and are expected to continue doing so with the economy improving  The utilities and energy business is witnessing substantial growth led by increased revenues from BNSF  the railway which was acquired in Feb 2010  The NV Energy acquisition also added fuel for further growth of the business  


Berkshire s Finance and Financial Products segment is also performing well after suffering from a soft housing market in the recent past  We expect improving trends in this business segment given that the housing market is back on track 


Moreover  with Warren Buffett at the helm  the company has created tremendous value for its shareholders over the past several years  A strong capital position along with his unique skills in making the right acquisitions has made Berkshire a conglomerate with equity stake in many big companies

5854,227369,AFSIM,A Year Of Speedy Recovery For U S  Insurers ,opinion,"The possible reversal of the persisting low interest rate environment and modest strengthening of the key economic indicators   employment  real estate  GDP and stock market   should help insurers witness accelerated recovery in 2015  Moreover  an already strong liquidity profile  conservative product design and evolving coverage opportunity should lead the industry to an upside 
Following a slowdown in Q1  which saw an 8 7  earnings decline on 0 6  revenue drop  the insurance industry witnessed a recovery in the next two quarters  keeping pace with the broader finance sector  Earnings growth in Q2 and Q3 came in at 0 1  and 6 1  on revenue growth of 5 5  and 6 6   respectively  With no major headwind cropping up in Q4 and most of the factors remaining favorable  the growth trend is likely to continue  While the pace of premium rate increase remained subdued due to the still low interest rate environment  momentum is due shortly as the rate hike seems imminent  However  fundamental challenges   such as weak underwriting gains and low investment yields   and heightened market competition might continue to mar profitability to some extent  No matter what  the ongoing reserve development will keep supporting insurers  financials  Also  increasing demand from economically recuperating American households should place insurers in a favorable pricing cycle  A lot depends on catastrophe losses too  Following two below normal seasons in a row  the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season  spanning from Jun 1 to Nov 30  is again expected to keep catastrophe losses modest  This should lead to recovery in underwriting and a lower combined ratio for Property   Casualty  P C  insurers  Moreover  the possibility of lower catastrophe losses will keep lowering premium rates Time to Rethink Regulation  Apparently  a safe and sleepy business nature keeps U S  insurers out of federal regulations  which could have marred business expansion  But the industry is yet to be strongly braced by the advantages of operating under state run regulations  Instead  decentralized regulation and consumer protection make the industry susceptible to insolvency  Now  the changing nature of business   more like banks in terms of liabilities   perhaps calls for federal oversight  Though the necessity for a regulatory revamp has been strongly felt after witnessing the success of banks  this will delve another blow to the tottering industry  A provision of the 2010 Dodd Frank Act requires setting minimum capital and leverage standards on insurance companies as well  but these are yet to be implemented by U S  lawmakers  who are considering the distinct business fundamentals unlike banks  But the industry  which accounts for 7  of GDP in terms of insurance premiums paid each year  is not likely to be relieved of Federal Reserve control for very long Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  insurers are broadly grouped in the Finance sector  one of 16 Zacks sectors  and are further sub divided into five industries at the expanded level  P C  Multiline  Accident   Health  Life and Brokers  The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry  We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit     As a guideline  the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank  88 and lower is  Positive   between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and  177 and higher is  Negative   The Zacks Industry Rank for Property   Casualty is  31  Multiline is  70  Life is  76  Brokers is  97 and Accident   Health is  114 Earnings Trends The Insurance industry  which is the medium level  or M level  component of the broader Finance sector  witnessed Q3 earnings beat ratio  percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises  of 77 3   while the revenue beat ratio was 68 2   The broader Finance sector showed a recovery from Q2 in terms of growth  The sector witnessed year over year earnings growth of 3 8  compared with 0 9  in the prior quarter  Revenues however witnessed a 10 7  decline compared with 2 4  increase in the prior quarter  For Q4 and FY14  the sector is expected to witness earnings growth of 0 3  and 16 2   respectively  Revenues are expected to decline 4 8  in Q4 but increase 2 8  in FY14  However  the sector s Q3 beat ratios for earnings and revenues were impressive at 70 4  and 63   respectively  For a detailed look at the earnings trend for this sector and others  please read our latest  report  Bottom Line Looking at the broader trends  the overall health of the industry  which endured significant pricing pressure and reduced insured exposure since the latest recession  has recently improved on a stepped up macro economy  Moreover  learning from past experiences  insurers are now resorting to expense saving measures  If insurers manage to overcome the short term resistance that may be holding back premium rate increase  they should ultimately witness margin expansion  Also  in the absence of federal regulation  insurers can take on new challenges with the ample capital that they now have  That said  though the market condition isn t soft anymore  reasonable hardening is not expected at least in the near term  Moreover  lack of real employment growth and legislative challenges will continue to restrict insurers  ability to return to the historical growth rate How to Play Insurance Sector Given the expected upturn of the sector  it could be a prudent idea to bet on a few insurance stocks that still look cheap but carry a favorable Zacks Rank  We have handpicked 5 such stocks here
