23471,244986,ECPG,Should Value Investors Pick Encore Capital  ECPG  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Encore Capital Group  Inc    NASDAQ ECPG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Encore Capital has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 24  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 35  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Encore Capital s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Moreover  the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock  suggesting it might be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 8 37  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Encore Capital has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 09  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Encore Capital stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Encore Capital has a P S ratio of about 0 81  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 36 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years As we can see  the stock is trading near its median value for the time period from a P S metric  This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Encore Capital currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Encore Capital a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Encore Capital is 0 51  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 0 66  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  ECPG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Encore Capital might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of D  This gives ECPG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower  while the full year estimate has seen seven upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 5 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Encore Capital Group Inc Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEncore Capital is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 35   and a solid Zacks Rank instills investor confidence However  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall as over the past two years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Encore Capital Just Released  Zacks  7

23617,245132,ECPG,Is Encore Capital Group  ECPG  A Great Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Encore Capital Group  Inc    NASDAQ ECPG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Encore Capital Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 6 65  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 17 13  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Encore Capital Group s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 8 93  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 75  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Encore Capital Group has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 6 27  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Encore Capital Group s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Encore Capital Group has a P S ratio of about 0 82  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 07 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Encore Capital Group currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes ECPG a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in 5 96  which is slightly better than the industry average of 6 14  Clearly  ECPG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Encore Capital Group might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of C  This gives ECPG a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and four lower  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 5 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen 3 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Encore Capital Group Inc Price and Consensus    Despite this mixed trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  on the back of its strong value metrics and this is why we are expecting above average performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineEncore Capital Group is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Boasting a formidable industry rank  top 7  out of more than 250 industries  and a strong Zacks Rank  the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will you retire a millionaire  One out of every six people retires a multimillionaire  Get smart tips you can do today to become one of them in a new Special Report   7

23646,245161,ECPG,Is Encore Capital Group  ECPG  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Encore Capital Group  Inc    NASDAQ ECPG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Encore Capital has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11 9 as you can see below This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at 21 4  If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Encore Capital s current PE below its highs  suggesting a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Encore Capital has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 2   which is faintly lower than the current figure  So it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Encore Capital stock in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  the company has a P S ratio of about 1  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Encore Capital currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Encore Capital a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 8 9  which is slightly far better than the industry average of 9  Clearly  ECPG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Encore Capital might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of A  This gives ECPG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending upwards  The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the next year estimate has seen two upward revisions and two downward revision in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has increased by 5 7  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Encore Capital Group Inc Price and Consensus   Even though Encore Capital has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineThe Finance   Consumer Loans industry is characterized by stiff competition that weighs on the individual companies  financials  The adverse impact of currency fluctuation has also been hurting the industry  Also  the future success of this space is dependent on the companies  ability to adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards  any failure in which might cause major decline in revenues Currently the industry carries a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 23  out of more than 250 industries   which dims the sparkle on Encore Capital stock too  As you can see below  the industry has also widely underperformed the broader market over the past three years  Thus  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to favorable before investing

23648,245163,ECPG,Navient s  NAVI  Ratings Affirmed By Moody s  Outlook Stable,opinion,"Navient Corporation s   NASDAQ NAVI   ratings have been affirmed by Moody s Investors Service  The Wilmington  DE based lender s senior unsecured debt rating has been reiterated as Ba3  senior unsecured debt shelf rating as  P Ba3 and Corporate Family Rating as Ba3  Also  the outlook has remained stable 
Reasons Behind Unchanged Ratings
Moody s stable ratings are reflective of Navient s constant financial performance and good asset quality on the back of  105 billion student loan portfolio  Further  the rating agency is optimistic of Navient s acquisition of Earnest  a financial technology company in November 2017  Per Moody s  this acquisition might help Navient reduce the pace of declining net income if it focuses on development of new and existing businesses   
This acquisition is likely to boost Navient as it marks the company s comeback in student loan origination market  After becoming one of the servicers to U S  Department of Education under Direct Student Loan Program in 2010  the company stopped originating new FFELP loans  Earnest s student loan refinancing and personal loan offerings will support Navient s declining loan portfolio  particularly private student loan portfolio 
Also  Moody s was positive on Navient s decision to suspend share buyback program in order to reduce leverage and focus on growing its private student lending portfolio  Also  it expects to resume buyback in the second half of 2018 
Moody s affirmed the outlook on expectations that Navient would continue to execute its origination strategy  maintain solid financial performance and current leverage levels along with conservatively managing its liquidity and funding requirements 
What Can Trigger Change in Moody s Ratings
Rating for Navient can be upgraded in case Moody s feels that the lender has successfully build its private loan originating business and reduced declining trend of its loan portfolio 
At the same time  ratings can go down if the financial performance of Navient deteriorates or the value of the investment portfolio declines 
The company s shares have lost 9 8  in the past year against 2 8  growth of the

23791,245306,ECPG,7 Small Cap Stocks To Buy In The Service Sector,opinion,"With the market so volatile and investors generally heading for the exits  many good companies can be acquired today for cheap  The following 7 stocks appear to be good buys right now with terrific valuations and solid history of earnings growth  In a few cases  the undervaluation is extreme due to temporary issues 
Each stock listed here has a  under 10  a P B ratio under 1 and has a positive earnings growth history in the previous 5 years  Whether the earnings will continue to grow or not  the stocks are priced reasonably attractively in the market  This list does not contain any energy or commodities names  which have been the primary drivers of the stock market weakness in the recent months  More than half of these are banks or financial companies of some kind that have also seen declines recently 
These companies range from  30 million to  1 billion in market capitalization  Please note that additional detailed data is in the spreadsheet attached to this article 
Banks and Financial Institutions
Middlefield Banc Corp  O MBCN 
This is a 100 year old bank serving Central Ohio  The stock pays a 3 26  dividend  The company only commands a valuation of about  63 million and is very thinly traded  so  can be an issue  However  the company has had consistent revenues and profits historically  16  5 yr EPS growth  and since Dec 2012  it has grown its book value by 21  The stock can be bought at about 1x book value and a little less than 10x earnings  This is the most expensive stock in this list of 7 
Northrim BanCorp Inc  O NRIM 
Northrim Bancorp sports similar multiples to Middlefield with stock being priced at 9x earnings and 0 93 times book value and 5 year EPS growth of 16  or so and delivers a 3 15  yield in dividends  The bank operates in Anchorage  Alaska and is about  170 million in market cap  I like this better than Middlefield as the stock is more liquid  a little less expensive and  is a little stronger 
Medallion Financial Corp   O TAXI 
Medallion Financial is a specialty finance company that primarily finances taxicab medallions in New York City  This is actually a very interesting situation and I am sure this will pique the interest of many value investors  Medallion values are now plummeting due to the disruption in the market brought on by new services like Uber and Lyft  For the value investor in you  it is worth noting that the stock price now reflects tremendous discount to the value   trading at less than 7 times earnings and 70  of the book value  The company also operates in other lines of businesses  including banking  so it has the ability to pivot and grow in other areas  The stock currently pays a 13 3  dividend yield  and the EPS has on average grown 13 4  in the last 5 years 
World Acceptance Corp  O WRLD 
A credit services company that services subprime market to individuals and small businesses  The stock trades at around 3 times earnings and 80  of the book value  Earnings share have grown about 22  on average in the previous 5 years  The stock has suffered with rest of the subprime consumer lending industry with new regulations and enforcements by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  CFPB   This is a very hated industry and as a result certain stocks can be selling at distressed levels 
Encore Capital Group  O ECPG 
The company operates a debt recovery service and tax lien purchasing and servicing business  A little similar to World Acceptance Corp but on the other end of the loan default and not necessarily all sub prime  The stock sells at 88  of the book and about 5 times earnings  Almost 50  of the shares have been shorted 
Other Industries
Roadrunner Transportation Services Holdings  N RRTS 
The company provides Truckload and Less Than Truck Load  LTL  transportation services  It also has a customs brokerage business  The stock is at 9 6 times earnings and 75  of the book value  The EPS has grown at about 23  rate over the previous 5 years 
Iconix Brand Group Inc  O ICON 
Iconix is a brand management company that pioneered this business model  It owns brands such as Candies  Ecko  Fieldcrest  Joe Boxer  Rampage  Mudd  London Fog  Sharper Image and many more  The company is undergoing a restatement of its previous financial statements as a result of a SEC investigation in its accounting of joint ventures in the various parts of the world  The restatement should have no impact on the free cash flow according to the company  I can give you the P E and other ratios as of now  but they are going to be restated and therefore not relevant for any sort of analysis  The restatement will be completed in March and it may be worthwhile to keep this stock in your watchlist  The stock has fallen 75  in the previous 52 weeks  Sports Direct  L SPD   a retailer out of UK has accumulated a 14 4  stake in Iconix as of January of this year ",2016-03-01,Shailesh Kumar,https://www.investing.com/analysis/7-small-cap-stocks-to-buy-in-the-service-sector-200119923,200119923
