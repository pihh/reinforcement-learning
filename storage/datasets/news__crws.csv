2505,224020,CRWS,DISH Network Extends Contract With Citadel Communications,opinion,"Satellite TV service provider DISH Network Corporation   NASDAQ DISH   and Citadel Communications    an American private broadcasting company    has agreed for a temporary extension of their current contract till Aug 23  2017 
The company expected a cut off of the signal for the local ABC affiliate  WLNE TV  in Providence  Rhode Island  However  to avoid any service disruption  it started offering free installation of HD over the air antennas to qualified local subscribers 
Currently  the company is trying hard to mitigate the dispute with its owner over carriage fees and to keep ABC6 available on DISH Network  But the inflexible approach and appalling demands of Citadel is making it difficult for the company to reach an agreement with the broadcasters 
Notably  DISH Network lost a net of 196 000 pay TV subscribers in the second quarter 2017 due to a rise in programming cost  As of Jun 30  2017  the company had approximately 13 332 million pay TV subscribers  down 1 9  year over year 
In fact  more consumers are now acquiescent to switching to free over the air reception to fight the rising subscription costs  Also  the providers  even with a risk of losing add on fees after cancelling local station packages  are finding different ways to suit their customers   
Earlier  DISH Network could avert the blackout of 129 Sinclair TV stations on its satellite pay TV service by reaching a short term extension agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group too  Federal Communications Commission  FCC  helped them to come to this short term broadcast retransmission extension 
Price Performance and Zacks Rank
DISH Network s price performance has been dull for the last six months  The company s stock declined 8 9  against the  gain of 6 4  in the same period  Also  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

2506,224021,CRWS,7 Low Price to Sales Stocks Worth Buying,opinion,A stock s Price to Sales ratio reflects how much investors are paying for each dollar of revenues generated by the company If the Price to Sales ratio is 1  it means that investors are paying  1 for every  1 of revenues generated by the company  So  it goes without saying that a stock with Price to Sales below 1 is a good bargain  as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth   Thus  a stock with a lower Price to Sales ratio is more suitable for investment versus a stock with a high Price to Sales ratio While Price to Earnings is the first thing to cross one s mind while using valuation metrics  Price to Sales has emerged as a convenient tool to determine the value of stocks that are incurring losses or are in an early cycle of development  generating meager or no profits Though a loss making company with a negative Price to Earnings ratio falls out of investors  favor  its Price to Sales could indicate the hidden strength of its business  This underrated ratio is also used to identify recovery situation or ensure that a company s growth is not overvalued Price to Sales is often preferred over Price to Earnings as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures  However  sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable However  one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and low Price to Sales is not an ideal choice  The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point  leading to further share issuance and a rise in market cap and ultimately a higher Price to Sales ratio In any case  the Price to Sales ratio used in isolation can t do the trick  One should also analyze other ratios like Price Earnings  Price Book  Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Sales less than Median Price to Sales for its Industry  The lower the Price to Sales ratio  the better Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than Median Price to Earnings for its Industry  The lower  the better Price to Book  common Equity  less than Median Price to Book for its Industry  This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock Debt to Equity  Most Recent  less than Median Debt to Equity for its Industry  A company with less debt should have a stable Price to Sales ratio

2507,224022,CRWS,5 Breakout Stocks Offering Astounding Returns,opinion,As popular as it is divisive  a breakout strategy is one of the most frequently used techniques among active investors  The idea is fairly simple    to identify stocks trading within a narrow band and buy them when they move above this channel or sell when they move below  If a stock moves above the channel  it promises substantial gains for investors But critics warn against the risk of timing such a move incorrectly or identifying the wrong breakout level  However  when executed correctly  this strategy can yield lucrative gains  which explains its enduring popularity Identifying Breakout StocksThe essence of this strategy lies in calculating the support and resistance levels of a stock  The lower bound of a stock s trading channel is its support level and it should be sold as soon as it threatens to fall lower  On the other hand  the ceiling is a stock s breakout level and it can gain substantially if it breaks the resistance level When a stock is close to its support level  demand is literally hitting the floor  On the other hand  demand rises when it is breaching its resistance level  signaling the right time to make a lucrative addition to your portfolio  The idea is to pick stocks which have just broken above their resistance barriers or are very closing to doing so Checking Whether It s for RealStocks that have breached their resistance levels should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive    Current Price  52 Week High greater than or equal to 0 9  Stocks which are trading 90  close to their 52 week highs    Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Strong Buy

breakout strategy is one of the most frequently used techniques among active investors  The idea is fairly simple    to identify stocks trading within a narrow band and buy them when they move above this channel or sell when they move below  If a stock moves above the channel  it promises substantial gains for investors But critics warn against the risk of timing such a move incorrectly or identifying the wrong breakout level  However  when executed correctly  this strategy can yield lucrative gains  which explains its enduring popularity Identifying Breakout StocksThe essence of this strategy lies in calculating the support and resistance levels of a stock  The lower bound of a stock s trading channel is its support level and it should be sold as soon as it threatens to fall lower  On the other hand  the ceiling is a stock s breakout level and it can gain substantially if it breaks the resistance level When a stock is close to its support level  demand is literally hitting the floor  On the other hand  demand rises when it is breaching its resistance level  signaling the right time to make a lucrative addition to your portfolio  The idea is to pick stocks which have just broken above their resistance barriers or are very closing to doing so Checking Whether It s for RealStocks that have breached their resistance levels should ideally be in high demand among traders  But the test of whether this is a genuine breakout is when they go on to attain higher prices and the old barrier becomes a new support  This is why it is important to determine whether a long term price trend is about to emerge Only a study of long term trends can determine whether the existing trading channel has been breached effectively  This indicates the strength of the support or resistance levels  If you can identify the effective channel for a stock  picking it even at a not so reasonable price would give you significant returns Screening Parameters  Percentage price change
