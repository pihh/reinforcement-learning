118782,340297,FMC,China Lithium King Pummeled in Hong Kong Debut Amid Stocks Rout,news," Bloomberg     Ganfeng Lithium Co  slumped on its trading debut in Hong Kong as fresh turmoil in global markets added to weaker sentiment in the battery material sector 
The stock fell as much as 28 percent to HK 11 80 a share and traded at HK 12 38 as of 9 39am after being priced at HK 16 50  the lowest end of its offer range  Its Shenzhen listed shares are down 46 percent this year 
Prices for lithium have declined this year amid concerns over the arrival of new supply and signs of weaker demand in China  falling about 8 percent in 2018  according to a Benchmark Mineral Intelligence index  Equity markets in Asia tumbled after the S P 500 Index fell the most since February 
 Investors have decided to pause their investments around lithium and cobalt   said Chris Berry  a New York based analyst at House Mountain Partners LLC and consultant to companies in the sector   Macro economic concerns are driving the sentiment right now  With the threat of tariffs and trade war  there s just a lot of uncertainty right now

Lithium producers needed to be more conservative in the face of concerns about oversupply  Ganfeng s Vice Chairman Wang Xiaoshen said in an interview on Oct  9  He delivered a cautious message on growth and said it was time to  fasten seat belts  for lithium producers 
Ganfeng s debut in Hong Kong is being watched together with another initial offering in New York to gauge investor sentiment on lithium  Livent Inc   a lithium spin off from chemicals producer  FMC Corp   NYSE FMC    is due to go public later Thursday   The Ganfeng IPO is going to raise less money than we thought and Livent is probably going to struggle a little bit just like Ganfeng  Berry said

118783,340298,FMC,Lithium Spinoff CEO Warns Electric Car Craze May Lead to Shortages ,news," Bloomberg     The market for lithium will remain tight through 2025 as producers struggle to ramp up production fast enough to meet demand for the mineral that s essential in making batteries for electric vehicles  Livent Corp  Chief Executive Paul Graves said 
 We think demand is going to grow almost five times larger in 2025 than it was in 2017   Graves said in an interview Thursday in New York   Our biggest challenge is producing enough to meet the demand    there s a much greater risk that this market is consistently in a deficit in the near future  
Investor interest for lithium has been wavering as prices tumble this year  amid speculation producers may flood the market with supply  That s a reversal from the rally that tripled prices in the three years through 2017  Some companies are struggling to raise money for expansion  dimming the global supply outlook  Graves said  Some companies are also facing regulatory hurdles that could thwart efforts to boost output  he said said 
Shares of Livent  a spin off from chemical manufacturer  FMC Corp   NYSE FMC    fell 4 2 percent to  16 28 a share at 2 53 p m  Thursday  its first trading day on the New York Stock Exchange  Standard   Poor s Index headed for its longest losing streak of Donald Trump s presidency 
Production will trail consumption of lithium carbonate by 250 000 tons in 2025  said Graves  47  who worked at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS   for 12 years  including as co head of natural resources in Asia  He served as CFO at FMC before joining Livent 
Livent s estimates for demand of 1 million tons in lithium carbonate for 2025 compares with Bloomberg NEF s forecast of 850 000 in its report in August 
Supply will outstrip demand in 2018 as two new mines start production and another one expands  BNEF analysts Logan Goldie Scot and James Frith said   Based on current announcements  the market will begin to tighten again by 2024  although there is sufficient time for miners to look at further capacity expansions   they said 
Extremely Difficult
Livent sold 20 million shares at  17 each  below the price range of  18 to  20 that the company had expected in its filing on October 1  The initial public offering raised  390 million  Graves said 
 Pricing an IPO in those market conditions is extremely difficult   Graves said   We were asking people to step in and commit capital in a market that was down 800 points   he said  referring to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumping Wednesday by the most in eight months  The gauge fell Thursday for a third straight session 
Its Chinese competitor  Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium Co   fell more than 28 percent in its first trading day in Hong Kong  even after pricing the shares at the bottom of a target range 
 I think investors have decided to pause the investments around lithium and cobalt   Chris Berry  a New York based energy metals analyst and founder of research firm House Mountain Partners LLC   said by phone on Wednesday   Macro economic concerns are driving the sentiment right now  
In South America  where FMC operates the Salar del Hombre Muerto mine in Argentina  lithium carbonate fell to  14 500 per ton in September  from a record high of  15 750 per ton in June  according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence  The research firm s gauge of prices across the main regions is down 8 2 percent this year  after climbing 208 percent in the three years ended Dec  31 
 I have no doubts about the demand side and I have no doubts that there is a good deal of capital out there that s looking to be deployed   Berry said   But everyone s skittish about China  tariffs  late cycle economic growth and interest rates on the rise in the U S  ",2018-10-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/lithiumspinoff-ceo-warns-electriccar-craze-may-lead-to-shortages-1641236,1641236
118784,340299,FMC,Lithium Market  Problematic  on Project Delays  Livent CEO Says,news," Bloomberg     The lithium industry s struggle to match booming demand for the rechargeable battery ingredient is  problematic  and will further tighten the market  according to the only lithium pure play trading in New York 
 It s almost impossible for me to see a meaningful decrease  in lithium prices  Livent Corp  Chief Executive Officer Paul Graves said in a telephone interview Tuesday after the company presented quarterly earnings   Whenever you have less supply than expected  it will create more tightness  
Santiago based SQM was the latest lithium producer to report a project delay as suppliers react to global demand that  according to Graves  probably will quadruple by 2025 as electric vehicle sales accelerate

118823,340338,FMC,As China ties up global lithium  Asian rivals must bet big on South America,news,"By Dave Sherwood and Nicole Mordant SANTIAGO VANCOUVER  Reuters    South America s lithium triangle is the lowest cost place to produce the vital battery ingredient  but political hurdles will require Japanese and South Korean companies to make big investments to crack into the region as they chase Chinese rivals who have tied up resources in other parts of the world  Even China  the leader in the global race for the metal used in batteries for everything from smartphones to electric cars  has had its efforts thwarted in the lithium triangle of Bolivia  Chile and Argentina  home to around two thirds of global reserves  Because of China s problems  market experts say the lithium triangle is one place South Korean and Japanese auto and battery makers can play catch up  The race will go to whichever producers can best navigate policy obstacles in all three countries  But Panasonic  Samsung  KS 005930  and other South Korean and Japanese companies focused on long term supply contracts find themselves further behind the Chinese  who have been aggressively going after physical assets elsewhere  such as purchasing their own mines  JOLTED OUT OF COMFORT ZONES South Korean and Japanese firms have relied largely on South American lithium  and formed longstanding relationships with producers there  But they have been jolted out of their comfort zones in the last year as China has engaged in a deal making spree elsewhere in the world  spurred by government quotas for electric car sales   The Japanese and Koreans are  certainly looking for supplies  in South America  said Henk van Alphen  CEO of small Chilean lithium brine developer  Wealth Minerals Ltd   V WML   which has held talks with battery makers from both countries   Japanese and Korean companies have dipped a toe in backing new lithium mine developers  including in Latin America where Japanese carmaker Toyota  T 8105  invested in an Argentine lithium project  Company executives and government officials from those countries say more is needed    How to secure metal supplies is one of the interests I have these days   Park Jin soo  chief executive and vice chairman of LG Chem  KS 051910  told reporters in Daesan  South Korea  last month    We could consider cooperating with companies which have such metals  or if needed  a joint venture or a long term deal  and we are making a lot of plans for the next few years    A Korean official said the government was looking at how to back the private sector  Previous efforts by Korean state development agencies have been halting  especially in Bolivia where a lithium initiative is mired in debt    We are currently focused on giving support to the private sector like POSCO or  Samsung SDI  on the sideline   said the official speaking on condition of anonymity   Japan s Panasonic Corp  T 6752  is  working to secure stable supplies of battery materials  through such steps as directly sourcing raw materials and diversifying sourcing channels   said a spokeswoman  declining to comment on specific regions  In February  a delegation of dozens of Japanese companies toured Argentine provinces that are home to most of that country s lithium reserves   THE REAL PRIZE  Chinese companies have aggressively pursued supply elsewhere  inking several deals with mine developers in Australia  Canada and Africa in the past year   In Chile  however  the Chinese have struggled to get a significant foothold in the lithium industry  leaving an opening for others   Authorities in Chile balked when Chinese lithium giant Tianqi moved to purchase a coveted 32 percent stake in Chile s SQM  the world s lowest cost producer  Chile development agency Corfo filed a complaint with anti trust regulators to block the sale  Now Tianqi is talking to Chile s top anti trust prosecutor about the yet to be inked deal  N SQM   SN SQM pb    Such a deal would be  nerve wracking for Korean and Japanese companies  who have long standing arrangements with the producers like SQM  said van Alphen  of Wealth Minerals  These relationships would be rocked if Tianqi purchased even a minority stake in the top producer   South Korean battery maker Samsung SDI  KS 006400  and metals supplier Posco have committed to building a battery materials plant in Chile in exchange for securing lithium at a discount from SQM and U S  based  Albemarle   N ALB   the country s two biggest producers    Why stick a cathode facility in Chile  It is likely to be more expensive than in Korea or China or Japan  It is all to do with security of supply   said Robert Baylis  managing director at  consultants Roskill Information Services in London   The real prize  according to a source with knowledge of the transactions  is a toehold in Chile s lithium industry and the possibility for eventual expansion   Chile has proven particularly hard to court  prioritizing access and increased production quotas for SQM and Albemarle and more recently  state miner Codelco   The country has also been closely guarding entry of new miners  encouraging companies to do business with known entities  Yet investors are watching a handful of smaller deals in the lithium triangle which could hint at potential openings in Chile for newcomers seeking reliable physical assets   Topping those deals is Salar Blanco  a project controlled by Lithium Power International of Australia and Canada s Bearing Lithium  which in March secured a rare Chilean export permit   There are also opportunities in Argentina and Canada where companies can jump on investments if they move swiftly    If you look at the emerging low cost lithium chemical projects such as Cauchari  Sal de Vida  Argentina   and Nemaska  Canada   said Joe Lowry  an independent industry consultant who worked for U S  based lithium producer  FMC Corp   N FMC   The most appealing thing about those projects  he added  is that

for batteries used in electric cars   are agreeing long term contracts with their customers to fund the investments needed to address a looming shortfall  Demand for battery grade lithium compounds is expected to skyrocket in the next decades in tandem with soaring demand for electric cars as governments and individual consumers try to reduce their carbon footprint   Although there s plenty of lithium around  the problem is ensuring there is enough capacity to process it   Battery makers and other end users such as car manufacturers will need to sign multi year deals that encourage large producers to invest more  and faster  industry sources say  Some of that is already happening   We ve established the timeline for our own expansion based on the commitments our customers are making with us   said Tom Schneberger  global business director at U S  listed FMC Lithium  N FMC   one of the world s top four producers    Our first priority will be to provide the adequate supply of the

LIMITED VISIBILITY The lithium ion batteries needed to power electric cars use lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide  but the industry typically talks in terms of lithium carbonate equivalent which contains both  Two types of lithium deposits dominate   One is hard rock as found in Australia  for which ready to  go capacity to produce battery grade lithium can take up to three years  The other is brine  mostly found in Chile and Argentina  which can take seven years or more   China has reserves of both  Consultants Roskill estimate 785 000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent a year will be needed by 2025  amounting to a 26 000 tonne shortfall from anticipated supply  compared to 217 000 tonnes of demand versus 227 000 tonnes of supply this year  Others expect an even larger deficit   There s limited visibility into where we re going to get the last 200 000 tonnes of lithium if we hit the numbers Roskill is expecting for 2025   said Seth Ginns  a managing director at Jennison Associates   Jennison manages more than  164 billion of investment and is a top 10 investor in both FMC and U S  listed  Albemarle   N ALB   another of the top four producers   We estimate the lithium industry is going to need between  4  5 billion of investment out to 2025   said Simon Moores  managing director at Benchmark Minerals Intelligence   Price projections out to 2025 are not available  but Benchmark estimates prices of lithium carbonate will average  13 000 a ton over the 2017 2020 period from around  9 000 a ton in 2015 2016  Demand for lithium hydroxide  preferred over carbonate as it allows greater battery capacity and longer life  is expected to grow at a faster pace  Benchmark predicts the price to average  18 000 a ton between 2017 2020 against  14 000 in 2015 2016   FOUR

Lithium Corporation  SZ 002466  together accounted for 66 percent of the world s lithium carbonate equivalent last year  Wood Mackenzie consultant James Whiteside puts the figure at 78 percent  FMC s lithium hydroxide capacity rose 80 percent in 2017 to 18 000 tonnes a year  and it has plans to boost that to 30 000 tonnes by the end of 2019  After that  capacity will be expanded as required by demand  FMC s Schneberger said  Albemarle is planning to expand its lithium carbonate equivalent capacity to 165 000 tonnes by 2021 from 89 000 tonnes this year  a spokesperson said   We anticipate

48 000 tonnes currently  It also has joint ventures in Argentina and Australia to develop deposits   Tianqi Lithium declined to comment on its investment plans   Another company actively investing is Australia s Orocobre  which planned to produce 17 500 tonnes a year of lithium carbonate at its Olaroz facility in Argentina  Severe weather cut this year s production to 11 700 11 800 tonnes  however  Whiteside said Orocobre s difficulties were typical of many smaller players  noting that the Olaroz facility was the first new major brine operation started in 20 years   Because the number of brine operations has been so few historically  there are very few technically experienced chemical engineers to assist these junior companies   he said   There are people out there promoting brine projects

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   RDS A   TOTAL  TOT  and Becton  Dickinson  BDX   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Royal Dutch Shell s shares have outperformed the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry year to date   0 9  vs   0 5    The Zacks analyst believes that the Anglo Dutch company s position as a key supplier of liquefied natural gas should further benefit its long term cash flow growth on the back of attractive growth opportunities 
Europe s largest oil company s Q3 earnings was ahead of analysts  expectations  driven by strong performance from the Downstream and Integrated Gas units 
Moreover  its dividend is safe and secure  However  there are worries over drop in its cash flow excluding working capital while the company s poor reserve replacement ratio raises concerns about future production  Moreover  Shell s  1 7  2 3 billion impairment charge is expected to increase gearing  Hence  investors are advised to wait for a better entry point 
 You can  
Shares of TOTAL have gained  8 3  in the past three months against the Zacks Integrated International Oil industry s rise of  0 7   The Zacks analyst believes that the company continues to benefit on account of strong contribution from startups and the expanding upstream portfolio that has above industry average exposure to the faster growing hydrocarbon producing regions of the world 
Strategic acquisitions and divestment of assets that are not in sync with its long term objectives are going to boost performance and further strengthen the company s cash flow generation capability  Cost saving initiatives are also aiding it to boost margins 
However  TOTAL s operations in some politically troubled regions and increasing competition might affect profitability  Due to its global presence  the company is exposed to risks associated with pursuing business abroad 
 You can  
Becton  Dickinson s shares have gained 10 2  over the past six months against the Zacks Dental Supplies industry s decline of  10 5   The Zacks analyst believes that solid performance by the core BD Medical and Interventional segments instills optimism in the stock 
Domestic revenues increased year over year in recent times  driven by segmental strength  Growth in Europe and APAC is an added positive  Expansion in gross margin is also encouraging  BD has issued a solid guidance for fiscal 2020  which is indicative of bright prospects 
A series of product launches is expected to boost the stock further  On the flip side  a drop in operating margin raises concern  Management expects unfavorable foreign currency to partially mar BD s bottom line in fiscal 2020 and first quarter fiscal results  Competition in the MedTech space is stiff  The stock is overvalued at the moment

118945,340460,FMC,Earnings Preview  FMC  FMC  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects FMC  FMC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chemical producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 64 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 20 billion  down 4 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 19  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FMC 
For FMC  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 75  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FMC will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FMC would post earnings of  1 62 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 72  delivering a surprise of  6 17  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
FMC doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-fmc-fmc-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200443267,200443267

What s Next for FMC 
While FMC has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

118985,340500,FMC,12 Exceptional Investments In The Process Industries Sector  Part 14 ,opinion,"Introduction
One of the main goals of this series of articles is to illustrate the significant differences between individual stocks  and the significant differences between different sectors  Therefore  from this perspective  I have been attempting to illustrate the  nature of the beast  for each of the sectors I have covered  The Process Industries Sector as reported by FactSet does consist of companies that are cyclical in nature  However  just as we ve seen with other sectors  some are more cyclical than others 
Moreover  cyclicality is an attribute that can be problematic for many investors  but not necessarily a long term negative  To clarify that statement  every research candidate except for one  International Paper  covered in this article has dramatically outperformed the S P 500 on both dividend income and total return over the long run  However  that exceptional performance has not always been a smooth ride relative to the cyclical nature of these companies  operating histories  Consequently  I feel comfortable stating that being a long term investor in cyclical companies such as those covered here can be very challenging  Therefore  many investors might lack the fortitude to be able to stay the course during those times when earnings and cash flows are faltering 
On the other hand  the historical dividend records of most of these research candidates have been quite good and have grown consistently despite earnings cyclicality  Therefore  investors focused on earning a steadily increasing stream of dividend income can be more apt to ride through the cycles in order to achieve the strong long term returns  More simply stated  although short to intermediate term stock prices and operating results can be quite volatile  dividend growth is both more reliable and attractive  Consequently  most of these research candidates have generated more total cumulative dividend income than the market  and if held long enough  most have also produced higher growth and total returns as well 
Additionally  although cyclicality can be unnerving at times  it can also represent the precursor to significantly higher intermediate returns than those available from more  steady Eddie  type companies  One of the reasons for these  greater intermediate returns  phenomenon is the excitement created by extremely high year to year growth rates when companies are coming off a low point in their operating cycle  High growth off a low base generates extremely high quarterly and annual earnings reports that can get investors temporarily quite enthusiastic about the companies  I will be clearly illustrating this in the analyze out loud video later in this article 
A Sector By Sector Review
This is part 14 of a series where I have conducted a simple screening looking for value over the overall market based on industry classifications and subindustry classifications reported by FactSet Research Systems  Inc 
In part 1 found here I covered the Consumer Services Sector  In part 2 found here I covered the Communication Sector  In part 3 found here I covered the Consumer Durables Sector and its many diverse subsectors  In part 4 found here I covered Consumer Nondurables  In part 5 found here I covered companies in the Consumer Services Sector  In part 6 found here I covered the Distribution Services Sector  In part 7 found here I covered the Electronic Technology Sector  In part 8 found here I covered the Energy Minerals Sector  In part 9 found here I covered the Finance Sector  In part 10 found here I covered the Health Services Sector  In part 11 found here I covered the Health Technology Sector  In part 12 found here I covered the Industrial Services Sector  In part 13 found here I covered the Non Energy Minerals Sector 
In this part 14 I will be covering the Process Industries Sector 
In each article in this series  I will be providing a listing of screened research candidates from each of the following industry sectors  the sector I m covering in this article is marked in green

A Simple Valuation and Quality Screening Process
With this series of articles  I will be presenting a screening of companies that have become attractively valued primarily as a result of the bearish market activities experienced in 2018 from each of the above sectors  I will be applying a rather simple valuation and quality oriented screen across each of the sectors  First  I have screened for investment grade S P credit ratings of BBB  or above  Next  I have screened for low valuations based on P E ratios between 2 and 17  Finally  I have screened for long term debt to capital no greater than 70  
By keeping my screen simple  and at the same time rather broad  I will be able to identify attractively valued research candidates that I might have overlooked through a more rigorous screening process  In other words  I m looking for fresh ideas that I might have previously been overlooking  Furthermore  I want to be clear that I do not consider every candidate that I have discovered as suitable for every investor  However  I do consider them all to be attractively valued  Additionally  I also believe that every investor will be able to find companies to research that meet their own goals  objectives and risk tolerances as this series unfolds

Summary and Conclusions
In part 13 of this series I covered the Non Energy Minerals Sector and indicated that it was a sector that I was not too fond of investing in  In this part 14  I am covering a sector that   as I pointed out earlier  contains companies with very cyclical histories  As a rule  I prefer companies that produce consistent  predictable and reliable operating growth rates  I find companies with those attributes to be easier to evaluate  forecast and hold for the desired long term period of time  Nevertheless  even though each of the research candidates presented in this article have cyclical histories  they have also dramatically outperformed the average company over time 
Consequently  as I stated in the title  I feel there are some exceptional long term investments presented in this part 14 of this series  However  I do believe that prospective investors need to be cognizant of the cyclical nature of these companies and the short to intermediate term results that that cyclicality might produce  Furthermore  I also pointed out earlier that investing in cyclicals at the bottom of a cycle can lead to exceptionally high short to intermediate term results  The reason is simple  Cyclical companies can generate very high short to intermediate term growth rates when they come off of the bottom of an earnings cycle  Moreover  typically when that does happen  great returns over the next few years quite often follow  Therefore  I suggest that prospective investors attempt to identify where these companies are in their operating cycles as part of their research and due diligence effort

118986,340501,FMC,Earnings Preview  FMC  FMC  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects FMC  FMC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chemical producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 62 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12  
Revenues are expected to be  1 19 billion  down 1 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 25  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FMC 
For FMC  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 51  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that FMC will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that FMC would post earnings of  1 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 69  delivering a surprise of  2 42  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
FMC doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-fmc-fmc-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200412437,200412437

119016,340531,FMC,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For FMC  FMC ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering FMC  FMC   which belongs to the Zacks Chemical   Diversified industry 
This chemical producer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5 31  
For the most recent quarter  FMC was expected to post earnings of  0 92 per share  but it reported  0 98 per share instead  representing a surprise of 6 52   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 71 per share  while it actually produced  1 78 per share  a surprise of 4 09  
Price and EPS Surprise

For FMC  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
FMC has an Earnings ESP of  13 95  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  4  Sell   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 11  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-fmc-fmc-200383819,200383819

119051,340566,FMC,Chemical   Diversified Stock Outlook  Good Run To Continue ,opinion,"The chemical industry continues its positive run this year  sustaining the momentum witnessed in 2017  The industry s upswing is backed by a resurgent global economy  strength across major end markets  such as construction and automotive  and a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy market supported by a rebound in oil prices  Notwithstanding some headwinds  the industry s upturn is expected to continue in the short haul as the fundamental driving factors remain firmly in place   The chemical diversified industry  which includes manufacturers of basic chemicals  plastics and agricultural chemicals  seems to be in fine fettle and poised for growth in the near term  While companies in this space face margin headwind from a spike in raw materials costs as a result of short supply  softness in agricultural commodity prices due to persistent grain glut and trade war risks  they should continue gaining from strategic measures including productivity improvement  price increase actions  portfolio restructuring  expansion into high growth markets and earnings accretive acquisitions President Trump s business friendly tax reform  which contributed to the recent impressive earnings performance of the U S  chemical diversified companies  would remain a major tailwind  The tax reform is expected to boost their bottom line  improve cash flows and incentivize capital investments in new chemical projects 
Industry Trails on Shareholder Returns  The   which is a 44 stock group within the broader   has underperformed both the S P 500 and its own sector over the past year  While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 10 2   the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Basic Materials Sector have rallied 14 3  and 21 8   respectively The underperformance appears to partly reflect trade related worries for the chemical industry  Fears of a fierce trade war between the United States and China have gripped the markets since March 2018  The good fortunes of the chemical industry have been  of late  clouded by prospects of a trade war between Washington and Beijing The Trump administration  in March  proposed sweeping tariffs on  50 billion of Chinese imports including chemicals  China subsequently retaliated with plans to levy 25  tariffs on nearly  50 billion of U S  imports that would harm a major market for a range of U S  produced chemicals and plastics  The United States is pushing ahead with its plans and recently announced a new list of Chinese products slated for tariffs  thereby intensifying chances of a trade battle Threats of tariffs on U S  chemical exports by China and the Trump administration s actions to impose heavy tariffs on steel imports have raised concerns that chemicals companies would reconsider their investments in new projects  which would lead to a slowdown in growth  The hefty steel tariffs are likely to push up the costs of building chemical plants that use a significant amount of steel  thereby eroding the economic benefits of chemical projects  All these have left investors jittery about the prospects of the chemical industry One Year Price Performance
 
The Group s Valuation Looks Bit StretchedNotwithstanding the underperformance of the industry over the past year  the valuation doesn t look cheap now  One might get a good sense of the chemical diversified industry s relative valuation by looking at its EV EBITDA  Enterprise Value  Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization  ratio The EV EBITDA multiple is a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like chemicals that have significant fluctuations in earnings from one quarter to the next  Notably  the value of commodity companies is dependent on the movement of prices of commodities and growth in the underlying industry economy  both of which typically move in cycles   Going by this multiple  valuation for the chemical diversified industry looks a bit stretched at the moment when compared to the broader market and its own sector The industry has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 12 8  which is below its own average of 14 2 and the highest level of 19 8 in the past one year  However  the industry compares unfavorably with the market at large  as the trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio for the S P 500 is at 11 6 and the median level is 11 3 
Enterprise Value EBITDA  TTM 

Moreover  a comparison of the group s EV EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector indicates that the group is trading at a premium  Zacks Basic Materials Sector s trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 10 3 and the median level of 10 2 for the same period are below the respective ratios of the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry  As such  there seems to be little room for an upside moving ahead 
Earnings Outlook Paints Favorable PictureChemical diversified stocks are expected to continue delivering positive shareholder returns over the near term on the back of favorable end market fundamentals and expectations of industry wide margin improvement driven by cost cutting and productivity measures and price increase actions to offset higher feedstock costs  But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry s prospects for a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies  Empirical research shows that a company s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock While one could get a good sense of a company s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year s reported number  an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates The consensus earnings estimate for the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry of  5 13 per share reflects a 2 6  year over year improvement  Also  the trend in earnings estimate revisions appears favorable  
Price and Consensus  Zacks Chemicals Diversified Industry

 
Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are hopeful of this group s earnings potential The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised positively  by a penny  since Mar 31  2018  
Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions

 
Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Upbeat ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates a positive picture for the near term The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  49  which places it at the top 19  of more than 250 Zacks industries  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry s rank has been hovering in the top half over the past eight weeks  

 
Long Term Growth Prospects Look PromisingThe long term  3 5 years  EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry appears upbeat  The group s mean estimate of long term EPS growth rate has been increasing since May 2018 to reach the current level of 10 6   This compares to 9 8  for the Zacks S P 500 composite  
Mean Estimate of Long Term EPS Growth Rate

 
One key reason for this long term EPS growth could be the recovery in top line that stocks in this industry group have been showing since the beginning of 2017 
 

 
Another important indication of solid long term prospect is the improvement in the group s EBITDA  which is an important metric for evaluating chemical stocks 

 
Bottom LineCompanies in the chemical diversified space are hamstrung by a few challenges including feedstock cost pressure  weakness in agricultural commodity prices and concerns over trade tariffs  However  strategic actions including expansion of scale through acquisitions  operational efficiency improvement and continued focus on cost and productivity should help them weather the macroeconomic and industry specific headwinds over the short haul 
The industry s momentum is expected to continue on sustained demand strength across automotive and construction markets  a rebound in demand in the energy space and investment on capacity expansion Cost cutting and productivity improvement actions are expected to reap industry wide margin improvements  Moreover  price hike actions by these companies in the wake of rising raw materials costs should also provide margin benefits  Continued shift of focus on high growth markets should also allow them lower their exposure on businesses that are grappling with weak demand and input costs pressure There are many reasons to be optimistic about the chemical diversified industry over the near future  Keeping the long term expectations in mind  it would be prudent to bet on a few stocks in this space that have a strong earnings outlook

119200,340715,FMC,3 Dividend Paying Airline Stocks To Boost Your Portfolio ,opinion,"The robust U S  job data for February bodes well for the domestic economy  In fact  American businesses have recorded the strongest jobs growth in a year and a half in February  Factors like warmer than normal weather conditions and Trump s business friendly tax reform contributed to the impressive numbers 
While the economy is currently basking in the glory of the February job data  it is worth noting that market participants were gripped by fears of inflation only a month back  Notably  both the Dow as well as the S P 500 had entered into the correction territory on Feb 9  In fact  the significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  highlighted the heightened volatility in the market at that time 
Given the fluctuating nature of the U S  equity market  investing in companies that pay consistent dividends seem to be a prudent strategy right now  This is because such companies are financially stable and mature and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions 
Airlines  A Sector to Consider
A sector that boasts well paying stocks in terms of dividends  is the one having airline stocks  Infact  airlines have rebounded nicely after having laid low by hurricanes last year  
Markedly  the financial prosperity of airline stocks has contributed to their shareholder friendly attitude  This is well reflected by its healthy price performance over the last six months  The  has gained 13 7  in the period  outperforming the S P 500 s 11 9  rally 

Factors like healthy demand for air travel and improving unit scenario have contributed to the bullish sentiment surrounding airlines  The Zacks Industry Rank of 97  out of 250 plus groups  carried by the Zacks Airline industry further highlights the attractiveness of airlines  The favorable rank places the companies in the top 38  of the Zacks industries 
We put our entire 250 plus industries into two groups  the top half  i e   industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank  
Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
Click here to know more  
Moreover  the fact that Warren Buffett   one of the most revered investors of all time   continues to show his affinity for airline stocks bodes well for the sector  Last month  the  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha   in an interview to   did not reject the possibility of eventually owning an airline company  thus showcasing his interest in the space 
More Dividend Hikes Likely Under the New Tax Law
The new tax law  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act   which reduces corporate tax rate significantly  is a huge positive for airline stocks  This is because it is likely to boost cash flow and in turn improve the bottom line of carriers  Moreover  the fact that the likes of Southwest Airlines Co    NYSE LUV   and JetBlue Airways Corp    NASDAQ JBLU   declared bonuses   1 000 per member   following the tax overhaul  highlights the optimism on stocks pertaining to this measure 
Meanwhile  the likes of Alaska Air Group  Inc    NYSE ALK   and SkyWest  Inc    NASDAQ SKYW   have already announced hikes in their respective dividend payouts in 2018  We expect other carriers to do the same in view of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
Notably  huge savings owing to the reduction in corporate tax rate implies that more cash will be available to fund their capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases  among others  This bodes well for shareholders who will gain in the form of dividend hikes and more buybacks 
Valuation Signals More Upside
Going by the EV to EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  ratio   which is often used to value airline stocks   given their significant debt levels  and high depreciation and amortization expenses  the industry does not look expensive at this point 
The industry currently has a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio of 6 9  which compares favorably with the market at large  as the current EV EBITDA for the S P 500 is at 12 2  The industry s favorable positioning compared with the overall market certainly signals more upside 
Dividend Paying Airlines Should Grace Your Portfolio
In view of the tailwinds mentioned above  we believe that stocks from the airline space should be present in one s portfolio  Moreover  dealing with dividend stocks is a prudent strategy during uncertain times like the current scenario  Markedly  the best dividend stocks that pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects are less susceptible to market downturns 
Given the significant reduction in taxes  we expect the already cheap airline stocks to fly higher  going ahead  Consequently  we have zeroed in on three stocks in this high flying space  which have a strong dividend paying history  Moreover  each of the selected stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see  
Delta Air Lines  Inc    NYSE DAL   is a leading provider of scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo in the United States as well as internationally  The company  based in Atlanta  GA  has a Zacks Rank  2 and a  of A 
The company has a dividend yield of 2 18   Also  Delta has been consistently rewarding its shareholders through dividends since 2013  Notably  it has hiked dividend pay outs significantly for four consecutive years since then  The latest hike was announced in May 2017  when the company s board of directors approved a 50 6  dividend hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 30 5 cents per share  We expect the company to raise its dividend this year too 
American Airlines Group  Inc    NASDAQ AAL    headquartered in Fort Worth  TX  is another established name in the airline space paying regular dividends  This Zacks Rank  2 legacy carrier has a Value Score of A  The company has a dividend yield of 0 71  
International Consolidated Airlines Group  LON ICAG   S A    OTC ICAGY   based in Madrid  Spain  was founded in 2010  The carrier has a Zacks Rank  1  The company has a dividend yield of 2 48

119243,340758,FMC,Early Reports Show A Slow Down In Inflationary Measures ,opinion,"This week we have several important economic reports coming out   These reports will give us key data on future indicators regarding inflation  housing  retail sales  housing  and consumer sentiment  
The biggest report came out before the opening bell this morning  the Consumer Price Index  also called the CPI   This report is a great indicator of inflationary measurers and has a ripple effect impacting both the Housing market index  and housing starts data  both of which are due out later this week 
The CPI showed that year over year core inflation held steady at 1 8    This indicates that inflation will probably be more gradual than previously expected 
As you can see in the chart  both CPI  and core CPI have begun to pull back from its recent spike  Which is key to the future growth of the markets as inflation has been the biggest worry among investors  This data combined with the recent jobs report that showed that wages were not increasing as fast as previously expected helped the markets start the day in the green  Further  this news caused the 10 year treasury yields to pull back this morning  All positive signs for the markets  As of late  the inflationary issues have been putting pressure on the building sector as fears of the Fed rates rising faster than anticipated have subdued several members of the segment  
You can see this downward pressure in the year to date Price return graph   While the S P 500 has gained 4 2   the building sector has fallen by 12 3  with the big players like KB Homes  KBH  and D R  Horton  DRI  performing well below that of the S P 500  
But the positive CPI report bodes well for the upcoming Housing Market Index  and Housing Starts reports that come out later this week   If these data points stay at or near their current high levels  expect the building sector to bounce back  
We will also see two other reports that are closely tied together  the Retail Sales report  and Consumer Sentiment 

The Retail report is expected to show a big bounce back from a reading of  0 3  to  0 4  after weak results in both December and January   Sales fell after a strong three month stretch between September and November due to big holiday sales  
The largest factor for the upbeat retail sales expectations is overall consumer sentiment which has remained at elevated levels for the past several months 


The data has maintained a reading of 95 or higher for the past 7 consecutive months  and is expected to come in at 98 8 when the report is released on Friday  If consumer sentiment data comes in as expected it will be a positive indicator for the retail sector  as this report gauges consumer spending  and the overall attitude of the economy  If both the Retail sales and Consumer sentiment numbers come in as expected  several key retail companies will be positively impacted  

These 6 companies currently carry a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy rating  and are very well positioned to take advantage of these data points      
Overall  this morning s CPI report has eased many fears of increasing inflation  and has begun to set a positive tone for the markets  The coming reports due out later in the week can further boost this positive tone if they come in as expected

119244,340759,FMC,Quanta Services Vs  AECOM  Which Construction Stock To Bet On ,opinion,"Investors are always on the lookout for companies that consistently yield good returns over a considerable time frame  Currently  the Construction space is one of the sectors that is enjoying multiple growth drivers  Per the U S  Census Bureau s data for January  the sector experienced positive year over year growth in terms of spending 
Moreover  recovery in the housing market has led to an increase in property and other forms of real estate tax collections in recent quarters  This  in turn  is expected to allow a number of public agencies to boost spending  ultimately boosting construction activities further  Comprehensive tax cuts  pro growth regulatory environment and sustained increases in defense spending are other major catalysts that bode well for this space 
Given this backdrop  let s focus on the comparative analysis on some key metrics of two companies in the Engineering   R D Services industry falling under the broader Construction space   Quanta Services  Inc    NYSE PWR   and AECOM   NYSE ACM    At present  Quanta Services has a market capitalization of  5 55 billion  while that of AECOM stands at  5 79 billion 
Valuation
AECOM s stock is presently trading at a forward P E multiple of 12 2  while Quanta Services is trading at a multiple of 20 1  Relative to the industry s PE multiple of 15  we see that Quanta Services is richly valued while AECOM is trading at a discount 
Past One Month Share Price Performance
In the past month  Quanta Services  stock has gained 5 4   compared with AECOM s return of 4 3  

However  both companies trumped the industry s modest increase of 0 3  

 
Zacks Rank 
While both Quanta Services and AECOM carrya Zacks Rank  3  Hold   the  is ranked  101 out of the 265 industries in Zacks coverage 
Favorable infrastructure spending as well as strong US job demand has been driving the performance of the engineering  procurement and construction services providers from the Construction space  Notably  the Engineering   R D Services industry currently falls within the top 38  of the 265 different industries tracked by Zacks  Thus  any positive industry developments should benefit both companies 
Earnings Trend
As far as earnings history is concerned  Quanta Services has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailingfour quarters  with an average negative surprise of 1 4   AECOM has delivered positive earnings surprises thrice in the trailing four quarters  with an average earnings beat of 17 4   So in terms of earnings trends  AECOM clearly comes out as the better play 
Estimate Revisions
For 2018  Quanta Services witnessed four upward estimate revisions versus two downward in the last 60 days  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved north from  2 47 to  2 63  depicting bullish analyst sentiment surrounding the stock  AECOM s consensus mark for 2018 also climbed from  2 66 to  2 69 on three upward estimate revisions versus none downward  reflecting bullish analyst outlook 
Other Key Factors
Quanta Services is enjoying strong prospects in its electric power segment  fuelled by the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure  generation mix shifting to more renewable and natural gas  grid modernization and regulation aimed at improving grid reliability  Also  the company s oil and gas segment outlook looks promising  courtesy of the improving mainline and natural gas distribution  and integrity markets 
Moving ahead  the company is expected to benefit from healthy levels of base load work  including supporting midstream infrastructure  downstream support services and natural gas distribution  However  Quanta Services  operations remain vulnerable to unpredictable weather  the timing of projects and customer budget releases 
In the meantime  AECOM is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments  Its Construction Services and Management Services businesses continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction and power businesses  This apart  the company s solid backlog levels  which are a key indicator of future revenue growth  indicate significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters 
Bottom Line
Even though Quanta Services and AECOM carry the same rank  the latter enjoys a lead in terms estimate revisions  valuation and earnings trend 
Key Picks
Investors interested in the same sector may consider also Fluor Corp    NYSE FLR   and Owens Corning Inc   NYSE OC    While Fluor sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Owens Corning carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

Blackberry Patent Case Against Facebook  WhatsApp  Instagram
Blackberry has sued Facebook and its WhatsApp and Instagram messaging units for alleged infringement of its mobile messaging technologies included in its BBM app that was highly popular at one point in time  The company has said in a 117 page complaint filed with the court last Tuesday that after years of dialogue  the company had finally decided to take the matter to court as  an obligation to our shareholders to pursue appropriate legal remedies   The company is seeking an injunction to prevent Facebook from continuing to use the seven main technologies mentioned in the lawsuit as well as unspecified damages for lost profits 
According to Paul Grewal  Facebook s deputy general counsel   Blackberry s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business  Having abandoned its efforts to innovate  BlackBerry is now looking to tax the innovation of others  We intend to fight  
As Blackberry s business moved away from handsets to focus on growing its licensing business  the company has grown aggressive at protecting its patents  To its credit  it has managed to extract  940 million from Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   secure ongoing patents from Cisco  settle with Canadian company Avaya and a Florida based maker of low cost mobile devices called Blu  Its case against Nokia  HE NOKIA  for infringement of its 3G and 4G patents is pending at a Delaware federal court

The goal with these licensing agreements is to unlock the potential in user generated video  because every time it happens  creators and songwriters will get to make money  Moreover  that s the way music is enjoyed in the digital world  Facebook is also likely gearing up to becoming a music streaming company in its own right

119336,340851,FMC,RH Or WSM  Which Is A Better Home Furnishing Pick ,opinion,Home furnishing industry is poised to grow in the upcoming years  The Freedonia Group forecasts household furnishings demand to reach  34 9 billion in 2021  According to the report  improvements in the residential housing market and improvement in disposable personal income will boost sales Notably  demand for home furnishing products depends on the performance of the broader housing market  Housing starts hit their highest level in more than a year in January 2018  after the sector recovered from a decline in December due to poor weather  Building permits  which are a reliable indicator of future demand  also increased favorably  Overall  the monthly new residential construction report indicates that the industry is in fine fettle and has a strong year ahead  As such  demand for home furnishing products are expected to increase Limited supply of homes  higher mortgage rates  higher raw material costs owing to the recent imposition of tariffs and labor shortage continue to plague the housing industry  However  these factors have failed to mar the performance of industry  which has been one of the top performers for quite some time Also  the current employment scenario looks promising  evident from the February job growth data which marked the best in more than one and a half years   U S  employers added 313 000 jobs in February  after an upward revision of 239 000 in January and surpassing market expectations of 200 000 jobs  The hourly earnings rose 2 6  year over year in February Considering the higher disposable income  consumers are expected to increase their spending on non essential products like home furnishing items This is expected  to increase revenues for companies like RH   NYSE RH    Williams Sonoma Inc    NYSE WSM    At Home Group Inc    NYSE HOME   and Haverty Furniture Companies  Inc    NYSE HVT   Meanwhile  furniture accounts for a major portion of the broader furnishing industry  According to a recent report by Research and Markets  the home furniture market in the United States is likely to witness a CAGR of 6 14  during the period 2017 2021 Again  demand for outdoor furnishing has increased steadily  per a study by the American Home Furnishings Alliance  According to the research  consumers use their outdoor rooms for almost everything that they can do indoors  This further raises the demand for furnishing products Given this backdrop  let s try to ascertain which of these two key home furnishing players   RH and Williams Sonoma Inc    is a better investment option  Since both the companies carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   we need to delve deeper into factors beyond rank  You can see   Market CapWilliams Sonoma s market capitalization is  4 2 billion  while that of RH is just  2 1 billion  Considering business size  Williams Sonoma is undoubtedly a winner and is better positioned over the long term  courtesy of its massive scale of operations  However  short term industry headwinds are likely to affect the companies Sales PerformanceRH s revenues increased 14  in the nine months ending October 2017  The upside can be attributed to higher outlet and warehouse sales on the back accelerated inventory optimization efforts  RH s comparable brand revenues increased 7  in the said period  On the other hand  Williams Sonoma s revenues rose 3 1  in the nine months ending October 2017 and comparable brand revenues increased 2 1   Moreover  sales for fiscal 2018 are expected to increase 6 6  for RH and 4 3  for Williams Sonoma  It is evident that RH s efforts to boost sales are way more effective than Williams Sonoma s Earnings History  ESP and Estimate RevisionsWilliams Sonoma is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 on Mar 14  while RH is expected to release the same on Mar 13  RH has a greater chance of beating estimates as the company has an  of  1 77   Meanwhile  Williams Sonoma s ESP value is  0 16  Considering a more comprehensive earnings history  RH and Williams Sonoma have delivered positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters  However  RH has a superior average earnings surprise of 17  compared with Williams Sonoma s figure of just 3 2  While comparing the earnings estimates over the last 60 days  RH s estimate for fiscal 2018 has increased 2 9   whereas that of Williams Sonoma rose 5 4   This indicates that analysts  are getting more optimistic about Williams Sonoma s performance  However  RH s earnings are expected to grow a whopping 82 7  in fiscal 2018 compared with Williams Sonoma s improvement of 15 1  Price PerformanceRH s shares have surged 127 9  in the past year  which is higher than the broader  s 7 5  rally  Meanwhile  Williams Sonoma s shares have returned 9 6   which is lower than RH s and the broader industry s performance  ValuationRH s valuation looks stretched when compared with the industry average  Looking at the company s price to earnings  P E  ratio  the company is currently trading at 31 6  higher than the industry s average of 16 1  Williams Sonoma  with a Zacks Value Score of A  has a slightly lower P E  14 8x   implying that there s more upside left for the stock Return on EquityWilliams Sonoma boasts a ROE of 25 5   while the same for RH is 20   more than the industry s average of 10 1   Clearly  Williams Sonoma is more efficient in using shareholders  funds than RH or other industry peers Final ThoughtsOur comparative analysis shows that RH has an edge over Williams Sonoma when considering future earnings growth  price and sales performance  However  Williams Sonoma s large scale of operation  good return on earnings and attractive valuation cannot be ignored In conclusion  one has to consider that RH s efforts to redesign supply chain network and rationalize product offerings have proved to be highly effective in driving sales  Also  RH has outperformed earnings estimates by a higher percentage and is expected to register strong earnings growth in fiscal 2018  This is why it may be a good idea to bet on RH over Williams Sonoma Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed

119373,340888,FMC,Buy These 3 Stocks As Healthcare Continues To Shift Gears,opinion,"The recent announcement by Cigna Corp    NYSE CI   to acquire pharmacy benefits manager  Express Scripts Holding  ESRX  corroborates the fact that the healthcare industry is shifting gears The coming together of two different sections  health insurers and the pharmacy benefit managers  of the healthcare space asserts that business boundaries are getting blurred  Healthcare companies are making concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive healthcare providers  a one stop solution for their customers Recent Spate of DealsThe first deal of this kind was CVS Health  NYSE CVS  s acquisition of Aetna  NYSE AET   announced last December  The transaction  valued at nearly  77 billion  is slated to go through in the second half of 2018   Following this news  UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   announced the buyout of the primary and urgent care services of DaVita Inc  for nearly  5 billion However  UnitedHealth can be considered a pioneer in this aspect  having acquired Catamaran  a pharmacy benefit management company in 2015  The buyout has proved highly accretive to UnitedHealth and contributed meaningfully to its results What s the Driving Factor Pressure to slash costs to protect margins and the need to counter growing competition are the primary catalysts for the merger and acquisition wave sweeping through the industry   Insurers are under pressure to protect margins due to high medical cost  growing consumerism and high regulations  Meanwhile  pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs  are facing the prospect of fierce competition especially given that the tech giant  Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN    is making inroads in the pharmacy business  Amazon recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  and Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  in order to curb medical costs for their employees Teaming up with other forward or backward integrated companies consequently seems the best survival strategy to provide businesses with additional strength and a wider spectrum Given the vertical integration nature of these deals  odds of getting a clearance from regulators seem high  Cigna s merger with Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   and Aetna s with Humana  NYSE HUM  were blocked by regulators last year  on concerns that the combination would stifle competition in the healthcare industry since both the companies had overlapping businesses The Impact of These CombinationsPBMs provide a wide range of services including formulary management  Medicare Part D services  mail order  specialty pharmacy and infusion services   It also provides retail pharmacy network management services  prescription management systems  clinical services  disease management services and medical spend management  They function to negotiate of prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out of pocket costs for consumers Their clients include insurance companies with the focus on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost effective  Tie up with PBMs better equips health insurers to negotiate discount with drug manufacturers which should lower insurers  medical costs These combinations should be well positioned to cater to the health needs of populations especially the 50  of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80  of all health care costs  Getting vertically integrated would better equip health  insurers to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs  by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services Consequently along with providing growth opportunities for business these evolving entities would also better serve customers  Such changes therefore bode well for both the consumers and the producers U  S  healthcare expenditure has been on the rise and though ways are being devised to control costs  a reversal in trend seems difficult to achieve  Companies in this space are thus set to thrive given continued demand for better healthcare needs Promising Stock PicksWe therefore point out some stocks in the space that carry a strong Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have outperformed the  s growth of 34 5  in a year s time  Adding these stocks to an investment portfolio is

Also  a fine of HK 119 million has been levied on UBS Group  Though the bank has not specified the reason behind this penalty  in the latest annual filing  UBS Group mentioned its intentions to contest the regulators  decision 
However  the Swiss bank has assured its employees of continuing  business as normal  via an internal memo sent by Andrea Orcel and David Chin  global and Asia Pacific heads of UBS s investment bank  per a Reuters article 
UBS Group seeks to continue sponsoring IPOs till its appeal is heard by the authorities  Also  the bank informed the employees that it expects the full hearing of the appeal to happen in fourth quarter 2018 and a final decision to made early in 2019 
The suspension comes when the city s investors are anticipating to witness some potential floats in the nearterm  Hong Kong IPOs require at least one sponsoring bank that leads the work  i e  collection of a significant proportion of the feeswhile the deal is in progress 
Further  if a company wishes to change sponsor in the middle of its IPO process due to a sponsor s suspension the whole listing process will have to start over again  leading to months of additional work 
Moreover  the regulator is investigating works of about 15 more firms of their role as sponsors  which is likely to have resulted in losses of about billions of dollars for investors 
UBS Group s suspension from IPO sponsoring might keep revenues under pressure as it depends significantly on its wealth management and private banking segments  Also  its profitability continues to be challenged by negative interest rates in the domestic economy

119428,340943,FMC,Why It s Wise To Hold On To Duke Realty s  DRE  Stock For Now,opinion,Duke Realty Corporation   NYSE DRE   is well positioned to benefit from an escalating demand for industrial properties by offering modern distribution facilities in strategic infill locations  Also  the medical office asset sale enabled the company to turn into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT  However  large scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term  Further  stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns In January 2018  Duke Realty reported  fourth quarter 2017 core funds from operations  FFO  per share of 30 cents  which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the figure was lower than the year ago tally of 31 cents  Total rental and related revenues of  179 4 million for the quarter jumped 11 5  on a year over year basis  Further  the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  175 million  The results reflected growth in same property net operating income on the back of solid rental increase Notably  the industrial real estate market has been witnessing elevated demand for modern  bulk distribution properties and warehouses  This demand is stemming from the growth of industries and companies opting for measures to improve supply chain efficiencies  This is helping the industrial real estate market to grow  Given Duke Realty s solid capacity to offer such properties  it remains well poised to capitalize on this trend In fact  as part of its strategy to concentrate on industrial properties  in recent years  the company has made concerted efforts to lower exposure to suburban office assets  Further  it divested its medical office business in the prior year  Such efforts are particularly aimed at simplifying the company s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT Moreover  solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors  Duke Realty has raised its regular common dividend rate by 5 9   5 6  and 5 3  in fourth quarter 2015  2016 and 2017  respectively  Furthermore  the company contributed  70 million toward special dividend in 2015  Also  during fourth quarter 2017  the company paid 85 cents as special dividends Nevertheless  as Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures  this included the significant disposition of suburban office assets and MOBs in recent times  While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term  the near term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed  Such moves tend to drag the company s quarterly results and weigh on its profitability Though the company s large development pipeline is encouraging for its future growth  it increases operational risks by exposing it to rising construction costs  entitlement delays and lease up risks  The company also faces significant competition from developers  owners and operators of commercial real estates  This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors Further  shares of Duke Realty have underperformed its  in the past six months  declining 13 3  compared with the industry s descend of 8 6   Currently  Duke Realty carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Stocks Worth a LookA few better ranked stocks from the same industry include Arbor Realty Trust   NYSE ABR    Extra Space Storage Inc   NYSE EXR   and Sotherly Hotels Inc    NASDAQ SOHO    All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2  Buy  Arbor Realty Trust s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 FFO per share have been revised 2 3  upward to 90 cents over the past month  Its share price has risen 10 2  in six months  time Extra Space Storage s FFO per share estimates for the current year have moved up 0 9  to  4 52 in a month s time  Its shares have gained 11 7  over the past six months Sotherly Hotels  FFO per share estimates for 2018 have been revised upward approximately 1  to  1 04 over the past month  The stock has gained 5 9  during the past six months Note  Anything related to earnings presented in this write up represents funds from operations  FFO    a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold tickers for the entirety of 2018 Last year s 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double digit winners  including FMC Corp  NYSE FMC   and VMware which racked up stellar gains of  67 9  and  61   Now a brand new portfolio has been handpicked from over 4 000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank  Don t miss your chance to get in on these long term buys ,2018-03-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-its-wise-to-hold-on-to-duke-realtys-dre-stock-for-now-200297714,200297714
119429,340944,FMC,Should Value Investors Pick Tech Data  TECD  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tech Data Corporation   NASDAQ TECD   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tech Data has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 6  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Tech Data s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 11 7  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Tech Data has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 8 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Tech Data stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tech Data has a P S ratio of about 0 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tech Data currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Tech Data a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Tech Data is just 0 4  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 0 9  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  TECD is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Tech Data might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A This gives TECD a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at its best  The current quarter has seen one estimate to go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen three up and one down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 2 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone up by 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tech Data Corporation Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTech Data is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 14  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past three years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold tickers for the entirety of 2018 Last year s 2017 Zacks

suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Sonic Automotive currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes SAH a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 0  which is slightly better than the industry average of 8 2  Clearly  SAH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Sonic Automotive might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of F  This gives SAH a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined about 16 7  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen nearly 5 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Sonic Automotive  Inc  Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineSonic Automotive is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 12  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Top 10

Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  118 5 million 
 Exelixis  Inc  Price and Consensus
 

    
Quarter in Detail
The FDA approved a tablet formulation of cabozantinib   distinct from the capsule form  under the brand name Cabometyx in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  in patients who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy  In December 2017  the FDA also approved Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC  approximately two months ahead of the assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  action date 
Cabometyx generated  95 7 million in net product revenues  up 84  y y  driven by growth in demand for second line RCC  Demand was driven by increases in market share  refills for patient already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base  15  sequential increase  
Cometriq  cabozantinib  capsules for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer generated  5 3 million in net product revenues 
Total collaboration revenues were  10 0 million compared with  20 million earned in the year ago quarter 
In the fourth quarter  research and development expenses increased 35 3  to  32 2 million stemming from increases in personnel expenses  clinical trial costs and consulting and outside services  Selling  general and administrative expenses were  46 2 million  significantly up from  13 0 million driven by increases in consulting and outside services to support the company s marketing activities resulting primarily from an increase in general and administrative headcount to support the company s commercial and research and development organizations 
2017 Results
Revenues came in at  452 5 million in 2017  up from  191 5 million in 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  451 3 million  Earnings per share came in at 49 cents  up from a loss of 28 cents in 2016 and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate   Cabometyx sales came in at  349 million  up 158  year over year 
Pipeline Update
In March 2017  the FDA granted cabozantinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   In October 2017  Exelixis announced that the CELESTIAL trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival   OS   with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC  The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial should be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis  Exelixis plans to submit an sNDA to the FDA in first quarter 2018 
Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Roche Holding   OTC RHHBY   to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in 2017  Exelixis and Bristol Myers initiated a phase III trial  CheckMate 9ER  in July 2017 which is evaluating the combination of checkpoint inhibition therapy  combined with a cabozantinib  compared to Sutent 
Meanwhile  updated results from the ongoing phase I trial of cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo  with or without Yervoy  in patients with refractory genitourinary tumors demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile  and high rates of durable responses in the previously treated metastatic UC and metastatic RCC cohorts 
In January 2018  Exelixis announced an amendment to the protocol for the phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors  The amendment added four new expansion cohorts to the trial  which now includes patients with non small cell lung cancer and castration resistant prostate cancer  in addition to previously included patients with RCC and urothelial carcinoma  The primary objective in the expansion stage of this trial remains to determine the objective response rate in each cohort 
The IMspire150  TRILOGY  trial  which evaluates the combination of Cotellic  Tecentriq  and Xelboraf in first line BRAF V600 mutation positive metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma is underway while IMspire170  the trial evaluating the combination of Cotellic and Tecentriq versus Merck s   NYSE MRK   Keytruda in first line BRAF wild type metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma  has enrolled its first patient 
2018 Guidance
Exelixis expects total costs and operating expenses for 2018 in the range of  430  460 million 
Our Take
Exelixis  fourth quarter results were positive wherein while sales beat estimates  earnings came in line with expectations   Exelixis put up a strong performance in 2017 driven by gain in market share for Cabometyx  New patient market share in the second line plus setting grew to approximately 42  at the end of 2017  up from 38  in the third quarter 
We expect sales to get a further boost in 2018 as the company will launch the drug for first line RCC which will increases the eligible patient population for Caobometyx in the United States by approximately 14 000 patients and grab market share from two key drugs   Sutent and Votrient in the first line RCC market 
We expect investors focus to remain on further label expansion of cabozantinib and Cotellic  A potential label expansion for advanced HCC will further boost the growth prospects of the company 
Zacks Rank
Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

119567,341082,FMC,Does January s New Home Sales Drop Hint At Housing Downfall ,opinion,Sales of new U S  single family homes dropped for the second straight month in January and in four of the past six months  Does this give smoke signals of a downtrend in the housing market Exchange traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry dropped on Monday  after the news release  iShares U S  Home Construction ETF   WA ITB   fell 0 7  while the SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  dropped 1   Meanwhile  the PowerShares Dynamic Building   Construction Portfolio  was down 1 3  Shares of major builders of the U S  housing industry like D R  Horton Inc    NYSE DHI   Beazer Homes USA Inc    NYSE BZH    Lennar Corp    NYSE LEN   and PulteGroup Inc    NYSE PHM   slipped following the news release on that day Is Weather or Higher Mortgage Rates the Culprit Sales of newly constructed homes  accounting of roughly 10  of all U S  home sales  fell 7 8  in January from the prior month and 1  from the year ago period to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593 000 units  as per data released on Feb 26 by the Commerce Department Notably  last month s figure is the lowest since August 2017  weighed down by sharp declines in the Northeast and South  Sales sank 33 3  in the Northeast and fell 14 2  in the South  which accounts for the majority of new home sales  Sales rose 1  in the West and 15 4  in the Midwest The downside was probably due to cold weather  particularly in Southern states  rather than any economic factor  Otherwise  all regions would have experienced deterioration Again  higher mortgage rates could also be the reason for this downfall  Mortgage rates are surging in proportion with U S  government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve  The 30 year fixed rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4 15  for the week ending Jan 25  2018  the highest level since March 2017  according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac Again  the 30 year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4 40  for the week ending Feb 22  the highest level since April 2014  from 4 38  in the prior week  It has increased for seven straight weeks  Higher mortgage rates accompanied with the loss of homeowner tax breaks in certain expensive markets might be hitting on affordability Apart from the recent weak new home sales report  last week s report from the National Association of Realtors also showed dismal existing home sales  Existing home sales dropped 3 2  to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 38 million units last month  Existing home sales  which account for about 90  of U S  home sales  tanked 4 8  on a year on year basis in January Meanwhile  the industry has already been challenged by shortage of homes for sale  suitable land and skilled labor  Total housing inventory at the end of January rose 4 1  to 1 52 million existing homes available for sale  but is still 9 5  lower than a year ago and has fallen year over year for 32 consecutive months  That said  the inventory of new homes was up 15  from a year ago in January  which is expected to provide some relief as we head toward the spring selling season Limited land availability is driving prices higher  as median sales price of a new home jumped 2 4  year over year last month  The median house price increased 5 8  for existing homes from a year ago and was the 71st consecutive month of year on year price gain Adding to the woes  first time buyers comprised 29  of sales in January  which is down from 32  in December 2017 and 33  a year ago Will the Current Downfall Linger Through 2018 Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve  homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage  limited land availability  higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment  These are restricting homebuilders to respond to growing demand Nonetheless  homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period  In spite of shortage in inventory  robust demand from a solid job market is keeping the industry alive  Americans filing for unemployment benefits plunged to a 45 year low for the week ending Feb 17  2018  indicating strong job growth  Job additions grew at a solid pace in January  and the record low unemployment rate and strong wage growth show that the labor market is in good shape  Notably  wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight and a half years  Although home price increases have surpassed wage growth  which remained 2 9   the optimism surrounding the U S  housing market remains intact amid overall economic growth  Along with this  a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and demand Given this mixed scenario  we should keep an eye on how the housing sector responds to rising rates as we approach in Spring  which according to Fitch Ratings  is traditionally more upbeat than the rest of the year Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold tickers for the

119593,341108,FMC,Here s Why Best Buy  BBY  Could Be A Solid Value Stock,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Best Buy Co   Inc    NYSE BBY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Best Buy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 05  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 26  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Best Buy s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail   Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 30 45  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Best Buy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Best Buy stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Best Buy has a P S ratio of about 0 55  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 48 right now  This makes the stock undervalued from the P S aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Best Buy currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Best Buy a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Best Buy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of B  This gives BBY a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter and full year have seen three upward estimate revisions each in the past sixty days compared to two no downward revisions This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by nearly 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Best Buy Co   Inc  Price and Consensus    This bullish trend is why the stock sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineClearly  Best Buy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  this Zacks Rank  2 company flaunts a solid Zacks Industry Rank  among top 2  of more than 250 industries   Notably  over the past two years  the industry has clearly surpassed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would

operational excellence via execution of the enterprise wide cost productivity program in order to generate additional savings in 2018 and beyond  Notably  it concluded the assessment phase and is currently in the advanced stages of designing along with the implementation of its savings plans  Markedly  this productivity program mainly revolves around three major areas  including enhancement of its supply chain network  optimizing spending across all key categories to ensure greater efficiency  and integration of operating model along with minimizing general and administrative expenses The enhancement of supply chain focuses on consolidating plant network as well as maintaining quality  value and service  In the process  changes will be implemented in phases effective 2018  which is

119634,341149,FMC,Is Asbury Automotive  ABG  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Asbury Automotive Group  Inc    NYSE ABG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Asbury Automotive has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Asbury Automotive s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Asbury Automotive has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 9 8  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Asbury Automotive stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Asbury Automotive has a P S ratio of about 0 2  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ABG is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Asbury Automotive currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Asbury Automotive a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Asbury Automotive might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A  This gives ABG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen four up and two down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 16 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 15 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Asbury Automotive Group  Inc  Price and Consensus    This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineAsbury Automotive is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a solid industry rank  among Top 1  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  1  instill investor confidence on the stock  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this

119668,341183,FMC,Is American Eagle Outfitters  AEO  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put American Eagle Outfitters  Inc    NYSE AEO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  American Eagle Outfitters has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 3  If we focus on the long term PE trend  American Eagle Outfitters  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that American Eagle Outfitters has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for American Eagle Outfitters stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  American Eagle Outfitters has a P S ratio of about 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this

cents from continuing operations  The figure is ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents  Adjusted earnings improved 23 8  year over year  primarily on strong sales growth at the company s Biologics and Spine Fixation strategic business units  SBU  Excluding one time items  net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter came in at 8 cents per share  showing a remarkable year over year improvement over the net loss from continuing operations of 29 cents Sales DetailsOrthofix s fourth quarter sales improved 7 7   6 1  at constant exchange rate or CER  to  116 9 million  The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  112 million by 4 4  Sales were primarily driven by a better than expected performance by the company s all four SBUs with significant contributions from Biologics and Spine Fixation SBU DetailsFor the fourth quarter  the company posted BioStim sales of  49 8 million  reflecting 4 1   same at CER  growth from the prior year period  Biologics SBU sales totaled  16 9 million  up 10 7   same at CER  from the year ago quarter  This upside resulted from strong sales of Trinity Elite allograft  banking on an expanded distributor network Extremity Fixation sales were  29 1 million in the quarter under review  showing an 8 4  improvement  up 2 2  at CER  from fourth quarter 2016  The company particularly realized strong revenue growth from the outside U S  Extremity Fixation s stocking distribution Orthofix International N V  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Orthofix reported Spine Fixation SBU sales of  21 2 million  reflecting 13 5   up 13 2  at CER  growth over the year earlier quarter  This uptick can be attributed to new product launches and the adopted strategic initiatives MarginsIn the fourth quarter  gross margin expanded 133 basis points  bps  to 79 8   Solid top line growth can be a major factor to have boosted the gross margin Sales and marketing expenses rose 6 5  year over year to  51 9 million  General and Administrative expenses were down 7 5  to  19 5 million  led by lower legal settlement costs in the reported period as well as core expense reductions due to the U S  and outside U S  restructuring initiatives and lower professional fees  The company also witnessed a 12 6  rise in research and development expenses to  8 5 million  Accordingly  adjusted operating margin expanded 426 bps to 11 6  owing to increased operating expenses Cash PositionOrthofix exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of  81 2 million compared with  39 6 million at the end of 2016  Full year net cash provided by operating activities was  53 3 million compared with  44 7 million a year ago  Excluding capital expenditure of  16 9 million  free cash flow was  36 4 million in 2017  This compares unfavorably with the free cash flow of  26 4 million in 2018 due to capex of  18 3 million 2018 GuidanceOrthofix has provided its 2018 guidance  Full year 2018 sales are expected in the band of  450  455 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year revenues is pegged at  453 9 million  higher than the guided range Adjusted EPS from continuing operations are expected in the range of  1 76  1 84  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year adjusted EPS stands at  1 83  within but close to the upper end of the company s projected range Our TakeThe company exited the fourth quarter of 2017 on a solid note with both earnings and sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The top line was substantially driven by strength in Biologics and Spine Fixation businesses  expected to continue on the back of an improved performance by sales partners  expanded distributorship network and introduction of products The year 2017 has remained successful for Orthofix  This is because the company transformed its spine fixation SBU  delivering exceptional growth and sales momentum in addition to a robust stream of new products in the period  In 2018  the company has already launched 20 products and has even scheduled another 17 to be released ahead A strong current year guidance is indicative of its enhanced prospects On the flip side  currency fluctuations  a competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges to the company  Moreover  higher operating expenses are a matter of concern for Orthofix  Also  heavy dependence on a third party for final distribution of products exposes the company to increased risks  Zacks Rank   Key PicksOrthofix carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the broader medical space are athenahealth

119697,341212,FMC,Is Walmart  WMT  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Walmart Inc    NYSE WMT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Walmart has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 21 1  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 3  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Walmart s current PE ratio much above its midpoint  which is 15 3  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 30 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Walmart has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 18 9  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Walmart s stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Walmart has a P S ratio of about 0 6  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Walmart currently has a Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes WMT a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Walmart might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of F  This gives WMT a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen nine estimates go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen twelve upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 5 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased nearly 4 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Wal Mart Stores  Inc  Price and Consensus    This favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term  Bottom

Quarter in DetailThe FDA approved a tablet formulation of cabozantinib   distinct from the capsule form  under the brand name Cabometyx in April 2016 for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma  RCC  in patients who have received prior anti angiogenic therapy  In December 2017  the FDA also approved Cabometyx for the treatment of previously untreated advanced RCC  approximately two months ahead of the assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  action date Cabometyx generated  95 7 million in net product revenues  up 84  y y  driven by growth in demand for second line RCC  Demand was driven by increases in market share  refills for patient already on therapy and continued expansion of the prescriber base  15  sequential increase  Cometriq  cabozantinib  capsules for the

general and administrative expenses were  46 2 million  significantly up from  13 0 million driven by increases in consulting and outside services to support the company s marketing activities resulting primarily from an increase in general and administrative headcount to support the company s commercial and research and development organizations 2017 ResultsRevenues came in at  452 5

significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared with placebo in patients with advanced HCC  The independent data monitoring committee for the study recommended that the trial should be stopped for efficacy following review of the second planned interim analysis  Exelixis plans to submit an sNDA to the FDA in first quarter 2018 Exelixis inked agreements with Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Roche Holding   OTC RHHBY   to develop cabozantinib in combination with immunotherapy agents in 2017  Exelixis and Bristol Myers initiated a phase III trial  CheckMate 9ER  in July 2017 which is evaluating the combination of checkpoint inhibition therapy  combined with a cabozantinib  compared to Sutent Meanwhile  updated results from the ongoing phase I trial of cabozantinib in combination with Opdivo  with or without Yervoy  in patients with refractory genitourinary tumors demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile  and high rates of durable responses in the previously treated metastatic UC and metastatic RCC cohorts In January 2018  Exelixis announced an amendment to the protocol for the phase Ib trial of cabozantinib in combination with Tecentriq in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors  The amendment added four new expansion cohorts to the trial  which now includes patients with non small cell lung cancer and castration resistant prostate

00  2 10 per share Estimates are RisingFor US Foods  its bottom line is headed down a steady upward track for the foreseeable future Earnings are expected to grow almost 78  for the current quarter  One analyst has revised their estimate upwards in the last 30 days  though one analyst has also cut their estimate for the same time period Fiscal 2018 figures are also looking pretty promising  with four estimates moving higher in the past month  The consensus estimate trend has jumped from  1 78 per share to  2 05 per share Earnings estimates for 2019 are on the rise as well  jumping from  2 01 per share to  2 34 per share in the last 30 days Can Shares Push Higher Shares of USFD have only gained 2 8  since the start of the year  and about 18  in the past one year period  Originally launched in 2000  Pandora Media is often referred to as an Internet radio pioneer  Its technology has helped it lead the free online music listening movement  With Pandora  a listener can enter a single song  artist  or genre to start a station  and its mathematical algorithms will combine with individual and collective feedback to suggest songs and build personalized playlists Pandora offers its users a free  ad supported version  as well as Pandora Premium  a  9 99 per month subscription that lets you play and choose any song or album and utilize playlist creation features Sitting at a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Pandora reported mixed fourth quarter results  but the company has been on a steady decline for a few years now  Is there any chance for a rebound for this Internet radio innovator Q4 Earnings  A Deep DiveLast week  Pandora reported an adjusted loss per share of 21 cents  missing the Zacks Consensus of a loss of 7 cents and falling short of the year ago quarter s loss of 13 cents per share as well Revenues grew just 0 7  to  395 million  which beat our consensus estimate of  375 million  If you exclude sales from Ticketfly and the recent winding down of operations in Australia and New Zealand  sales would have climbed 7  Subscription and other revenues increased as well  up 63 2  year over year thanks to subscriber growth and higher average revenue per paid subscriber  ARPU  ARPU was  6 08  up 32 8  from the year ago period  this metric was driven by growth in Pandora Premium subscribers However  advertising revenues fell 5  to  297 7 million  while total listener hours declined 6 5  on a year over year basis to 5 03 billion  The number of active listers also decreased  down 6  year over year to 74 7 million Earnings EstimatesFor the current quarter  one analyst cut their outlook in the last 30 days  and the consensus has dipped from   0 25 to   0 26  Earnings are expected to decline about 8 3  for this time period Three analysts have revised their estimates downward for the current fiscal year  though earnings are expected to grow over 51  in that time frame Looking at the next fiscal year  earnings could grow over 77   but analysts have been slashing their outlook for this time period as well  And  the current consensus has dipped from   0 04 to   0 08 in the last 30 days What s Next for Pandora Shares of Pandora are down nearly 11  so far this year  and have plummeted almost 67  in the past one year Additional content Why Nvidia s the Cheapest It s Been in Nearly a YearIt is no secret that Nvidia is one of Wall Street s most popular stocks  The graphics chip maker is a dominant force in the global gaming industry  and its tireless investments in self driving cars  machine learning  and artificial intelligence all but guarantee the company a spot among the tech industry s leaders for years to come Nvidia s leadership and innovation have also led to a massive surge in the company s stock  Over the last two years  NVDA has climbed more than 800   thanks in large part to excitement over the company s future focused technology But some of that surge has also been caused by rapid earnings and revenue expansion  with the company notching adjusted EPS growth of 61  and sales growth of 41  in its most recent fiscal year Nevertheless  Nvidia remains a speculative growth stock with sky high valuations  NVDA is currently trading with a P E ratio of 38 2  coming in significantly higher than the broader market average  as well as the 15 8 average displayed by its    industry peers To those skeptical of rising valuations in the sector  Nvidia s high P E is just another example of the bubble forming around tech stocks right now  Believers in Nvidia s future  on the other hand  argue that investors simply have to pay a premium for companies with the potential to lead humanity into the next great technological age One thing that nearly everyone can agree on is that Nvidia is quite the unique company  Prudent investors are correct to compare the stock to the others around it  but the uniqueness of the situation might also demand special consideration  In other words  investors looking to determine whether Nvidia is  cheap  or  expensive  might be best served by comparing the stock to itself Nvidia was battered by the late January sell off  but shares have recovered quite nicely  That means that the cause of this lower P E is also an improved analyst outlook and rising earnings estimates Within the past 60 days  we have seen 12 revisions with 100  agreement to the upside for Nvidia s fiscal 2019 earnings estimates  Over this same timeframe  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for that fiscal period  which ends in January 2019  has gained a staggering  1 56 Nvidia is now expected to witness adjusted full year earnings of  6 34 per share in fiscal 2019  which would represent growth of nearly 29  on a year over year basis This strong revision activity has helped NVDA earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   giving

119907,341422,FMC,EMCOR  EME  Posts Record Q4 Earnings   18 Outlook Strong,opinion,"EMCOR Group Inc    NYSE EME   posted fourth consecutive earnings beat  as fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations came in at a record  1 13 per share  The figure trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents by a whopping 31 4  
The earnings figure improved 56 9  year over year  driven by higher productivity and improved margins  Solid non residential construction demand and strong project execution boosted profits 
In 2017  EMCOR reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of  4 06 per share  up 31 4  from  3 09 reported in 2016 
Inside the Headlines
The company generated a record  2 013 million in revenues  which edged down 3 2  year over year  but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 932 million 
Revenues in the fourth quarter were primarily fueled by sound performance from the combined U S  Construction segments along with solid contribution from recent acquisitions 
In 2017  revenues inched up 1 8  year over year to  7 69 billion 
Coming back to the quarter under review  the U S  Construction segment  up 6 3  year over year  sustained its robust momentum and delivered strong revenues and operating income growth  The segment was driven by the U S  Mechanical Construction business  up 10 2    The U S  Electrical Construction business remained almost flat year over year 
The company s U S  Building Services segment revenues moved down 1 1  year over year  remaining pressurized by soft capital spending and the lingering impact of Hurricane Harvey  which deferred turnaround work 
The U S  Industrial Services revenues  affected by Hurricane Harvey  persistently exhibited a lackluster performance and contracted 1 1  year over year  The hurricane led to a delay in the fall turnaround work and under absorption of overhead costs for projects which the company was unable to execute  which dented margins 
Revenues from total U S  operations rose 2 2  year over year to  1 916 million  Revenue growth from the U K  building services continued on growth trajectory and grew 30  year over year to  96 6 million  The upside was driven by profitable new contracts and solid execution in base business 
As of Dec 31  2017  EMCOR s backlog was  3 79 billion  down 2 8  year over year 
A rise in the backlog of the U S  Building Services  U S  Industrial Services  and U K  Building Services segments more than offset the dip in backlog for the U S  Mechanical Construction and U S  Electrical Construction  resulting in overall growth 
From an end market perspective  the company witnessed growth in backlog for the commercial  institutional and hospitality markets  which was somewhat offset by the declines in industrial  water   wastewater  healthcare and transportation sectors 
EMCOR s operating income was  48 5 million  down 16 1  from the prior year quarter  Operating margins were 2 4   reflecting a contraction of 140 basis points from the prior year quarter 
EMCOR Group  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Liquidity   Cash Flow
EMCOR s cash and cash equivalents totaled  467 4 million as of Dec 31  2017  compared with  464 6 million as of Dec 31  2016  Total debt and capital lease obligations were  269 8 million  declining from  283 3 million recorded on Dec 31  2016 
In 2017  cash flow used in operating activities totaled  366 1 million  significantly higher than  264 6 million recorded in the year ago quarter 
Guidance 
Encouraged by its accretive acquisitions and increasing traction in the U S  construction space  EMCOR s management issued guidance for 2018  with earnings from continuing operations in the range of  4 10  4 70 
In light of the current size and mix of its backlog and overall positive market conditions  EMCOR expects revenues in the range of  7 6  7 7 billion 
Our Take
EMCOR ended 2017 on a strong note  as the company set fresh records for net income and outdid revenue expectations as well  Strong performance in the non residential construction segment has set the tone for robust future growth  reflected in the company s healthy backlog and 2018 guidance 
Also  a healthy balance sheet position and increasing market traction added to the company s strength  indicating bright prospects  Additionally  increasing strength in the non residential construction markets bodes well for the company  Building Services is also expected to gain from sustained growth in the retrofit and energy savings projects 
Meanwhile  the company sees continued headwinds in its U S  Industrial Services segment  which is likely to be affected by adverse  new build  heat exchanger fabrication pricing 
We believe that the company s diverse business structure along with concerted efforts to explore beyond traditional shop related operations for tapping other profitable areas like food processing and power  will drive long term growth 
EMCOR carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the broader construction sector include KB Home   NYSE KBH    MasTec  Inc    NYSE MTZ   and NVR  Inc    NYSE NVR    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
KB Home registered a positive average surprise of 12 9  in the four trailing quarters  beating estimates all through 
MasTec registered a remarkable positive average surprise of 28 1  in the last four quarters  driven by four consecutive beats 
NVR has a decent earnings beat history  beating estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 11

119908,341423,FMC,Why Nvidia  NVDA  Stock Is The Cheapest It s Been In Nearly A Year,opinion,"It is no secret that Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   is one of Wall Street s most popular stocks  The graphics chip maker is a dominant force in the global gaming industry  and its tireless investments in self driving cars  machine learning  and artificial intelligence all but guarantee the company a spot among the tech industry s leaders for years to come 
Nvidia s leadership and innovation have also led to a massive surge in the company s stock  Over the last two years  NVDA has climbed more than 800   thanks in large part to excitement over the company s future focused technology 
But some of that surge has also been caused by rapid earnings and revenue expansion  with the company notching adjusted EPS growth of 61  and sales growth of 41  in its most recent fiscal year 
Nevertheless  Nvidia remains a speculative growth stock with sky high valuations  NVDA is currently trading with a P E ratio of 38 2  coming in significantly higher than the broader market average  as well as the 15 8 average displayed by its    industry peers 
To those skeptical of rising valuations in the sector  Nvidia s high P E is just another example of the bubble forming around tech stocks right now  Believers in Nvidia s future  on the other hand  argue that investors simply have to pay a premium for companies with the potential to lead humanity into the next great technological age 
One thing that nearly everyone can agree on is that Nvidia is quite the unique company  Prudent investors are correct to compare the stock to the others around it  but the uniqueness of the situation might also demand special consideration  In other words  investors looking to determine whether Nvidia is  cheap  or  expensive  might be best served by comparing the stock to itself 
With that said  a quick glance at Nvidia s historical Forward P E reveals that the stock is actually trading at its lowest valuation in nearly a year 
Nvidia was battered by the late January sell off  but shares have recovered quite nicely  That means that the cause of this lower P E is also an improved analyst outlook and rising earnings estimates 
Within the past 60 days  we have seen 12 revisions with 100  agreement to the upside for Nvidia s fiscal 2019 earnings estimates  Over this same timeframe  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for that fiscal period  which ends in January 2019  has gained a staggering  1 56 
Nvidia is now expected to witness adjusted full year earnings of  6 34 per share in fiscal 2019  which would represent growth of nearly 29  on a year over year basis 
This strong revision activity has helped NVDA earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   giving investors yet another clue that now might just be the perfect time to scoop up some shares

Danaher s shares have gained  3 6  over the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has declined  2 1  over the same period  Danaher kept its impressive earnings beat streak alive as its fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings beat expectations  
The Zacks analyst is optimistic about the company s core revenue and earnings growth  on the back of improving order trends and its operating culture  DBS  Its recent acquisitions   Pall and Cepheid   are proving to be strong profit churners  and will boost top line growth as they become a part of the company s core revenues

This apart  the company remains highly vulnerable to adverse foreign currency translations  as a significant portion of its revenues is derived from regions outside the United States

119940,341455,FMC,Why Is China s Momo Inc  Stock Soaring Today ,opinion,"Shares of Momo Inc    NASDAQ MOMO   soared more than 12  in morning trading Friday after the Chinese instant messaging company acquired Tantan  China s top dating application  in an all cash deal valued at more than  600 million 
Such a major deal clearly signals that Momo is looking to diversify its core business in an effort to compete against Tencent s   OTC TCEHY   WeChat  the clear leader in China s instant messaging market 
 Our core position will continue to center on social networking and this acquisition enriches our product line in the social space   said Momo CEO Yan Tang   After the acquisition  the Tantan team will continue to operate the mobile apps under the Tantan brand with our full support  
Labelled as the  Tinder of China   Tantan claims to have created 5 billion matches since launching in 2015  The app never disclosed its private valuation  although we do know that it has raised about  120 million including  70 million in a funding round as recently as last year 
For Tantan  the deal presents the young company with a unique opportunity to scale while still operating under its own banner 
 The acquisition is a critical strategic upgrade to cover a greater range of user demographics and needs  and build up a larger social networking market through complementary businesses and strategic synergy  We are very confident in our future development   said Tantan CEO Yu Wang 
Momo shares opened higher and continued to climb in morning trading Friday  reaching an intraday high of  34 50 shortly after the opening of the U S  markets  The stock is now up nearly 35  over the past year  although it is still a long way off the 52 week high it reached in August 
Momo s failure to generate much momentum actually presents a unique value opportunity in the Chinese internet space  While many of its peers including Line Corporation   NYSE LN   and Weibo Corporation   NASDAQ WB   trade with sky high valuations  Momo is currently sporting a P E of just 13 9 
But Momo is still a stock with explosive growth potential  Our consensus estimates are calling for the company to conclude its fiscal 2017 with full year earnings growth of 97 7   followed up by an additional bottom line expansion of 28 2  in the upcoming fiscal year 
Momo is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   as well as an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system

bell The company has been gaining from the smooth execution of customer strategy along with disciplined inventory management  Also  it is enhancing market share through persistent store expansion and strengthening capabilities via further investments  Notably  these initiatives helped the company to deliver sixth straight positive earnings surprise in third quarter fiscal 2017  wherein sales marked its second successive beat  However  higher expenses continue to remain a headwind  which are likely to weigh upon the company s near term margin performance Nordstrom  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 24 for the fourth quarter reflects a year over year decline of 9 5   though it remained stable in the last 30 days  Moreover  analysts polled by

balance between its sales and expense growth  Also  it is focused on advancing in the technology space by boosting e commerce and digital networks  and improving its supply chain channels and marketing efforts  Management anticipates online penetration to exceed 25  by the end of the year Recently  the company also released sales and comparable store sales  comps  for the combined months of November and December  which primarily comprises the holiday season  Nordstrom recorded a 2 5  increase in net sales for the nine weeks  ended Dec 30  2017  while comps for the period rose 1 2   The solid holiday show was primarily driven by growth in Nordstrom s full line and Rack stores compared with the year to date sales performance and persistent strength in e commerce at Nordstrom com and  by the robust holiday sales  management raised its previously stated guidance for fiscal 2017  The company now expects sales growth of nearly 4 2   including the 53rd week  with comps expected to gain 0 5   Additionally  Nordstrom anticipates earnings in the range of  2 90  2 95 per share  marking an increase from the prior guidance range of  2 85  2 95 per share  The revised guidance assumes strong sales growth  persistent stability in merchandise margins and higher supply chain  technology  and occupancy costs related to the company s growth initiatives These factors have boosted the company s share price performance in the last three months  The stock has gained 22 7  compared with the  s growth of 11 7  Though Nordstrom s growth strategy bodes well  higher investments related to occupancy  technology  supply chain and marketing are likely to hurt the company s performance  Apparently  the company s merchandise margin was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the fiscal third quarter  This led contraction in gross margins and increase in SG A expenses  For fiscal 2017  the company anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off price growth What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that Nordstrom is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter

which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents  However  the bottom line was in line with the year ago figure Shares of Emergent have significantly outperformed the in a year s time  The stock has jumped 65 9  against the industry s decrease of 2 6   Revenues in the reported quarter climbed 28  from the year ago period to  193 8 million  primarily on the back of substantially higher product sales  This was however  partially offset by lower contracts and grants revenues  The top line also surpassed the consensus mark of  191 million Quarter in DetailTotal product sales significantly soared 85  to  161 6 million from the year earlier quarter  mainly owing to increase in sales of Emergent s anthrax vaccine  BioThrax  under the company s current contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for procurement of the same  Moreover  initial sales of raxibacumab  anthrax monoclonal antibody  and ACAM2000  smallpox vaccine   acquired from GlaxoSmithkline   NYSE GSK   and Sanofi   NYSE SNY   respectively  last year  also contributed to higher sales Notably  in early 2017  Emergent signed a two year contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for the delivery of BioThrax to the Strategic National Stockpile Contracts  grants and collaboration revenues plunged 66  year over year to  15 9 million  primarily due to decrease in

revenues were  16 2 million  slightly slipping 3  compared with the prior year number Research and development expenses were  28 5 million  up 5  from the comparable quarter last year  This rise is attributable to higher contract development services performed for next generation anthrax vaccine  NuThrax and broad spectrum antibiotic  EV 035 series Selling  general and administrative expenses

2018 revenue guidance in the band of  125  150 million from the previous expectation of  145  160 million on an unfavorable timing of deliveries of BioThrax The company anticipates adjusted net income between  110 million and  125 million  The midpoint of  117 5 million in the former forecast represents an improvement of 23  year over year Other UpdatesIn December 2107  Emergent was awarded a

119979,341494,FMC,U S  Bancorp Might Witness Ratings Downgrade By Moody s,opinion,"U S  Bancorp s   NYSE USB   long term ratings are under review for downgrade by Moody s Investors Service  a rating arm of Moody s Corporation  In March 2017  the rating agency had rated U S  Bancorp s senior unsecured and subordinated debt as A1 
Moody s initiated the review on account of the  613 million settlement that U S  Bancorp had agreed upon with several U S  regulatory bodies last week due to shortcomings in its anti money laundering and willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act   Read more   
Ratings for U S  Bancorp s subsidiaries along with its bank subsidiary  U S  Bank National Association  have been placed for review  U S  Bank s long term deposits rating of Aa1  issuer and senior unsecured debt rating of A1  baseline credit assessment  BCA  of aa3 and counterparty risk assessment of Aa2 cr  are also under review  However  short term ratings of Prime 1 for short term deposits and senior debts were affirmed and are not under review 
Following the legal settlement  Moody s felt the necessity to review whether the company s risk management system continues to be better in comparison to its competitors  Though  the settlement amount was beyond Moody s expectations  it anticipates U S  Bancorp s earnings and capital position remains well poised to bear the impact 
The rating agency will be considering whether U S  Bank s BCA rating of aa3 is still justified  Also  the changes in board processes along with oversight and the ability to guide management in identifying and mitigating potential future risk will be reviewed 
U S  Bancorp s enterprise wide risk governance  asset quality and operational risks will also be in focus of the review process  Notably  the company remains exposed to the risk of coming into light some other breach of law  which would lead to a violation of the two year deferred prosecution agreement that the company had agreed upon with the regulators 
What Can Drive the Ratings Up
Ratings of the company might witness an upgradation if Moody s is of the opinion that its enterprise risk governance and management stand superior to its peers and that it is likely to maintain above average and consistent financial metrics 
What Can Bring the Ratings Down
On the flip side  long term ratings can be downgraded if Moody s finds that the company s enterprise wide risk governance and management are not strong enough to place it above its peers  A sustained weakening in asset quality  capital or profitability metrics could also act as a negative factor 
Shares of U S  Bancorp have gained 4 7  over the past six months  underperforming the 19 7  growth for the  it belongs to

120011,341526,FMC,Is DineEquity  DIN  A Good Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put DineEquity  Inc   NYSE DIN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  DineEquity s Entertainment has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  DineEquity s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that DineEquity has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 16 1  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for DineEquity stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  DineEquity s Entertainment has a P S ratio of about 2 1  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  DIN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  DineEquity currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes DineEquity a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though DineEquity might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of A  This gives DIN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of C   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  Both the current quarter and full year have seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 22 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 10 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below DineEquity  Inc Price and Consensus     This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term Bottom LineDineEquity is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 37  of more than 250 industries  boosts investor confidence  However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in DineEquity Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you

quarter under review  GAAP earnings were  66 9 million or  1 78 per share compared with  7 1 million or 17 cents per share in the year ago quarter  The year over year improvement in GAAP earnings was

120016,341531,FMC, Will Soft Margins Hinder FEMSA s  FMX  Earnings In Q4 ,opinion,"Fomento Economico Mexicano  S A B  de C V    NYSE FMX   or FEMSA is slated to release fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 27  after the market closes  The question lingering in investors  minds is whether this major beverage company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported 
Last quarter  the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 293 7   However  it has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding three quarters  Nonetheless  the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 61 9  for the trailing four quarters  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Fomento Economico Mexicano S A B  de C V  Price and EPS Surprise
    What to Expect 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings is pegged at  1 08  reflecting year over year improvement of over 20   We note that earnings estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days  Additionally  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  6 55 billion  representing growth of 18 2  from the year ago quarter 
Factors at Play
FEMSA remains plagued with soft margins for over a year due to strained margins at Coca Cola FEMSA and lower margin businesses growth at FEMSA Comercio  Consequently  impacting the company s gross and operating margins in the preceding quarter as well  Additionally  margins were hurt by increased freight and labor expenses  consolidation of Coca Cola FEMSA s results in the Philippines and margin contraction at FEMSA Comercio s Retail division 
The company predicts operating margin to remain strained due to lower margins at FEMSA Comercio s Retail division  It anticipates operating margin for the segment to decline slightly compared with the previous forecast of flat margins 
Additionally  the company remains cautious about the rest of 2017 as well as 2018 due to bearish consumer sentiment and increased fuel prices  thanks to the high inflation rates  FEMSA also lowered sales outlook for fourth quarter 2017 and 2018  after three years of robust growth  Apart from the high inflation  other factors that hurt the outlook are Mexico s 2018 presidential election and continuing talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA   a keystone of Mexico s economy 
Consequently  shares of FEMSA have declined 6 3  in the past six months compared with the  s loss of 3 2  

While these factors pose a threat to the company s upcoming performance  FEMSA is well poised for long term growth through its strategic actions including expansion of store base  diversification of business portfolio and focus on core business activities 
What the Zacks Model Unveils
Our proven model does not show that FEMSA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
FEMSA has an Earnings ESP of  18 52   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  makes surprise prediction difficult 
As it is we caution against sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  which should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
Stocks With Favorable Combination
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Hormel Foods Corporation   NYSE HRL   has an Earnings ESP of  10 94  and a Zacks Rank  3   You can see

120054,341569,FMC,Should Value Investors Pick Brinker International  EAT  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Brinker International  Inc    NYSE EAT   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Brinker International has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 4  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 8  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Brinker International s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail   Food   Restaurant industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Brinker International has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 2  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Brinker International stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Brinker International has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  EAT is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Brinker International currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Brinker International a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Brinker International is just 0 9  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 8  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  EAT is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Brinker International might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives EAT a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight up and no down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 6 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 7 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Brinker International  Inc  Price and Consensus   This bullish trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBrinker International is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 35  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a

Key Estimates Ahead of NVIDIA Earnings Shares of Nvidia gained nearly 3  in morning trading Wednesday  just one day before the company is scheduled to release its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings report  The Wall Street darling was hit hard by the recent market wide sell off  but the stock is now almost fully recovered and investors can be sure that the company s report will attract significant attention Nvidia has quickly moved to the forefront of the global investing scene over the past two years  largely due to the company s focus on innovative technology  The Santa Clara  California based firm manufactures graphics processing units  GPU  and system on a chip units  SoCs  that are considered the top of the line in their respective industries Nvidia s traditional business focuses on delivering GPUs to the gaming market and SoCs to the mobile computing market  But over the past few years  its technology has exploded in popularity throughout several budding new industries and is now used in  smart  vehicles  datacenters  cryptocurrency mining  artificial intelligence  and autonomous driving On the back of growth in these new markets and excitement for what these industries could bring in the future  Nvidia shares have skyrocketed more than 750  over the past two years  including a strong 90  climb over the past 52 weeks But this share price explosion has also ushered in ludicrous expectations for the company  so the pressure will be on Nvidia to deliver another solid quarterly report tomorrow  Based on our current consensus estimates  we expect management to report adjusted earnings of  1 16 per share and total revenues of  2 67 billion These results would represent year over year growth rates of 17 2  and 22 8   respectively  That growth is a bit slower than we have grown to expect from Nvidia  but the company is starting to face tougher prior year comparisons  which should force investors to adjust a bit With that said  it is entirely possible that Wall Street hones in on Nvidia s performance in specific key businesses  as opposed to its overall results  This could be a more effective method for judging the company s position right now To prepare for this  we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file  The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts Investors will rightfully be interested in several of Nvidia s exciting growth catalysts  but it is also important to track how the company s core video gaming business is holding up  Our consensus estimate file is calling for Nvidia to report Gaming revenues of  1 581 billion  up about 17 3  from the year ago period  However  Nvidia notched 25 5  growth in Gaming revenues last quarter  so investors will hope that the company s holiday shopping season was stronger than analysts are expecting One division that will likely grow in magnitude over the next few years is the company s Automotive segment  This is still a relatively small revenue driver  but as the demand for AI powered autonomous driving grows  Nvidia should stand to benefit For the fourth quarter  our consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to report Automotive revenues of  150 million  which would represent year over year growth of about 12 2   Last quarter  Nvidia posted segment revenues of  144 million  up 13 4   so it looks like growth rates are expected to pick up Finally  investors are going to want to pay special attention to Nvidia s Datacenter business  which has been one of its fastest growing units in recent months  Last quarter  Nvidia reported Datacenter revenues of  501 million  up 108 8  from the year ago period Based on our consensus estimates  we expect to see Nvidia post Datacenter revenues of  549 million for Q4  That would represent year over year growth of 85 5  from the  296 million that was witnessed last year 85  growth is certainly nothing to scoff at  but investors have grown accustom to triple digit Datacenter growth over the past few quarters  This could be a key catalyst for the stock if Nvidia can beat expectations Make sure to check back here for our full analysis once Nvidia reports

120239,341754,FMC,Midstates Petroleum Proposes Merger With SandRidge  SD   revised ,opinion,"SandRidge Energy  Inc    NYSE SD   has recently been offered a merger deal from rival Midstates Petroleum Company   NYSE MPO   in an all stock deal  The move  if it were to be agreed upon at somew poibnt in the future  would create one of the largest oil players in the Mississippian Lime shale formation  Both Tulsa based Midstates Petroleum and Oklahoma based SandRidge have prominent presence in Mississippian Lime and the merger would be likely to unlock substantial synergies for both companies 
Following the news of the offer  SandRidge shares rose more than 2 2  to eventually close at  16 87 on Feb 6  On the other hand  Midstates Petroleum stock dipped around 1  to eventually close at  15 30 following the announcement 
This comes almost after a month SandRidge cancelled its plan to acquire Colorado based Bonanza Creek Energy   NYSE BCEI   amid shareholders  strong opposition 
Details of the Deal
SandRidge shareholders would be expected to receive 1 068 shares of Midstates Petroleum s for each share held  according to the proposed deal  per its closing price as on Feb 5  SandRidge shareholders would own a 60  stake in the combined company  with the remaining interest held by Midstates Petroleum  The combined entity would likely be valued at nearly  1 billion 
According to the proposal  Midstates  CEO David J  Sambrooks would serve as the chief controller of new entity  The proposal also supports the prolonged efforts of Fir Tree Partners and Carl Icahn   two of the biggest shareholders in both SandRidge and Midstates Petroleum   who have long criticized SandRidge s managerial decisions and wanted a change in the company s leadership position 
The new entity would own more than 450 000 net acres in the core of the Mississippian Lime play  with the production capacity of over 53 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  In addition  the combined company would also hold 75 000 net acres in the Northwest STACK play 
Benefits of the Deal
The merger would benefit from complementary assets which would likely lead to various financial  commercial and operational synergies  It would lead to cost synergies of around  70 million annually  generating free cash flow of over  100 million  The deal would lead to significant value addition for both companies   
Both companies have emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy after successfully completing debt restructuring  SandRidge recovered from bankruptcy in October 2016 after reorganizing  4 1 billion in debt  while MIdstates Petroleum came out of the same in December 2016 after writing off  2 billion in debt 
The proposed combined company would not have any debt and would display strong liquidity metrics with forecasted free cash flow of up to  480 million in the next five years  The acquisition would help the combined entity to yield superior risk adjusted returns in the coming years 
Zacks Rank and Other Stock to Consider
SandRidge is engaged in the development and production activities of oil and gas  The company s operating segment consists of Exploration and Production  Drilling and Oil Field Services and Midstream Gas Services The company carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy     Investors interested in the space can also consider Occidental Petroleum   NYSE OXY    sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

120267,341782,FMC,Auto Stocks Q4 Earnings  Key Predictions For BWA  GT  PAG,opinion,"sector s fourth quarter earnings announcement is in full swing  Of the lot  a few important companies have already released earnings for the quarter ending Dec 31  2017  On Feb 6  General Motors Company   NYSE GM   and Cummins Inc    NYSE CMI   reported quarterly results  Both companies delivered an earnings beat 
Now  let s assess the three important automakers namely BorgWarner Inc    NYSE BWA    The Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company   NASDAQ GT   and Penske Automotive Group  Inc    NYSE PAG    slated to announce quarterly performance on Feb 8 
Per the latest   as of Jan 31  185 companies under the S P 500 category have already reported earnings  These companies recorded estimate beat ratios of 82 2  and 80  in earnings and revenues  respectively  As of the same date  33 3  companies from the Auto sector have released financial numbers for the quarter 
In fourth quarter 2017  earnings growth for auto manufacturers is expected to grow 10 3  on a year over year basis  whereas revenue is expected to decline 2 5  year over year  However  the S P 500 companies are likely to witness 11 9  and 7 6  year over year growth in earnings and revenues  respectively  during the quarter 
With substantial freight and packages ready for transport  a spurt in demand for additional trucks is expected  However  rising interest rates and return of a huge number of late model used cars are coming in the way of new vehicle sales 
Now  let s take a look at the four auto companies scheduled to announce earnings figures on Feb 8 
We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model  combining a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold  with a positive   to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter  You can see  
You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Per our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that with an ideal combination of the two key ingredients   Zacks Rank and ESP   chances of a positive surprise are as high as 70  for the stocks lined up for an earnings release 
Michigan based BorgWarner is one the leading manufacturers of powertrain products for major automakers  Its products cater light  medium and heavy duty vehicles  Per our model   BorgWarner is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as the company has an Earnings ESP of  0 84  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Last quarter  the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Additionally  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise in all the trailing four quarters  Further  it has a long term earnings growth rate of 8 6    Read more       Goodyear is a world s leading tire manufacturer  It also engages in tire retailing and undertakes automotive repairs and other services  Last quarter  the company pulled off a positive surprise  Further  in the last four quarters  it exceeded estimates thrice and missed once with an average beat of 7 5  
The company has a long term growth rate of 12 4   Per our model  it seems that Goodyear is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as the company has an Earnings ESP of  4 92  and a Zacks Rank of 3   Read more       Bloomfield Hills  MI based Penske Automotive offers automotive and commercial truck dealerships in the United States  Canada and Western Europe  Further  it engages in the distribution of commercial vehicles  diesel and gas engines  power systems and related parts and services in Australia and New Zealand  Last quarter  it came up with a positive surprise  Also  Penske Automotive surpassed expectations with an average beat of 29 21  in three of the trailing four quarters and reported in line earnings on one occasion 
Per our model  it seems that Penske Automotive is also likely to beat estimates this time around  That is because it has an Earnings ESP of  0 84  and is a Zacks  3 Ranked player  The company has a long term growth rate of 7 3     From the above analysis  it appears that all the three companies are likely to come up with an earnings beat in fourth quarter 2017

120269,341784,FMC,Is MPSC Verdict A Respite For Southern Company s Kemper ,opinion,"The Mississippi Public Service Commission   MPSC   and the electric utility firm finally reached a settlement regarding the rate issue over The Southern Company s   NYSE SO   controversial Kemper project  MPSC has finally decided to lower the amount needed to recover from customers 
Looking Back
Mississippi Power  subsidiary of Southern Company and in charge of the Kemper Project  has spent years for the construction of the project  which is based on clean coal gasification technology  The Kemper plant had been central to ex President Obama s Climate Plan and was designed to lower up to 65  of carbon dioxide emission  Notably  the project also received the support of President Trump 
However  the project has been facing continuous criticism owing to its poor execution  cost overruns and multiple delays  The plant is already three years behind schedule and is over  4 billion beyond the stipulated budget  The overall cost of the plant was estimated to be around  3 billion in 2010  However  with several delays adding to the project s cost  the current price tag of the plant has ballooned over  7 5 billion 
The project found it difficult to get its two gasifiers to operate consistently  Thus in June 2017  MPSC issued an ultimatum ordering Southern Company to redesign plans and run the Kemper project solely on natural gas in a bid to eliminate ratepayers risk for the gasifiers  assets  Thereafter  the company suspended all coal gasification operations at its Kemper plant 
The company intended to retrieve the project s massive costs by passing it to ratepayers  The company had once warned of rate increase of more than 40   However  Mississippi regulators  who did not wish ratepayers to incur additional costs  ordered the company not to increase the rates for Mississippi Power customers  Since then  a cloud of uncertainty has been hovering over the project  leaving the management in a dilemma in regard to its investment costs retrievement 
Recent Update
To date  the company has written off about  6 4 billion in losses relating to the project  Per the recent agreement  Southern Company will not be able to retrieve any of these losses from the ratepayers in the future  Notably  the agreement will reduce the customers  bill by 2 4  and they will end up paying less than  3 per month than what they are currently paying  Taking into account the recent changes in tax law  the company will finally collect  99 million from the ratepayers this year compared with the previously agreed payment of  113 million 
Per the agreement  the plant will continue functioning as a natural gas facility and the company will no longer be entitled to operate the gasification unit of the plant  Additionally  the company will also vend a land adjacent to the plant  valued at  18 million   the proceeds of which will be rebated to customers 
Kemper s Fate Still Uncertain
While the recent update brings an end to the controversies surrounding the project regarding the rate issue  the commercial viability of the project still remains uncertainty as the utility has to absorb  6 4 billion losses associated with the project  Also  it will be difficult for the company to make the project economically viable amid volatile natural gas prices 
Southern Company is reeling under high debt which restricts its financial flexibility and ability to tap growth opportunities  The utility s long term debt at the end of the third quarter totaled more  44 billion  which represents a debt to capitalization ratio of more than 60   Moreover  the company s another major construction project   the Vogtle Plant   is also suffering from ballooning costs  poor productivity rates and is bankrolled with more than  8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees 
As such  amid the financials losses suffered by the company  whether the recent decision really gives a breather to the company is still a wait and watch story 
Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to Consider
Georgia based Southern Company carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell     A few better ranked players in the same industry are Pampa Energia   NYSE PAM    National Grid  LON NG  Transco   NYSE NGG   and Algonquin Power   TO AQN     Pampa Energia and National Grid sport Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   respectively  Algonquin Power carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

120272,341787,FMC,Statoil And 3 Other Top Ranked Oil Firms Raising Dividends,opinion,"Building on the sector s second annual gain in a row  energy stocks have witnessed a solid start to 2018 and look poised to continue climbing in the coming months 
Just a few months ago  or until September last year  the commodity had a very difficult year  In June 2017  U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  fell to nearly  42 a barrel   the lowest in ten months  Since then  the contract has risen more than 50   In fact  WTI hit a more than three year high of around  66 recently 
Unlike other short lived rallies over the past three years  we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals  Declining inventories and the extension of OPEC led supply cuts until the end of 2018 are the two major factors helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend 
Production Cut Deal Extension
One of the significant reasons why the U S  oil benchmark soared  revolves around the expansion of the output cut deal between OPEC and other major producers beyond March  True to predictions  the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018 
The agreement  now renewed twice  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day  or 2  of global supply  off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut  While there are several question marks over the degree to which the cartel members are adhering to their quotas  there s no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances 
Sharp Inventory Drawdowns
Investors have pinned hopes of recovery over the U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles   pointing to a slowdown in shale output  Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April  The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 411 6 million barrels  current crude supplies are 15 7  below the year ago period and the lowest since February 2015 
Investors Bet on a Sustained Rise in the Price of WTI crude
Currently at around  63 a barrel  the price of oil has more than doubled from the multi year lows of early last year and it s a whole new ballgame for investors who are now the most optimistic on the commodity than at any time in the past three years  They believe that the OPEC and Russian agreement will help whittle down huge global stockpiles and lead to even higher prices in the near term 
Strong Oil Market Supported by a Robust U S  Macro Economy
Notwithstanding recent hiccups  U S  stock markets have hitting all time highs on a regular basis  Stocks have mostly rallied since last year s election  with a booming U S  economy  supportive monetary policy and robust corporate earnings being the key triggers  Expectations that the Trump administration s proposed tax and regulatory reforms will help companies  and consumers  have given investors further reasons to put their money in stocks 
Improving Cash Flows Prompt Oil Companies to Reward Shareholders
As low oil prices over the past three years weighed on the energy companies  top and bottom lines  the industry was forced to chalk out new strategies and resort to dividend cuts and cost reduction initiatives to shore up cash flows  The downturn not only impacted the smaller and the more leveraged companies  it also affected the fairly larger companies  generally considered safe haven investments   They were forced to cut or suspend cash dividend and share buyback programs 
Thanks to rebounding oil prices and strategic initiatives  most of the energy firms have finally managed to successfully come out of the slump  A stable floor under crude price  together with lower operating expenses not only helped boost profits but also encouraged a number of companies to raise dividend payouts 
How to Pick the Right Stocks 
With a host of oil producers raising payout of late  It is no easy task to select outperformers  Therefore  we are using the Zacks Rank to zero in on companies with strong fundamentals 
To guide investors to the right picks  we highlight four energy stocks that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance  To learn more about how you can use this proven system for market beating gains  visit 
Finally  the chosen ones have recently announced another increase in their payouts to shareholders 
Statoil  OL STL  ASA   NYSE STO    Statoil ASA is a Norway based major international integrated oil and gas company  This Zacks Rank  1 company has operations in all major hydrocarbon producing regions of the world  it has an upstream focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf 
Statoil raised its quarterly dividend by 4 5  on Wednesday  to 23 cents a share 
Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD    Irving  TX based Pioneer Natural Resources Company is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company  the asset base of which is anchored by the Spraberry oil field located in West Texas  the Hugoton gas field in Southwest Kansas and the West Panhandle gas field in Texas Panhandle 
The company   carrying a Zacks Rank of 1   not only posted a comprehensive fourth quarter beat but also declared a semi annual dividend of 16 cents per share  or 32 cents annualized  This is a fourfold increase from the prior dividend of 4 cents 
Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC    Findlay  OH based Marathon Petroleum is a leading independent refiner  transporter and marketer of petroleum products  The company also as a Zacks Rank  1 
The company  which last week reported  on higher refining margin  recently approved a 15  hike in its quarterly dividend  Marathon will now reward shareholders with a dividend of 46 cents per share compared with 40 cents earlier  This translates to an annualized dividend of  1 84 per share 
Cabot Oil   Gas Corp    NYSE COG    Cabot Oil and Gas  based in Houston  TX  is an independent oil and gas exploration company with producing properties mainly in the continental U S 
Earlier this year  the Zacks  1 Ranked company declared a quarterly dividend of 6 cents per share  or 24 cents annualized  This is a 20  increase from the prior dividend of 5 cents

120295,341810,FMC,3 Key Estimates Ahead Of Nvidia s Q4 Report,opinion,"Shares of Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   gained nearly 3  in morning trading Wednesday  just one day before the company is scheduled to release its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings report  The Wall Street darling was hit hard by the recent market wide sell off  but the stock is now almost fully recovered and investors can be sure that the company s report will attract significant attention 
Nvidia has quickly moved to the forefront of the global investing scene over the past two years  largely due to the company s focus on innovative technology  The Santa Clara  California based firm manufactures graphics processing units  GPU  and system on a chip units  SoCs  that are considered the top of the line in their respective industries 
Nvidia s traditional business focuses on delivering GPUs to the gaming market and SoCs to the mobile computing market  But over the past few years  its technology has exploded in popularity throughout several budding new industries and is now used in  smart  vehicles  datacenters  cryptocurrency mining  artificial intelligence  and autonomous driving 
On the back of growth in these new markets and excitement for what these industries could bring in the future  Nvidia shares have skyrocketed more than 750  over the past two years  including a strong 90  climb over the past 52 weeks 
But this share price explosion has also ushered in ludicrous expectations for the company  so the pressure will be on Nvidia to deliver another solid quarterly report tomorrow  Based on our current consensus estimates  we expect management to report adjusted earnings of  1 16 per share and total revenues of  2 67 billion 
These results would represent year over year growth rates of 17 2  and 22 8   respectively  That growth is a bit slower than we have grown to expect from Nvidia  but the company is starting to face tougher prior year comparisons  which should force investors to adjust a bit 
With that said  it is entirely possible that Wall Street hones in on Nvidia s performance in specific key businesses  as opposed to its overall results  This could be a more effective method for judging the company s position right now 
To prepare for this  we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file  The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts 
Investors will rightfully be interested in several of Nvidia s exciting growth catalysts  but it is also important to track how the company s core video gaming business is holding up  Our consensus estimate file is calling for Nvidia to report Gaming revenues of  1 581 billion  up about 17 3  from the year ago period  However  Nvidia notched 25 5  growth in Gaming revenues last quarter  so investors will hope that the company s holiday shopping season was stronger than analysts are expecting 
One division that will likely grow in magnitude over the next few years is the company s Automotive segment  This is still a relatively small revenue driver  but as the demand for AI powered autonomous driving grows  Nvidia should stand to benefit 
For the fourth quarter  our consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to report Automotive revenues of  150 million  which would represent year over year growth of about 12 2   Last quarter  Nvidia posted segment revenues of  144 million  up 13 4   so it looks like growth rates are expected to pick up 
Finally  investors are going to want to pay special attention to Nvidia s Datacenter business  which has been one of its fastest growing units in recent months  Last quarter  Nvidia reported Datacenter revenues of  501 million  up 108 8  from the year ago period 
Based on our consensus estimates  we expect to see Nvidia post Datacenter revenues of  549 million for Q4  That would represent year over year growth of 85 5  from the  296 million that was witnessed last year 
85  growth is certainly nothing to scoff at  but investors have grown accustom to triple digit Datacenter growth over the past few quarters  This could be a key catalyst for the stock if Nvidia can beat expectations

120309,341824,FMC,3 Key Estimates For Activision Blizzard s Q4 Earnings Report,opinion,"Shares of Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   closed slightly lower on Wednesday  just one day before the company is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report  With digital revenues on the rise and highly anticipated releases like Call of Duty  WWII occurring during the ever important holiday quarter  investors can bet that ATVI will command the attention of Wall Street when it reports 
So what does Activision have in store for its fourth quarter report  Well  based on our current consensus estimates  we expect the company to report adjusted earnings of  0 93 per share and adjusted revenues of  2 61 billion  These results would represent modest year over year growth rates of 1 1  and 6 4   respectively 
But earnings and revenue only paint part of the picture  In today s quickly changing entertainment landscape  video game publishers have to be on top of current trends and ready to capitalize when the next trend emerges 
That means that investors will also be interested in how specific segments of Activision Blizzard s overall business performed in the holiday quarter  To prepare for this  we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file 
The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts 
First up  Activision Blizzard s King Digital segment is always important to track  Activision shelled out  5 9 billion for King  the publisher of the popular Candy Crush mobile games  in a deal that closed in Feb  2016  The acquisition was seen as a massive bet on the future of mobile gaming  and investors are still interested in seeing whether it has paid off 
Our consensus estimate file is calling for ATVI to report total King Digital revenues of  492 million  up about 12 9  year over year  Last quarter  the company reported growth of 15 0  in this segment  It is also worth noting that mobile gaming is significantly less impacted by cyclical trends compared to Activision s other businesses  so year over year and quarter over quarter comparisons are a bit more useful here 
Meanwhile  our current consensus estimates are projecting that Activision Blizzard will post total Activision brand revenues of  1 351 billion  which would represent growth of about 17 4  from the year ago period  Activision is the business segment that published the new Call of Duty game  so investors will be hoping for a strong quarter on the back of a decent opening for the popular franchise s latest iteration 
Finally  Activision Blizzard will hope to display strength in its Digital channel  The vast majority of gamers are buying their games online these days  especially considering the rise of PC gaming and the explosion of digital game sales on consoles 
Based on our current consensus estimates  we expect Activision to report total Digital revenues of  1 451 billion  accounting for nearly 55 6  of total revenues

120337,341852,FMC,Why Is Wynn Resorts Stock Soaring Today ,opinion,"Shares of Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   gained more than 8  in early morning trading hours Wednesday after the company announced that Steve Wynn has resigned from his position as CEO and chairman in the wake of a report alleging that the casino mogul engaged in decades of sexual misconduct 
The details of Wynn s alleged misconduct were first published in a Wall Street Journal  last month  Dozens of current and former employees described accounts that the Journal said amounted to  a decades long pattern of sexual misconduct  
The report also revealed that Wynn once paid a  7 5 million settlement to a former manicurist at one of his resorts who claimed that Wynn pressured her into having sex with him  Wynn also allegedly pressured massage therapists to perform sex acts for  1 000 tips 
Wynn s behavior was known by the staff at some of his properties  and employees at the spa would often make fake appointments in an effort to avoid contact with him  the WSJ said  also read    
In statements issued after the original report  Wynn said that the idea that he ever assaulted any woman was  preposterous   Nevertheless  the former CEO stepped down from his position as the Republican National Committee s finance chief shortly after the Journal published its story 
The trading of Wynn Macau shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange were halted ahead of today s announcement  In a company statement  Wynn again refused to admit any wrongdoing and instead blamed the  environment  created by the allegations 
 In the last couple of weeks  I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity  As I have reflected upon the environment this has created one in which a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else  including the facts I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles   Wynn said 
Wynn Resorts announced that the company s current president  Matt Maddox  would be taking over as CEO immediately  Shares of the casino and resort operator fell nearly 19  in the immediate aftermath of the WSJ report  and even with today s gains  the stock is more than 11  off its 52 week high

120338,341853,FMC,BP Maintains Dividend Payments  Is A Hike Around The Corner ,opinion,We are in the thick of the Q4 earnings season  with 251 S P 500 members having reported so far  Up until now  the energy sector has witnessed year over year earnings  of 146  in the fourth quarter  courtesy of a partial recovery in crude prices  Leading oil players like Chevron   NYSE CVX    ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP   and Pioneer Natural Resources Company   NYSE PXD   managed to hike quarterly dividends  following an improvement in Q4 results British energy giant BP plc   NYSE BP   also saw its fourth quarter earnings skyrocket from the prior year  However  the integrated energy firm maintained its dividend payment even though analysts were expecting it to announce a dividend hike along with quarterly results That does not mean that BP is not fundamentally strong enough to raise dividends  In fact  our research shows that the company has the potential to hike dividend in the near term Dividends Consistent Despite Crude DownturnThe market has experienced a downturn in crude prices  after fell below the  100 per barrel mark in August 2014 Excess supply of oil amid lackluster global demand led to multi year lows for the commodity  The concurrent race for market share among leading crude exporters like Russia  Saudis  and US shale players resulted in crude languishing in bearish territory Subsequently  energy players experienced trouble sustaining their businesses  ending up with huge debt loads  Eventually  many energy firms were compelled to stop paying dividends  Though BP couldn t escape the situation  it did reasonably well when compared to others BP has been paying s to American Depositary Share  ADS  holders for 13 quarters in a row despite persistent crude weakness  ADS holders will again receive dividend payments on Mar 29  2018 as announced by the company along with its fourth quarter 2017 results  the quantum of which has been maintained Investors should note that even though BP s adjusted earnings per ADS was  1 94  83 cents  and  1 88 in 2015  2016  and 2017  respectively  the annual dividend of  2 40 paid during each of the respective three years was comparatively higher The picture clearly shows that BP has been distributing dividends in excess of their earnings  a trend which may not be sustainable  In fact  the company s current dividend yield of 5 9  is much higher than the  3 8   In other words  the era of low crude prices and the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP operated Macondo Prospect   events which are still affecting the company    could not deter BP from paying shareholders steady dividends Can Investors Expect a Dividend Hike Since the beginning of 2018  crude has been trading above the  60 per barrel psychological mark  Notably  for the first time after 2014  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude started off the year above  60 a barrel  We view this as a partial recovery for oil prices  thanks to the extension of the production cut deal by OPEC players On Nov 30  2017  OPEC members met non OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord  first signed in late 2016  beyond the first quarter of 2018  More than 20 oil producers  including leading exporters like Russia and Saudi Arabia  participated in the meeting  As expected by most analysts  all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018 end  Saudi Arabia  Russia  and their allies have pledged to put 1 8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of market The improvement in crude price is favorable for BP as the company has a portfolio of major upstream projects  Last year  BP brought online seven key projects   Khazzan Phase 1  Zohr  Juniper  Persephone  Quad 204  Trinidad Onshore Compression and West Nile Delta   Taurus   Libra   which helped the firm produce record volumes of oil and gas during the October to December quarter  In fact  fourth quarter 2017 production touched the highest mark since the January to March quarter of 2011 BP is also expected to bring online five more upstream developments in 2018  All these projects along with the developments placed online during 2016 will likely help the energy giant add 800 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to net production capacity by 2020 All those developments are reflected in the company s healthy pricing chart  Over the past year  BP has rallied 18   outperforming the  8 2  gain  Hence  there are strong reasons to believe BP will be able to boost shareholder s dividends in the near term   BP carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

120386,341901,FMC,Snap  SNAP  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Surpass Estimates ,opinion,Snap Inc    NYSE SNAP   reported loss per share of 13 cents  which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents and the year ago quarter s loss of 19 cents The company reported revenues of  285 7 million  which came ahead of the consensus mark of  251 7 million and grew 72 4  year over year The year over year increase in revenues is impressive  given the decelerating growth trend that the company witnessed in the past three quarters  In the first  second and third quarters of 2017  the company s revenues had registered 286   153  and 62  year over year increase  respectively Notably  shares of Snap have lost 42 6  of their value since its listing date of Mar 2  2017 against 19 5  growth of its  Quarter in DetailAd revenues of  281 million in the quarter grew 74  year over year and 38  sequentially  Revenues from other sources contributed the rest  Snap s transition to automated auction for advertisements resulted in 90  of Snap Ads being bought programmatically during the quarter Snap s price per ad impression dropped 25  in the quarter but advertising impressions grew more than four times year over year  which drove results  Management notes that revenues from smaller businesses more than doubled sequentially Moreover  Snap s international revenues  23  of total revenue  increased 12  year over year and 20  sequentially The company s daily active users  DAU  and average revenue per user  ARPU  witnessed year over year improvement  DAU increased 18  year over year to 187 million  while ARPU improved 46  to  1 53  Management notes that net addition of 8 9 million DAUs to be the highest since the third quarter of 2016  driven by an increase in Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Android users Notably  on a sequential basis  DAU increased 5   This is also a positive as the company was witnessing decelerating growth in DAU  In the third quarter  it was a meagre 2 9   down from 4 2  increase in the second quarter and 5  in the first quarter Snap s costs per user  CoRPU  increased only 2  year over year to 98 cents  The company s main cost  hosting costs per DAU  was 70 cents  lower than the year ago quarter figure of 72 cents Snap s cost of revenues increased 24 7  to  191 2 million on a year over year basis  The company noted that its operating expenses for the quarter increased 17  sequentially  mainly due to an increase in legal costs  sales commissions and year end expenses and a modest growth in headcount Gross margin of 36  expanded 2 700 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter The company ended the quarter with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  2 04 billion  down from  2 3 billion as of Sep 30  2017 During the quarter  Snap used approximately  176 1 million of cash for operational activities  Free cash outflow was nearly  197 3 million Snap Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Our TakeSnap s decision to redesign the application taking into account the technical glitches is boosting its popularity among Android users  Management mentioned a 20  year over year increase in Android user retention in the fourth quarter Its initiatives to improve service in the international markets are also a positive  Snap s recent partnership with wireless carriers to reduce cellular bandwidth costs will drive its presence in the international market  The rollout of Stories Everywhere will help Snap gain prominence over the web as well The company s transition to programmatic advertising is also driving growth for the company  Snap s new ad format called Promoted Stories helps advertising partners to spend more time with the audience   However  we note that in the first three quarters of 2017  Snap s slowing user base and revenue growth rates posed concerns  User growth holds the key to attracting advertisers  which is the primary source of revenues for Snap  A slowdown in user base growth rate may look unattractive to advertisers  thus dampening its growth opportunities Management forecasts a slowdown in sequential growth in the first quarter as ad spending by large brands increased in the fourth quarter  which includes the important holiday season Stiff competition from the likes of Alphabet  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Twitter   NYSE TWTR   in the digital ad market remains an area of major concern  The total addressable market  TAM  of these companies is much larger compared to Snapchat In our opinion  advertisers are more likely to opt for Facebook s Instagram whose TAM is more than twice that of Snap s  To put it simply  it s unlikely for advertisers to pay for Snap s services as its reach is limited The company therefore  needs to focus more on the redesign of the application to make it simpler and easier to use  Moreover  Snapchat needs to emphasize more on the global market and target other age groups  above 34 year olds  in order to stay ahead in the competition Snap carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold

owned development properties  having 960 000 square feet of leasable space and 80 5  occupied as of the end of the quarter  for a total investment of  78 8 million  Further  Liberty commenced development of two wholly owned properties during the quarter  aggregating 705 000 square feet of leasable space  at an estimated investment of  44 4 million Balance Sheet PositionLiberty Property exited fourth quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around  11 9 million  down from  43 6 million recorded at the end of the prior year Notably  during the reported quarter  the company closed on credit facilities totaling up to  830 million outstanding at any one time as well as a delayed draw term loan facility aggregating up to  100 million OutlookLiberty Property provided its guidance for 2018 and projects FFO per share in the range of  2 53  2 65  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at  2 61 Further  the company s full year 2018 FFO per share projection is backed by same store operating income for the industrial portfolio s estimated growth of 3 4  on a straight line and 4 5  on a cash basis Also  the company expects asset sales in the  600  800 million band and acquisitions in the range of  400  600 million Our TakeThe better than expected performance of Liberty Property in the fourth quarter is encouraging  Notably  the company is gradually shifting its focus toward industrial properties due to favorable demand supply conditions  The company plans to fund investments in industrial assets through proceeds from dispositions of office properties  While such efforts are a strategic fit for long term growth  the near term dilution effect of such moves on earnings is unavoidable Moreover  supply of industrial real estates is likely to increase in the upcoming quarters and adversely affect the growth tempo of this real estate market  Also  rate hike remains a concern  Nevertheless  its premium quality industrial properties  situated in key locations  have the capacity to drive long term growth by leveraging on the e commerce boom and supply chain strategy transformations Currently  Liberty Property carries a Zacks Rank

120470,341985,FMC,Is TreeHouse Foods  THS  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put TreeHouse Foods  Inc    NYSE THS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  TreeHouse Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 7  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 2x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  TreeHouse Foods  current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 21 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that TreeHouse Foods has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 5  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  TreeHouse Foods has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  THS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  TreeHouse Foods currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes TreeHouse Foods a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though TreeHouse Foods might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of D  This gives THS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   ofC   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been favorable  For the full year  there were no estimate revisions  however  for the next year one estimate moved up  compared to no movements in the opposite directions in the last two months This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the full year quarter consensus estimate remained constant in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched upper by 0 02   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Treehouse Foods  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTreeHouse Foods is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 46  of more than 250 industries  boosts investor confidence However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold tickers for the entirety of 2018  Last year s 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double

Europe  Viacom Inc    NASDAQ VIAB    is set to report first quarter fiscal 2018  ended Dec 31  2017   Although the company carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   our earnings beat criteria was let down by its Earnings ESP of  1 64  Viacom Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Viacom s first quarter fiscal 2018 results are likely to be hurt by weak affiliate revenues in the United States due to loss of subscribers  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for affiliate revenues is pegged at  1 076 million  below  1 150 million in the previous quarter  Additionally  advertising revenues are expected to remain weak in the fiscal first quarter  Soft advertising and affiliate revenues are expected to hurt the company s primary division   Media Networks too  Below par performance of the company s principal revenue generating division will naturally hurt its overall results  Moreover  higher programming expenses have the potential to hurt results in the to be reported quarter However  the company s performance on the international front is anticipated to be much better  Additionally  strong growth in international consumer products is likely to boost ancillary revenues  Similarly  internal growth should boost total advertising revenues  mitigating the weakness on the domestic front   Read more  Moving to News Corporation   NASDAQ NWSA    this diversified media and information services conglomerate carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Moreover  the company s current Earnings ESP is  8 11  makes surprise prediction impossible  Nevertheless  its efforts to diversify revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement alongside stringent cost cutting are impressive  The company is also expanding its digital offerings  emphasizing on real estate businesses and augmenting digital subscriber base News Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   However  advertising  which forms a major part of total revenues  continues to be highly vulnerable to economic conditions  In fact  advertising revenues in the News and Information Services segment remained flat in the preceding quarter  This is because contributions from the buyouts of Australian Regional Media and Wireless Group  favorable foreign currency fluctuations and modest rise in digital advertising revenues were offset by sluggishness in the print advertising market and lower free standing insert revenues at News America Marketing  Previously  management had highlighted that FOX SPORTS Australia is likely to struggle against higher costs during the second quarter due to the amortization of NRL rights throughout the year   Read more   Taking a sneak peek at World Wrestling Entertainment Inc    NYSE WWE    we note that this integrated media and entertainment company is likely to beat expectations in the to be reported quarter  The company fulfills the Zacks earnings beat criteria as it has an Earnings ESP of  2 56  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see  World Wrestling Entertainment  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   WWE has garnered a stellar revenues record with sturdy growth delivered in the last three quarters  We believe this record is likely to continue as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreements with the new service provider for airing its flagship program   Raw and SmackDown   in different countries  Further  subscriber growth and worldwide increase in TV rights fees are anticipated to provide an impetus to the top line  Furthermore  revenues from international sponsorship will receive an additional stimulus from WWE s agreement with sports marketing agency   Lagard re Sports  We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services  WWE Network through its vast presence in more than 180 countries will be able to capitalize on the trend   Read more   Finally  let s assess the earnings beat criteria for Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation   a producer and distributor of motion pictures for theatrical and straight to video release  The surprise prediction for this stock is also difficult given its Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  4 19  Lions Gate Entertainment Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Lions Gate s strategic acquisitions and alliances to enhance its competitive position and maximize returns along with building a diversified portfolio bode well for the company  Notably  the addition of Starz is aiding Lions Gate to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in the streaming network  Moreover  the company has invested in The Immortals to capitalize on the increasing popularity of eSports  It expects the eSports market to grow more than 1 billion in fiscal 2018 However  fewer movie releases in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year might hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance  Dismal television production performance in the past few quarters has also been a concern for investors  Further  the escalating

either The company announced that its fourth quarter 2017 financial results will include certain items that will have a negative impact of 18 cents on its FFO per share  However  this amount will be excluded in the adjusted FFO per share figure The non recurring items will have a loss impact of 20 cents per share  after non controlling interests  on its net income for the quarter  Similar to FFO  the adjusted net income will exclude the impact On account of a reduction in corporate tax rates under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  the company will recognize  34 8 million of tax expense  The tax expense pertains to a reduction in deferred tax assets   primarily 220 Central Park South   of Vornado s taxable REIT subsidiaries   The company will also record expense of  4 8 million related to the

Harvoni   Sovaldi Plunges FurtherProduct sales came in at  5 8 billion  down 19 1  year over year  The decline was due to lower HCV sales  partially offset by higher sales across HIV and other therapeutic areas Antiviral product sales  which include Gilead s HIV and liver disease portfolio  came in at  5 2 billion in the quarter  down 21 2  HCV product sales  which include Harvoni  Sovaldi  Epclusa and Vosevi  were  1 5 billion  down from  3 2 billion reported in the year ago quarter  The downside was mainly attributed to lower sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi across all major markets Sales of Harvoni declined 60 7  year over year to  644 million in the quarter  Further  Sovaldi sales recorded a steep year over year decline of 78 4  to  117 million Epclusa garnered sales of  565 million in the quarter  down from the year ago figure of  1 0 billion Meanwhile  HIV and HBV product sales came in at  3 7 billion  up 8 8  year over year  The increase was primarily driven by continuous strong uptake of tenofoviral afenamide  TAF  based products such as Genvoya  which generated sales of  1 060 million  up from  563 million in the year ago quarter  Descovy  which recorded sales of  365 million  up from  149 million  and Odefsey  which registered sales of  325 million  up from  155 million  HIV treatments like Stribild and Complera Eviplera sales declined 42 6  and 25 2  respectively  Viread sales were down at  212 million  down 34 6  Atripla sales tanked 27 5  to  440 million  while Truvada sales fell 8 2  to  797 million Other products like Letairis  Ranexa  AmBisome and Zydelig recorded sales of  233 million  up 3 1     200 million  down 4 7     90 million  down 4 4   and  39 million  respectively Research   development  R D  expenses declined 11 9  to  845 million due to the 2016 impact of ongoing milestone payments  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses decreased 1 6  to  923 million  Adjusted product gross margin was 83 5  compared

adjusted SG A expenses are projected in the range of  3 4  3 6 billion and  3 4  3 6 billion  respectively  Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85 87  AcquisitionsThe company acquired Kite Pharma in 2017  The FDA approval for Yescarta  a CAR T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy should Gilead s prospects The company recently acquired Cell Design Labs to expand further in the CAR T space Dividend and Share RepurchaseConcurrently  Gilead declared a cash dividend of 57 cents per share of common stock for first quarter 2018  an increase of 10   The dividend is payable on Mar 29 to stockholders of record at the close of business on Mar 16  During 2017  the company paid cash dividends of  2 7 billion and repurchased shares for  954 million Our TakeThough the company topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the fourth quarter  the magnitude of the decline in HCV sales was larger than expected  The HCV franchise is under tremendous pressure due to lower patient starts and increasing competition  We expect sales to decline further going forward   We note that Harvoni  Sovaldi and Epclusa  face competition from AbbVie s   NYSE ABBV   Viekira Pak and Viekira XR  Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Merck s   NYSE MRK   Zepatier  Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid 2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further Meanwhile  the HIV franchise maintains momentum driven by the rapid adoption of TAF based regimens in the United States and EU  The TAF based regimens now represent 62  of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and the launches of Odefsey and Descovy in 2016  Truvada for use in the pre exposure prophylaxis setting also put up a strong performance as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with an estimated 153 000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017  The approval of Yescarta also bodes well for Gilead  We expect the decline in HCV franchise to offset the positive momentum of HIV franchise  Gilead is also intending to foray into the NASH

120528,342043,FMC,TSN Vs  K  Which Stock Will Fare Better This Earnings Season ,opinion,The earnings season is in full swing and the picture this quarter has been exceptionally good   with more than usual number of companies delivering better than expected performance  Moreover  companies are witnessing significant uptrend in estimates for the current as well as the subsequent quarter Per the latest  251 S P 500 companies have already put up their quarterly show  Earnings of these companies advanced 16  year over year on the back of 10 5  jump in revenues  Further  80 5  of these companies topped bottom line estimates  while 78 1  posted positive revenue surprise For the quarter under review  earnings for the total S P 500 companies are envisioned to rise 13   with revenues anticipated to grow 7 7   This fares better than the previous quarter  wherein total earnings rose 6 7  on revenue growth of 5 9   Encouragingly  out of the 16 Zacks sectors  14 are estimated to witness year over year earnings growth  The  sector  which also houses major foods stocks  seems to be one of them How is Consumer Staples Placed Well  we are yet to see the main show from this space  with many players scheduled to release earnings this week itself  The Consumer Staples sector seems to be well placed for the season  given favorable economic indicators like improved labor market and healthy consumer spending  To top it  President Trump s recent tax overhaul is likely to cushion many consumer companies Further  we note that growth efforts such as focus on innovations  strategic buyouts as well as product launches  are likely to keep driving the players in this space   including food stocks  However  heightened competition  price wars and input cost inflation remain threats for the sector that is currently ranked among the bottom 44  out of all Zacks sectors  Nevertheless  aggressive cost saving initiatives and attempts to keep pace with changing consumer patterns are likely to provide cushion This is evident from the overall expectations for the sector that gained 6 3  in a year  while the S P 500 rallied 18 3   For this earnings season  the bottom line of the Consumer Staples space is envisioned to climb 7 3  year over year with the top line is anticipated to advance 1 9   While earnings forecast is higher than 3 9  growth witnessed in the preceding quarter  the revenue projection on par with the previous quarter growth  That said  let s see what awaits the following food stocks that are queued up for earnings releases on Feb 8 Well our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive   the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Tyson Foods or Kellogg Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   is slated to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8  before the opening bell  We expect Tyson Foods to continue gaining from rise in demand at the chicken and the beef segments  Also  the company s prepared foods category has been depicting solid growth owing to rising demand for protein packed brands and synergies from the AdvancePierre s buyout Notably  Tyson Foods has been benefiting from its strategic buyouts  focus on protein packed brands and nutritious products as well as significant geographical foothold  Impressively  the company witnessed major sales from the markets of Canada  Central America  China  the European Union  Japan  Mexico  Middle East  South Korea and Taiwan   However  the company s earnings estimate of  1 51 for the fiscal first quarter depicts a year over year decline of roughly 5  from the year ago period figure  This might be due to the company s exposure to the risk of raw material price volatility  Also  stiff competition and intense promotions remain headwinds  Rising wage costs also pose threats to Tyson Foods  operating results  Tyson Foods  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise     Tyson Foods has an Earnings ESP of  0 17   Although  the company s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP but a negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult  Nevertheless  management announced a Financial Fitness Program last quarter  that is expected to enhance operating efficiency in the forthcoming periods  All these initiatives are likely to drive the company in the first quarter   Read More   Kellogg Company   NYSE K   is set to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 8 before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12 9   The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 7 88   However  the company has been witnessing top line weakness for the last two years  primarily due to lower demand  Particularly  weak performance of its cereal products in developed markets as well as soft U S  snacks business has been negatively impacting the company Further  Kellogg has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food  This trend is unlikely to change in the to be reported quarter and Kellogg expects its top line to remain subdued in 2017  decreasing 3  from 2016 level on a currency neutral comparable basis  Nonetheless  given the tepid sales growth  the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings  The company is investing in brand building  in store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation  Further  the company s sales in Brazil are likely to benefit from the Parati acquisition  The company s sales are also expected to somewhat benefit from Pringles  improved performance in Europe Cost savings initiatives like Project K and zero based budgeting program are also somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales  Although the top line has been weak  Kellogg s margin growth has been impressive  Pricing and mix improvement is anticipated to give support to its bottom line growth  Currency headwinds are also expected to diminish  thereby further supporting EPS growth  Overall  for the fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 96 cents  reflecting a 4 4  year over year increase  However  this Zacks Rank  3 company has an Earnings ESP of  0 26   which makes surprise prediction difficult   Read More    Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise     Thus  it looks like Kellogg s earnings growth prospects are better than that of Tyson Foods  However  we prefer to wait and see how things actually shape up for these food stocks this earnings season Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know

Harris Corp    NYSE HRS    a leading technology innovator  solving customers  toughest mission critical challenges by providing solutions that connect  inform and protect  is slated to report second quarter fiscal 2018 results  before the market opens

Nonetheless  Juniper is facing significant pricing pressure amid intensifying competition in the network equipment market from the likes of Arista Networks Inc  Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO  and others including white box vendors 
Moreover  the chances of this company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter under review are low  The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 68   A favorable Earnings ESP indicates a positive earnings surprise

120558,342073,FMC,3 Key Estimates For Facebook s Q4 Earnings Report,opinion,"Shares of Facebook   NASDAQ FB   closed more than 2  lower on Monday  just two days before the company is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter financial results  Facebook has remained a must own stock within the internet industry for years  but as investors gear up for its latest report  the company finds itself at what could be a major turning point 
Indeed  the social media king is currently embroiled in several of its fiercest public relations scandals on record including one that threatens to slow the red hot stock down in 2018  As of late  Facebook has been forced to answer questions related to the use of its website to spread disinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle  Mark Zuckerberg s polarizing company is also dealing with increased public scrutiny over data security 
Facebook has already received criticism from both lawmakers and the general public for its failure to properly vet content on its website  Now  the company is slated to increase spending on security and double down on its initiatives to prevent abuse  pledging in its previous earnings announcement to invest  so much in security that it will impact our profitability  
But up to this point  Facebook has overcome whatever challenges it has faced by continuing to innovate and expand  So what should investors expect from the company this quarter  Well  our current consensus estimates are calling for Facebook to post adjusted earnings of  1 96 per share and revenues of  12 563 billion  which would represent year over year growth of 39 0  and 42 6   respectively 
Key Report Items
But of course  total earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be looking at when Facebook reports on Wednesday  In fact  it is entirely possible that the company s post earnings momentum is based on its performance in what investors have determined to be its key report items  especially if the stock hopes to shake off concerns about security spending 
To prepare for this  we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file  The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts 
One of the most compelling figures in any Facebook report is the company s monthly active users  MAUs  total  According to our latest consensus estimates  Facebook is expected to report that it finished the quarter with 2 134 billion MAUs  That would represent growth of about 14 7  year over year and 3 0  sequentially 
Another thing that investors will likely hone in on is Facebook s average revenue per user  ARPU  figure  This gives investors a better idea of how well Facebook is capitalizing on each individual user  and steady growth in this category will become even more important as user growth eventually plateaus 
Our consensus estimate file is currently calling for Facebook to report ARPU of  5 89 in the quarter  This result would mark growth of 21 9  year over year and 16 2  sequentially  possibly indicating that the company s new focus on video has paid off 
Finally  we should also highlight growth in Facebook s Asia Pacific region  which has been one of its key expansion catalysts recently  Based on our most recent consensus estimates  we expect that Facebook will report Asia Pacific revenues of  2 040 billion for the quarter  which would represent growth of 51 2  from the year ago period  Last quarter  Facebook reported growth 52 5  in this region

120560,342075,FMC,Factors Keeping The Coal Industry Alive,opinion,"Energy analysts downplay coal as a fuel source and are quite skeptical about its prospects  But the Trump administration remains committed to the industry s competitive position through the relaxation of emissions rules 
Apart from the relaxation of stringent environment legislation  coal demand also benefit from the higher price of natural gas and improvement of coal prices in the global market  An increase in steel production from Asian countries like China and Japan will pave the way for shipments of metallurgical coal 
Per a report from the World Coal Association  there are currently 861 billion tons of proven coal reserves worldwide  implying that there is enough coal to last nearly 112 years at the current rates of production  Compared with this  proven oil and gas reserves are predicted to last around 46 and 54 years  respectively  at the current production levels 
The current availability of coal even outpaces the combined proven reserves of oil and gas  So  the advantages of coal cannot be overlooked  and may be expected to brighten long term prospects of investors 
Trump s decision to walk out from the Paris Climate Agreement and repeal the Clean Power Plan should keep fossil fuel based electricity generation afloat longer  Also  the recent Supreme Court ruling temporarily halted the implementation of the Clean Power Plan 
Let s dig a little deeper into the factors driving this industry 
Coal s Share in U S  Power Generation  Despite usage of natural gas  coal is still among the major sources of fuel for electricity generation in the United States  Per the U S  Energy Information Administration s   EIA    release  coal s share in electric generation was 30  in 2017 and is expected to average nearly 30  in 2018 as well 
Even with a decline of coal s share in power generation from historical levels  it is quite heartening to notice that the U S  electricity generation is increasingly shifting to refined coal  Per EIA  use of refined coal has increased from 17  of power sector coal consumption in 2016 to nearly 19  in 2017  We expect the rising awareness among the U S  utility operators to lead to increased usage of refined coal in power production  which has less emissions compared with conventional coal 
In addition  the utility operators in the United States are installing mercury control equipment in the coal fired plants to meet the emission control standards  a big positive for the coal industry in the country 
EIA release showed the delivered coal price averaged  2 10 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in 2017 and is expected to increase to  2 21 MMBtu in 2018 
Coal as Input for Steel Industry  Due to its heat producing nature  hard coal  metallurgical or coking coal  forms a key ingredient in the production of steel  Nearly 70  of global steel production depends on coal  Since  met coal  is an essential ingredient for the production of steel  U S  met coal producers are likely to benefit from the increase in steel consumption 
Although the steel industry is expected to remain under pressure for some time  it is certainly expected to grow on the back of flourishing automotive and construction industries  A recent report by The World Steel Association showed that world crude steel production reached 1 691 2 million tons  Mt  in 2017  up 5 3  from 2016  Steel production in 2018 is expected to improve from 2017 levels  This definitely is a ray of hope for metallurgical coal producers and will boost prospects of metallurgical coal producers likeArch Coal Inc   ARCH  
Demand Upsurge in Asian Countries  The increasing demand for coal in Asian economies like China and India has been a key price driver since the end of recession in 2009  We expect this trend to continue in the future  primarily owing to rising energy needs in India  China and Southeast Asian countries 
Though Asian countries also produce coal  it is not sufficient to meet the growing demand in the region  resulting in regular imports  Southeast Asia has a surging demand for electricity  chiefly due to its improving economies  Numerous coal based power plants are presently under construction and more are being planned over the next few years  This will create ample export opportunities for the U S  thermal coal producers  Per a International Energy Agency release  coal imports in India will increase 5  per year through 2022 
Per EIA  coal production increased 45 million short tons  MMst   6   in 2017 to 773 MMst in response to high demand for U S  coal exports  However  coal exports are expected to drop in 2018 due to use of cheap natural gas 
Recently  Cloud Peak Energy  CLD  entered into a long term coal export sales agreement with JERA Trading Pte Ltd  for supplying coal to two power plants in Japan  The coal shipment is expected to begin at the end of 2019 and is likely to continue for a period of 30 40 months  The coal export volumes are expected to touch 1 million metric tons in the final year of contract 
Not Just Electricity Generation  Electricity generation is just one use of coal in the United States  Manufacturing plants and industries use it to make chemicals  cement  paper  ceramics and metal products  etc  Methanol and ethylene  which can be prepared from coal gas  are used to make products such as plastics  medicines  fertilizers and tar 
Certain industries consume large amounts of coal  For example  concrete and paper companies burn coal  and the steel industry uses coke and coal by products to make steel for bridges  buildings and automobiles  Per the EIA  consumption of coal in other sectors is expected to remain flat in 2018 at 52 4 MMst and increase by 0 7 MMst year over year to 53 1 MMst tons in 2019 
New Coal Focused Company  The much awaited spin off of CONSOL has resulted in the formation of coal focused CONSOL Energy Inc  NYSE CNX    CEIX   which will have interest in the Pennsylvania Mining Complex  the Baltimore Marine Terminal and approximately 1 billion tons of greenfield coal reserves 
To Sum Up
Interestingly  among all other coal companies  Contura Energy  CNTE   carrying a Zacks Rank  3  seems to be operating on a different level  The company surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters  Contura Energy is expected to come out with positive earnings surprise this season as well  You can see  
For the aggressively growing and energy hungry Asian economies  coal seems to be the most popular source of power generation  despite inroads being made by renewables  In a global scale  the importance of coal as a fuel source is far from over  but U S coal producers will continue to face tough competition from the coal exporters in Australia  Indonesia and Russia 
Coal is by far the most stable source of energy  The majority of the coal consumed in the United States is actually produced in America and the coal industry provides jobs to thousands of Americans  The  America First  approach of President Trump will help the coal stocks to remain in focus

Here are the developments in detail 
A Mixed Week for Wynn
Earnings Beat 
Wynn Resorts posted strong fourth quarter 2017 results  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts 
Earnings of  1 40 per share surpassed the consensus mark by 2 9  and increased more than 100  from the year ago figure of 50 cents  given a substantial increase in operating income from Macau operations  Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau  and income tax benefit from U S  tax reform  partially offset by a decrease in Redemption Note fair value 
Revenues exceeded the consensus mark by 9 7  and increased 29 9  year over year  again driven by significant contribution from Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau 
CEO Accused of Harassment 
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that several women said they were harassed or assailed by Wynn chairman and CEO  Steve Wynn  Wynn denied all allegations the same day  stating   The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous  
The casino tycoon resigned from his RNC finance chair role the next day  He has been a high volume Republican donor  and led fundraising activities of the RNC during President Donald Trump s first year  helping the committee earn more than  130 million 
Commitment to Renewable Energy
A day before the CEO disaster  Wynn announced that it will power its multi use development  Paradise Park  entirely with renewable energy from the Enel  MI ENEI  Green Power North America  EGPNA  owned and operated 27 MW Wynn Solar Facility  The facility is currently under construction in Stillwater  NV and is expected to start operating by the first half of 2018 
The move will help meet 75  of Wynn Las Vegas  current peak power requirements  Wynn claims that no other resort in Las Vegas and gaming operator in Nevada has ever used such high percentage of renewable energy 
Wynn Resorts carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Las Vegas Sands Q4 Earnings Beat on Solid Top Line
The company s fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 3  and increased 41 9  year over year on higher revenues  Net revenues of  3 4 billion beat the consensus mark by 6 3  and increased 11 7  year over year 
The solid performance can be attributed to the scale and diversity of gaming and non gaming services across Macao and Singapore operations 
Las Vegas Sands carries a Zacks Rank  2 

Price Performance 
The following table shows the price movement of the major gambling stocks in the past week and the last six months In the last five trading sessions  share price movement of the major gambling stocks displayed a more or less dismal trend  Notable movements include that of Wynn Resorts  Melco Resorts   NASDAQ MLCO   and Century Casinos   NASDAQ CNTY    which lost 7 7   3 6  and 2 5   respectively

120583,342098,FMC,Should You Buy Advanced Micro Devices  AMD  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD   gained more than 2 5  in morning trading hours on Monday  just one day before the trendy chipmaker is set to release its latest quarterly earnings results  Now  with the stock on the rise ahead of its report date  many investors will be wondering whether it is time to buy AMD or avoid the often volatile semiconductor maker altogether 
Based in Sunnyvale  California  AMD produces microprocessors  chipsets  discrete graphics processing units  GPUs   and professional graphics  The company operates under two segments  Computing   Graphics and Enterprise  Embedded   Semi Custom 
AMD has garnered significant attention over the past few years thanks to a rise in demand for many of its products and an influx of noteworthy competitors in its key businesses  The stock is up just a modest 24  over the past year  but investors can bet that Wall Street s focus will be firmly planted on the company when it reports on Tuesday 
Latest Outlook
Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  we expect AMD to report adjusted earnings of 5 cents per share and revenues of  1 40 billion  In the year ago period  the company posted a per share loss of one cent and revenues of  1 11 billion 
Of course  total earnings and revenue are not the only items in AMD s report that investors will be interested in  In fact  it is possible that AMD s post earnings momentum is inspired by its performance in key business units  To prepare for this  we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file 
The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts 
According to our latest consensus estimates  AMD is expected to report Computing   Graphics revenues of  839 million  up about 39 8  from the year ago period  That growth rate would represent a noticeable cooling off from the 73 5  expansion witnessed last quarter  but strong demand for GPUs in like gaming and cryptocurrency mining should still lift results 
Meanwhile  our consensus estimates are calling for AMD to post Enterprise  Embedded   Semi Custom revenues of  562 million  which would mark year over year growth of roughly 11 1   This result would also represent an improvement from the 1 3  slump witnessed last quarter  Analysts have cited strong adoption of the company s EPYC server processors as a key growth catalyst in this division 
Earnings ESP Whispers
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that AMD surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Just one day out from its report  AMD is sporting a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an Earnings ESP of 12 75   That is because the company s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at 6 cents per share  meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus  This improved outlook is a good sign heading into the report

Another important thing to consider ahead of AMD s report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices  To view the latest trends here  check out the company s price and surprise chart over the course of its last three quarters Advanced Micro Devices  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   AMD s earnings beat streak actually extends beyond the pictured quarters  The company has now met or surpassed earnings estimates in six consecutive quarters  However  we can see that positive surprises do not always lead to strong share price surges  In fact  the stock dipped significantly after its Q3 report and would take more than two months to return to its pre report levels 
With that said  investors will need to consider that forward guidance can be the catalyst for the stock s post earnings momentum  Guidance can also be extremely unpredictable 
One thing to remember is that most tech firms have been taking one time charges related to the recent U S  tax reform bill  These charges have resulted in a significant difference between adjusted and GAAP earnings results  but the overall impact of tax reform has led to favorable earnings guidance for the next few quarters

120584,342099,FMC,Roche Hemophilia Drug Hemlibra Gets Positive CHMP Opinion ,opinion,"Roche   OTC RHHBY   announced that the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use   CHMP   has adopted a positive opinion for Hemlibra  emicizumab  for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients suffering from hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors 
The CHMP has recommended the drug for use in all age groups 
The Marketing Authorisation Application is being reviewed under accelerated assessment 
A final decision is expected from the European Commission shortly  The CHMP recommendation is based on the positive results of two pivotal clinical studies for people with haemophilia A with inhibitors  the phase III HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 2 studies 
We note that the FDA approved Hemlibra for routine prophylaxis to event or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in November 2017  Hemlibra was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in people aged 12 years or older with haemophilia A with inhibitors in September 2015 
Meanwhile  Hemlibra is being evaluated in a clinical development program that includes two additional phase III studies  HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4  Results from HAVEN 3 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the number of treated bleeds over time in adults and adolescents  12 years of age or older  with haemophilia A without inhibitors who received Hemlibra prophylaxis every week or every two weeks  compared with those receiving no prophylaxis  Interim results from HAVEN 4 showed a clinically meaningful control of bleeding in adults and adolescents  12 years of age or older  with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors who received Hemlibra prophylaxis once every four weeks 
A potential approval in Europe will further boost Roche s hematology portfolio which includes approved drugs like MabThera Rituxan  Gazyva Gazyvaro  Tecentriq and Venclexta as well as an encouraging pipeline comprising candidates like polatuzumab vedotin RG7596 and a small molecule antagonist of MDM2  idasanutlin RG7388  
We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie   NYSE ABBV    Both companies are jointly commercializing in the United States  AbbVie is commercializing the drug outside the United States 
Earlier in the month  the European Commission  granted marketing authorization for multiple sclerosis  MS  drug Ocrevus 
The drug is approved for active relapsing forms of MS defined by clinical or imaging features as well as for early primary progressive MS in terms of disease duration and level of disability  and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity 

 
Roche s stock has lost 3 1  over a year compared with  s gain of 2 9  
Approval of new drugs and a potential label expansion of existing drugs bode well for Roche as its legacy drugs like Herceptin  MabThera are facing competition from biosimilars 
Novartis AG   NYSE NVS   has already launched its biosimilar version of Rituxan  MabThera in Europe  Amgen   NASDAQ AMGN   has also obtained FDA approval for a biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer  colorectal cancer  glioblastoma  renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 14 major stocks  including Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   Illinois Tool Works  ITW   and Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE BK   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Johnson   Johnson s shares have gained  28 5  in the last one year  almost in line with the  29  gain of the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  J J s fourth quarter results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for sales  As expected  J J s sales growth accelerated in the second half backed by higher sales in the Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices  
Though quite a few key products in J J s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition  the Zacks analyst thinks new products in all segments  label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions   mainly Actelion   can support top line growth   Meanwhile  share buybacks and the restructuring initiative should provide bottom line support  However  headwinds like generics competition  pricing pressure  sluggish growth in the Consumer segment and soft global market conditions remain

Shares of Buy rated Illinois Tool Works have outperformed the Zacks Industrial Machinery industry over the last three months  gaining  13 7  over the period versus the industry s  11 7  gain  The Zacks analyst thinks the company is well positioned to benefit from its solid product portfolio and strengthening foothold in various end markets  Also  its strategic initiatives to improve margins and policy of rewarding shareholders handsomely will work in its favor  In fourth quarter 2017  earnings of  1 70 per share surpassed expectations by 4 9   For 2018  the company anticipates earnings to be within  7 45  7 65 per share  reflecting 40 cents growth at mid point  Organic revenue growth is expected to be 3 4  while total revenues are projected to be roughly within the  15  15 2 billion range  Enterprise initiatives are likely to contribute 100 basis points  bps  to operating margin growth  Also  the company is working to increase its dividend payout rate to 50  in August 2018

BNY Mellon s shares have underperformed the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry in the last six months   8 9  vs   21 8    The company s earnings have surpassed expectations in two of the trailing four quarters  Its fourth quarter 2017 results benefited from improvement in net interest revenues along with provision benefits  However  rise in expenses and lower fee income acted as headwinds  Easing margin pressure  driven by gradual higher interest rates  and rising loan demand are expected to further aid revenue growth  Also  potential lesser regulations  lower tax rates and cost saving initiatives are likely to drive profitability  However  concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee based income remains a matter of concern for the company  If there are any changes in individual investment preferences  regulatory amendments or a slowdown in capital market activities  it could hurt the company s financials

PositiveRecently  Quality Systems acquired EagleDream  a software analytics solutions company  It was incorporated in the company s operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018  During the quarter  the company closed 10 deals across a broad product spectrum of accounts  both by specialty and geography  It has also led to a swift uptake in interest from the company s user base around EagleDream  Thus  Quality Systems witnesses deal flow and significant interest from the integration of EagleDream Bookings StrengthenA sequential 17  increase in bookings majorly drove sales in the reported quarter  which amounted to 30 5 million Interoperability FrameworkThe company s framework is suitable for its software to exchange and make use of the information  Per management  the company had more

is transportable not just within the company database  but also across the industry Margin DetailsGross profit for the third quarter totaled  70 1 billion and gross margin is at 53 2   Gross margin declined 429 basis points on a year over year basis  The decline is mainly due to a general shift to lower margin subscription revenues RCM margins are too compressed as the company invested for future efficiencies and witnessed some headwinds this quarter from personnel expenses Operating expenses surged due to investment in sale and marketing as well as acquisitions  partially Financial ConditionThe company exited the third quarter with 23 4 million in cash and equivalents and 39 million in outstanding against revolving credit agreement at the end of the quarter  Quality Systems

while revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate Solid revenue growth and segmental support buoys optimism  Revenues benefited from EagleDream software platform  which has been enjoying favorable market response since its integration in the reported quarter On the flip side  declining revenues in the Software and Hardware Related segment are a concern  Operating expenses are also high due to

quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 8 6  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayPitney Bowes  concerted efforts to transform business have started to show results as evident from growth across most business lines  For instance  the new channels that the company has been developing over the last four years namely  the tele and digital channels

from  20 million business to a worth of over  400 million  Going forward  the company anticipates this segment s growth rate to accelerate  in light of expansion in overall retail volumes and customer wins  Further  the company expects the Commerce Cloud platform to act as the foundation for all its products and solutions  enhancing digital capabilities and web based solutions  consequently acting as a decisive factor influencing growth going forward Further  the company s ardent lookout for strategic acquisitions  like building channel partnerships with systems integrators and other technology companies  is likely to strengthen competitive position in the software business  This apart  the company s prolonged effort to enhance and optimize new enterprise business platform is also

has witnessed a decline in revenues  For instance  during third quarter  SMB Solutions revenues dipped 7 4  year over year  The tepid performance can primarily be attributed to prolonged softness in the North American Mailing business as well as International Mailing Business  These factors could be a drag on segment margin and is likely to put pressure on the overall top line performance in the upcoming quarter as well Moreover  the company has been experiencing a surge in operating expenses on account of ERP implementation in the United States and higher marketing expenses in relation to

due to ERP implementation in the United States and higher marketing expenses in relation to aggressive advertising and marketing strategies  Till the benefits of ERP materialize  the company is

120717,342232,FMC,Dismal Holiday Quarter To Impede GoPro  GPRO  Q4 Earnings,opinion,GoPro  Inc    NASDAQ GPRO   is slated to release fourth quarter 2017 results  after the closing bell on Feb 1 The company has had a decent earnings history  having beaten estimates each time over the trailing four quarters  Last quarter  GoPro reported adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share  far ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate which was at breakeven level Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderEarlier this month  GoPro released a profit warning ahead of fourth quarter 2017 earnings results  The company lowered its projected revenues for the critical holiday season to about  340 million  marking it as its worst holiday quarter since the company went public  This marks a significant slump from an already disappointing previous sales projection of  470 million Also  it represents a 37  year over year sales plunge in the key holiday quarter  and is behind the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  384 million  The company stated that its revenues took a hit of about  80 million due to discounting for its Karma drones  as well as the Hero line of cameras  during the holiday quarter The company also decided to abandon its drone business and slash 20  of workforce after a witnessing sub standard holiday quarter  Karma has been a roller coaster ride for the company  punctuated mostly by lows rather than highs  Karma was facing mounting margin challenges in a tremendously competitive aerial market  even as a hostile regulatory environment in Europe and the United States severely limited its total addressable market  The failure of this unit will likely have a deep depressing impact on GoPro s upcoming financials Further  the company stated that it saw soft demand for the flagship HERO 5 cameras at the beginning of the holiday quarter  This would also hamper the top line for the quarter under review  Additionally  the company was forced to offer the cameras at discounted prices to shore up sales  which would also put pressure on margins  consequently With this major fourth quarter revenue shortfall  the company s full year growth is in serious jeopardy  In addition  GAAP losses might result in additional cash burn  further weakening the company s balance sheet Not surprisingly  the company s stock has had a dismal run on the bourse   having depreciated 31 4  over the past one year   in stark contrast to the  s average position return of 20 2   GPRO is playing in a brutally competitive market  and has not been able to hold its own against camera makers such as Nikon  Olympus  and Canon  as well as electronic players  including Samsung  KS 005930   Panasonic  and Sony  Its market share has been continuously threatened by lower cost alternatives from Sony  Xiaomi  Garmin and HTC  The result has been consistent   sharp revenue and earnings declines in the last couple of years   and this quarter is expected to fare no better In light of the recent dreadful developments at the company  the analysts  community has become increasingly bearish on the stock  with the company s estimates plunging headlong over the past month  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has nosedived from earnings of 4 cents to a loss of 50 cents over the past month  highlighting acutely negative expectations from the company GoPro  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that GoPro will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 10 cents   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks

120738,342253,FMC,Why An Earnings Beat Is Unlikely For Duke Realty  DRE  In Q4,opinion,Duke Realty Corp    NYSE DRE   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 31  after the market closes  Revenues are expected to grow sequentially Last quarter  this commercial real estate investment trust  REIT  delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 5   Results witnessed same property net operating income growth on the back of robust rental growth  Nonetheless  total occupancy declined sequentially The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being nearly 6   The graph below depicts this surprise history Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Notably  Duke Realty s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 8 5  in the past 12 months  outperforming the 3  gain recorded by the  Will the stock s rally continue post fourth quarter earnings release  Let s see how things are shaping up Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Realty will likely beat estimates this season  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Duke Realty is 0 00   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  This combination of a 0 00  ESP and a Zacks Rank  4 makes it difficult to predict a beat this season Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsIn recent years  Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio  This augurs well because the industrial asset category has been grabbing attention as it is experiencing high demand  with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy Amid an e commerce boom  growth in industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations for improving supply chain efficiencies  demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks have been increasing  This is helping the industrial real estate market to grow  Given Duke Realty s solid capacity to offer modern  bulk distribution properties  the company remains well poised to capitalize on this trend Duke Realty has made rigorous efforts to lower its suburban office assets as part of its strategy to concentrate on industrial assets  Subsequently  in May 2017  the company inked a deal to sell its MOB portfolio for a price of  2 8 billion  The company generated  2 45 billion in proceeds in the second quarter  through this sale  Further  in the third quarter  Duke Realty substantially accomplished the sale of seven of the nine medical office buildings  spanning 519 000 square feet  Such efforts are aimed at simplifying the company s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT While such streamlining efforts are strategic fit for the long term  the near term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed  In fact  such short term impact will likely drag the company s quarterly results Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations  FFO  per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged at 30 cents  reflecting lack of any solid catalyst  Also  it points to a year over year decline of 3 2  Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  175 million  indicating a decline of 14 3  year over year For full year 2017  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  736 8 million  The consensus estimate for FFO per is  1 24  reflecting a year over year improvement of 3 3   Further  management expects core FFO per share in the range of  1 21  1 25 Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows these have the right combination of

120741,342256,FMC,Will Bell Segment Rebound Aid Textron s  TXT  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Textron Inc    NYSE TXT    known for brands like Bell Helicopter and Cessna Aircraft  is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Jan 31  before the market opens We expect sales growth at the Industrial segment  which accounts for the majority of Textron s top line  to drive fourth quarter revenues  Moreover  a rebound in the Bell segment after many quarters of weakperformance buoys optimism Let s discuss these factors in detail Industrial Segment   A Key CatalystTextron s Industrial segment designs and manufactures variety of products  including automotive engine components  specialized vehicles and varied industry related tools and equipment  The acquisition of Arctic Cat   a leader in the recreational vehicle industry   made in the first quarter of 2017  has been boosting growth at this segment In fact  this buyout drove third quarter sales by double digits at the segment  We expect the takeover to drive revenues at this segment in the fourth quarter as well  In line with this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment s fourth quarter sales is pegged at  1 2 billion  reflecting a solid 21 6  rise from the prior year quarter s  952 million Will Bell Segment Drive Growth Bell  another important segment for Textron  has been able to deliver improved results in the third quarter  after quarters of poor performance  In particular  strong demand for commercial jets drove the top line higher at this unit  With management expecting to maintain the upside in commercial deliveries  we expect the fourth quarter results to reflect top line growth at the Bell segment In line with this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment s fourth quarter sales is pegged at  918 million  reflecting a 3 5  rise from prior year quarter s  887 million Other Factors at PlayIn addition to the aforementioned factors  improved growth pattern and performance and a steady inflow of orders from Pentagon are expected to provide an impetus to fourth quarter sales  Among the deals clinched in the fourth quarter  the one worth mentioning is the  333 million contract from U S  Army for up to 255 mobile strike force vehicles All these factors are expected to boost Textron s fourth quarter revenues  as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of  4 04 billion  which reflects a year over year improvement of 5 6  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings is pegged at 75 cents per share  reflecting a decline of 6 25  year over year  This could be because the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from fixed price contracts  exposing the bottom line to cost overruns Moreover  during the third quarter earnings call  management announced that its vehicle business is lagging in terms of line rates and production output  These factors as well as a charge associated with the TAPV program incurred in the first quarter of 2017 have compelled management to slash the 2017 EPS guidance Textron Inc  Price and EPS Surprise     What Does the Zacks Model PredictOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Textron this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Textron has an Earnings ESP of  1 22   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Zacks Rank  Textron carries a Zacks Rank  3

  Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Can These 4 Large Cap Drug Stocks Deliver an Encore in 2018 Investing in sound large cap pharma stocks seems judicious as they are fundamentally lucrative and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows for the investor The drug sector had a good run in 2017  bouncing back after drug pricing issues dampened its performance in 2016  Importantly  the sector saw a considerable increase in new drug approvals last year  The FDA approved 46 novel drugs last year  more than double of 2016 s tally of 22 The  industry witnessed an impressive rally in 2017  up 16 3  against a decline of 5 2  in 2016  The run was propelled by encouraging quarterly results  increased demand for new product sales  successful innovation and product line expansion  Strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products also boosted the sector These factors are expected to play an instrumental role in 2018 as well  which may take the large cap drug sector to new highs  The industry is already up 3 9  so far this year Notably  the Large Cap Pharma industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of  100  placing it among the top 39  of the 265 plus Zacks industries  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one The passing of the tax overhaul bill by the Congress is a cherry on the top  The slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  is likely to further boost profit margins  Moreover  the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations  leaving these companies with extra cash in hand  This may lead to strategic deals like merger and acquisitions this year  which were relatively fewer in 2017 Most drug companies with a large market cap have seen their share price rise in 2018 so far  Here we present four companies  Johnson   Johnson  AbbVie  Zoetis and Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb   which outperformed the industry last year and have the potential to repeat the same performance in 2018 Johnson   JohnsonThe company s stock was up 21 3  in 2017  which compared favorably

regulatory applications for label expansion of its key drugs under review  Potential approval to these line extensions will certainly boost the company s growth prospects  Meanwhile  there are several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones lined up for 2018 Moreover  J J s pharma segment s growth accelerated in third quarter of 2017 after slowing down in the first half due to a number of factors including competition for some key drugs like Remicade and Concerta  The upside is expected to continue in 2018 AbbVieThe stock of the company was up 54 4  in 2017  The company holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  In 2017  the company reported a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies  regulatory approvals in the United States  Europe  and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine  Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvica and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with Amgen Inc  AbbVie also expects several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones in 2018  which is expected to further aid the company  The data readout from the pivotal phase III TRINITY study on Rova T in third line or later small cell lung cancer will be an important catalyst for the stock  Moreover  a FDA decision is expected on the new drug application   NDA   for elagolix for endometriosis  which was granted priority review in October last year AbbVie s blockbuster drug  Humira  has been performing well despite competitive pressure  The company expects the drug s performance to continue  which will boost the topline  Imbruvica is also doing consistently well with multibillion dollar potential  AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases Novo NordiskShares of the company increased 49 7  in 2017  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3 This company was granted approval to expand the label of its diabetes drug  Victoza  to include treatment of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults

semaglutide once daily pre filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients  It also received approval for Rebinyn for hemophilia B in the United States and Refixia for the treatment of adolescents and adults with the same indication in Europe In 2018  the company expects a U S  launch of Ozempic and an approval for the same in Europe  which will certainly boost the company s revenues Moreover  the company serves almost half of the insulin market and a quarter of the diabetes market  The growing diabetes market will certainly boost the topline ZoetisThe company s shares rose 34 6  in 2017  The company sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  The company has a diversified portfolio of livestock and companion animal products  In2017  the company increased its share of the dermatology products for dogs market to 59   The companion animal business has been performing well  along with the launch of Apoquel and Cytopoint  The company acquired Nexvet Biopharma last

gaming market in the United States is expected to see a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 4 74  in the 2017 2021 period What s Working in Favor of Casinos The stellar rally of casino stocks on the

Alternative Avenues Leading casino companies are primarily looking up on improving tourism in Las Vegas and increasing demand for gaming and leisure  These casinos are opting for alternative avenues to expand customer base and business  They are increasingly making associations with the hospitality sector  setting up luxury hotels alongside their gaming businesses  Since these non gaming services

A phase I II study is expected to begin in 2018 and will be sponsored by Kite  The results of the study will be used to find options for further development of this combination  or similar combinations between Kite s engineered T cell products and utomilumab

120886,342401,FMC,5 Stocks To Buy For Aging Millennial Generation,opinion,"Every day a new article pops up about the latest thing that Millennials  killed   The list ranges from beer and napkins  to running and marriages  This is the way life goes  previous generations typically bemoan the perceived faults of the current as they begin to transform the economics of the day and redefine societal norms 
Each generation is different  Millennials might have simply pushed some of life s bigger responsibilities back a few years  unlike say Baby Boomers or even Generation Y  But for all the stories of ruin and doom  the stock market is chugging along at unprecedented rates and the economy is humming while new technologies transform the world 
In fact  in some cases  Millennials themselves have disproportionately created positive  long lasting economic changes  making investors from older generations a lot richer  And as Millennials begin to age  many will begin to pump even more money into important corners of the economy  and soon enough  the negative focus will shift to the soon to be scrutinized Generation Z 
With that said  let s take a look at five stocks that might benefit from the aging Millennial generation 
1       PulteGroup  Inc    NYSE PHM  
This multi brand homebuilding company is set to grow in the coming years  especially as more Millennials begin to buy homes  PulteGroup is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 20 51  over the next three to five years  On top of the long term earnings growth projections  the homebuilding firm currently presents outstanding value and is trading at just 11 37x earnings  PulteGroup has also been able to build a growing cash supply and has seen its stock price climb nearly 80  over the last 52 weeks  PHM is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
2        Restoration Hardware   NYSE RH  
This upscale home furnishing power has been able to get ahead of new experiential retail trends and even expanded into the restaurant business  which helped its stock price skyrocket 216  over the last year  The company s new operations have resonated with Millennials who are now at the right age to be buying home goods  Restoration Hardware is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Furthermore  the company is expected to see its bottom line expand for years to come as its earnings per share figures are projected to expand at an annualized rate of 20  over the next three to five years 
3        Facebook   NASDAQ FB    
Millennials are nearly solely responsible for Facebook s meteoritic rise to one of the most valuable companies in the world as they were the founders and the first wave of users  Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   and the company s 109 17  cash flow growth rate should help it further invest in new technologies such as AI and augmented reality  Millennials are unlikely to ditch Facebook s platform in the coming years  and the company is still actively growing its user base  The social media giant is also expected to see its bottom line surge at an annualized rate of 26 82  over the next three to five years 
4        Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   
For all of the businesses that Millennials have supposedly harmed  they have definitely helped lift Amazon s e commerce division  Amazon has been able to secure a growing cash reserve and is only set to expand its sales as the need for cloud computing and web hosting increases  Meanwhile  Millennials are using the site to buy everything  including groceries plus  they already love Whole Foods  Looking down the road  the company is expected to see its EPS figures grow at an annualized rate of 20 87  over the next three to five years  Jeff Bezos  company is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
5        Lennar Corporation   NYSE LEN  
This Miami based home construction company has seen its stock price climb 59 62  over the last 52 weeks  Some might think this is a result of short term demand  but we re likely just seeing that start of the Millennial home buying boom  On top of strong 2018 top  and bottom line growth projections  Lennar s EPS figures are expected to expand at an annualized rate of nearly13  over the next three to five years

120887,342402,FMC,Can These 4 Large Cap Drug Stocks Deliver An Encore In  18 ,opinion,"Investing in sound large cap pharma stocks seems judicious as they are fundamentally lucrative and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows for the investor 
The drug sector had a good run in 2017  bouncing back after drug pricing issues dampened its performance in 2016  Importantly  the sector saw a considerable increase in new drug approvals last year  The FDA approved 46 novel drugs last year  more than double of 2016 s tally of 22 
The  industry witnessed an impressive rally in 2017  up 16 3  against a decline of 5 2  in 2016  The run was propelled by encouraging quarterly results  increased demand for new product sales  successful innovation and product line expansion  Strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products also boosted the sector 

These factors are expected to play an instrumental role in 2018 as well  which may take the large cap drug sector to new highs  The industry is already up 3 9  so far this year 
Notably  the Large Cap Pharma industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of  100  placing it among the top 39  of the 265 plus Zacks industries  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one 
The passing of the tax overhaul bill by the Congress is a cherry on the top  The slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  is likely to further boost profit margins Moreover  the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations  leaving these companies with extra cash in hand  This may lead to strategic deals like merger and acquisitions this year  which were relatively fewer in 2017 
Most drug companies with a large market cap have seen their share price rise in 2018 so far  Here we present four companies  Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ    AbbVie Inc    NYSE ABBV    Zoetis Inc    NYSE ZTS   and Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  A S   NYSE NVO    which outperformed the industry last year and have the potential to repeat the same performance in 2018

The trend is expected to continue in 2018  J J has several regulatory applications for label expansion of its key drugs under review  Potential approval to these line extensions will certainly boost the company s growth prospects  Meanwhile  there are several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones lined up for 2018 
Moreover  J J s pharma segment s growth accelerated in third quarter of 2017 after slowing down in the first half due to a number of factors including competition for some key drugs like Remicade and Concerta  The upside is expected to continue in 2018

AbbVie also expects several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones in 2018  which is expected to further aid the company  The data readout from the pivotal phase III TRINITY study on Rova T in third line or later small cell lung cancer will be an important catalyst for the stock  Moreover  a FDA decision is expected on the new drug application   NDA   for elagolix for endometriosis  which was granted priority review in October last year 
AbbVie s blockbuster drug  Humira  has been performing well despite competitive pressure  The company expects the drug s performance to continue  which will boost the topline  Imbruvica is also doing consistently well with multibillion dollar potential  AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases

In 2018  the company expects a U S  launch of Ozempic and an approval for the same in Europe  which will certainly boost the company s revenues

Furthermore  we understand that stocks with low prices can often catch many investors  eyes  One group of stocks that investors sometimes pay particular attention to are those currently trading under  10 per share  These stocks present retail investors with the opportunity to take a considerable position in a company 
The ability to buy up large positions akin to intuitional investors that grab large chunks of S P 500 giants also means that stocks trading for  10 or less are often subject to massive one day swings 
Now  let s take a look at three companies trading for less than  10 per share that surged today 
Ramaco Resources  Inc    NASDAQ METC  
This coal company saw its stock price surge by nearly 8  on Thursday  Before today s climb  shares of Ramaco had popped over 45  within the last four weeks  Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Ramaco s earnings are projected to soar in its current full year as it looks set to re enter the black  This EPS growth is also expected to continue into the following fiscal year  Ramaco is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

19  2018    highlights Illinois Tool Works Inc    NYSE ITW   as the Bull of the Day  Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc    NYSE ANW   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on International Business Machines   NYSE IBM   Here is a synopsis of all three stocks  Illinois Tool Works Inc  manufactures and markets a variety of products that are used worldwide   The company s products are found in cars  wind turbines  deep sea rigs  healthcare  aerospace technology  food equipment  mobile devices  and many other items that you use on a daily basis   ITW is a well diversified company who has been a world leader in innovation for decades   The company generates just over 50  of their revenues in the United States  and has operations around the world Recent Earnings ReportIllinois Tool Works  who currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  announced earnings last Monday where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates   Moreover  management increased their FY 2017 EPS outlook by  0 25   16  year over year growth   and raised their 2017 revenue guidance by  100 million to  14 3 billion   5 2  year over year growth    Overall  the company saw increasing revenues  improving margins  organic growth  and EPS expansion during their most recent quarterly report Further  the overall outlook for global growth is improving faster than previously expected   This was reinforced when International Monetary Fund s  IMF  increased growth expectations for both 2017 and 2018  2017 was lifted by 0 1  to  3 6   and 2018 was revised by  0 1  to  3 7     This improved global economic outlook is very beneficial to ITW as it sells industrial products and equipment in 57 different countries The company has beaten the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates in 7 out of the last 8 quarters    Further  due to the strong quarterly performance and increased EPS guidance  analysts have positively revised their estimates for both 2017 and 2018   Management s TakeAccording to E  Scott Santi  Chairman and CEO   In the third quarter  the ITW team continued to execute at a high level and  as a result  delivered another quarter of strong financial results   I continue to be very pleased with our progress in positioning the company to leverage ITW s differentiated business model and high quality diversified business portfolio to deliver consistent top tier performance   Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc  has seen its earnings plunge in 2017  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is cutting costs and repositioning assets until the margins improve Aegean Marine Petroleum is an international marine fuel logistics company that markets and physically supplies refined marine fuel and lubricants to ships in port and at sea It buys product from various sources  including refineries  oil producers and traders  and resells it to customers across all major commercial shipping sectors and cruise lines A small cap company with a market cap of  188 million  Aegean has 51 delivery ports and 61 bunkering tankers Challenging Market Environment in Q3On Nov 15  Aegean reported its third quarter results and met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 10 Even as parts of the oil industry saw improvement  the marine fuel sector remained under pressure with plenty of competition which led to margin pressures Gross spread per metric ton declined by 13 1   to  14 60 from  16 80 in the second quarter It also didn t help that the company endured extreme weather in the quarter  including 3 major hurricanes  as well as a refinery fire which impacted procurement costs and sales volumes in some regions The company  however  continued with its cost cutting initiatives in the quarter For example  it withdrew from the loss generating supply business in the Singapore market It also moved its U S  West Coast storage operations to smaller facilities where capacity was a better match for actual utilization levels Additionally  Aegean rationalized its fleet operations in Gibraltar which should lead to better utilization and lower costs Looking ahead  for new business  it expanded into the Port of Savannah on the U S  East Coast and intended to enhance its presence in St  Croix  one of the U S  Virgin Islands Cost savings measures through October 2017 have yielded the company  24 million  well past its original  20 million goal  It was so encouraged by the savings that it increased its 2017 goal to  30 million Estimates Cut for 2017 and 2018While the analysts were sympathetic to the market conditions  and liked the cost cutting strategy  they still cut both 2017 and 2018 estimates in the last 3 months The company made  1 35 in 2016 but the 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to just  0 01 from  0 32 just 90 days ago  That s a decline of 99  from 2016 Earnings are expected to bounce back some in 2018  to  0 50  which would be an earnings recovery  but

list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT    ACCO Brands Corporation   NYSE ACCO    iRobot Corporation   NASDAQ IRBT   and Graphic Packaging Holding Company   NYSE GPK   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  These Industrial Stocks Are Likely to Beat Q4 EstimatesThe upcoming fourth quarter earnings season for the industrial sector holds promise backed by the upbeat manufacturing data  strong housing and commercial construction markets and an improving U S economy  Industrial production  which is considered one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks  jumped 8 2  at an annual rate in the fourth quarter  It is a measure of the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  The upbeat performance was supported by a 7  jump in manufacturing and 12 7  in mining output in the quarter  The index is currently pegged at 107 5  of its 2012 average  Further  it has gained 3 6  in a year  logging its biggest calendar year gain since 2010 Manufacturing Activity  New Orders Close 2017 on a HighManufacturing activity also closed on a high in 2017 as evident from the December PMI  Purchasing Managers  Index  reading of 59 7  per the Institute for Supply Management   ISM    The reading was a tad lower than the peak of 60 8 in September but marked the fastest pace of expansion since 2011  The PMI is an indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector with a reading above 50 signalling increased factory activity The score can be attributed to strong expansion in new orders and production  Further  16 of 18 industries reported growth in December  With this reading  manufacturing has delivered positive growth for 16 consecutive months   Notably  in 2017  the ISM manufacturing index averaged the highest readings for a calendar year since the last 13 years The manufacturing sector accounts for about 12  of the U S  economy  The December PMI indicates growth for the 103rd consecutive month in the overall economy  The index has averaged 57 6  for 2017  which translates to a 4 5  increase in real gross domestic product  GDP  on an annualized basis New orders and production both rose to very healthy levels to close 2017 and have delivered positive growth trend for 16 straight months  In December  New Orders Index registered 69 4   the highest reading since January 2004  In fact  the index has been at levels above 60  for seven months at a stretch   the highest expansion level in 14 years  The Production Index registered 65 8  in December  the highest reading since May 2010 Steady Growth AheadHealthy order and production levels suggest that the strength exhibited by the manufacturing sector throughout 2017 should carry over into 2018  With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  the pace of growth could pick up even further  We believe that implementation of the Trump government s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for industrial stocks The continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries sustain strong demand for farming and mining machinery  Long term demand for agricultural equipment will be buoyed by increased global demand for food  Further  favorable trends resulting from growing  and affluent population along with rising living standards and dietary improvements will provide ample opportunity for long term growth  Moreover  healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations  especially in emerging countries  are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment Construction machinery demand will remain strong in the years to come aided by population growth  urbanization  increased energy consumption as well as an expanding middle class  Further  increasing demand for global infrastructure  such as roads  housing  airports  and energy will help sustain growth Impressive Performance  Sector PositionOver the past year  the  sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  has clocked a gain of 29 7   outperforming the S P 500 s growth of 20 5  The Industrial Products sector put up an impressive 19 6  growth in earnings in third quarter 2017  At the onset of the fourth quarter earnings season  investors remain eager to know about the performance of the sector in this quarter  Of the 4 2  of the S P 500 participants that have reported so far  a 15 1  earnings growth has been recorded on the back of a 23 8  rise in revenues  The beat ratio is an impressive 100  for both the metrics  Per our latest projections  the sector will put up an earnings growth of 22 2  while revenues will advance 11 9  in fourth quarter 2017  It is one the six sectors that is expected to log double digit growth in earnings in the fourth quarter   Read more   We put our Sectors  all 16 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   sectors with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the sectors with the worst average Zacks Rank   In the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much   To learn more visit    The industrial products sector  with a Zacks Sector Rank  8  enjoys a position in the top half How to Identify the Outperformers The encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely to beat our fourth quarter earnings estimates  Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors  This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat But with a wide range of industrial stocks thronging the investment space  it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better than expected earnings  The Zacks methodology makes the task simple  by combining a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive  You can see  Our proprietary methodology  Earnings ESP  shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  And research shows that for

120937,342452,FMC,Better Buy  Facebook  FB  Vs  Twitter  TWTR  ,opinion,"At this point  nearly every investor knows that social media has become a worldwide phenomenon  spurred by the proliferation of mobile devices and internet access  Today there are a seemingly endless array of platforms that hold users  attention for hours every day 
Social media use in the U S  is set to reach new heights this year  according to a  from market research firm eMarketer  The U S  social media user base is expected to fall just 32 million shy of the entire U S  adult television audience in 2018  which would account for over 61  of the total U S  population 
Last year  an estimated  people used social media around the world  marking an 8 7  jump from 2016  By 2021  the total number of social media users around the globe is expected to reach  
Ubiquity and user growth leads directly to advertising dollars  and ad spending is essentially the only way social media powerhouses like Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Twitter   NYSE TWTR   make money 
But with total users set to grow overall  which of these two widely popular publicly traded social media companies is the better buy right now 
User Growth 
Facebook reported that as of the end of September  its monthly active users total 2 07 billion  which marked a 16  year over year jump  Facebook now claims over 27  of the world population as an MAU  Facebook was also able to grow its daily active user base a highly important metric for advertisers by 16  to reach 1 37 billion 
During the third quarter  Twitter grew its DAU base by 14  year over year  This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in this category  Twitter was also able to grow its monthly active user base by 4  in Q3  The social media company now boasts 330 million MAUs 
Top and Bottom Line Growth 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2017  Facebook is projected to see its revenues soar 42 62  year over year to hit  12 56 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  On top of that  the social media giant is expected to see its bottom line surge by 37 59  to reach  1 94 per share 
What s more  Facebook is expected to expand its EPS figures at an annualized rate of 26 82  over the next three to five years 
Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Twitter s Q4 revenues and earnings to dip by 3 76  and 12 50  respectively  However  2018 is projected to be a bounce back year for the micro blogging platform 
Twitter s full fiscal 2018 sales are expected to reach  2 57 billion  which would mark a 7 35  year over year jump  The company s bottom line is projected to pop by nearly 13  to hit  0 45 per share  In terms of long term earnings growth potential  Twitter is expected to see its EPS figures grow at an annualized rate of 21 50  over the next three to five years 
Momentum 
Over the last 12 weeks  Facebook has seen its stock price climb 4 10   But shares of the social media company dipped marginally in the last four weeks  Still  Facebook has seen its stock price surge by 38 84  over the last 52 weeks 
Investors might be happy to note that Facebook stock currently sits over 5  below its 52 week high of  188 90 per share  which should theoretically give the company room to expand before the added burden of crossing into a new all time high range 
On the other hand  shares of Twitter have skyrocketed 43 29  in the last 12 weeks  which blows away the S P 500 and the  Internet   Software  industry average  This great three month run accounts for nearly all of the company s gains over the last year 
However  Twitter saw its stock price slip by nearly 2 50  on Thursday  And even before today s dip  shares of the company fell by 2 54  over the last four weeks 
The Winner Is  
Both Facebook and Twitter are currently Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks that sport  A  grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system  helping them earn overall  B  VGM scores 
The winner at this point has to be Facebook  Few companies in the world have as much clout as Zuckerberg s  especially in terms of advertising reach  According to eMarketer  by 2019  Facebook will account for 11 3  of all U S  ad spending compared to 10 0  for the entire print category 
Facebook is set to report its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan  31  Twitter is set to report Q4 results before the opening bell on Feb  8

120940,342455,FMC,4 Casino Stocks To Bet On Ahead Of Q4 Earnings,opinion,"The U S  gaming industry has been on a strong growth trajectory for over a year now  According to our   the Gaming industry has gained more than 32 9  in the past year  outpacing the S P 500 s 23 8  
Within the gaming space  the casino market  which is considered one of the largest entertainment markets in the world  is positioned for substantial growth over the long haul  Per a report by Research and Markets  the casino gaming market in the United States is expected to see a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 4 74  in the 2017 2021 period 
What s Working in Favor of Casinos 
The stellar rally of casino stocks on the bourses has been supported by an array of factors  First  demand in the casino space is relatively inelastic as the business targets a fixed range of consumers  These consumers will continue to demand services at casinos irrespective of market conditions  Moreover  a rising middle class population with increased spending on leisure is helping the gambling market flourish 
Second  lenient government regulations with respect to online casinos have led to a rapid rise of casino operators  Online gambling has been a primary growth driver for the market as a wide range of customers has gained access to such portals 
Finally  improving dynamics of the tourism industry is favoring casino companies  Tourism in Las Vegas is looking up on a consistent increase in traffic  Revenues at companies operating in Las Vegas are also likely to grow 
Moreover  the turnaround in Macau business is helping the companies rake in handsome profits  Although a tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016  revenues have been rising since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers 
Meanwhile  efforts undertaken by Macau operators to revive revenues by attracting tourists with numerous facilities have also started yielding results  In fact  in the first 11 months of 2017  gambling revenues from Macau rose 19 5   signaling recovery in the casino hub  Macau s momentum has also been hitting highs lately  giving investors enough reasons to be bullish in the quarters ahead 
Casino Giants Opt for Alternative Avenues 
Leading casino companies are primarily looking up on improving tourism in Las Vegas and increasing demand for gaming and leisure  These casinos are opting for alternative avenues to expand customer base and business  They are increasingly making associations with the hospitality sector  setting up luxury hotels alongside their gaming businesses  Since these non gaming services generate higher margins  companies are increasingly focusing on alternative streams to drive revenues 
Casino giants are also effectively responding to the rapidly evolving market and are capitalizing on significant cash flow associated with the current casino business

shares with growth prospects are the best investment bets  Chubb carries an impressive  of B   Growth Drivers in PlaceChubb has remained focused on pursuing growth initiatives that pave the way for long term growth  Chubb expects both organic and inorganic initiatives undertaken in the United States  Latin America and Asia to drive improvement While the company is intensifying focus on its middle market business prospects  it is also leveraging cyber insurance that has huge room for growth Chubb reviews underwriting actions in portfolios that neither meet its risk appetite nor generate decent net premium  Subsequently  the company either terminates or re insures business to improve its risk reward profile Chubb is on track to achieve annual run rate integration related savings of  875 million  up from  800 million  guided earlier  by the end of 2018  This in turn will aid margin expansion The US President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22  2017  This tax reform policy  an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years  lowers the corporate tax burden to 21  from 35   A reduced tax rate would aid the companies  bottom line as well as boost

anticipates quarterly investment income run rate to remain in the range of  845  855 million  up from the previously guided range of  830  840 million  A robust financial position enables the company to return shareholders  value through dividend hikes and share buybacks as well as pursue growth initiatives  While the company had  1 3 billion remaining under its buyback authorization  it targets a

120985,342500,FMC,The Secret Winners From Amazon s Second Headquarters Shortlist,opinion,"Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   announced on Thursday that it had officially narrowed the list of candidates for its second headquarters down to 20  eliminating the vast majority of the reported 238 applicants and brining the remaining cities one step closer to the 50 000 jobs promised by the e commerce behemoth 
Not surprisingly  Amazon s shortlist includes several locations in the Midwest and South and on the East Coast  The list shies away from tech heavy West Coast hubs  but it does include one major Californian metropolitan area  Here s a snapshot of the finalists  locations  Credit   
 Thank you to all 238 communities that submitted proposals  Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough   all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity   said Holly Sullivan  Amazon s head of economic development  in a press release   Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation  
Amazon provided no further details on why each city was selected  other than to say it based its choices on the criteria announced at the beginning of the search  which included a metropolitan area of more than one million and an ability to attract top technical talent   
Company officials will now work more directly with finalist cites  Amazon is expected to select a winner later this year  It is unclear exactly how the next phase of this process will look for these local governments  but judging by the very public displays many put on during the application process  it should be entertaining at the least 
It will also be interesting to see whether local businesses step up their marketing efforts  The announcement of Amazon s shortlist brings our attention to the  secret  winners of HQ2 potential partner corporations that will benefit from having Amazon as a neighbor without having to foot the bill for the company s sure to be lavish demands 
One example would be Red Hat   NYSE RHT    an open source software and enterprise IT company based in Raleigh  North Carolina  The company has a strategic partnership with Amazon s Web Services unit and is rapidly growing its cloud offerings  Raleigh hits on several other key requirements  including its close proximity to top schools like Duke and UNC  but the presence of Red Hat is almost certainly a factor
Several other locations look attractive for strategic reasons  Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM   the organic grocery chain Amazon shelled out  14 billion for last year  is headquartered in downtown Austin  Texas  Bringing HQ2 to Austin could mean that Amazon wants the new location to be the center of its budding grocery business 
We also know that Amazon has reportedly considered expanding into pharmacy operations  Well  Walgreens   NASDAQ WBA   is based in Deerfield  Illinois less than an hour outside of shortlist city Chicago  Rite Aid   NYSE RAD   is headquartered about two hours away from Philadelphia  while CVS   NYSE CVS   finds itself slightly over an hour s drive from Boston 
There is no indication that Amazon is interested in working directly with any of these companies  let alone willing to move HQ2 to a nearby city in order to make that partnership work  And in today s world  one would hardly need to be located near another business to join forces on a specific project 
But proximity still matters to some  and it will be interesting to see whether any of these brands open their arms to Amazon or reject the company s advances altogether

121027,342542,FMC,Is Korn Ferry International  KFY  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Korn Ferry International   NYSE KFY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Korn Ferry International has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 2  If we focus on the long term PE trend  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  indicating that it could be a good entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Korn Ferry International has forward PE of 16 9x  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Korn Ferry International has a P S ratio of about 1 4  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Korn Ferry International currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Korn Ferry International a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too What About the Stock Overall While Korn Ferry International might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of C  This gives KFY a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about

the next year estimate has seen two up and none down in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate has increased nearly 1 6  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has moved up by 2 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Korn Ferry International Price and Consensus   Even though the company has better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineKorn Ferry International is an

121069,342584,FMC,Is Adecco Group  AHEXY  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Adecco  SIX ADEN  Group AG   OTC AHEXY   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Adecco Group has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 8  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 2  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Adecco Group s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 1  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Adecco Group has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 6  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Adecco Group stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Adecco Group has a P S ratio of about 0 5  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 2 8x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Adecco Group currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Adecco Group a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 16 5  which is better than the industry average of 17 1  Clearly  AHEXY is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Adecco Group might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives AHEXY a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty discouraging  The current quarter consensus estimate has inched lower by 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has gone down by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Adecco SA Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAdecco Group is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 41  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past six months  the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks

investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Alliance Data Systems has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 35  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 19  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Alliance Data Systems  current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 20 63 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands significantly lower than the highs for the stock  suggesting that it could be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Business Services sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 10  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Alliance Data Systems has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 89  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Alliance Data Systems stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Alliance Data Systems has a P S ratio of about 1 93  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 52 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  ADS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Alliance Data Systems currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Alliance Data Systems a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Alliance Data Systems is just 0 88  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 77  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 01  which is far better than the industry average of 18 81  Clearly  ADS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Alliance Data Systems might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives ADS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been somewhat discouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to no upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen one upward and downward revision each in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 0 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Alliance Data Systems Corporation Price and Consensus    Owing to this somewhat bearish trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAlliance Data Systems is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite carrying a Zacks Rank  3  the company enjoys a solid Zacks Industry Rank  among top 39  of more than 250 industries   which hints at favorable broader factors  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates to turn around in this name first  but once that happens

121116,342631,FMC,Will McCormick s  MKC  Q4 Earnings Gain From Acquisitions ,opinion,McCormick   Company Inc    NYSE MKC   is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 25  before the opening bell  The bottom line results of this leading distributor of spices  seasonings and other specialty food products outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of the preceding four quarters  with an average beat of 4  Considering this  let s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement What to Expect The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has been stable over the past 30 days at  1 52 and  4 22  respectively  Expected earnings for the quarter under review and the fiscal 2017 depict a growth of 19 7  and 11 6   respectively  from the year ago reported figure  Notably  management expects fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of  4 20  4 24 per share Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of  1 475 million for the fourth quarter  up 20 2  from sales recorded in the year ago quarter  Also  the consensus mark for fiscal 2017 sales is pegged at  4 82 billion  reflecting a rise of 9 3  from fiscal 2016 sales McCormick   Company  Incorporated Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayAcquisitions have long been favoring McCormick s performance  aiding the company to develop a robust product portfolio  To this end  McCormick s buyout of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc  in August 2017  deserves special mention  Apart from adding iconic brands to McCormick s portfolio  the deal led to sales growth in the industrial and consumer business segments of the company during the third quarter of fiscal 2017  In fact  the acquisitions of Reckitt Benckiser and Enrico Giotti SpA contributed to sales growth in the third quarter  Further  the company continues to expect positive synergies from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group Driven by such factors  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales growth for the fourth quarter related to consumer and industrial business segments are currently pegged at 0 18  and 0 25   respectively Moreover  the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2017 to reflect the positive impacts from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group and lower currency  The company expects sales to grow approximately 9 10  in fiscal 2017  compared with the previous range of 4 6   Excluding currency  McCormick expects sales to grow approximately 10 11  in fiscal 2017  compared with the previous band of 5 7  McCormick s cost saving and productivity enhancing initiatives through the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement  CCI  program have also been positively impacting performance  Owing to the cost savings efforts  the company delivered double digit adjusted operating income growth in the third quarter and expanded adjusted operating income margin by 140 basis points  This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion  McCormick expects to deliver cost savings of at least  105 million in fiscal 2017  up from the previous expectation at least  100 million expected previously Although the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans  higher input costs have been hurting McCormick s margins of late  Prices of majority of the raw materials including cinnamon  oregano and rice along with packaging costs have been rising for a while  Further  in fiscal 2017  the company expects material cost inflation in mid single digits  McCormick s increased spending on brand marketing also poses adequate threats of lowering profits  However  we expect the company to offset the impact of such hurdles through efficient pricing strategies What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Although McCormick carries a Zacks Rank  3  its Earnings ESP of  0 49  makes surprise

121118,342633,FMC,Should Value Investors Choose Roadrunner Transportation  RRTS  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Roadrunner Transportation Systems  Inc    NYSE RRTS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Roadrunner Transportation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 11  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 2  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Roadrunner Transportation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the  s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 31  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Roadrunner Transportation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Roadrunner Transportation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Roadrunner Transportation has a P S ratio of about 0 2  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 5x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  RRTS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Roadrunner Transportation currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Roadrunner Transportation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 3 6  which is far better than the industry average of 9 8  Clearly  RRTS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Roadrunner Transportation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives RRTS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been pretty encouraging  The current year consensus estimate has risen by 40  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has gone up by 25 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Roadrunner Transportation Systems  Inc Price and Consensus   Despite this favorable trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and that is why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineRoadrunner Transportation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 10  out of more than 250 industries  further strengthens its growth potential  In fact  over the past two years  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks

121281,342796,FMC,US Chemical Output Up In November On Recovery From Hurricanes,opinion,U S  chemical production increased in November as the industry continued to recover from the damaging effects of hurricanes   according to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council   ACC   The chemical industry trade group said that the U S  Chemical Production Regional Index   CPRI   went up 1 2  in November on a monthly comparison basis  This follows a 0 5  rise a month ago and a 1 2  decline in September  The U S  CPRI  which is measured using a three month moving average  was created to track chemical production in seven regions nationwide Per the ACC  chemical production rose across all regions in the reported month  The increase reflects sustained recovery from the unfavorable impacts of disruptions from hurricanes and a rebound in manufacturing activity Hurricane Harvey weighed on U S  chemical production during the third quarter  A sizable portion of total U S  production capacity was hit by the storm  Harvey led to the shutdown of several chemical plants along the Gulf Coast   the epicenter of the U S  specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry  A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production  leading to reduced supply of this major chemical in the third quarter Encouraging November ReadingsThe November readings showed a rise in chemical output across the board  Production across Gulf Coast  Midwest and Ohio Valley went up 2 2   1 2  and 2 1   respectively  while both Mid Atlantic and Northeast saw a 0 9  increase  Output rose 0 8  in West Coast while Southeast saw a 1 4  gain By segments  chemical production was mixed in November  Gains across pesticides  fertilizers  coatings  adhesives  organic chemicals  other specialty chemicals  synthetic rubber  consumer products and pharmaceuticals were neutralized by lower production in industrial gases  manufactured fibers  dyes and pigments  plastic resins and chlor alkali Per the ACC  activity for the U S  manufacturing sector   the largest consumer of chemical products   rose 0 6  in November  The sector is a major driver for the chemical industry which touches around 96  of manufactured goods Overall chemical production also went up 2 4  on a year over year basis in November with all regions scoring gains U S  Chemical Industry Set to Ride Growth WaveThe U S  Chemical Industry is set for solid growth in 2018  The ACC envisions national chemical production  excluding pharmaceuticals  to rise 3 7  in 2018  further accelerating to a 3 9  growth in 2019  The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets  capital investments and improved export markets The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to expand 4 7  in 2018 and further gain steam with a 5 2  rise in 2019 on the heels of new capacity additions  Major export markets such as Latin America and Asia are expected to play a significant role in production growth The United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks and energy  This is driving investment in chemical production projects Per the ACC  roughly 320 chemical projects have been already announced worth more than  185 billion  62  of which is foreign direct investment  Moreover  roughly 65  of the chemical investment announced since 2010 are complete or under construction  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream The ACC also expects chemical industry capital spending to rise 6 3  in 2018 and 6 8  in 2019 and eventually reach  48 billion by 2022 Moreover  the ACC sees improving export markets to contribute to solid growth of the domestic chemical industry  Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are driving chemical demand across key end use markets such as light vehicles and housing   Chemical Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks that are worth considering in the chemicals space are Kronos Worldwide  Inc    NYSE KRO

121286,342801,FMC,3 Reasons Momentum Stock Investors Will Love EOG Resources  EOG ,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on EOG Resources  Inc    NYSE EOG   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for EOG s status as a solid momentum stock below Longer Term Price Change for EOG ResourcesWhile any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of EOG  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 17 5  to 11  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of 7 5   Clearly  EOG is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors  EOG Resources  Inc  Price    Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Change for EOGIn addition to price performance  it is also important to take a look at earnings estimate changes for the full year  This can show if EOG is poised to make a run based on fundamentals  or if the company is simply moving on speculation Over the past month  the full year earnings estimate for EOG has risen by 16 8   On its own this is impressive  but considers that it also beats the industry average of 12 6  too  The trend is undeniably in EOG Resources  favor right now  and it suggests that the momentum might be long lasting for this stock  EOG Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with EOG as of late too Over the past two months  six earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that seven estimates have moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame too  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago EOG was expected to post earnings of 81 cents per share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of 89 cents for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have EOG as a security with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a Momentum Score of A  You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep EOG on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to know about our 10 finest buy and hold tickers for the entirety of 2018 Last year s 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double digit winners  including FMC Corp  NYSE FMC   and VMware which racked up stellar gains of  67 9  and  61   Now a brand new portfolio has been handpicked from over 4 000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank  Don t miss your chance to get in on these long term buys ,2018-01-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-momentum-stock-investors-will-love-eog-resources-eog-200281445,200281445

earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents  This includes increased costs associated with transportation and logistics for raw materials and inventory to avoid customer disruptions  increased raw materials costs

121562,343077,FMC,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  FMC  PPG Industries  Huntsman  Methanex And H B  Fuller,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL  July 26  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Chemicals  Part 2  including FMC Corp   NYSE        PPG Industries  NYSE PPG   Inc   NYSE        Huntsman Corp   NYSE        Methanex Corp   NASDAQ       and H B  Fuller Company  NYSE       

	Industry  Chemicals  part 3

	Link  

	The chemical industry is gaining momentum on continued strength across major end markets and an upswing in the global economy  While chemical makers are poised to gain from strategic growth measures and investment in capacity expansion  the industry remains exposed to certain challenges  There are a few reasons to be watchful about the chemical industry in the near term  which we have outlined below 

China Worries Linger

	Uncertainties surrounding China    a major market for chemicals    remains a deterrent over the short to medium term  While China s second quarter GDP growth of 6 9  was slightly higher than analysts  expectations  the world s second biggest economy remains hamstrung by financial stability risks  The country s economy is still plagued by rising corporate debt  persistent industrial overcapacity and weak private investment  In particular  ballooning debt levels  manifested by rising debt to GDP ratio  and rapid credit expansion have raised a red flag on the Chinese economy 

	China s GDP expanded 6 7  in 2016  a deceleration from 6 9  a year ago  also the weakest annual growth in 26 years  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  projects China s GDP to grow 6 7  in 2017  moderating to 6 4  in 2018  Moreover  the Chinese government has set a slower GDP growth target of roughly 6 5  for 2017  Rapid credit expansion poses a downside risk to the country s economic growth 

Still Difficult Fertilizer Agrichemical Space

	Fertilizer and agricultural chemical companies are still grappling with a difficult pricing environment  Potash prices  although recovered somewhat of late  remain under pressure due to elevated supply  Producers of the nutrient witnessed a slump in prices in the first quarter  dragging down their potash margins 

	Potash miners continue to ramp up production amid a still sluggish demand environment  The potash market is expected to remain oversupplied in the near future  overshooting demand   thereby weighing on prices  Adding to the concern is the prospects of lower demand from India  a major consumer  in 2017  Potash imports in India are expected to be hurt by a spike in retail prices of the commodity as a result of the recent reform in indirect taxes  in the form of rollout of the Goods and Services Tax  in that country and a cut in government subsidy on the nutrient 

	Moreover  higher supply has also contributed to a softer nitrogen pricing environment  Abundant nitrogen supply driven by new production capacity is expected weigh on global prices in 2017  Additional nitrogen capacity including a significant increase in North America is expected to come online globally in the back half of the year 

	Global capacity expansion continues to exert pressure on urea and other nitrogen fertilizer prices  Elevated supply in the global nitrogen market is hurting prices  causing farmers to delay buying activities  As such  margins of fertilizer producers remain thwarted by a weak nutrient pricing environment 

	Moreover  agriculture market fundamentals remain weak and there is continuous negative sentiment among agriculture investors that can create uncertainty in the near term  According to the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA   net U S  farm income is expected to drop 8 7  to  62 3 billion in 2017  This would also mark the fourth straight year of decline  The USDA outlook reflects a slump in prices of most crops  Prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  remain at their multi year lows 

	The prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing is a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies as it is hindering fertilizer use by farmers given the adverse effect of lower crop pricing on growers  income  Lower farm income has a negative influence on growers  nutrient purchasing decisions  Given the bleak forecast for farm income  growers are expected to remain cautious while making crop input decisions in 2017  Insipid economic growth in certain key markets including Latin America is also affecting demand for nutrients 

Sluggish Demand in Energy Sector

	A low crude oil price environment  with prices consistently remaining at sub  50 a barrel levels  is still affecting demand for chemicals in this important end use market  Depressed crude oil prices have also kept chemical prices under check as they essentially move in tandem with oil prices 

	Moreover  the recent weakness in crude oil prices has renewed concerns over the sustainability of the cost advantage of the U S  chemical producers over their global counterparts who use oil based feedstock such as naptha 

	Oil prices crashed to a ten month low of  42 a barrel in late June 2017 in the face of a surging U S  oil output  officially entering into bear market territory  Notwithstanding a recovery since then  oil prices are persistently trading below the important psychological level of  50 a barrel amid a relentlessly oversupplied market  exacerbated by a ramp up in U S  shale drilling activities and production 

	Sustained increase in U S  shale output continues to counteract the efforts of the Saudi led OPEC cartel to drain the glut in the market and drive up prices through production cuts  As such  a still weak energy sector continues to pose a headwind for the chemical industry 

Pricing  FX Headwinds

	Commodity pricing remain a concern for many U S  chemical producers  Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy  given the competitive pressures in play  A number of chemical companies  including Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW   PPG Industries  Celanese and Eastman Chemical  are witnessing a spike in raw material prices as seen in the first quarter  As a result  margins of these producers may be under pressure moving ahead amid an inflationary environment 

	In addition  chemical companies generate a major chunk of their revenues outside the U S  and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations  A strong U S  dollar created a significant headwind for these companies in the March quarter and is expected to continue to be a drag on profits in the near term 

Stocks to Get Rid of Now

	As you can see  there are certain reasons to be cautious about the chemical industry  As such  it would also be a prudent choice to get rid of certain companies in the space that show weak fundamentals and carry an unfavorable Zacks Rank 

	We suggest staying away from stocks such as FMC Corp   NYSE        PPG Industries  Inc   NYSE        Huntsman Corp   NYSE        Methanex Corp   NASDAQ       and H B  Fuller Company  NYSE        all carrying a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  

	 Check out our latest  for a more detailed discussion on the fundamental trends

121594,343109,FMC,Dow Chemical  DOW  Q1  Can It Sustain The Earnings Streak ,opinion,"Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW   is scheduled to report its first quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Apr 27 Last quarter  the U S  chemical kingpin delivered a 12 50  positive earnings surprise  helped by its cost cutting and productivity actions and continued focus on consumer driven markets  Sales rose by double digits year over year as volumes rose on the back of the acquisition of Dow Corning s silicones business  Revenues topped expectations Dow has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 11 31   Is the company poised for another winning quarter  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Dow Chemical Company  The  Price and EPS Surprise
    Factors to Watch ForDow  in its last earnings call  said that it is witnessing signs of positive economic momentum with the U S  currently in expansionary mode while Europe continues its gradual recovery notwithstanding growing political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions  Moreover  sustained growth of middle class continues to drive demand in Asia  The company also envisions improvement in Latin America with slow but stable gains in Brazil The company expects demand to remain healthy  especially in the businesses that cater to packaging  infrastructure  consumer care  electronics  automotive and agriculture Dow has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over a year  The company s shares have gained around 17  over this period  compared with roughly 11 5  gain recorded by the industry Dow should continue to gain from its productivity improvement and cost control actions in the March quarter  The company remains on track to deliver  1 billion of cost reduction under its three year productivity program  Dow achieved  313 million in productivity savings in 2016  thereby surpassing its cost savings goal for the year  The company s continued focus on productivity improvement should lend support to its earnings in 2017 Dow should also gain from the synergies associated with Dow Corning Silicones business  Dow has taken full control of Dow Corning   earlier a 50 50 joint venture between Dow and Corning Inc Dow expects to achieve combined run rate annual synergies of  500 million from the restructured ownership in Dow Corning  consisting of  400 million in cost synergies and  100 million in growth synergies  Dow has already reached a cost synergy run rate of more than  360 million  The company also expects to realize  1 billion in annual EBITDA synergies  Dow is taking a number of actions to attain synergies from the restructuring of its ownership in Dow Corning Dow also remains committed to invest in attractive regions through highly accretive projects including the expansions in the U S  Gulf Coast and Sadara joint venture in the Middle East  The company s propane dehydrogenation unit  PDH  in Freeport is now operating at full capacity  The PDH unit represents a major part of Dow s roughly  4 billion U S  Gulf Coast investments  Dow also recently completed the construction of the new ethylene cracker that is on track to be operational by mid 2017 However  Dow is still facing challenges in its agriculture business  While Dow s agriculture business witnessed a healthy fourth quarter 2016  the company expects headwinds in the agriculture market to persist in the short haul   The agriculture market is not out of the woods and remains affected by depressed farm commodity prices  leading to lower farm income   While Latin America is showing signs of improvement of late  agricultural market conditions still remain sluggish in that key region  particularly in Brazil Dow is also seeing weakness in the energy market  stemming from the low oil price environment that is hurting oil and gas exploration project demand  The company saw lower volumes in its energy business in the fourth quarter due to weak demand from refining and processing end markets Dow is also witnessing competition driven pricing pressure in its performance materials   chemicals unit  The company also faces feedstock cost pressure in its performance plastics business  evident from a roughly  100 million increase in feedstock and energy costs in fourth quarter   The company expects raw material cost pressure to continue in the first quarter Dow and DuPont  NYSE DD  agreed to combine their businesses in Dec 2015 in an all stock deal to create a chemical powerhouse  dubbed  DowDuPont   with a combined market value of around  130 billion  before eventually breaking up into three independent companies through tax free spin offs  The breakup is expected to take place 18 months after the completion of the deal The companies  in Mar 2017  said that the European Commission  EC  has conditionally approved their proposed merger  The approval  which came after both companies committed to sell major portions of different businesses  is a major step toward closing the merger transaction  The approval is conditional on the companies fulfilling the commitments given to the EC in connection with the clearance DuPont  last month  struck a deal to sell part of its Crop Protection business to chemical company  FMC Corp  NYSE FMC   Moreover  DuPont agreed to buy substantially all of FMC s Health   Nutrition business  The deal with FMC is subject to the completion of the Dow DuPont merger and other customary closing conditions Dow and DuPont also amended their merger deal to accommodate the requirements of the FMC transaction  The companies now expect completion of their merger to take place between Aug 1  2017 and Sept 1  2017  The closing is subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of regulatory approvals  Earlier  the transaction was expected to complete in first half 2017  We expect Dow to provide an update on the deal in its first quarter call Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Dow is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Dow is  4 04  as the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 95 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 99 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Dow currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a negative ESP  makes

121598,343113,FMC,Does First Trust Have The Best ETFs You ve Never Heard Of ,opinion,"Barron s recently wrote an article about the best fund families of 2016  First Trust Advisors was  5  Here is what makes them different 
Just last week I attended an Insight Forum sponsored by First Trust  Interestingly  neither First Trust nor any of the other top 5 fund families are based on Wall Street or even in the New York City area  State Street and Natixis are in Boston  American Funds and Pimco are in southern California and First Trust is headquartered in Wheaton  a suburb of Chicago  where I once lived 
None of these firms are known for their offerings of passive index investments  although they may either be invested so close to their benchmark in some cases that they may as well be  By the way  if you don t recognize the name Natixis you will more likely recognize some of their affiliated funds like Oakmark  Oakmark International  Loomis Sayles and so on 
Remember  these rankings are based upon one year only   One swallow does not a summer make   It does  however  bring to the fore some offerings we may not have been familiar with prior to seeing these rankings 
First Trust differentiates itself in two ways from most of its competitors 

While the firm offers mutual funds  closed end funds  unit trusts  variable annuities and other products  its primary offerings are in ETFs  First Trust offers 114 different ETFs that cover the waterfront  It is the breadth of their coverage and the variety of styles  many combining the best of passive and active investing that sets First Trust apart 
The company has reviewed the data  studied the history  and analyzed the current risks and rewards of investing in various markets and come away with the inescapable conclusion that being anything but optimistic on America and American companies is short sighted 

As to First Trust s breadth of offerings  their AlphaDEX roster of ETFs is the one that will likely appeal most to current passive index investors  The AlphaDEX methodology is a smart beta approach to quasi passive investing  The terms smart beta  enhanced indexing  beta plus  etc  are all different ways of saying the same thing  Beta is nothing more than a measure of volatility it measures how a particular investment moves in relation to a benchmark index  A passive index will have a beta of 1 0  Smart beta begins with an index and applies some rules based approach in order to select securities from that index  In particular  it seeks to provide a better risk return profile than capitalization weighted indexes 
This can be done in the number of ways  At First Trust the emphasis is on fundamental indexing  The idea is to avoid or at least limit exposure to overpriced stocks and increase exposure to those companies trading it more attractive valuations based upon company fundamentals  Some of these factors might include the Price to Book value  Price to  Cash Flow  Price to Sales  and Return on Assets 
The philosophy behind the AlphaDEX ETFs is not to provide active management  but rather to provide returns from a different subset of a typical capitalization weighted benchmark  The approach is passive in that the stock selections are completely rules based  It begins with the same broad based index constituents that form the basis for ETFs that many passive investors buy  But the AlphaDEX rules then analyze the securities and determine if they are primarily value stocks  growth stocks or a blend 
For value stocks  they rank all stocks based upon value factors like price to book value  price to cash flow and return on assets  For growth stocks  they look more to momentum  price to sales and sales growth  Core  blend  securities are ranked on the higher of their value or growth rankings 
The next step is to eliminate from consideration the lowest 25  in each area and instead place their portfolio funds in the other 75   This makes these ETFs weighted not by capitalization but by fundamental factors  However  the portfolio managers aren t finished yet  They then take those 75  of stocks still worthy of consideration and create 5 quintiles  The lowest 20  of the 75  receive only 6 7  of the total portfolio  The next 20  receive 13 3  of the total portfolio  the middle quintile 20   the second best 26 7  and the 20  with the best growth or value profile receive the highest share  33 3  
Then they leave it alone  exactly as passive ETFs do   except  Except they run a completely new analysis every 3 months and reconstitute and rebalance the portfolio to always keep the most worthy firms  based upon the rules they have established as the biggest factor in the portfolios 
Here is one example of the philosophy at work  one which I own for a number of clients  The First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund  NYSE FXZ  currently   and subject to change 4 times per year   counts among its largest positions Owens Illinois  NYSE OI   FMC Corp  NYSE FMC  Canada s Tahoe Resources  NYSE TAHO   Owens Corning  NYSE OC   Eastman Chemical  NYSE EMN  and so on  Morningstar gives the ETF 5 stars and rates it as below average risk with a high return profile  Mutual Fund Observer credits it with the  Great Owl  label  It has been a steady performer  much like the market itself  albeit with less day to day or week to week fireworks 

For comparison  during this period the biggest passive ETF  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   advanced from 210 to 245  or the equivalent of 21 to 24 50 
I like the idea of a rules based strategy that uses the kinds of measures I also use to decide what to own   and that discards the least favorable and then reallocates on a regular schedule  It doesn t always guarantee success but I believe it does well after all expenses  0 66  for those who care deeply about such things  and results in a rational approach that has shown fine results thus far 
The second thing I respect and like about First Trust as a firm is that it recognizes the distinction between politics and investing  Too many times of late I ve had people tell me they are getting out of the market because they  just don t trust that guy in the White House   as if that somehow were the most compelling reason to exit the market  I try to tell them that  in my investing lifetime  I heard the same exact words about presidents Nixon  Carter  Reagan  Clinton  both Bushes  and Obama  And do you know what the markets did while people were avoiding it because they didn t like the current president  Here s a snapshot 

This chart is dated a year and a half ago  Today the S P is at 2440  up some 2000   The market cares about corporate revenues  not Congress  It cares about corporate earnings  not the President  It cares about solid balance sheets  not whether the Fed is adding or subtracting 25 basis points from the Fed Funds rate 
And in these areas  American ingenuity has never been more on display and American entrepreneurs more in evidence  We hear that the US is the  1 economic power  followed by China and Japan  But not as frequently discussed is  by how much  

The US is still the leader and is not giving ground  Shale oil and  more importantly  shale gas will enlarge the USA s share of world GDP  not diminish it  While China  Japan  Germany and the rest of the world burn as much coal as ever  China   import more oil and gas than ever  Japan   or spend GDP jousting at windmills when nat gas is abundant and cheap  Germany  the US just keeps rolling along   That s why our subscribers know that I continue to add to pipeline holdings whenever the price is right  like it is today  If government never spends a dime on infrastructure I know who will   energy firms   and I know where much of it will go   to improve and increase our nation s pipeline infrastructure  
This nation is on the leading edge in health care improvements  in computing  in robotics  in energy and in so many other areas  A nation that guarantees intellectual and property rights and lives under the rule of law will always dance circles around the many more numerous nations that do not 
My respect for First Trust s offerings rests upon more than their portfolio managers and their rules based and other ETFs  mutual funds and closed end funds  It is that  rather than try to time this or that Fed announcement or Congressional or presidential faux pas  they are constantly asking   Who is likely to increase their revenues going forward  Who is likely to increase their earnings  Who has the most bullet proof balance sheets  returns the most on assets  etc  etc  
We all know what is most important in investing  Most forget it regularly  First Trust employs a discipline that keeps these things uppermost in their minds

121629,343144,FMC,Good Reasons To Bet On Chemical Stocks ,opinion,"The chemical industry s recovery remains on track amid a still fragile global economic environment  The industry s recovery is supported by healthy demand across automotive and construction markets  Notwithstanding a few industry related headwinds  weak demand across agricultural and energy markets and sluggishness in China  there are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul  which we have highlighted below 
Shale Boom   Driving Force for Chemical Investment
The shale gas revolution in the U S  has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country  According to the American Chemistry Council  ACC   the U S  has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas  New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  are boosting shale production  bringing down prices of ethane  derived from shale gas  in the process 
The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities  crackers  in the U S  to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost effective way  Per ACC  domestic chemical investment related to shale gas has reached as high as  164 billion  more than 60  of which are from firms outside the U S 
Already 264 projects    many backed by the Federal government    have been announced by chemical makers to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies  with 40  of them already complete or under construction  Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years  The ACC expects average annual gains of more than 8  in U S  chemical industry capital spending through 2018 
Construction Sector Gathering Steam
A recovery across housing and commercial construction    major chemical end markets    has been another tailwind for the chemical industry  After being hit hard in the recession  the construction sector has bounced back on the back of strong housing fundamentals  The U S  housing sector saw steady recovery in 2015 backed by stabilizing mortgage rates  improving job market and moderating home prices  and the momentum continues this year 
The underlying demand trends in the housing space remain strong  supported by an improving employment levels  affordable interest mortgage rates and a rise in income levels  Recent housing data has been fairly upbeat with housing starts scaling a 9 year high in October as builders ramped up construction to meet rising demand for new homes and apartments 
The renewal of long stalled construction projects and long awaited access to credit from lending institutions has also helped invigorate the commercial construction sector  U S  architecture firm billings continue to rise  The US Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an indicator that offers a glimpse into the future of U S  non residential construction spending activity  clocked 50 8 in October 2016  a reading above 50 indicates an increase in billings  
Moreover  the American Institute of Architects  AIA  expects healthy growth in non residential construction spending based on strong demand for hotels  office space  manufacturing facilities and amusement and recreation spaces  The AIA sees spending to go up 5 8  in 2016 and 5 6  in 2017 
Automotive   Good Run Continues
Chemical makers continue to see healthy demand from the automotive sector    a major end use market  The sector is enjoying the fruits of low fuel prices 
U S  light vehicles  a key end user market for chemicals  sales hit all time high of around 17 5 million units in 2015  The U S  light vehicles market continues to show strength this year  supported by an improving job market  rising personal income  low fuel prices and attractive financing options 
A high average age of cars on the U S  roads is also fueling replacement demand for cars  U S  light vehicle sales rose 3 6  year over year to 1 38 million units in November 2016  hitting a new high for the month  New car and light truck sales are expected to reach to 17 4 million units in 2016  as per The National Automobile Dealers Association  NADA  estimates  indicating a fairly stable market 
Low interest rates  favorable financing and cheap oil have also backed a recovery in the European auto market this year  The auto industry in Asian countries  especially China  is also expected to thrive over the next several years  According to IHS Automotive  new vehicle sales are expected to touch nearly 90 million units globally in 2016  Healthy momentum in the automotive space augurs well for chemical demand in this important end market 
Chemical Bonding   M A Heating Up 
Chemical makers remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and shore up growth in a still difficult global economic environment  The industry saw a pick up in consolidation activities last year and the momentum continues in 2016 
Chemical companies are increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations  The  130 billion proposed mega merger of Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW   DOW  and DuPont  NYSE DD   DD     the biggest chemical deal ever    is a huge testimony to these strategic moves 
Other major deals that have taken place in the chemical space in the recent past include Albemarle Corp  s  ALB   6 2 billion buyout of Rockwood Holdings  Inc   Merck  NYSE MRK  KGaA s  17 billion acquisition of Sigma Aldrich  FMC Corp  NYSE FMC   s  FMC  acquisition of Cheminova A S  Westlake Chemical s  WLK   3 8 billion acquisition of Axiall Corp   ChemChina s proposed  43 billion acquisition of Syngenta  SYT   and the  66 billion proposed merger between Monsanto Company  NYSE MON   MON  and Bayer AG  DE BAYGN   BAYRY  
Strategic Measures
Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on high growth markets  driven by megatrends  in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are struggling with weak demand and input costs pressure  Moreover  cost cutting measures    including plant closures and headcount reduction    and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to yield industry wide margin improvements  Several chemical makers are also disposing non core assets as they shift their focus on high margin businesses 
Stocks to Consider
As you can see from the above mentioned factors  there are many reasons to be optimistic about the chemical industry  Chemical stocks that are well placed in the current operating backdrop include FMC Corp   Westlake Chemical and The Chemours Company  CC   all sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
We also have a bullish view on Celanese Corp   CE  and Methanex Corp   MEOH   both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

121639,343154,FMC,1 500  Growth In Demand For This Powerful Commodity,opinion,"The smartphone in your pocket    the tablet on your nightstand    the fitness tracker around your wrist   
They re all powered by the same industrial metal  And as technology becomes better  faster and smaller  experts predict thousands of tons of it will be needed to meet demand   
538 000 tons to be exact 
As you can see in today s chart  technology is leading the charge in lithium demand 
By 2018  mobile phone manufacturers will require 15 million tons of lithium  The world s 407 million laptops and tablets will need 12 700 tons  And 500 000 new vehicles will use up 28 000 tons  The energy storage industry will trim another 34 000 tons off of our lithium supply 
We ll need to produce 1 500  more lithium over the coming years 
In the interim  that means one thing   
As surging demand outpaces limited supply  prices will soar 
It s great news for fast acting investors  In a  for Energy   Resources Digest  Resource Strategist Sean Brodrick wrote 
What does  increasing demand  do to prices  Here comes another earth shaking KA BOOM  In China  a major user of the metal  the price of battery grade lithium has surged to more than  20 000 per ton from just  7 000 per ton in 2015  according to a report from CRU Group 
Prices will zig zag up and down from here  But the big trend is higher 

According to Sean  one way to play the trend is with the Global X Lithium  NYSE LIT  
This fund holds lithium producers  explorers and miners  That includes FMC Corp   NYSE  NYSE FMC   Sociedad Quimica y Minera SA  NYSE SQM  and China s LG Chemicals  KS 051910  

Once again  in Sean s words 

 You can see how this fund ripped higher earlier in the year  Now it is consolidating  The next big wave is coming  I think it could take Global X Lithium ETF to  39  then much higher  

Lithium is riding a surge of rising global demand  And with more and more of our devices relying on this powerful metal  the rally is just getting started

121640,343155,FMC,NRG Metals  A Good  Lithium Bet ,opinion,"After massive moves in Lithium   Li   juniors last year  will history repeat  Who knows  there will be big winners in 2017  but far fewer  Investors learned a lot about which stories have a chance and which likely don t  For example  if one is invested in an Esmeralda County  Nevada  host of the Clayton Valley basin  Li play  it might be time to take a closer look  Why  The superpower in the area  Albemarle Corporation  NYSE ALB  believes it has a senior claim on ALL water rights in the basin 
Water rights and or lack of scale will be the downfall of dozens of hopefuls in western States  This is also true  for the same and other reasons  in many jurisdictions of Canada  Australia   Argentina   ARG    Investors looking for good ideas should pay particular attention to ARG  For some  that might mean development stage companies like Lithium Americas Corp  TO LAC  which owns 45 75  of a very strong project  Cauchari Olaroz   along with 45 75  partner Sociedad Quimica y Minera SA  NYSE SQM  in Jujuy Province  Or  ASX listed Galaxy Resources Ltd  AX GXY   owner of the very promising Sal de Vida project on the western side of the Salar del Hombre Muerto 
Cheap valuation  world class team  sizable Li brine option in Argentina
I m looking for juniors with cheap valuations PLUS 1  strong management  2  access to capital and 3  potential projects of scale  NRG Metals Inc  V NGZ  stands out for its valuation  2nd lowest market cap of 15 ARG Li juniors I track  Note   Valuation is more important than ever  Dozens of Li stocks are up hundreds or thousand s  of percent  even after meaningful pullbacks from 52 week highs   NRG has a world class management   technical team  and has gained control  through a low cost option  of nearly 30 000 ha in the Salar de Carachi Pampa 

I asked the following questions of President  CEO   Director Adrian Hobkrik 
There are  20 junior lithium companies with property or project interests in Argentina  Why should readers care about NRG Metals 
That s a great question  Since there are many juniors competing for scarce resources  we strongly believe that controlling a basin will be critical  We have optioned 29 182 hectares   72 100 acres  in the Carachi Pampa basin  in the Salar de Catamarca   a position we consider district scale  Size matters  but even more important  vitally important  is having a strong technical team including people with direct Li brine experience in South America  We re funded through our upcoming drill program and believe our ability to raise capital is strong 
You spoke of the vital importance of management  how does your team compare to that of peers that have larger market caps  
In a country like Argentina  boots on the ground is a pre requisite for success  Six team members have mining experience in S  America   4 fluent or native speaking  3 with direct Li experience  offering a range of valuable skills  Jos  Gustavo de Castro is a chemical engineer  an expert in evaluating and advancing of projects  including 5 years as Country Manager at producer Orocobre Ltd   responsible for the development of the Salar de Olaroz project  Jos  also held senior positions with the Argentine subsidiary of FMC Corporation  NYSE FMC   operator of S  America s largest lithium operation  Note   Avg  market cap of 15 ARG focused Li juniors    C 50 million   5x that of NRG s C  9 million market cap 3 22 17  

Fernando Villarroel has 12 years  experience in the mining industry in Argentina focusing on lithium process development  From 2009 to 2013 he worked with Lithium Americas as Project Manager responsible for construction management   commissioning of the initial pilot evaporation facilities and lab at Cauchari Olaroz  Jos  Louis Mart n is a Phd in Geology with 35 years  experience  Dr  Mart n served as the Catamarca representative for Galaxy Lithium from 2010 to 2013  and participated in the development of the Feasibility Study for Galaxy s Sal De Vida  Note   See more detailed bios below 
How did you find the Carachi property  and how were you able to quadruple NRG s initial land position to 29 182 hectares  72 100 acres   
Initially we had 3 004 ha    7 420 acres   then we optioned an additional 3 383 ha   8 360 acres  and announced the transaction  After a successful VES survey  which formed the basis of the   done by Novaldo Rojas  the QP for Milllennial Lithium  TSX V  ML   we decided to go after a dominant position in the basin  So  we re negotiated with five parties and came up with a deal requiring a cash payment of only US 173k  for an option on  as you said  29 182 ha   72 100 acres   No further payments are due unless we like upcoming drill results  We believe  consultants believe  salars in this area are related to the Galan Caldera  Given the depth of the basin  if we hit decent Li values without chemical issues  we could be off to the races 

Please explain why you think your Carachi Pampa property is an attractive prospect  
Based on a recent geophysical survey  there s a zone of very low resistivity   high conductivity that looks like it could be a zone of saturated brines  It begins at 70 m depth  dips to 300 m  is about 150 m thick  and is open at depth and in all directions  At low cost  we can drill a few holes and see what we find  Our technical team can explore multiple targets at once until we find project s  we like  Access to capital is key  we re in good shape on that front 
Might NRG be interested in other technology metals  In other provinces or other countries  
Our clear focus is on Carachi Pampa  That said  we re in discussions about Li brine properties projects in nearby salars  Our in house expertise allows us to review multiple prospects brought to our attention  We re in no rush  Carachi Pampa will keep us busy as we contemplate exercising that option  Regarding other metals  other countries  we would possibly look in Chile  but our skill set is geared towards Li brine deposits 
Management team bios

Readers be warned  or reminded   Li juniors are highly speculative  all of them  NRG Metals Inc is no different  but at least its valuation is much lower than that of  the average  Li junior with property project s  in Argentina  Less downside risk may be found in the shares of giant companies like Tianqi Lithium Industries  China listed     Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium  China listed     FMC  Albemarle and SQM  or with development   producing companies like Galaxy  Lithium Americas and Orocobre Ltd   ASX  ORE   But  to have a possibility of out sized returns  one has to accept incremental risk NRG has a very experienced Li team and is actively looking to diversity its portfolio with assets from neighboring salars  The Company prudently locked down dominant position of nearly 30 000 ha for under US 200k to take a shot at a potentially significant discovery  Make no mistake  this is an educated guess  not a sure thing  However  a technical team of this caliber would serve investors well by making as many low cost educated guesses as they possibly can

121641,343156,FMC,Wealth Minerals Ltd  Hottest Salar In Chile,opinion,"In this article I discuss a Lithium   Li   junior that has successfully locked down  via option agreements  several key lithium properties   projects in Chile  mgmt  still looking for more  and owns or controls 4 precious   base metal projects in Mexico  Peru   Canada  Each of the Company s assets is good to very good  but my focus is on the crown jewel  On March 17  Wealth Minerals Ltd   V WML  delivered a NI 43 101   the  Report   on its optioned Proyecto Atacama Lithium   PAL   project in the northern part of the Salar de Atacama  the  Salar    located  220 km east of the Chilean city of Antofagasta  LON ANTO   The Salar itself is the largest in Chile and 3rd largest in the world  measuring about 85 x 50 km   4 250 sq  km  The Report represents an important milestone in the Company s early stage Li exploration activities   See  
For non experts  like myself  in hydrology   hydrodynamics  chemistry  geochemistry  geology  hydrogeology  volcanology  stratigraphy  etc   I ve condensed roughly 10 000 words  maps  charts  images   schematics into a few key takeaways 


Wealth Minerals  NI 43 101 Technical Report  in Under 500 Words
Wealth s exclusive option on a 100  royalty free Interest in  and to  the PAL project in Chile consists of 144 exploration mining concessions covering 46 200 hectares   114 160 acres   462 sq  km   178 sq  miles  in the northern part of the Salar  The PAL project abuts claims held by SQM  NYSE  SQM    Albemarle Corp s  NYSE  ALB   subsidiary Rockwood Lithium  roughly 30 km   50 km north  respectively  of those companies  world class operations  NOTE   46 200 contiguous hectares is a huge land position  larger than that of any other  entire  salar in Chile  

The principal origin of lithium is interpreted to be surface   subsurface lithium bearing geothermal waters from the El Tatio Geyser Field situated north of the Salar  flowing south onto concessions controlled by Wealth Minerals Chile    WMC    then onto SQM s   Albemarle s concessions   production facilities  The chemistry of the brines in the south is said to be   almost identical  to that of the geothermal fluids of El Tatio  strongly suggesting those mobilized fluids are the main source of lithium   potassium   K   in the Salar  From the Technical Report  Section 6 0  page 18 

   because there s been Li   potassium production from brines located in the southern part of the Salar  and because there has been significant development of deep water sources for nearby mining activities  copper mines Escondida   Zaldivar  among others   significant studies of the geology  hydrogeology and natural resources are available for the region  These regional studies have been carried out by several third party private companies and by Chilean agencies  As well  numerous cooperative assessments of geology and hydrogeology have been carried out by international scientific agencies  


Whereas SQM   Albemarle are harvesting near surface brines  WMC s target zone is in subsurface aquifers several hundred meters deep  NOTE   the company s goal is to identify similar brine chemistry at depth  as that of nearer surface brines being extracted 30 50 km to the south   There has been no exploration whatsoever for Lithium on the northern part of the Salar  including the PAL project  WMC s Technical Report offers 10 recommendations for a Phase 1 exploration program 

i  consultation with a geophysical contractor  ii  confirm methodology  iii  consider the use of Time Domain EM  iv  determine sedimentary regime  v  consider gravity survey to determine basin configuration  vi  consider Magneto Telluric methodology for deep target evaluation  vii  conduct geophysical programs  viii  initiate community relations programs  ix  prepare reports   analysis to develop drill targets and x  permit   drill 5 test holes 

The above mention steps are estimated to cost just  550k  The Report s author concluded that although the PAL project is early stage  exploration for lithium resources is warranted for the following reasons  section 1 0  page 5 

 1  Lithium rich brines produced in the northern part of the Salar flow to the south  across the PAL project  2  Sustained production of lithium  potassium   byproducts has occurred in the Salar since the 1970 s from properties contiguous to the PAL project  3  Regional and multidisciplinary studies by several companies and government agencies have confirmed the similarity of geology and hydrogeology of the northern and southern parts of the Salar  4  Although not necessarily an indication of brine potential  surface sampling of sediment   surface waters returned anomalous lithium concentrations  

Who Will Survive Inevitable Industry Shakeout  

Above is a comparison chart of well known South American salars  NOTE   the metrics associated with  Salar de Atacama  are those of known producers SQM   Albemarle  there s been no exploration on WMC s concessions  
Wealth Minerals has locked up a very large block of contiguous exploration concessions in northern Chile  host to the undisputed lowest cost lithium  brine  hard rock or clay  operations in the world  There are at least 18 publicly listed  pre production Li juniors with property or project interests in Argentina  There are just 4   2 of which Bearing Resources Ltd  V BRZ  and Lithium Power International Ltd  AX LPI  are partners on the same project   focusing on Chile  LiCo Energy Metals Inc  V LIC  is another junior in Chile with an option on exploitation concessions  plus it has significant Li assets in Nevada and promising cobalt assets in Canada   Both countries will be top 3 or 4 Li suppliers  The question is  which juniors will break into the ranks of SQM  Albemarle   FMC Corp  NYSE FMC  in South America s Lithium Triangle 
There are several contending projects in Argentina  most notably Lithium Americas Corp  TO LAC    SQM s joint venture Cauchari Olaroz project in Jujuy Province and Galaxy Resources Ltd  AX GXY  Sal de Vida project in Salar del Hombre Muerto  As mentioned  the race is on among over a dozen other new entrants there  By contrast  if one believes as I do that new producer s  will emerge in Chile  then Wealth Minerals  PAL  Lithium Power s Bearing Resources  Maricunga and LiCo Energy s Purickuta  located in the same Salar de Atacama  projects are virtually the only games in town among publicly listed companies  
The Report explains lithium production methodology at active production sites on the Atacama Salar in section 7 3  page 23 

 The production method utilized by SQM and Rockwood is  lithium containing brine is pumped out of the lithium potassium bearing brine aquifer into evaporation ponds  where it s concentrated by evaporation  The brine is further purified on its way through the system by continued evaporation  when the brine is pumped through a cascade of ponds where impurities or by products are crystallized and removed  Main by products are potash for the fertilizer industry and bischofite used for road paving  During the evaporation process  the lithium concentration is increased from about 2 000 ppm to up to 60 000 ppm  6   in the final brine  The final brine is transported to a processing plant for further purification and processing to yield lithium carbonate and lithium chloride  

Of the three  the scale of Wealth Minerals  flagship project really stands out at 46 200 hectares   114 160 acres   If the Company is successful in identifying high grade Li   K  with acceptable levels of deleterious elements  there would be the real possibility of a large production profile  That remains to be seen  there s no proof  just theory  that Wealth s optioned property contains potentially economic brines 
But  the theory seems a good one for the reasons laid out in the   Could there possibly be a better location on the planet to explore for concentrated Li bearing brines  To reiterate  the concessions are just 30 50 km north of Albemarle   SQM s operations  lowest cost in the world   Geologically speaking  in the context of aquifers  that distance is small  Investors in Li juniors have likely already picked a few Argentina plays  Chile should not be ignored  I believe that Wealth Minerals offers a compelling investment proposition  well worth readers further attention   See

Stocks post solid weekly gain to close out quarterly rally
Stocks closed out a solid quarterly advance with a respectable rebound from recent pressure  showing some resiliency in the face of festering political uncertainty  which was exacerbated by last week s failed healthcare reform bill  Energy issues led the way as crude oil prices snapped back from a recent tumble on the heels of some bullish inventory data and speculation of an extension of OPEC s production cut agreement  per Bloomberg 
Stocks were also bolstered by an unexpected jump in Consumer Confidence to the highest level since December 2000 and a stronger than expected final read on 4Q  as well as comments out of Washington suggesting the healthcare hiccup would likely not derail efforts on tax reform and infrastructure spending  Financials also contributed to the week s gain as the drop in Treasury yields showed some signs of stabilizing  The U S  dollar rebounded on the economic data and some hawkish commentary from a Fed official 
The stage is set for next week s heavy dose of data  to see if economic optimism can continue to counter political uncertainty  The ISM and Markit will deliver their March reads on manufacturing and key services sector activity and the Fed will release the minutes from its meeting that yielded a rate hike earlier this month  while the trade balance  monthly auto sales and factory orders are likely to garner attention  However  the headlining event will close out the week  courtesy of Friday s March nonfarm payroll report 
The modest downward pressure on stocks recently appears to be working off some overly optimistic sentiment  We view this as a healthy pause in an ongoing bull market  U S  political realities and the failure of healthcare reform contributed to the recent pullback in stocks but investors shouldn t get discouraged  Economic data has hooked up  notably business confidence  which has led to a pickup in capital spending  The official Brexit process has begun  and although a recession doesn t appear imminent  risks have risen and volatility will likely rise

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to Consider
Century Aluminum slipped to a loss in first quarter 2016  The company recorded a net loss of  16 2 million  or  0 19 per share  in the quarter versus a profit of  73 8 million  or  0 76 per share  recorded a year ago The company stated that capacity additions and production growth in China have been persisting despite weak domestic demand  The excess production  backed by illegal subsidies  continues to support exports which have caused material damage to its industry  The company remains hopeful that only strong enforcement of international trade laws will lead to a fair and even playing field for the industry 
Century Aluminum is implementing a number of actions to reduce costs and preserve cash amid a weak pricing environment  The company anticipates achieving annualized savings of  40  65 million through these measures that include operating expense cuts and headcount reduction 
Century Aluminum is expected to benefit from acquisitions  especially Mt  Holly  and value added investment projects  The key regions for the company   the U S  and China   are also witnessing robust growth in aluminum requirements for the automotive and aerospace industry 
Century Aluminum recently renegotiated a market based agreement with a third party supplier to provide roughly 75  of the power requirements for the Mt  Holly smelter  The balance 25  of the smelter s power requirement will continue to be supplied by Santee Cooper  The new agreement will allow the smelter to continue to operate at around 50  capacity while it looks for a competitive long term arrangement 
However  the company is faced with a weak pricing environment  LME aluminum prices still remain under pressure due to supply glut aggravated by high levels of exports of aluminum by China  the world s biggest producer  amid weakening demand at home 
 CENTURY ALUM CO Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Century Aluminum is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Century Aluminum is currently 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  both stand at a loss of 9 cents 
Zacks Rank  Century Aluminum carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult

121716,343231,FMC,Will Cabot Corp   CBT  Disappoint Estimates In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Specialty chemicals and performance materials producer  Cabot Corp    NYSE CBT    is set to release third quarter fiscal 2016 results after the market closes on July 27 
Last quarter  the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9 09   The company reported adjusted earnings of 70 cents per share that fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents  Net sales of  568 million tumbled 18 2  year over year  However  cost reductions led to an improvement in operating profits and earnings compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2015  
The company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 1 59   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
In second quarter fiscal 2016  Cabot Corp  performed relatively well with its adjusted earnings per share surging 32 1  year over year  The increase was primarily driven by cost reduction as a result of restructuring measures undertaken by the company  Management expects a better performance in the second half of fiscal 2016 compared to the first half  with higher volumes across all segments 
At the beginning of fiscal 2016  the company had targeted a 75 cents increase in annual adjusted earnings per share over last year  However  the company does not expect to achieve this target now given a challenging operating environment  It sees earnings per share for fiscal 2016 in the range of  3 05  3 23  While the company is on track with cost reduction through restructuring  several other factors can weigh on earnings 
Cabot Corp  continues to face a number of macroeconomic challenges  The company s Specialty Fluids segment is dependent on the timing of certain oil and gas projects  The segment s EBIT decreased by  1 million year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2016  The segment continues to be affected by low momentum and project activity caused by a downturn in the oil and gas industry 
The Purification Solutions segment of Cabot Corp  saw a  3 million year on year decrease in EBIT in second quarter fiscal 2016 due to an adverse impact of reduced inventory levels  Low natural gas prices are expected to have a more pronounced impact on the segment  going forward 
The company s Reinforcement Segment saw volumes fall by 1  year over year in the last reported quarter  This was primarily caused by weaker demand in Latin America  partially offset by higher demand in North America and Asia  Although the segment is expected to grow in North America and Europe  it continues to face stiff competitive pressure in China and South America  While management is optimistic about the coming quarters  uncertainty or unfavorable movement in feedstock costs  natural gas prices  volume and currencies can create pressure on the projections CABOT CORP Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cabot Corp  is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Cabot Corp  is currently pegged at  3 26   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 89 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 92 cents

121751,343266,FMC,Critical Elements Corp   Lithium Junior Worth Watching,opinion,"The following exclusive interview of Jean S bastien Lavall e  President   CEO of Critical Elements Corp  was conducted by phone and email over the four days ended December 17th  All dollar amounts are in CAD  
Critical Elements Corporation  TO CRE  is a junior lithium company with a promising project in northern Quebec  backed by the its Preliminary Economic Assessment   PEA  Lithium is one of the only metals minerals experiencing increased demand  as evidenced by higher lithium carbonate   hydroxide prices this year  Critical Elements is in the right place at the right time  poised to advance its Rose Lithium Tantalum project  Management believes that the Company has been de risked due to the recent signing of a comprehensive Collaboration Agreement with a leading global chemical company 
Management has been resolute in keeping equity dilution to a minimum  For instance  cash burn is just  125k per quarter  Critical Elements is in discussions with various parties regarding a potential capital raise that  if consummated  is expected to include a meaningful debt component  Further evidence of a strong management team can be found in the hiring of Mr  David J  Buckley as Chief Processing Operator 
Mr  Buckley has very extensive experience in the lithium space  Most recently  from 2006 to 2015  he was Senior Process Engineer for Rockwood Lithium Inc  where he was heavily involved in end products including lithium carbonate  hydroxide   chloride  Prior  Mr  Buckley was Process Engineer for FMC Lithium from 1992 to 2004  

 With his many years of experience in the lithium processing industry with companies like FMC and Rockwood  Mr  Buckley brings expertise to the proper execution of each step necessary for the successful ramping up of lithium carbonate production at the Rose Lithium Tantalum project  with anticipated optimal capital and operating costs   said Jean S bastien Lavall e  President   CEO 

Please describe Critical Elements Corp  to readers unfamiliar with the story 
Critical Elements Corp   TSX V  CRE   US OTCQX  CRECF  is an emerging specialty metals  lithium  tantalum  rare earths  company focused on the Rose Lithium Tantalum project in northern Quebec  Besides battery grade lithium  the project benefits from a rare source of low iron spodumene concentrate  ideally suited for the Glass   Ceramic markets  As well  we hope to become one of the few new sources of conflict free tantalum in the world  The project is supported by roughly  200 million of key infrastructure  including a road with 100 Metric tonne  Mt  capacity  There s a nearby airport  power line  and Hydro Quebec camp 30 kms away  Therefore  a significant amount of infrastructure that we would have had to build is readily available  Our PEA spotlights a high purity  low cost lithium  99 98  Purity  opportunity with a post tax NPV 8     IRR of  279 million   25   and a pre tax NPV 8     IRR of  488 million and 33  
Most important  we recently struck a Collaborative Agreement with a leading  global chemical company  This agreement includes a 100  take or pay off take clause  The agreement grants the Partner an option to buy a 25  direct interest in the Rose Lithium Tantalum project for 25  of the cap ex  Our Partner will contribute valuable technical assistance and commercial knowledge through to commercialization 
Critical Elements   of a   collaboration agreement  with a leading chemical company  including 100  take or pay off take  was terrific news  Do you believe this development is reflected in the share price  
By avoiding dilutive financing as much as possible  we have run the company in a very lean fashion  As a result  there s a lack of awareness of the investment opportunity offered by Critical Elements  With ongoing achievement of important milestones  we hope that the investing public will recognize our Company s undervaluation 
We have set high performance standards and remain intently focused on reaching them  Every step of our plan has been successfully accomplished so far  In addition to Mr  Buckley  we are working on hiring key executives with long time experience in lithium carbonate   hydroxide processing 
Our collaboration agreement is more like a partnership in that we will share technical   commercial knowledge from the Feasibility stage on through to production  This agreement is with a company that enjoys worldwide freight and distribution power  We believe this agreement represents a tremendous vote of confidence in our project and management team 
Investors might not appreciate these important distinctions that greatly de risk our project 
Critical Elements  PEA shows a pre tax NPV 8   of  488 million   IRR of 33   but at a moderately higher lithium carbonate price  the NPV more than doubles  Are current lithium prices above or below the base case assumption 
Following discussions with producers  consumers   industry consultants  and supported by the announcement by FMC Corp  N FMC  of a 15  across the board increase in prices  we estimate the lithium carbonate price is around US  7 500 Mt  25  above the long term assumption in our PEA  A price of US  7 500 Mt implies a post tax IRR of about 35  and NPV 8   of roughly  500 million  Like most PEAs  we believe that ours is fairly conservative  The assumed FX rate we used is at parity between the US    C   However  if today s C  0 73 FX rate were to be incorporated  the NPV 8    in Canadian dollars  would be considerably higher  The chart below shows the pre tax IRR  The PEA s base case is 33 0  

Can you give readers a snapshot of Critical Elements  most recent Capital Structure  
We have 125 7 million common shares outstanding  basic market cap   20 8 million at 12 16 15 close    7 7 million options at a weighted average strike price of  0 21  range  0 15 to  0 30    6 4257 million warrants at a weighted average strike price of  0 365  range  0 35 to  0 375   We have 140 million fully diluted shares  The Company s fully diluted Enterprise Value   EV   fully diluted market cap plus debt minus cash     23 1 million   zero debt    4 million  pro forma cash from the exercise of options   warrants     19 1 million  Critical Elements  EV is trading at   19 1 million divided by the PEA s NPV 8   of  279 million     7  of the base case NPV for our Rose Lithium Tantalum project alone 
What portion of Critical Elements  combined Indicated   Inferred resources are included in the PEA  In what ways  if any  do you think that select components of the PEA could be conservative  
The PEA only includes the Indicated resource  leaving a lot of room to increase our mine life with additional drilling  We believe we could convert some of the Inferred resource into the Indicated category to add mine life  but at this stage  17 years is plenty  We also have a number of other exploration prospects sporting positive grab samples  trenching and drill results  The assumed CAD  US  FX rate has moved markedly in our favor  The assumed lithium price in the PEA of US  6 000 Mt is below the current spot price  We have made notable improvements in our recoveries since the PEA was delivered 
There s fear among investors that they will endure death by a thousand equity raises  Can you comment on possible equity dilution  
Since we ve been developing the Rose Lithium Tantalum project  management has worked hard to minimize equity dilution and to ensure that dollars spent on the project are well allocated  Management is taking the time necessary to avoid the mistakes of others and to do the right things  step by step  We are fortunate to be in discussions with various funding parties  allowing us to possibly execute a financing package consisting of both debt and equity capital  To be clear  we have nothing definitive to say at this time 
I would be remiss if I did not point out that management and family members own about 18  of outstanding shares  Adding to that amount  the top five shareholders accounts for a total of 38  of outstanding shares  Our interests are entirely in line with that of our shareholders  We want to benefit directly from an increase in the share price reflecting the company achieving milestones  The avoidance of equity dilution is very important to all of us 
Access to infrastructure is vital  it can make or break a project  How is Critical Elements positioned in this regard 
We have strong access to infrastructure  giving us an advantage over many projects around the world  A road and power line are already on site  and there s a nearby airport and mining camp  Given the collapse in oil  precious   base metals  manpower is not only available  but available on favorable terms  Importantly  that includes a range of consulting groups  contract miners and equipment leasing firms 
On page 15 of the Company s corporate presentation there s an operating flow sheet  How complex is it compared to that of peer lithium projects 
Yes  I m glad you asked that  The flotation flow sheet is standard and simple  We are not a technology oriented company  so we are pleased that we don t have to deal with technology risk in our processing designs  Our flow sheet is nearly the same as lithium operations in Australia  In addition  the quality of our resource gives us the opportunity to potentially generate cash flow earlier in the process  Our tantalite concentrate by product is expected to be extracted at the first processing step  After that  we intend to produce low iron lithium concentrate for the Glass   Ceramic markets  12 18 months later  we hope to start producing battery grade lithium carbonate  This makes a big difference in the cash flow schedule and would reduce the risk of our lithium carbonate plant ramp up by self funding a portion of the cap ex 
What s your team s view on tantalum demand  Is the potential contribution to the Rose Lithium Tantalum project s economics significant  
The demand for tantalum is increasing about 4  annually  The actual demand is around 4 million pounds  of which 20  comes from scrap and 50  from the Democratic Republic of Congo  Critical Elements hopes to be one of the few new  economically viable sources of conflict free tantalum in the world  The revenue split between lithium tantalum is about 80  20   Our tantalite is deposit is one of the larger potential sources  and we have been approached by many end users 
We and others believe that lithium   tantalum are poised to be in high demand  We have seen for the last 5 years a shift in global commodity demand  where new technologies and applications demand higher performing materials  This is driven by the consumer s desire for smaller  better  improved power performance 
On page 4 of the corporate presentation it says   very high purity  battery grade deposit of lithium carbonate   Is the purity higher than that of peer projects  
The 99 98  purity speaks for itself  This high purity outcome was achieved with little filtration and no further processing  Yes  our Rose Lithium Tantalum project has high purity lithium  but it s important to also understand that purity is not the only specification to look at  The amount and mix of impurities is also a key component in the success of a project  As noted  Rose has very low levels of iron  uranium   thorium 
Can you please comment on the reported recoveries of lithium   tantalum  again in the context of peers  
 If we compare the recoveries achieved during our testing to that of peers  in many cases we are well above them  Our spodumene recovery is around 90  at a grade of 6 4  Li2O and we had a 94  recovery on the carbonation process for Li2CO3  The industry average is around 80  for spodumene and 85  for carbonation  As for tantalum  it s normally a by product with industry recoveries of about 45  50   We have achieved recoveries averaging 77 6   So bottom line  we have about 20  25  higher recoveries than anyone in the lithium   tantalum space  
As mentioned  your resource has low uranium  thorium   iron content  We know that low iron is advantageous  what about the low levels of uranium   thorium 
For the electronics   technology markets  end users cannot tolerate radioactive material  Very low levels of uranium   thorium in a tantalum rich carbonate is the exception  not the rule  This is a key differentiating factor in our favor 
Low iron content is not merely an advantage  it s a pre requisite in enabling us to sell spodumene concentrate into the Glass   Ceramic sectors  This activity could possibly generate early cash flow to help fund subsequent stages of our ramp up  Regarding uranium   thorium  several tantalum projects in west Africa that have been stopped due to higher levels of these contaminants 
Do you have any final thoughts to share with readers 
In a nutshell  our company has received multiple confirmations that our lithium resources are top tier quality  with the best metallurgy  As per our PEA  the Rose Lithium Tantalum project carries strong economics with ample in place infrastructure  Importantly  we have a leading  global chemical company as a partner for 100  off take on all of our products  There are a number of catalysts to watch for next year  I believe that Critical Elements Corp  has a very attractive valuation  or EV  of just  20 million  So we are very enthusiastic about 2016 
Thank you for your time Jean S bastien  An interesting story  in one of the very few metals minerals sectors to show a pulse

121787,343302,FMC,Should You Add Coal to Your Portfolio ,opinion,"There is no denial that the stricter regulatory measures to control pollution will have an adverse impact on the unrestricted use of steam coal for power production  Having said that  coal still holds an advantageous position due to its wide availability and lower cost compared to other fossil fuels and renewable sources of energy  Importantly  the Congress resulting from the recent mid term elections is expected to be a lot more sympathetic to the industry than it had been previously 
Per a report from World Coal Association  we currently have 860 billion tons of proven coal reserves worldwide  This means that there is enough coal to last nearly 118 years at current rates of production  In comparison to this  proven oil and gas reserves are equivalent to around 46 and 59 years  respectively  at current production levels  Proven reserves are considered economically recoverable at any given time  taking into account available mining technology and costs  So  as per the above data  the current availability of coal outpaces the combined oil and gas proven reserves  Per a U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  report  coal production in the first nine months of 2014 was 742 million short tons  MMst   down 0 4  from the year ago period  However  EIA projects fourth quarter U S  production to improve and overall 2014 production to go up 1 4  in 2014 to 998 MMst  Production is further expected to increase 0 4  year over year to 1 002 MMst in 2015  What keeps the coal industry rolling amid rising competition from other fuel sources and a stringent regulatory climate  We have tried to address these factors below Coal Dominates U S  Power Generation  Coal as a major source of generating fuel dominates the utility industry  Coal is used to generate near about 40  of the electricity consumed in the U S  Electricity generation absorbs about 93  of total U S  coal consumption  The reason is simple  coal is by far the least expensive and most abundant fossil fuel in the country  The worst of the regulatory overhang is likely behind us as well  particularly following the mid term elections Not Just Electric Generation  Electricity generation is just one use of coal in the U S  Manufacturing plants and industries use coal to make chemicals  cement  paper  ceramics and metal products  to name a few  Methanol and ethylene  which can be made from coal gas  are used to make products such as plastics  medicines  fertilizers and tar  Certain industries consume large amounts of coal  For example  concrete and paper companies burn coal  and the steel industry uses coke and coal by products to make steel for bridges  buildings and automobiles  Recently  Westmoreland Coal Company  NASDAQ WLB  signed a long term coal supply agreement with diversified chemical company FMC Corporation  FMC   The new deal terminates two old contracts and extends the fresh one through 2026 Coal as an Input for Steel Industry  Due to its heat producing feature  hard coal  metallurgical or coking coal  forms a key ingredient in the production of steel  Nearly 70  of global steel production depends on coal There is some good news from the World Steel Association as it predicts global steel usage to increase 2  year over year to 1 562 metric ton  Mt  in 2014 and by another 2  in 2015 to reach 1 594 Mt  Since met coal is an essential ingredient for the production of steel  U S  met coal producers like Walter Energy  NYSE WLT  and Alpha Natural Resources Inc   NYSE ANR  could benefit from this revival Demand Upsurge in Asian Countries  The increase in coal demand in Asian economies like China and India has been a key price driver since the end of the U S  recession in 2009  We expect this trend to continue in the future mainly due to the growing energy needs in India  China and South Korea  Of the Asian countries  economic growth in China and India will be the fastest  These two countries do produce coal  but their domestic coal production has yet to match the growing demand  resulting in the continuous need to import  These two countries rely heavily on coal for electricity generation  Japan is also importing large volumes of coal following the deactivation of its nuclear power plants  Given the rising demand from the fast growing Asian economies  companies find it attractive to export coal to these regions  Peabody Energy  NYSE BTU  in a bid to access the Asian coal markets had acquired Macarthur Coal of Australia in 2011  Australia is a developed country with huge resources and is strategically located closer to the Asian nations  Peabody is also extending its operations to Thailand  the world s largest supplier of sea borne thermal coal and located nearer to the Asian demand centers To Sum Up Hence black diamond hasn t seen its last days yet and is continuing to lend support to the industry  For the aggressively growing and energy hungry Asian economies  coal seems to be the popular source of power generation though renewables are increasingly making inroads  As per a report from International Energy Agency  total global coal fired generation units at the end of 2012 was 1 627 GW  Gross installation of coal fired units worldwide is expected to increase by 1 112 GW at the end of 2035  A major portion of these additions will be in India and China  So there will be no waning in coal demand for the next couple of decades in spite of increasing greening   Check out our latest Coal Industry Outlook for more details from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this sector from now onwards ",2014-11-16,Zacks Investment
