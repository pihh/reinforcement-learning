2488,224003,CRZO,Can Value Investors Consider Carrizo Oil   Gas  CRZO  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc    NASDAQ CRZO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Carrizo Oil   Gas has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 3 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 26  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Carrizo Oil   Gas s current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 22 06 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares favorably with the Oils Energy Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 59  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  Carrizo Oil   Gas has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 3 42  which is slightly higher than the current level  So  so it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Carrizo Oil   Gas has a P S ratio of just 0 74  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 22x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Carrizo Oil   Gas currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Carrizo Oil   Gas a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Carrizo Oil   Gas is 0 13  a level that is lower than the industry average of 0 86  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Carrizo Oil   Gas might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives CRZO a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  While the current quarter estimate has seen no upward or downward movements  the current year estimate has seen one upward and no downward movements over the past two months This has had a positive effect on the consensus estimate  While the current quarter consensus estimate has shot up 1 4  over the past two months  the current year estimate has dipped 4 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc  Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCarrizo Oil   Gas is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Besides a sluggish industry rank  among Bottom 37  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for Zacks rank  industry rank and analyst sentiments to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Free  Zacks  Single Best Stock Set to DoubleToday you are invited to download our just released Special Report that reveals 5 stocks with the most potential to gain  100  or more in 2020  From those 5  Zacks Director of Research  Sheraz Mian hand picks one to have the most explosive upside of all This pioneering tech ticker had soared to all time highs and then subsided to a price that is irresistible  Now a pending

2625,224140,CRZO,4 Oil Stocks That Had Massive Earnings Surprises In 2017,opinion,"It has been a wild ride for the energy market in 2017  setting pulses racing for even the steadiest of investors  Just a few months ago  or until September  the commodity had a very difficult year  In June  U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  fell to nearly  42 a barrel    the lowest in ten months  Since then  the contract has risen about 37   In fact  WTI hit a more than two year high of around  59 recently  Unlike other short lived rallies over the past three years  we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals  Declining inventories and the extension of OPEC led supply cuts until the end of 2018 are the two major factors helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend  Production Cut Deal ExtensionOne of the significant reasons why the U S  oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output cut deal beyond March  True to predictions  the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018  The agreement  now renewed twice  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day  or 2  of global supply  off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut  While there are several question marks over the degree to which the cartel members are adhering to their quotas  there s no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances  Sharp Inventory DrawdownsInvestors have pinned hopes of recovery over the U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles   pointing to a slowdown in shale output  Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 27 of the last 35 weeks and are down more than 85 million barrels since April  The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 448 1 million barrels  current crude supplies are 7 8  below the year ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year  Falling Capital Expenditure Also Comes to the RescueThroughout the downturn  producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques and extracting favorable terms from the beleaguered service producers  With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to thrive even at lower prices  Moreover  slashing investments  in existing and new wells  have led to numerous project cancellations and production losses    another step in reducing the glut of crude  Concerns Remain Despite OptimismCurrently at around  57 a barrel  the price of oil has more than doubled from the multi year lows of early last year and it s a whole new ballgame for investors who are now the most optimistic on the commodity than at any time in the past three years  They believe that the OPEC and Russian agreement will help whittle down huge global stockpiles and lead to even higher prices in the near term  But with U S  drillers ramping up their output quickly in response to the OPEC driven rally and rising rig count pointing to further rise in American production  the tightening of global oil market might get undermined and prices could again come under pressure  The steady trend of rising domestic oil production continues to be the biggest headwind for the market  As per the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release  U S  output rose by 25 000 barrels per day  for the week ending Dec 1  to 9 7 million barrels per day   the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983  Earnings PowerIn the midst of such uncertainty  earnings performance has emerged as a decisive factor behind a stock s performance  Speculations regarding earnings beat or miss have become a fundamental concern for investors that can either cheer or upset to the point of a hasty sell off  Considered Wall Street s dirty little secret  the formidable importance of earnings surprises can just not be ignored  whether you like it or not  But from a broader perspective  it is the analysts  consensus about the inherent strength of companies  coupled with their earnings performance  which should be closely followed for gaining better understanding about how to boost one s portfolio  Specifically  a history of positive earnings surprise generally works as a catalyst in sending a stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass the estimates  So  investors take it in their consideration while betting on the stock with the expectation that the company will do the same trick to outpace the estimates in the upcoming release  4 Stocks that Posted Huge Surprises We have zeroed in on four stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   and have recorded EPS

the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP    ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP    Northern Oil and Gas  Inc    NYSE NOG   and Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc    NASDAQ CRZO   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  4 Oil Stocks with Massive Earnings Surprises in 2017It has been a wild ride for the energy market in 2017  setting pulses racing for even the steadiest of investors Just a few months ago  or until September  the commodity had a very difficult year  In June  U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  fell to nearly  42 a barrel    the lowest in ten months  Since then  the contract has risen about 37   In fact  WTI hit a more than two year high of around  59 recently Unlike other short lived rallies over the past three years  we believe the current higher oil prices are a result of improving fundamentals  Declining inventories and the extension of OPEC led supply cuts until the end of 2018 are the two major factors helping to balance the market and support the strong uptrend Production Cut Deal ExtensionOne of the significant reasons why the U S  oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output cut deal beyond March  True to predictions  the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018 The agreement  now renewed twice  keeps 1 8 million barrels a day  or 2  of global supply  off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut  While there are several question marks over the degree to which the cartel members are adhering to their quotas  there s no ignoring the fact that the cuts continue to narrow the market imbalances Sharp Inventory DrawdownsInvestors have pinned hopes of recovery over the U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles   pointing to a slowdown in shale output  Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 27 of the last 35 weeks and are down more than 85 million barrels since April The gradual fall has helped the U S  crude market shift from year over year storage surplus to a deficit  At 448 1 million barrels  current crude supplies are 7 8  below the year ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year Falling Capital Expenditure Also Comes to the RescueThroughout the downturn  producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques and extracting favorable

2634,224149,CRZO,5 Incredible Top Ranked Stocks Under  20 On Sale,opinion,The Wall Street has made an impressive comeback after two weeks of violent sell off  which sent the major indices to correction territory  The positive trend is likely to continue in the months ahead  given the global economic growth  solid corporate earnings  and optimism around the new tax legislation  However  volatility and uncertainty will continue to show up  denting investors  confidence from time to time In such a scenario  most investors want to remain invested in the equity world but may not be able to afford large stakes in valuable companies with higher priced stocks  For them  low priced stocks could be attractive as these will enable them to buy more number of shares instead of just a handful of higher priced stocks for the same amount  For example  an investor willing to spend  10 000 can either purchase at least 500 shares of a stock trading under  20 or only 100 shares of a stock trading at  100 Additionally  stocks under  20 reap huge profits as an increase of as less as a dollar in share price adds 5  to the portfolio  This is in contrast to stocks priced at  100 or above  which see 1  or lower gains if share prices move up by  1  Further  most of the low priced stocks have high levels of liquidity that give these stocks an added advantage  This means that cash can be converted quickly and investors could easily get their money out of the securities In fact  trading in higher average daily volumes keeps the bid ask spread tight and does not lead to extra cost for the investor Moreover  given the chances of intermittent volatility  it is prudent to look for value and cheap plays along with low priced stocks  We recommend stocks under  20 that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  and average trading volume of at least 1 million shares as excellent picks  Adding some flavors of value and growth could make them highly appreciable  So  we have refined the search by using our  to locate stocks with below industry P E ratio and double digit earnings growth for the current year Here are five incredible stocks that are both cheap and liquid and can lead to huge gains Carrizo Oil   Gas Inc    NASDAQ CRZO  This Texas based energy company is engaged in the exploration  development  exploitation and production of oil and natural gas  primarily in proven trends in the Barnett Shale area in North Texas and along the Texas and Louisiana onshore Gulf Coast regions Last Closing Price   18 56Zacks Rank   1Average Volume  in shares   3 19 millionMarket Cap   1 54 BillionP E  6 07 vs industry average of 17 19This Fiscal Year Earnings Growth  115 56 You can see  Sally Beauty Holdings Inc    NYSE SBH  This Texas based company is an international specialty retailer and distributor of professional beauty products supplier Last Closing Price   17 20Zacks Rank   1Average Volume  in shares   2 91 millionMarket Cap   2 12 BillionP E  7 25 vs 13 85This Fiscal Year Earnings Growth  31 67 OM Asset Management plc   NYSE OMAM  This Massachusetts based multi boutique asset management company provides its services to individuals and institutions Last Closing Price   15 78Zacks Rank   2Average Volume  in shares   1 01 millionMarket Cap   1 78 BillionP E  8 13 vs 11 76This Fiscal Year Earnings Growth  19 75 Graphic Packaging Holding Company   NYSE GPK  This Georgia based company is a leading provider of paperboard packaging solutions for a wide variety of products to food  beverage and other consumer products companies Last Closing Price   15 15Zacks Rank   2Average Volume  in shares   3 90 millionMarket Cap   4 73 BillionP E  16 20 vs 16 37This Fiscal Year Earnings Growth  53 97 Keane Group Inc    NYSE FRAC  This Texas based company is a provider of integrated well completion services primarily in the United Stated and focuses on complex  technically demanding completion solutions Last Closing Price   15 01Zacks Rank   1Average Volume  in shares   1 85 millionMarket Cap   1 76 billionP E  11 33 vs 17 29This Fiscal Year Earnings Growth  533 3 Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio Earlier this month  credit bureau Equifax  NYSE EFX  announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans  The cybersecurity industry is expanding quickly in response to this and similar events  But some stocks are better investments than others  Zacks has just released Cybersecurity  An Investor s Guide to help Zacks com readers make the most of the  170 billion per year investment opportunity created by hackers and other threats  It reveals 4 stocks worth looking into right away ,2018-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-incredible-topranked-stocks-under-20-on-sale-200292224,200292224

2649,224164,CRZO,Should Value Investors Pick Carrizo Oil   Gas  CRZO  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc    NASDAQ CRZO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Carrizo Oil   Gas has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 64  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 26  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Carrizo Oil   Gas  current PE ratio much below its midpoint  which is 28 10  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Oils Energy sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 34 97  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Carrizo Oil   Gas has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 05  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Carrizo Oil   Gas has a P S ratio of about 1 99  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 14 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Carrizo Oil   Gas currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CRZO a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Carrizo Oil   Gas is just 0 70  a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 0 78  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  CRZO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Carrizo Oil   Gas might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives CRZO a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and four downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has not witnessed any earnings momentum in the past two months  while the full year estimate has fallen by about 4 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCarrizo Oil   Gas is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 26  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Oil and Gas   Exploration and Production   United States sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles

We have seen some action in both the 34 50 and 33 strikes in XOP December puts  reflective of caution in the sector as this ETF has recently found support on its 200 day MA in the past couple sessions  XOP rallied nicely from the very end of October until mid November where it staggered a bit  bringing it to present levels 
We note that the fund would still have to rally about 28  to get to its 52 week high of 44 97 even though most of November has provided a decent relief rally in the sector 
Year to date XOP has attracted very modest inflows to the tune of about  43 million in spite of seeing more than  125 million leave the doors via redemption pressure in the month of November alone  We have covered XOP frequently in this piece because when options players get involved in this sector  they generally choose XOP options to enact their hedges and or directional plays  which likely has contributed to the fund s asset base being far and above the next largest competitor in the sector  which is the  389 million IEO  iShares U S  Oil   Gas Exploration   Production  Expense Ratio 0 44   
The next biggest non levered play in this space only has  50 7 million in assets under management and it is PXE  PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration   Production  Expense Ratio 0 80    Given the recent downside put interest in XOP we are also closely watching the  41 5 million DRIP  Direxion Daily S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production Bear 3X  Expense Ratio 1 10    which in spite of its moderate asset size  trades good daily volume thanks to the historical volatility and trading opportunities that seem to be present in the Oil   Gas Exploration space  1 1 million shares traded on a trailing one month basis  
Its sister ETF  the bull levered GUSH  Direxion Daily S P Oil   Gas Exploration   Production Bull 3X  Expense Ratio 1 07   is substantially larger in size with  117 million in AUM  but it trades roughly the same number of shares on a trailing one month basis  1 09 million shares daily  
XOP  as we have mentioned before employs a modified equal weighted methodology and GUSH and DRIP of course follow the same underlying index  only they employ daily long and short leverage respectively  Top holdings in XOP presently are  1  CRZO  2 85    2  SM  2 54    3  HFC  2 36    4  WLL  2 35   and 5  OAS  2 32

2653,224168,CRZO,Is Carrizo Oil   Gas  CRZO  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc    NASDAQ CRZO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Carrizo Oil   Gas has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 8  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Carrizo Oil   Gas  current PE ratio below its midpoint  which is 27  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares highly favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 200 2  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Carrizo Oil   Gas has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 16 2  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Carrizo Oil   Gas has a P S ratio of 2 3  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Carrizo Oil   Gas currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CRZO a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 4 2  better than the industry average of 6 4  Clearly  CRZO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Carrizo Oil   Gas might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A  This gives CRZO a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and none downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate increased 28 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate moved north by about 15   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc  Price and Consensus   Even though Carrizo Oil   Gas has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCarrizo Oil   Gas is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  Top 34  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  over the past three months  its industry s has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been

2658,224173,CRZO,4 Soaring Energy Stocks That Are Good Buys,opinion,"Following the release of EIA crude inventory numbers and Fed announcement on interest rates  oil prices jumped above the psychologically important  45 per barrel level on Wednesday  West Texas Intermediate crude for Nov delivery gained  1 29  or 2 9   to settle at  45 34 a barrel in electronic trading yesterday 
The Catalysts
The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a surprise drop  As per the federal government s EIA report  oil inventories decreased by a massive 6 2 million barrels for the week ending Sep 16  2016 
 The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go up some 2 8 million barrels  A relatively strong refining activity for this time of year led to the big stockpile drawdown with the world s biggest oil consumer 
Following the third consecutive unexpected weekly inventory decline  the current supplies   at 504 6 million barrels   are at their lowest level in 7 months 
Apart from the bullish government data  oil prices were also supported by the decision by Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates  As widely expected  the U S  central bank opted to leave the current 0 25 0 50 rate unchanged  This led to dollar weakness that made the greenback priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency 
Supportive for Stocks
Yesterday   The Energy Select Sector SPDR  posted a jump of 2 32   outperforming the broad based Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500 index  which gained just 0 90  and 1 09   respectively  All major oil stocks   including mega caps Exxon Mobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   and ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP     relocated in the green with gains of 0 92   1 98  and 2 69   respectively 
A Rare Opportunity to Build a Position in Energy
There are investors who see oil s Wednesday s rally as just the calm before the storm and decide to build or increase their position in oil related companies  However  selecting stocks to buy could be a tricky proposition  especially with oil prices moving like a roller coaster 
However  with the help of our proprietary quantitative model  one can locate stocks with green shoots  In particular  we have shortlisted 4 companies that have gone up an impressive 4  or more yesterday  and have a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   You can see

2664,224179,CRZO,Energy Spending May Resume  Stocks And ETFs In Focus,opinion,"The latest rally in oil prices for the last three months seems to have legs with U S  crude staying above  50 a barrel lately for the first time in about a year  The reversal in the downing trend of oil prices for the last three months came on the back of drawdown of U S  crude stock piles and geo political issues in a key oil producing nation Nigeria 
The rebalancing in the global demand supply scenario is likely to support crude prices ahead  The latest upbeat forecast by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  for oil has given the commodity a fresh lease of life  Goldman upped the price target for crude oil to  45 per barrel for the second quarter and  50 per barrel for the second half of the year from  35 per barrel and  45 per barrel  respectively  as predicted in March  read    
Favorable Demand Supply Balance
Core Laboratories    NYSE CLB   CEO David Demshur sees a net decline of about 2 75 million barrels by the end of this year and greater demand of about 1 2 million In fact  some of the industry experts expect oil to reach  60 by the end of 2016  as per CNBC 
As per The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   U S  crude output will decline by  8 6 million bpd  and by 410 000 bpd to 8 19 million bpd in 2017  On the other hand  EIA upped the projection for U S  oil demand growth for this year 
Trend of Budget Cut Over 
So far  the plunge in prices has wrecked havoc on the global energy market forcing several companies to reduce capital expenditure or shelve projects  But now this sluggish trend seems to be easing  read    
Expecting a meaningful recovery in industry fundamentals  two industry chief executives recently indicated that crude prices will go on rising this year and some oil companies may resume capital expenditures  as per  
However  these industry experts noted that several U S  exploration and production companies are now short of money  So  even if capital expenditure is resumed  it would be by a handful of companies only  Investors should not expect a broad based activity

2666,224181,CRZO,5 Growth Stocks Poised For Huge Earnings Beats ,opinion,"In the world of equities  earnings have come to mean  the bottom line  both literally and figuratively  and for good reason  A company s earnings performance is probably the leading factor influencing its stock price  Little wonder  then  that the investment community is thoroughly smitten with this quarterly released number 
The Climate This Season
We have seen four back to back quarters of earnings declines for the S P 500 index  and the earnings season just around the corner is not expected to reverse this gloomy trend 
By all accounts  Wall Street is anticipating yet another quarter of bleak earnings reports and less than rosy company outlooks  The usual suspects  a strong greenback and a capricious energy market  though less formidable  still linger as headwinds 
Moreover  we are still following the negative estimate revision trend that has been prevalent for quite some time now  What s even more concerning is the fact that the downward revisions have been quite broad based  i e  they are not just a carryover of Energy sector issues 
An Inflection Point 
However  if we dig a little deeper  we will see that the magnitude of revisions this quarter has been notably less than the previous few quarters  That is reason enough to celebrate 
Also  many analysts believe that the Q2 earnings season will prove to be the inflection point for corporate earnings trend  That is  the corporate growth picture will begin to improve from Q3 onwards  and eventually turn positive in the second half of the year 
Like always  there will be plenty of companies overcoming odds and emerging as winners this season 
The Crystal Ball
You must have noticed how some stocks skyrocket after the earnings results while others fall off a cliff  Ever wondered if there is a way to identify potential outperformers before they report 
Studies indicate that on an average  positive earnings surprises drive strong returns in share prices for several weeks following the report  This is what we call the post earnings announcement drift 
At Zacks  we have developed   This system leverages the Zacks Rank  along with what we call Expected Surprise Prediction  or   When a stock has a good Zacks Rank  as well as a positive Earnings ESP  there is a very high chance of the company beating estimates in its next earnings report 
Not Just Dollar Minting
To make sure that our chosen stocks have the heat to march on with their growth stories even after the earnings fire has died down  we have added a Growth Style Score of  A  to our screen using our   Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from the company s financial statements to achieve a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth 
We thus integrated our time tested Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP methodology  ensuring that only those stocks that have good earnings beat history gets through  Moreover  these stocks have strong growth prospects compared to their peers

2667,224182,CRZO,What Awaits Hercules Offshore  HEROQ  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Oil and gas drilling contractor Hercules Offshore Inc   is expected to release its second quarter 2016 results on Thursday  Aug 4 
In the preceding three month period  the Houston  TX based offshore specialist delivered a positive earnings surprise of 35 71  despite the challenges that a steep drop in oil price tagged along  This was primarily owing to strong cost control measures 
As far as the earnings surprise history is concerned  the company has a mixed record  its beaten estimates in 2 of the last four quarters with an average beat of 16 87  HERCULES OFFSHR Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
Unlike the previous few quarters  second quarter 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with crude advancing more than 26  sequentially    the best quarterly percentage gain in seven years  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures during the Apr Jun 2016 period hovered mostly between  40 and  50 per barrel 
Therefore  producers are likely to revive spending on drilling activities that would spur rig count  This  in turn  will result in improved demand for oilfield equipments  thereby driving Hercules Offshore s revenues  earnings and cash flow 
Moreover  to a large extent  Hercules Offshore s successful cost reduction initiatives are expected to cushion the results 
However  despite oil s massive recovery since February  it s still under  50   about half the level of two years ago   and far below the breakeven price for many energy companies  In particular  deepwater ultra deepwater drilling   with its associated risks and steep costs   require a far higher oil price than what is prevailing currently   As a result  the struggling Hercules Offshore   that filed for bankruptcy last month for the second time   is expected to bear the brunt of narrow margins and a competitive price environment 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hercules Offshore will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at a loss of  2 06 
Zacks Rank  Hercules Offshore has a Zacks Rank  2  Though a Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Hercules Offshore  here are some energy players you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter

2670,224185,CRZO,5 Oil Stocks To Buy Even As OPEC  IEA Foresee Crude Glut,opinion,There seems to be no end to the debate on how long the crude market will remain oversupplied  One easy way to fix this problem is a production cut by the major oil producing nations  who are perennially at loggerheads  Their main lookout should be finding ways to restore oil price instead of means to fill up their own pockets  But in practice  this seems almost impossible as each major player is trying to kick others out of the market by pushing oil prices down to the pits To add fuel to the concern  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  and The International Energy Agency  IEA  in their recent reports projected an oversupplied oil market through 2017  Hence  there is no respite to the situation at least in the near term Why Crude Will Remain Oversupplied Since the middle of 2014  the market is witnessing weakness in commodity prices following an oversupplied oil market  Now  many investors might think that oil has recovered sufficiently from the mid February 2016 lows but if we take a closer look  the commodity is still way below the mark it was trading at before mid 2014 Whether big oil producers should restrain output is a question that seems to have found a permanent place on the hot seat  But such a theory can never be put to practice as oil players will continue to compete for market share  keeping the oil weakness behind It seems that this oversupplied market will remain intact till 2017 as per the comments given by OPEC  which controls more than a third of the global oil supply  and IEA which is the energy monitoring body of 28 industrialized countries  Following the comments  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  nosedived more than 3  to  44 90 per barrel OPEC Predicts Oversupplied Oil Market  According to the cartel  non OPEC players that include the U S   Russia and Norway will go on producing 190 000 barrels a day more oil than anticipated this year  On top of that  next year  production from non OPEC members will only grow following the start up of Kazakhstan s Kashagan oilfield and the comeback of shale producers in the oil patch  OPEC added that even if its oil output remains steady  its 2017 crude supply will outpace demand by 760 000 barrels a day These predictions show that OPEC might not agree to limit oil output when they meet in Algeria from Sep 26 to 28  In other words  when OPEC rivals are projected to produce more than expected  the only way for the cartel to compete for market share is to go on producing IEA Predicts Oversupplied Crude Market  The Paris based agency in its recent monthly report said that it has lowered the forecast of global oil demand by 100 000 barrels a day for 2016 and 200 000 barrels a day for 2017  IEA added that at least till the first half of 2017 the market will remain oversupplied Which Energy Company to Buy Definitely the price of oil determines the fate of oil energy players  With the expect glut  commodity prices will remain soft and the bearish trend will prevail  Of course  this does not favour upstream and integrated energy players like Halliburton Co    NYSE HAL    Schlumberger Ltd    NYSE SLB    Weatherford International plc   NYSE WFT    Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc    NYSE DO    Transocean Ltd    NYSE RIG   and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  since their

2672,224187,CRZO,Low Oil Prices  Slams Brakes  On North Dakota Production,opinion,"As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s crude output remained essentially flat in Jul after dropping to more than two year lows in the previous month  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in Jul was 1 029 507 barrels a day  up slightly  by 2 376 barrels a day  from Jun 
Despite the Small Increase  Production Remains Sluggish
Notwithstanding the miniscule increase  the newest numbers confirm the slowdown in volumes extracted from North Dakota  centered on the Bakken Shale formation  Churning out as high as 1 227 483 barrels day in Dec 2014  the current production statistics highlight oil s horror show that has seen prices come down from  110 per barrel in mid 2014 to around  45 now  in between falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb 
The commodity s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins Oils Energy Sector Price Index

Rig Count Still a Shadow of the Oil Boom Times
Just 31 drilling rigs were active in the state in Jul  down considerably from the year ago number of 73 and a far cry from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 rigs drilling 
What s more  economic hardship forced producers like Continental Resources Inc    NYSE CLR    EOG Resources Inc    NYSE EOG    Hess Corp    NYSE HES    Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO    QEP Resources Inc    NYSE QEP    SM Energy Co    NYSE SM   to put 1 472 wells on inactive status 
Buying any of the aforementioned stocks at this time would present significant risks  But in case you are looking for energy names for your portfolio  one could opt for Carrizo Oil   Gas Inc    NASDAQ CRZO    It has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
No Quick Resurgence in Sight
As one can conclude from the above discussion  the small improvement in North Dakota s Jul production does not mean much with the oil bust now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2017  In fact  with Jul production levels barely above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark  there are chances that output in the second largest oil producing state after Texas could fall below that figure before the end of 2016 if prices remain under  50 a barrel

2687,224202,CRZO,Too much oil  Texas boom outpaces supply  transport networks,news,"By Liz Hampton  Devika Krishna Kumar and Jarrett Renshaw MIDLAND  Texas  Reuters    The west Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution have overwhelmed the region s infrastructure with oil production  driving up costs  depressing regional oil prices and slowing the pace of growth  The U S  government continues to forecast the country s oil output rising to fresh record  But competition for limited resources in Texas is making it harder for shale producers to turn a profit and encouraging some to invest elsewhere  Texas is home to the Permian Basin  the largest U S  oil field and the center of the country s shale industry  In the past three years  production from the Permian has risen a whopping 1 5 million barrels per day  bpd  to 3 43 million bpd  All that oil means pipelines from the shale patch are full  so producers are paying more to transport oil on trucks and rail cars  Shortages of labor  water and even the fuel used in fracking are driving up production costs  At the same time  Permian producers are getting less for their oil  which in August traded as much as  17 a barrel below the U S  crude benchmark  Sellers have to offer the discount to compensate for the higher transport costs   We re our own worst enemy   said Ross Craft  chief executive of Approach Resources  a small west Texas oil producer which last year averaged about 11 600 barrels of oil equivalent daily output   We can drill  bring these wells on so quickly that we basically outpace the market  It is going to take a little bit of time   he said  for the infrastructure to catch up to producers  Approach Resources is leaving some wells uncompleted  That means the firm drills the wells  but does not fracture the rock to produce the oil  Other shale producers are also leaving the oil in the ground  waiting for higher prices to make the drilling more profitable  The number of uncompleted wells in the Permian jumped by 80 percent to 3 630 in August compared with a year earlier  according to U S  Energy Department data  For the rest of the United States  uncompleted wells are up 10 percent from the same period a year ago   Some companies are reducing the scope of their operations in the Permian  ConocoPhillips  N COP  and Carrizo Oil   Gas  O CRZO  each moved a Permian drilling rig to another oilfield  and Conoco idled a second  the companies have said   Noble Energy   N NBL  also has cut back on its well completions and said it is moving some drilling resources to Colorado  Global Drilling Partners  a drilling contractor based in the Woodlands near Houston  was set to drill seven wells with a Permian operator this July  but that has dropped to two wells starting in December due to lack of pipeline takeaway  said John Hopkins  a managing partner at the company    There will be a shift out of West Texas temporarily until they can solve their midstream problems   he said  Companies are looking to boost their drilling in other fields in Texas  Colorado and Oklahoma  he said  Suppliers including sand and rail companies say they are hedging their bets by expanding elsewhere   SHARES FALL ON HIGHER COSTS  LOWER REVENUE The price discount on Permian oil has hurt the share price of shale producers such as  Parsley Energy   N PE   which operates only in the Permian  Parsley delivered an eight fold rise in profits in the second quarter versus a year earlier  and boosted output by 57 percent over the same period  But investors have dumped the stock on concern that plans to increase output by another 5 percent by spending 17 percent more will deliver diminishing returns  Parsley s shares are down about 8 percent since the company reported results on Aug  7  Spending plans in 2018 by 53 independent U S  producers have risen a combined 18 percent over 2017  to  63 2 billion  according to investment firm Cowen   Co   The U S  in August produced a record 11 million bpd and continued investment in the Permian should see the country s total output to hit an average of 11 5 million bpd in 2019   But rising costs and bottlenecks have already slowed the pace of growth  Consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates Permian oil production in 2019 will be 200 000 barrels per day  bpd  less than it could be because of transport constraints  Permian output will be 3 9 million bpd next year  Wood Mackenzie estimates  but could have been 4 1 million bpd if more pipeline space were available   We ve had a more significant increase in costs this year than we would have assumed   Timothy Dove  chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources  one of the largest Permian oil producers  said in August  TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLY SHORTAGES Smaller producers without contracts to use pipelines are getting hurt most because they are forced to use trucks and railcars  Shipping oil by truck to Gulf Coast refinery and export hubs costs  15 to  25 a barrel  compared to  8 to  12 a barrel by rail and less than  4 a barrel by pipeline  according to market sources  The shift is leading to traffic jams on highways and rail crossings in far flung parts of the Permian shale fields  It also means fuel for supply vehicles and fracking equipment can be in short supply locally    Truck traffic is unlike anything we ve ever seen   said James Walter  co CEO of Colgate Energy  a Midland Texas based oil producer  who adds his company has agreements to transport all of its crude and gas production via pipelines  Rail capacity is unlikely to increase because oil producers are reluctant to sign up to long term contracts to lease rail cars  They would prefer to wait for the new pipelines to be built  Planned pipelines out of the Permian will add about 3 million bpd of oil capacity by late 2020  estimates Wood Mackenzie   Rail firms are reluctant to buy new oil railcars without long term contracts    We do think it s a short term situation    Union Pacific   NYSE UNP  Executive Vice President Beth Whited said in July   So we will not invest to support that    Sand suppliers have moved quickly to alleviate one supply shortage by opening new operations  Some 15 sand mines have popped up in the Permian in the past year  creating a  1 2 billion industry almost overnight  consultancy Rystad Energy estimates   These mines sell sand for about  40 a ton  saving producers nearly  90 a ton compared with sand shipped in from other states   
Just as elsewhere in the Permian  however  the increase in activity is inflating costs  Preferred Sands  which has a sand mine in Monahans  Texas  is paying workers there about 30 percent more it does in other markets  said Chief Executive Michael O Neill  prompting the firm to open its next sand mine in Oklahoma instead ",2018-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/too-much-oil-texas-boom-outpaces-supply-transport-networks-1631470,1631470

2696,224211,CRZO,It s Not About Discovering A Mine  It s About Discovering A Technology,opinion,"Michael and Chris Berry are back for The Mining Report s second annual father son interview in honor of Father s Day  While they don t agree on everything  they are aligned on the importance of disruptive discoveries to help companies succeed even in a sideways market  Flexibility and selectivity are their long term strategies in any sector  from precious metals to commodities to rare earths 
The Mining Report  Do you think investing is a skill that is learned or inherited 
Chris Berry  I suppose there s some sort of a gene for analytical ability  but there s no substitute for real world experience  While my father taught at the Darden School at the University of Virginia  I received a good grounding in theory based finance and investing  Being out in the investing world for the last 15 years  I ve seen what works and what doesn t compared to what you read in a textbook  If the last few years have taught us anything  it s that markets aren t as efficient as academic theory would have us believe 
TMR  Mike  when did you first know that Chris had the knack for investing 
Mike Berry  When I realized that Chris was interested in what I was doing  I sent him to see a good friend to talk to him  I wanted to stand back  Chris came back and said this is what he wanted to do  We have all heard Chris say he loves what he does now  If you love what you re doing  you re going to put a lot of effort into it and you will be successful 
I think it s more environmental than genetic  If you re in a family where everybody s reading The Wall Street Journal all the time  it probably comes more naturally 
In 2000  I came up with the idea of discovery as a different kind of investing discipline  Chris and I have worked together now for four years and he s adapted that into the idea of one of disruptive discovery  This is more defining and in the current market a lot more powerful  We reinforce each other s work  It s a really good relationship in that we re in sync and yet we cover different interests in the destructive or disruptive discovery space 
TMR  You recently changed the name of the publication you co edit to Disruptive Discoveries Journal  Which industries are being disrupted by macro forces  and how can investors profit 
CB  A number of macro forces have combined to deliver compelling challenges to the global economy  Globalization has increased trade among countries and benefited many people through higher living standards  The globalization of technology gives a farmer in an emerging market access to the same amount of information that  say  the president of the United States would have had 15 years ago  These two forces are leveling the playing field between East and West  As a result  both challenges and opportunities are presented  This means that as many more people live what I call  commodity intensive  lifestyles  we re starting to see living standards converge  This has been one of the main factors in stagnant real wage growth in the West in the past decade 
However  the confluence of globalization and technology has begun to raise a number of issues for us in the West  One challenge is an excess of labor  Hundreds of millions of people globally are joining the middle class  which is flattening wage growth  China s middle class is forecast to grow by 200 million in the coming decades  Other countries like India  Indonesia and Mexico are experiencing similar phenomena  Greater access to technology  for example free online education through Coursera or edX  has exacerbated this issue by allowing anyone with an Internet connection to learn what a better life can be  This will continue to have far reaching consequences for us in the West as the global labor pool expands and can grow at a relatively lower cost of living  Technology  specifically disruptive technology like online education  is simultaneously our best friend and worst enemy  A number of industries are set to be upended and herein lies the opportunity 
We broadened our reach because to thrive in the commodities markets of the future  investors will have to be much more selective about the sectors  the companies and the commodities they look at 
I look for companies anywhere along the value chain that have a disruptive technology or unfair competitive advantage  Maybe it s a deposit  maybe it s a technology  These companies offer the opportunities in a global economy awash in labor and capacity 
TMR  Mike  which commodities could benefit from today s disruptive technologies 
MB  Oil and natural gas come to mind first  Fertilizers and potable water also will benefit  Mineral exploration and recovery will also be revolutionized with new technology  There will be a revolution in energy use  food production  clean mineral production and  therefore  quality of life here and around the world 
It took a decade for hydraulic fracking to take hold  but now it has almost completely restructured the global geopolitics  In the second quarter of 2014 the U S  produced 8 4 million barrels  8 4 MMbbl  of oil equivalent  the highest in 26 years  By 2016 the U S  will produce 12 MMbbl of oil a day and will become an exporter of natural gas  it s just a matter of time  That s the best  most recent example of a global disruptive discovery 
It s not about discovering a mine  it s about discovering a technology  I talked recently with someone about plasma torch technology for processing minerals  That technology is still very early in its development  and many in the mining industry don t believe in it  but it has the same potential as fracking has had to oil and gas production to change the economics of the mining industry and impact the geopolitics of the world 
TMR  Many of these technologies are costly  You ve said that society needs access to cheap commodities to sustain a high quality of life  Many commodities are now being sold at below the price it takes to produce them  That can t be sustainable  With these new technologies  will prices catch up with the cost of production 
MB  It takes time to perfect these disruptive discoveries  In the Eagle Ford Shale  the cost of producing a barrel of oil is around  40  The best the Saudis can do using traditional finding and recovery technology is  45 or  50 a barrel  New exploration technologies and recovery technologies in mining will dramatically reduce costs  So the answer to your question is yes 
CB  Selling commodities below the cost of production is obviously not sustainable  We ve seen countless companies either mothball mines or abandon projects altogether in recent months  However  every commodity is different and I think it s important to look individually at the distinct supply demand dynamic for each  As an example  lithium and rare earth elements  REE  offer different opportunities  Lumping them together and saying ALL energy metals are bad bets now is patently false 
Take uranium  for example  By some accounts  60  of the uranium being produced today is produced below cost  That can t continue because companies have shareholders who invest based on the capability of management teams to generate profits and cash flow  You can only produce something at a loss for so long before you lose the trust of the markets 
The strategy of major producers Cameco Corp   NYSE CCJ   AREVA SA  PARIS AREVA  and Paladin Energy Ltd   TO PDN  is to cut exploration  cut overhead expenses and put mines on care and maintenance  This makes sense and is the first step in seeing supply and demand begin to equilibrate 
Yet  uranium is a critical component of our energy infrastructure  and it will remain a critical component  despite its challenges 
In an environment where the uranium spot price is  28 pound   28 lb  and the term price is  45 lb  you must find the companies that can exist in low price environments  Right now  that means in situ and near term production plays in the western United States and Kazakhstan  The Athabasca Basin has great grade  but that kind of hard rock isn t economic right now  and won  be until we reach much higher uranium prices 
If you want to invest in uranium right now  I would look at the lowest cost producers in the industry  Another strategy would be investing in hard rock plays that aren t economic now  but will be at higher uranium prices  I have been discussing this theme of optionality frequently 
TMR  What are some of those low cost plays that are preparing for uranium s upside 
CB  Two in situ plays in Wyoming are Uranerz Energy Corp   AMEX URZ  and Ur Energy Inc   AMEX URG   I m still comfortable with them at  28 lb  They each have off take partners in place at higher prices  so their low cost production profiles allow them the flexibility to produce when other companies in the uranium sector are unable to do so 
For the uranium sector to  turn   we need to see deals getting done  I don t necessarily mean mergers and acquisitions  End users like utilities need to come back into the market and establish long term supply deals with uranium producers  We ll know uranium has turned when we start seeing that happen more often 
The same is true of a number of commodities that are traded on a  handshake  basis  I m confident that we re at the bottom of this cycle  although I m not convinced that we re near a turn 
TMR  In last year s father son interview you were sharply divided on the prospect for uranium  Mike  you were adamant that we should be moving to thorium to avoid more Fukushimas  Do you still feel that way 
MB  One of the great things about our relationship is that we don t always agree  or disagree  We go back and forth  It s a very healthy relationship because you can avoid  drinking your own bathwater   We re still divided on uranium long term 
Uranium is not the best nuclear fuel  thorium is  Thorium is more plentiful and easier to store  The burnt material doesn t give off much plutonium  Its byproducts decay faster and are safer 
The problem is that we spent billions of dollars building and retrofitting uranium based nuclear plants  as have the Chinese  We re unlikely to move to thorium anytime soon  We ll probably have green energy before we have thorium reactors  although both China and India are working on them 
As to what Chris said about uranium not being ready for a turn  I agree  I don t see a turn for two to five years  That s why we re looking up the value chain for disruptive discovery investment opportunities in technologies  as well as the natural resource discoveries  In the nuclear space small modular reactors provide a disruptive technology  They are in their very early development stages 
TMR  Chris  let s talk about lithium  Would Tesla Motor Inc  s  NASDAQ TSLA  plans to build a battery Gigafactory disrupt the lithium market in a good way  If so  which junior lithium mining companies could benefit 
CB  It could disrupt a number of commodities  not just lithium  graphite  cobalt and nickel  for example  A lot of raw materials and components go into the typical lithium ion battery  If Elon Musk s plan to produce 500 000 lithium ion batteries by 2020 is half accurate  he will need a lot more of everything  And remember  Tesla isn t the only company in the battery business  LG Chemicals  KS 051910  is one of the world s largest battery producers  Johnson Controls Inc   NYSE JCI    Panasonic Corp   TOKYO 6752   BYD Company Ltd   OTC BYDDF   GS Yuasa Corp   TOKYO 6674  and Hitachi  Ltd   TOKYO 6501  are some of the other players  not to mention the dozens of smaller niche battery producers 
But  yes  with the Gigafactory Tesla wants to build  lithium is front and center  There was a sense of optimism at the recent Industrial Minerals Lithium Supply   Markets Conference  Tesla s pronouncement breathed much needed life into the lithium space  Cobalt and graphite have regained investor interest as well 
If we re looking at additional sources of supply  we need to find low cost producers that can compete in an industry that is really an oligopoly Sociedad Quimica y Minera SA  NYSE SQM   Rockwood Holdings Inc   NYSE ROC   FMC Corp   FMC NYSE  and the Chinese 
I like Lithium Americas Corp   TO LAC   an advanced brine play in South America  Its partner is Korea based POSCO  NYSE PKX   which has spent a great deal of time and money on lithium ion battery research  POSCO s partnership with Lithium Americas is developing a disruptive technology that would rapidly accelerate lithium production from brines from 18 months to a matter of weeks and would also minimize the relatively large environmental footprint associated with brine projects  POSCO will build a pilot plant next to Lithium Americas  Cauchari Olaroz project in Argentina to test this innovative process  If it works  this is a game changer for lithium production 
TMR  Is that partnership new 
CB  No  I think it s been overlooked by the market  Lithium Americas is a well run company with a great asset in a region of the world with history of lithium production  It could be producing a commodity whose demand looks to remain steady and growing  Despite some of the excess in the global economy I spoke about above  lithium has dodged this bullet  Lithium Americas has partnered with one of the more influential multinational companies in the world in the commodity space  It s a really positive story 
Also  as a brief aside  Tesla s recent announcement to not enforce its patents on its Supercharger technology will likely be more revolutionary to the electric vehicle industry in the long run 
TMR  Mike  are you as excited about lithium 
MB  Yes  very much so  although I m skeptical about Tesla s plans for its Gigafactory  Battery technology has not yet found its steady state niche  I am looking for disruptive battery technology today  You can t build a battery factory or a car factory to use all those batteries until you re sure you re at the point of sustainability 
Lithium ion battery technology is clearly important  Whether or not it uses graphite anodes is another issue  It s evolving  We may or may not have the expected demand for lithium and graphite  that s another issue 
I also want to comment on graphene  which is a one atom thick extract from graphite  In my view disruptive graphene technology is coming but it is a decade or two away from serious cash flow generation  It will definitely be a disruptive technology when it develops 
TMR  Which graphite juniors do you like 
CB  Not all graphite is suitable for the battery business  which is where the double digit growth is expected  Synthetic graphic is also a threat to natural in a number of ways  but comes at a higher cost 
We continue to follow Northern Graphite Corporation  TO NGC   The company was an early stage player in the 2011 2012 graphite rush  It has a large deposit of predominately large and jumbo flake  which is one of Northern Graphite s competitive advantages  You can make large or jumbo flake graphite smaller  but you can t make small or fine flake bigger  The company is arguably one of the most derisked graphite plays today as a bankable feasibility study has been published and we have a clear idea of the economics behind the company s plans 
Flinders Resources Ltd   TO FDR  in Sweden is another interesting near term production story  The company s proximity to manufacturing capacity in Europe means potentially low production and transportation costs and a local customer base  This mine was a past producer  so a client list ostensibly still exists  Also  the extraordinarily low capital expenditure figure  sub  20M  puts Flinders in the driver s seat to become the next graphite producer outside of China 
TMR  You ve emphasized that not all critical metals are alike  There has been lots of volatility among the REEs  Could China s recent announcement of its plan to tax REE producers and require environmental protections be good for non Chinese companies 
CB  I hate to sound cynical  but probably not  Every quarter  China makes an announcement about how it s going to change this or that  I don t expect the pronouncements out of China to benefit non Chinese REE exploration and development plays in the near term  Remember  this entire supply chain from mining to manufacture now takes place almost exclusively in China  This has been in place for years and we can t expect to change this overnight  Trying to use rulings from entities like the World Trade Organization to get China to dismantle its supply chain in the name of  fairness  is a wrong headed strategy  Both the private and public sectors in Western economies need to garner the political and economic will to comprise a strategy that can compete with a dominant low cost Chinese production scenario 
I have a five year view on the REE space outside of China  That is how long I anticipate it will take an REE junior to achieve commercial production 
We all know the challenges Molycorp Inc   NYSE MCP  and Lynas Corp   ASX LYC  have encountered  I think it s important to ask a company if it will be able to produce a product that the market wants  Also important is will it be able to do so economically  There are  of course  many other issues to consider including mineralogy  but at the end of the day economics matters most 
An investor has to be very patient and have a long window to make money in the REE junior space 
TMR  Mike  do you agree 
MB  I certainly agree that the U S  has given up on supply chain development  It takes billions of dollars and lots of time to build a workable and economic supply chain  The Chinese have worked pretty hard at that  They made mistakes  but they learned how to do it  We need to be focused downstream  as well as upstream 
In 2011  my wife and I went out to see Molycorp on site  I knew as soon as we got there that it would not be a good trip  Everyone was focused on the mining and not on the entire value chain  It s not clear that Molycorp can make it 
TMR  Which juniors could make it 
CB  Using that five year window  I d say Tasman Metals Ltd   AMEX TAS  has a really good chance  Its deposit is in Sweden  a mining friendly jurisdiction  Its European location and proximity to a number of technology and automotive manufacturers are advantages  I visited the project a year ago and Tasman continues to derisk its profile  My sense is that  if there was a rare earth company out there that has a good shot at an offtake or a strategic agreement in the near term  it s Tasman 
Namibia Rare Earths Inc   TO NRE  is also on my radar  We don t know a lot about the economics yet  but if an investor is patient and willing to take some risk  it is worth considering 
Namibia has an attractive deposit and is an earlier stage play that surprised a lot of people with some of its metallurgical results  The company s ability to produce a xenotime concentrate and potential catalysts from a preliminary economic assessment that is now underway and metallurgical optimization are all differentiators  There s a lot to learn here  but a lot of potential upside as well 
TMR  Mike  you brought up the disruptive technology of shale fracking  I recently interviewed T  Boone Pickens  who is very optimistic about the shale fracking industry and its potential impact on the U S  economy  What do you think is the best way to get exposure to that sector  Is it the juniors or the majors that might take over the juniors  Is it the services or the refineries 
MB  I get my exposure through royalty investments  What I like about the royalty play is that you end up buying the property and leasing it back to  Star Wars  producers like EOG Resources Inc   NYSE EOG   which have the expertise at finding and lifting  Depending upon the type of royalty  you get the first 20 25  of the oil that comes out of the ground and you get it every month  You have no drilling or environmental risk  In today s low yield market everyone should be seeking out royalty investments 
I think you can make money with investments like EOG and Penn Virginia Corp   NYSE PVA   Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   NYSE FCX  just moved into offshore oil area pretty heavily  Encana Corp   NYSE ECA  of Calgary just came down and invested in the Eagle Ford play  When the Canadians come to the play you know it must be considered good  Some other names of smaller operators that are interesting are Carrizo Oil   Gas Inc   NASDAQ CRZO   Contango Oil   Gas Co   AMEX MCF  and Chesapeake Energy Corp   NYSE CHK   EOG is perhaps the best of the disruptive discovery operators in the fracking business 
The Railroad Commission of Texas tells us that in the core areas of the Eagle Ford shale these fracked wells average 500 000 barrels of oil equivalent that can produce an economic life for up to 50 years  The first five years of production is especially good and yield about 40  of the total  Given that there s no dividend yield in the market today  the best bet in my opinion is investing in a royalty stream 
TMR  Mike  you re going to give your biannual talk to the Federal Reserve on the economy next week  What will you say 
MB  The overriding issue now is the battle among the central banks of the world trying to generate inflation  escape velocity growth and avoid deflation or shrinking of the money supply and their own economies 
I think the world is much more disinflationary or perhaps deflationary than it has been since the Great Depression  The Fed is printing a lot of money  Yes  it s tapering its quantitative easing  but the real money supply in the real economy is not growing  The Fed s money supply is  The Fed has  4 5 trillion of bonds in its portfolio  The real question now is   How does the Fed raise interest rates without imploding the economy  
The European Central Bank recently said it was worried about deflation  It instituted a  100 billion program to buy bonds and make loans  So the ECB is now embarking on its own quantitative easing program 
We don t have an economy of robust  sustainable growth  Since 1970 GDP growth has averaged 3 4  coming out of recessions  Here we are 70 months down the road and we can barely sustain 2  growth  Without escape velocity growth  you cannot deal with the amount of debt that was incurred back in 2000 2008  I m worried that we have three to five years of growth capped by the slow deleveraging process we are in today  That will affect how quickly the capital markets can turn and a new credit cycle evolves to support needed economic growth 
The equity markets are much overvalued  I expect a correction  I think we re facing two to five years of deleveraging  It s not an optimistic presentation in the short term  Longer term  of course  we will recover 
CB  All of that underpins our disruptive discovery thesis  It s not a viable strategy to hide your head in the sand and not participate in these markets  Rather  you need to find those opportunities that can provide above average returns in what looks to be a very muted growth profile over the next couple of years  You do this through finding those opportunities that can produce an attractive product either through a disruptive force in their business model or another element  Tesla has done this in the automotive business  Uber  though privately held  has done this in the mass transportation business  Netflix has done this in the streaming video business 
MB  Remember  there are two kinds of deflation  One comes from excess supply and insufficient demand  That is part of what we re facing now  For example  there is lots of supply of iron  aluminum and copper  but the Chinese have scarfed it all up  Who knows when that will come back and hit us on the head  That s bad deflation  excess supply and stagnant demand  Prices fall  expectations are formed and people start to save  because they can buy the washing machine cheaper next month  As a result  growth spirals into a decline 
The other kind of deflation comes from disruptive discovery  That s where new technological discoveries tend to replace labor or at least cap labor s real disposable income  That s happening in the labor market now  It is struggling to maintain growth in real wages and get people back to work 
The U S  announced the creation of 217 000 new jobs in May  equal to the number of jobs lost in 2008  Everybody cheered  The problem is there are 15 million more people in this country than in 2008  We still have tremendous excess and underproductive labor  Labor is not being rewarded  productivity  through new discoveries  is being rewarded 
We have both kinds of deflation right now  and we have to clear them out  I just don t see anyone in Washington  D C   being willing to do what is needed to make that happen 
TMR  A lot of people turn to gold when things are disrupted  The gold price is down from the beginning of the year  What do each of you think of the prospect for gold and silver 
MB  In terms of the real inflation rate  gold is going to be capped  I think it will test  1 200 ounce   1 200 oz   or maybe  1 100 oz  Wall Street is arrayed against gold right now  and the futures market is the tail that wags the dog in both gold and silver  At  1 200 oz  we d be buyers 
A lot of the producers Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM   Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE ABX   Goldcorp Inc   NYSE GG   and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd   NYSE AU  are saying they can produce at  980 oz or  1 000 oz  They ve already written off billions of dollars of reserves that have become uneconomic 
I suppose the good news  although it s not really good news  is that exploration is stopping  This will also be disruptive  It s very difficult to raise money for exploration now  The TSX Venture Exchange will be cannibalized before this is over  There will be very few new gold or silver mines coming on stream  Some of the midtier silver producers will have real problems as silver finds its bottom 
We might have to wait one to three years  but at some point we will run out of mineable gold properties as a result of the demise of exploration companies  I think gold and silver will find the bottom when we start to see marginal costs equal to the price of gold and silver  Then  there will be a bounce 
TMR  Chris  do you agree 
CB  I still maintain that most commodities will go sideways for a while  It is difficult to say how long this will last  but I can t see many macro catalysts at all auguring for explosive demand in the near term  You must find low cost production or disruptive technology stories 
In the precious metals sector  in particular  perception is reality  If you re hearing a lot about disinflation or a lack of inflation  you stop thinking about some of the traditional reasons to buy and hold gold or juniors and producers  That s one of the main reasons they ve been pushed down hard and will probably stay there for a while  The perception is that there is no inflation in the economy and economic growth is now stable  The reality is quite different if you ve been to a grocery store or filled your car with gas recently 
That doesn t mean gold might not explode to the upside based on world events in the short term  We saw what happened to gold when Vladimir Putin started saber rattling and invaded Ukraine  Gold hit  1 380 oz  but fell once things calmed down  We are now seeing a similar phenomenon as Iraq devolves into a civil war  I m unconvinced these singular events can push precious metals prices dramatically higher in the near term 
You want to watch traditional factors such as supply and demand and exchange traded funds inflows or outflows 
It s unfortunate that in the past 10 years  gold and silver have turned into asset classes in and of themselves and we ve forgotten their traditional roles as stores of value and insurance policies against inflation  As a result  we ve seen a lot more volatility with gold and even more with the price of silver 
MB  In my mind  gold and silver have decoupled  Silver has a huge industrial application  gold does not  With a mere 2  growth rate in the world s economy  industrial uses will shrink until we can get to 3 5  GDP growth 
There are a lot of silver investors out there  Some 245 million ounces  245 Moz  of silver coins and bars were purchased  in 2013 76  more than 2012 and triple the silver purchased by investors in 2009  When you add in jewelry and silverware purchases  almost 500 Moz silver were purchased in 2013  That does not include industrial usage  investment only  Last year we incurred a 113 Moz deficit in silver supply 
Two years ago  the silver price averaged  35 oz  today it is  19 oz  Investors must seek companies that can sustain their silver production  They have to be sure that companies can maintain their properties  I think we will find a lot of great silver properties that come free 
We see a lot of private equity players now  They re rolling up properties for pennies on the dollar when they can  Will silver turn  Yes  When will it turn  I don t know  probably a ways off 
TMR  Are there any companies that can position themselves  maybe with some of this disruptive technology  to succeed when the turn happens 
MB  I am an adviser to and own shares of Terraco Gold Corp   TO TEN   Its 35 square mile Moonlight property is immediately north of Midway Gold Corp   AMEX MDW  Barrick s Spring Valley project  Spring Valley has more than 2 1 Moz Measured and Indicated gold and 1 9 Moz Inferred gold  I visited Spring Valley  and this will be a mine 
Todd Hilditch is Terraco s CEO  One thing he did that has been very disruptive  especially to Barrick and Midway from a strategy viewpoint  was buy the royalties on Spring Valley  Thanks to management resourcefulness Terraco holds a 3  net smelter royalty on the majority of the Spring Valley gold resource  We talked about the power and transformative nature of royalty investing in the shale oil fields 
Even management strategy can be disruptive  Terraco has a tremendous advantage over other junior explorers because it can maintain its position and wait for Barrick to develop Spring Valley  Barrick has just dedicated another  14 million   14M  program to Spring Valley after its earn in  Todd Hilditch is the example of the new thinker in the junior mining industry  These new breed CEOs look at different ways of producing wealth  creating wealth  of working with the sell side  And there s no place better than Nevada for gold and silver 
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co   Ltd   TOKYO 5713  just did an earn in deal with Renaissance Gold Inc   TO REN  on its Fourth of July property close to Moonlight  So the area play is heating up and Terraco shareholders should benefit 
Pershing Gold Corp   OTC PGLC  is very close to Moonlight and Spring Valley  It will be producing gold soon  Apparently  its capital expense is very small and it can get into production on their property  Steve Alfers is the CEO  He is very experienced from his days with Franco Nevada Corp   NYSE FNV   Steve runs a tight ship  Pershing appears to have a solid group of investors  This is another company that I like a lot and we own shares in Pershing 
We visited NuLegacy Gold Corporation  TO NUG  when we were last in Nevada  It has a good team  Again  sustainability will be important for NuLegacy  It is another company that is at the top of my list  a list that was much longer two years ago 
TMR  What is the disruptive technology of the plasma torch technology 
MB  A company called U S  Precious Metals Inc   OTC USPR  has a 37 000 acre property in Michoac n  Mexico  parallel to Mexico City  close to the coast  It s in the Tierra Caliente region  It s probably a porphyry deposit copper and gold  but it appears to be very high grade  The company has drilled 26 holes with good results  The company is using Eastern European satellite sensing technology to identify the mineralized areas on the property  Some 71 such anomalies have been identified on a small part of the property  This promises to be a novel and economic way of doing mineral exploration  I visited the property in April and I was amazed at the surface mineralization that shouts out at you  Of course the Spanish mined this property and that s usually a very good omen  The company plans to process two stream beds on the property for placer  which should generate cash flow  U S  Precious Metals has a great property and had done a good job so far of exploring it  The European geologists are on the ground as I write and we are going to know a lot more about tonnage and grade soon on the property 
I am interested in U S  Precious Metals for three reasons  I decided to get involved because this is the vehicle that might just revolutionize the mining industry from exploration to production and recovery 
In addition to its novel exploration approach with satellite technology it has a developed disruptive assay and recovery technology called plasma torch technology  It is using plasma torch technology in its pilot plant in Twentynine Palms  California  Plasma is a 5 000 degree ionization technology that separates minerals at their atomic level  It can process oxides and sulfides and take the gasses off easily  It can provide much higher recoveries and often produces higher assays than fire assay technology  The technology is being developed by Plasma Arc Technologies in conjunction with Dr  Edgar Choueiri of Princeton University  Professor Choueiri is also on the Board of Directors of U S  Precious Metals 
That s a disruptive discovery that really interests me  Plasma Torch technology has been shown to be effective in other applications  It s not particularly new  Airgas just developed a major   400M garbage disposal plant in England using the technology  Once U S  Precious Metals gains mineral extraction expertise  it will be a leader in the field  This will be a similar story to EOG s  Star Wars  lead in hydraulic fracturing technology we discussed earlier in this interview  Plasma Torch technology could drastically increase the amount of recoverable minerals  while reducing all in sustaining cash costs of production  New satellite and ground technology could alter how much drilling we have to do to understand an ore body  One only has to think about the number of dumps around the world that are not recoverable with traditional technology 
I think these could become standard technologies quickly no more than five years 
TMR  Chris  in addition to being a son  you re also a father  which  of course  Mike  makes you a grandfather  Is there an investment in a commodity or a stock that you could make now when your children are young that would be worth enough 20 years from now to pay for their college degree 
CB  I can t think of a single investment or a commodity  You can t control financial markets or the performance of the economy  You have to a have a flexible strategy and a plan in place to weather these storms  Buy and hold is not the only strategy to employ and has been a losing strategy in recent years 
I focus on energy metals and I have a thought process  a timeframe and a strategy for each one of them 
The convergence of lifestyles is a real and credible phenomenon  It s not a parabolic boom  it s slow and steady and it will continue  We think that convergence only happens to the extent that people can live more commodity intensive  more affluent lifestyles  If you re going to invest in the commodity world  whether it s juniors or anywhere along the value chain  you need to have a strategy  a plan and a philosophy that you stick to  but you have to stay flexible enough to adapt when times change  It s not 2006 anymore and you should not be investing as if it is 
The ability to adapt is probably the most important lesson that I hope I can leave to my kids 
TMR  Mike  do you agree 
MB  One of the things Kate and I did was to make sure that we put stocks in trust for the kids  In the discovery sphere  landing on one major discovery I m thinking a world class Pe asquito  which was one of our big early discoveries can make you millions  These also increase wealth for everyone  Not all of them work  but you learn so much from every single discovery opportunity  disruptive or not 
I think it is incumbent upon parents to teach their children to understand implications of disruptive discoveries  In terms of a single investment that will put my grandchildren through college  that s a question I would rephrase  What can I teach my grandchildren to focus on as they approach college and life beyond 
The point I would make is the necessity for disruptive discoveries in food production and healthcare  These are areas that we are heavily involved in  Cancer technologies and therapies  stem cell technology and medical device innovations  as well as nutritional discoveries  are of great interest to both of us   Editor s note  Click here to read Michael Berry s ideas on   
At present we are also interested and involved in fertilizer discovery  Two companies of interest to us are Arianne Phosphate  OTC DRRSF   and Allana Potash Corp   TO AAA  
Arianne has developed a very large and unique phosphate resource in Quebec  The economics here are very compelling and as the major phosphate producers begin to scour the globe to add additional resources  Arianne must be on their radar  The company is greatly derisked in a number of ways and has shown the ability to deliver extremely attractive economics 
Allana has a large potash deposit in Ethiopia  Allana s recent announcement of a strategic alliance with ICL Fertilizers  ICL TASE   one of the largest fertilizer producers in the world  really puts the company in a different league relative to its competitors  ICL entered into a share purchase agreement initially worth  25M and could be worth as much as  84M  An offtake is also in place here  which is another major differentiator  Africa is set to become much more sharply in focus with respect to commodity supply and demand  Investors would be doing themselves a favor by starting to learn about these dynamics

2704,224219,CRZO,Key Energy Earnings For May 4  CRZO  MMP  RDS A,opinion,"As   more and more companies are posting their earnings results  On Tuesday  three big names in the oil industry reported their quarterly earnings before the bell  Let s take a look 
Carrizo Oil   Gas  Inc    NASDAQ CRZO  
The Houston based energy company reported weaker than expected first quarter results  Adjusted earnings per share came to  0 14  excluding  5 34 from non recurring items   missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 15 per share  Revenues of  81 3 million fell way behind the consensus estimate of  117 9 million  Production volumes during the first quarter of 2016 were 3 824 MBoe  or 42 025 Boe d  an increase of 21  versus the year ago period  The year over year production growth was driven by strong results from the Company s Eagle Ford assets 
Magellan Midstream Partners  L P    NYSE MMP  
The oil MLP strong Q1 results  Earnings per unit  EPU  came in at  0 87  excluding mark to market community related pricing adjustments   topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83  Total revenues of  519 8 million beat our consensus estimate of  513 4 million  In its Refined Products segment  quarterly operating profits of  170 9 million was down almost 7  from the year ago quarter  However  the partnership s operating margin from its Crude Oil unit was roughly  100 7 million  up 19  from the prior year quarter 
Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc 
Europe s largest oil company  impressive first quarter results  Earnings per ADR  on a current cost of supplies basis  and excluding one items and gains or losses from inventories  of  0 43  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 26  Revenues of  48 554 billion  however  missed our consensus estimate of  53 165 billion and reflected a 26  year over year decline  Because of the challenging industry environment  as well as following the completion of the  54 billion BG Group  LON BG 
Energy Sector Scorecard  as of 5 4 16 
Including all of this morning s reports  we now have Q1 results from 85 1  of the sector s market capitalization in the S P 500  Total earnings for these Energy sector companies are down  99 6  from the same period last year on  29 2  lower revenues  with 59 3  beating EPS estimates and 48 1  coming ahead of revenue expectations  This is weaker performance than we have seen from the same group of Energy companies in other recent periods 
For the S P 500 as a whole  we now have Q1 results from 374 index members that combined account for 81 3  of the index s total market capitalization  Total earnings for these companies are down  7 5  from the same period last year on  1 9  lower revenues  with 71 4  beating EPS estimates and 56 4  coming ahead of revenue estimates 
Relative to other recent periods  this is weak earnings and revenue growth from these 374 index members  But positive surprises are more numerous relative to other recent periods  both for earnings as well as revenues 
Looking at Q1 as a whole  combining the actual results from the 374 S P 500 members that have reported with estimates for the still to come 116 index members  total earnings are expected to be down  7 1  on  1 1  lower revenues   the 4th quarter in a row of earnings declines for the index

2705,224220,CRZO,Permian drillers begin selling new lighter crude oil grade,news,Oil producers in the Permian Basin reportedly have begun selling a new stream of light crude   WTI Light   as growing production from the prolific play gives rise to an increasing variety of crudes Most of the supply for WTI Light likely would come from more recently drilled parts of the region  such as Texas s Loving and  Culberson counties  with initial volumes estimated at  100K bbl day  Bloomberg reports The new stream is being blended to produce domestic sweet crude  WTI Midland or benchmark WTI for delivery at Cushing   Okla   according to the report  while lighter oil is typically higher priced   the new grade is being sold at a discount to WTI Midland The new grade will be shipped from Midland  Tex  in pipelines including those  operated by Enterprise Products Partners  NYSE EPD   Magellan Midstream Partners  NYSE MMP  and  Plains All American Pipeline   NYSE PAA  Permian producers include EOG  PXD  LPI  FANG  SN  COG  CRZO  CXO  RSPP  DVN  NFX  OXY  CVX  XOM  NBL  APC  APA  WPX  CDEV  REN  EGN  JAG  AXAS  HK  MCF  XEC  PE  SM  MTDR  QEP  ARNow read ,2018-10-18,Seeking Alpha,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/permian-drillers-begin-selling-new-lighter-crude-oil-grade-1650726,1650726
2706,224221,CRZO,Do You Practice Quality Of Life Investing  Perhaps You Should,opinion,"Energy and food will be hot commodities as emerging middle classes start buying cars and beef  That is why  in this interview with The Energy Report  Discovery Investing Founder Michael Berry explains the importance of quality of life investing  Oil and gas  uranium and fertilizer stocks are on sale now  but might not be in the years to come 
The Energy Report  When we last interviewed your son  Chris Berry  he advised to invest based on the reality of a growing  emerging market in China  That included both energy and agriculture sectors  Are you also bullish on quality of life based  QOL  investing 
Michael Berry  I am bullish  I developed the QOL concept a few years ago  What I m seeing is quite a few big institutions life insurance companies  family offices and money management companies opening quality of life funds  although often with different names  They are beginning to recognize that as people move from the country to the cities in the emerging markets  and a new middle class develops  they will want more animal based protein chicken  fish  pork  beef and eggs  By 2030  once the credit cycle is corrected  I m very bullish that quality of life funds are going to push forward  I think both the energy and the agriculture sectors are going to be interesting investment areas 
Chris and I have been spending a fair amount of time lecturing and presenting our QOL thesis and talking to investors and companies that have big stakes in this area  When you have 2 billion  2B  new consumers who want to live longer  healthier and easier  and who want better food  education and transportation  energy and nutrition will be key sectors 
TER  Does that mean that you are not worried about reports of slowing economic growth in China 
MB  I m not worried about the long term because growth in China must slow  As economies expand  growth  by definition  slows  I m not saying we won t have serious economic headwinds in the next few years  We have talked before about the impact of possible deflation in the metals sector  But ultimately  that will be overcome because members of the new and much larger middle class want to live better and they want to consume 
China and India are changing their models from export driven economies to consumer based economies  That might take a decade or more  but the Chinese government is transforming it now  China has its own credit problems that it must solve  Same goes for the United States  Regardless of the timeframe  energy and food are still keys to a higher quality of life  We are prepared to watch as this secular tsunami develops  and then take investment positions 
TER  A big part of that energy play is oil and gas  When we last interviewed Matt Badiali  he was very excited about shale plays because   these are real companies producing real profits  compared to gold explorers  What s your approach to the controversial shale oil sector 
MB  Shale oil is a great diversification play for all of your readers in either the metals sector or the energy sector  You want to spend some time and understand the Bakken and also the Eagle Ford Shale  I m very bullish on the Eagle Ford  It is clear fracking technology works  The biggest oil producers are involved  including Freeport McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc   NYSE FCX  
Specifically  I like the royalty play in the Eagle Ford Shale Trend  The U S  is a great country because if you own the land  you own all of the mineral rights beneath the land  We are the only country in the world where private citizens can own the minerals  The first 25  of oil that comes out of the land comes to the property owner  with no working interest risks and no environmental risks  The royalty owner pays only his share of the taxes  other than the cost of purchasing the royalty  he has no capital costs associated with drilling and completing the wells  or monthly lease operating expenses 
It is a great dividend like diversifier for people who are looking for yield and a hedge against inflation  Just in the Eagle Ford Shale alone  there have been approximately 9 000 wells drilled since its discovery in 2008  with a 97  success rate  The current average estimated ultimate recovery  EUR  per well is 351 000 barrels of oil equivalent  351 Mboe   This recovery rate appears to be increasing over time as the technology improves  There will likely be an additional 200 000 wells drilled in the Eagle Ford over the next 50 years 
TER  So you re not worried about decline rates 
MB  Not at all  because the initial rate of production is about 1 000 barrels per day  1 Mbbl d  or more  First year declines are 76   second year declines are 35   20  for the third year and 6  or less thereafter  So 40  of the total estimated ultimate reserves are produced in the first five years  then it tapers off  But a company like EOG Resources Inc   NYSE EOG  is now drilling one well on 20 acres  There is lots of potential  even though the decline rates are steep and it s  10 million   10M  to drill a well  When you re producing 11 500 bbl d at  100 barrel   100 bbl   the economics work  The risk is if oil were to fall to  40 or  50 bbl 
TER  What are some other companies that have been active in the shales 
MB  Penn Virginia Corp   PVA  and Carrizo Oil   Gas Inc   CRZO O  are producers that know where the profitable properties are located 
TER  My understanding is that Penn Virginia is buying on the outskirts of the Eagle Ford  where the property is cheaper  Is that working 
MB  The Eagle Ford Shale in Texas is more than 450 miles long and 50 miles wide  Moving west to east across south Texas  it is about 300 feet thick  thinning to 50 feet thick around central south Texas  and thickening to 1 000 feet as you move east  to the Eaglebine  That is why the best properties may not be found in the heart of the Eagle Ford  but to the east  on the fringes  The whole oil window play is moving east across Texas now  In fact  the Eagle Ford probably goes all the way into Florida  Penn Virginia is doing a great job of buying properties before they are overpriced  Carrizo is another great operator in the Eagle Ford Shale  There is a lot of potential here  and I m just talking about Texas  I m not talking about North Dakota  the Bakken  Pennsylvania or any of the other ones that are there  The future energy scenario for the U S  is very positive 
TER  You mentioned that you think we re about a year from uranium prices returning to higher levels  What would be the catalyst behind that 
MB  The spot price of uranium has fallen to around  32 50 pound   32 50 lb   That can t last with the rest of the world building out its nuclear power capability  I don t know what Japan and Germany will do  but China and India are building reactors as we speak  I think we re a year away from a realization that the Russians aren t going to be our friends anymore when it comes to sending us uranium to be down blended for commercial reactors  We are going to need more uranium soon and that means higher prices to make some of the great deposits in the Athabasca economic and hence mineable 
Chris and I attended the SME Conference on uranium in Corpus Christi in October and recognized the difference between the successful companies and those that might not survive to see higher prices  Presently  what s really important about uranium is being able to produce it cheaply  So the in situ leach  ISL  producers are the place to be right now 
TER  What companies have that ISL advantage 
MB  One is Uranerz Energy Corp   AMEX URZ   The company recently announced that the NRC has allowed Uranerz to commence production at Nichols Ranch in Wyoming  Production means cash flows and liquidity  U3O8 Corp   UWE TO  has Colombian and Argentinian assets of uranium and vanadium  It s an earlier stage play that looks promising  I met with management at PDAC in March  I like Ur Energy Inc   AMEX URG  because it has been producing via ISL in Wyoming for several months  ISL is particularly economic in a low uranium spot and term market  Uranium Energy Corp   AMEX UEC  interests me because it s a domestic producer 
We ve had some wonderful discoveries in the Athabasca led by Fission Uranium Corp   FCU V   These will require a higher uranium price to enhance the economics of hard rock discoveries  We think we will require  50 lb or  60 lb uranium before we start to gain share price momentum in the sector 
TER  Despite the low uranium prices  some of the companies have had some traction in the market  Uranerz did an update on the Nichols Ranch ISL project and the stock is way up from the beginning of the year  What happened there 
MB  First of all  it is an ISL producer  which is where you probably want to be invested today  Second  I think there s been a lot of hype in the sector itself  generating some behavioral excess in some of these stocks  Having said that  I think the ISL producers are probably going to hold their value as we go forward 
TER  You mentioned that energy and food are directly related  What fertilizer companies could benefit from an increased need for food 
MB  We re going to see a massive need for new fertilizer development globally  The three things farmers need to grow more food on less land are nitrogen  phosphorus and potassium 
There s an advanced phosphate developer in Quebec that I like called Arianne Phosphate  DRRSF PK   It currently has an NI 43 101 feasibility study completed  Arianne has a very high grade phosphate deposit at Lac   Paul in Quebec  The feasibility study shows a 25 year mine life with annual production of 3 million tones  3 Mt  of phosphate concentrate with a grade of 38 6  P2O5  There are many zones still to explore that will expand the resource  The feasibility study shows that after beneficiation  the resource will provide among the highest P2O5 grades in the world 
I think the company is an attractive takeover target given its location in Quebec  the vertical integration of the phosphate market and the very strong economics of the project  The phosphate market is comprised of a handful of big players  including OCP in Morocco  state owned   PhosAgro  PHOR LSE  in Russia and The Mosaic Co   MOS NYSE  in the U S 
TER  I understand Arianne has some permitting that it expects to get approved this year  Will that be an important catalyst 
MB  That should be a very important catalyst  The stock went up to CA 1 69  and it s backed off to CA 1 15  I think it s way too cheap right now  I think it s a stock that you want to own now  It s a big resource of 590 Mt of 7 13  Measured and Indicated ore  I don t think it will have any major problems on the permitting side  The one area it s going to have to deal with is the capitalization of the project  It may require a capex of  1 21B 
On the other hand  it certainly has a really strong following  with a very low estimated production cost of  93 70 per tonne  The average selling price will likely be around  200 per tonne  This is a wonderful margin  Furthermore  it s a commodity that is relatively scarce in North America 
TER  You mentioned that potash has been much more volatile lately  What are some companies you like that could survive in a depressed potash market 
MB  The good news is the potash market is probably pretty close to a bottom right now because of big producers flooding the market  As the middle class consumer grows worldwide  I think we re going to have much more demand for fertilizer  particularly overseas 
A Canadian company called Allana Potash  ALLRF PK  has a big  low cost potash project in Ethiopia that is going fertilize Africa and some of Asia  It has an offtake agreement with Israel Chemicals Ltd   ICL TA  that could be transformational for the fertilizer space itself  This 80  offtake agreement places Allana in a different league from its competitors 
These are the Discovery Investments we love to understand 
The stock is in strong hands  Liberty Metals   Mining  an offshoot of an insurance company  is a big shareholder  If I were investing in potash companies  I would pick some producing companies overseas to supply demand overseas  Allana fits that bill  and the stock is trading for CA 0 38 
Some investors are nervous about Ethiopia  but the asset is there and the management is excellent  I know CEO Farhad Abasov very well  I ve worked with him on other situations  I will be shortly travelling to Ethiopia to visit the Allana site 
The fertilizers are going to be very strong over the next few years as demand for protein skyrockets from the urbanization of the emerging world s new middle class  Be patient and select good management with quality assets and sustainable business plans 
TER  Any final advice for energy investors trying to get through the rest of 2014 
MB  Look at the shale plays  Look for royalty trusts on the shale plays  particularly the Eagle Ford in Texas  There are all kinds of new rules  You can even put royalties in your IRA now  We haven t gotten very much yield from the junior miners  It s time to start rewarding yourself 
TER  Thank you for all the ideas 
MB  Thank you

2712,224227,CRZO,These Companies Benefited From Russia s Crimea Move,opinion,"Don t put all your investments in one stock  warns S A Resource Report Editor Matt Badiali  In this interview with The Energy Report  he shares a basket of companies that are extracting higher margins with ever evolving shale drilling methods  Find out about his top tenbagger opportunities at home  in the so called new science and factory shales  as well as his favorites in the far reaches of Kurdistan  where an eventual takeover draft looks likely 
The Energy Report  In a Daily Resource Update   you wrote a piece called   Here s How Russia s Invasion of Crimea Could Benefit Some U S  Oil Companies   and it wasn t the oil producing companies I assumed from the headline  Tell us  what companies could benefit 
Matt Badiali  The companies that can refine crude oil here in the U S   put it on ships and send it abroad are the ones benefitting from the spread between Brent crude and cheap domestic West Texas Intermediate prices  I was actually surprised with the results of this research  too  Giant companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation    and Chevron Corp     had record years for their refining arms 
Refining is a terrible business  It s notorious for single digit profit margins  The price of oil fluctuates globally  but the price the refiners can sell it for in the U S  is limited by consumers  Back in 2008  when the price of oil hit  140 barrel   140 bbl   the price of gasoline increased  but it certainly didn t go up in the same magnitude as the price of oil 
Since exporting raw crude from the U S  is illegal  refined product is leaving the country at record levels  The Energy Information Administration  EIA  has tracked export data since the early 1980s  We are orders of magnitude higher today in export volume than we have ever been  It s going to Mexico  it s going to Canada  it s going to South America  it s going to Asia  We re putting it on ships in Houston and sending it everywhere  These refiners are making a ton of money 
TER  Also  didn t the U S   for the first time in a long time  sell crude oil from the strategic reserve as a way to punish Russia 
MB  That was a warning shot  Russia s economy is based on energy sales  It sells natural gas and oil to Europe and it is starting to develop a bigger sales arm to China  If you can undercut Russia s oil price with higher quality crude oil  then it really hurts Russia economically  That s what broke the U S S R  in 1991  Back then it took Saudi Arabian involvement  This recent strategic reserve sale increased the supply on the market  thereby lowering the price  which threatened Russia and made refiners at home even more profitable 
TER  Do the actions in Ukraine have an impact on European oil and gas companies 
MB  There is a fear premium built into Brent crude  and producers like the Italian oil company  ENI  NYSE E  will benefit from that  However  Europe s refineries  which are paying the significantly higher price of Brent  are losing their profit margins  That is why companies like BP  BP  Plc   Royal Dutch Shell A    and Total  TOT  are shedding European refineries 
Total is in big trouble with a couple of refineries in France  Repsol YPF S A   REPYY OTCPK   the big Spanish oil company  has invested billions of dollars in retrofitting older refineries and it s making about  1 bbl  It will take a long time to pay off that investment at that rate  So it s kind of a mixed bag right now 
TER  Back in the U S   we re coming off one of the coldest winters most people in the Northeast can remember  Is demand for natural gas going to bring the price back up long term or is  6 per thousand cubic feet  Mcf  a temporary blip 
MB  It is a temporary blip  The price spike is due to a transportation problem  We just don t have the right plumbing in place  There are not enough pipes to get the natural gas to the Northeast  And we did have a record drawdown of natural gas from storage  But there is too much natural gas for the prices to stay high 
If the natural gas price held at  6 Mcf  supply would skyrocket as well  There would be a mass mobilization of drill rigs into places like the Fayetteville Shale  the Haynesville Shale  the Barnett Shale and the western part of the Eagle Ford Shale  It would be like printing money at those prices  but at  4 50 Mcf that natural gas isn t economic  There is an enormous amount of natural gas waiting to be tapped 
TER  What is your estimate for the price of natural gas for the rest of 2014 
MB  I ve seen some pretty smart people putting their estimates around  4 4 25 Mcf for the average for this year  maybe a little higher because of that  6 hit we took early  But I suspect that you re going to see prices fall substantially into the summer 
Natural gas and coal are competitors because of electricity  Energy breaks down to fuel energy which is usually oil and power plant fuel  the stuff that powers our electrical grid that means coal and natural gas  When natural gas was really cheap  around  2 Mcf  many power plants switched to natural gas 
The new Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  pollution controls on coal plants also sped up decommissioning of old coal power plants  That decrease in demand drove the coal price down  Then when natural gas prices rose again  the plants that could switch  went back to coal  It is a delicate dance between supply and demand for these two fuels 
TER  The shale plays you mentioned earlier are not all producing the same thing  Some are oilier than others  some more advanced  How does an investor gain exposure to projects in the Bakken and Eagle Ford differently than the new science shales in the Tuscaloosa  Utica  New Albany or Cline 
MB  When George Mitchell first started experimenting with cracking shale in Fort Worth Texas  the target was natural gas  At that time  natural gas prices had spiked to more than  14 Mcf  The thin layers of shale rock he was observing weren t thick enough to hold a conventional well  He started exploring methods for drilling horizontally and opening up those rocks 
Fast forward over 20 years and we know a whole lot more about shale and how to make it produce 
Each shale requires a slightly different approach depending on the geology  This is the science stage of shale fracking  The Bakken Shale up in North Dakota is well past that stage  Companies like Continental Resources Inc   CLR  went through the science part of that shale in the mid 2000s  Today there are some really interesting new shales  including the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale in Louisiana  the Cline in West Texas and the Utica in Ohio  They are all in the science stage 
Once operators understand how deep and in what direction to put the wells for the best yields  they go into the development stage  This stage is all about making the best well at the cheapest cost  They experiment with fracking  Back in the 1990s  they might have divided the well into two stages  Now drillers do 30 or more stages 
As the operators figure these techniques out  production rises  This is when you see a massive increase in production  The Eagle Ford is just finishing up the development stage  It is moving into the factory stage 
During the factory stage  companies drill three  four  five wells from the same location  going out like bird feet  Or they drill them in parallel  Shale wells can be drilled very close together  called downspacing  by this point  That s where the Bakken is now  The Bakken is an oil and gas factory  You re seeing dramatic increases year after year in oil and gas production in North Dakota 
TER  Are the improvements in the development stage and increasing the number of frack stages helping with the decline rate problem 
MB  Absolutely  The decline rate in an oil well is a natural progression  A conventional oil well in sandstone is like a 2 liter bottle of soda  When you shake it and poke a hole in the side of it  cola or  in this case  oil gushes out because of the natural pressure in the rock  As that pressure declines  the production of the well does too  That s decline rate 
In shale wells  the decline rate is much steeper than in conventional oil wells  Analysts that don t understand shale use that data to predict a bad end for the shale revolution  However  that s wrong  And the reason is that the decline rate of a single well doesn t matter     it s the number of wells we can drill in shale that matters 
Let me explain the difference  Conventional oil fields are geologic anomalies  That s why it was getting harder and harder to find them  A conventional oil field is made up of three things  You have to have a source  which is the shale 
You have to have the reservoir rock  It has to have something like sand grains in it to hold the thing open with lots of space to allow the oil and gas to get in there  That is called permeability and porosity  That s what allows you to put a well in and suck the liquid out 
Then you have to have a seal  something on top to keep the oil and gas trapped  A good example would be throwing a handful of Dixie cups in the air  The ones that land open side down are conventional oil fields  These perfect situations aren t common  Giant ones are incredibly rare 
On the other hand  shale is like the carpet under the cups  It is the source rock  so it is full of oil and gas already  It covers an enormous area  much larger than the area of the conventional oil fields  That s what s so critical  The volume of oil and gas in shale is much larger than in the conventional fields 
That s why individual well results don t matter  Because the amount of oil available in shale is an order of magnitude larger than what was trapped in the conventional oil fields  And we re just starting to crack these rocks 
The Eagle Ford Shale was the source of oil for the largest oil field in the lower 48  and it still has billions of barrels of oil in it  That s what s exciting  Most investors just don t realize how gigantic shale fields are  We re just getting good at making them produce oil right now 
When shales get to the factory stage  companies maximize the amount of oil and gas coming out of the ground and minimize the cost to do it  I m a huge fan of this 
TER  Is there still money to be made in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford 
MB  There s absolutely money to be made  I like to find small companies doing something different in those established shale areas  One example is  in the Eagle Ford Shale  This is a company that is pushing the boundaries of what we considered the Eagle Ford to be  As the price of land in the heart of the shale play got more expensive  some companies moved to the periphery  That s where they can get a big position without spending a lot of money  Many of these smaller explorers do great work and take what they ve learned from the heart of the play and expand it  That s what Penn Virginia did 
By October of 2013  the Eagle Ford was an old story in the eyes of most investors  and Penn Virginia was a  6 73 stock  It saw an opportunity to move into the area  changed its business model  sold off assets and focused on the Eagle Ford  Shares are over  17 today  George Soros is an owner  and he significantly increased his position in the company  There is a Buy target on this from some analysts  up to  25 share  So  yes  there is absolutely still opportunity in the old shales 
Companies like Continental Resources kicked off the Bakken  but you don t buy them expecting to make 150   I want to find the next Continental  I want to buy the billion dollar company that goes to  23B 
TER  Where are you looking for the next Penn Virginia 
MB  I think the next big shale plays are probably the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale  the Utica Shale or the Cline Shale  We re digging very hard into companies working on these 
However  I like several companies that work multiple shales right now  Sanchez Energy Corporation  SN  is a peripheral Eagle Ford player  but it s also in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale  It s a small cap run by a really smart management team  It s a  1 3B market cap  This is a stock that I think has that potential 
Another one I really like in the Eagle Ford  Marcellus  Utica and Niobrara in Northeastern Colorado is Carrizo Oil   Gas Inc  CRZO O   It s the same thing small cap  moving into the new shales and with a lot of upside potential 
TER  What puts a company on your radar  Are you looking at number of wells drilling  Success rate  ROI 
MB  I look at the rocks  I read a lot of industry reports about well production     who s drilling where     whose well produced the best  It s dry as a bone  but I love this stuff 
These companies can make individual investors rich  I used to get excited about junior mining companies  and I still do to some extent  But small oil and gas companies are actually companies with revenue and earnings  You can evaluate the business as well as the rocks 
Even more important  these companies have to maintain bank loans  It s very expensive to drill shale wells  but they end up with long term cash flow worth many times the initial investment  That bank scrutiny gives investors an extra layer of due diligence because the banks want to make sure that their loans get paid back 
TER  Are there any rocks and well run businesses in the Cline that you like 
MB  There are some interesting companies working not just in the Cline  but also in the Eastern Permian Basin  This is the area under Midland Odessa  Texas 
If you ever want to find the flattest  driest  dullest part of the world  go there  No offense to all my friends out there from Midland  but this is the place that you re most likely to be trapped by a herd of tumbleweeds  However  it is a great new shale opportunity  It s still early  in the science stage 
There are a few companies I like in that area  Laredo Petroleum Holdings Inc  LPI  and Callon Petroleum Company  CPE  are two little guys  These are small caps that have a lot of potential  like the ones I was talking about in the Eagle Ford  The problem with science shale is that the drillers are still figuring it out  That means expenses are high and the drilling is slow 
Investors have to adjust their mindset  I don t think either of these companies is going to run up 150  in six months  I do see them both with tenbagger potential over a few years  and I could certainly see the potential to double our money in the next 12 24 months 
TER  You haven t just been wandering around the beautiful scenery in Texas  You ve also been traveling the world  The last time we talked  you shared some insights from your visit to Kurdistan  Have you been watching developments since you left  Are you more or less optimistic than three months ago that oil will again flow freely from the area  I understand there were some problems with pipelines 
MB  Yes  there are still problems with pipelines and politics  I am still very excited about Kurdistan  but you can t quantify the politics  With major oil companies and the big  influential players in Turkey involved  I still think a pipeline from Northern Kurdistan in Iraq to Turkey is inevitable  There is a dispute with Baghdad about how and who gets paid 
I warned my readers that this was not a short term speculation  It takes a long time  Your investment horizon here is 18 24 months  but I think it s going to be worth it  Right now  several juniors have the ability to produce oil in the region  but there is no outlet to get to market  The physical pipe is there  it s a political roadblock  So all we can do is wait 
Exxon Mobil is already in a partnership to build a second pipeline to get the oil out as soon as the political troubles are over  Once we see oil flowing out of the region  I suspect that the major oil companies are going to do an NFL style draft on the juniors in the area  They re going to roll them up  All that oil will end up in the hands of just a couple of majors  and that will be that 
TER  One of the companies you gave us an overview on was WesternZagros Resources Ltd  WZR V   Since then  it has announced it received a declaration of commerciality by the regional government  Would that make it higher up in the draft 
MB  Absolutely  It found oil  vetted it and now has a permit to produce it  That pushes it up into the No  1  No  2 draft pick area  However  I warn people not to invest in just one company 
At a recent Stansberry   Associates alliance conference in Singapore  I singled out five of these companies I felt like were good speculations and whose rewards more than offset our risk  I presented a basket to diversify risk because these kinds of companies have far more risk  be it political  technical or corporate 
I told those folks that out of the five stocks  three things will happen  First  something bad and unexpected will happen to one of these companies  One will absolutely blow us away by exceeding our expectations  And the other three are going to do really well 
A couple of weeks ago  one of the companies fell out of bed  and I have to tell you  I was shocked  The company was Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd  GKP LSE   It is the operator of the Shaikan field  which is just an enormous discovery  Shaikan s wells flow 10 thousand barrels per day  10 Mbpd   This is a huge field 
However  an engineering firm audited the field and came back with a lower reserve number than Gulf Keystone had been telling people  It was at the low end of its range  The stock was killed  We hit our trailing stop and sold 
This is not a bad company  Shaikan is a fantastic oil field  However  it was all about investor expectation  Investors expected a bigger reserve number  The company still has around 20 wells left to drill in that field  which will expand the reserves from where they are now  I still think it is a good buy  It s probably a better buy now that it s significantly cheaper 
TER  Do you want to give us another name to fill out our basket 
MB  Sure  Oryx Petroleum Corporation Limited  OXC TO  is run by a Swiss billionaire  Jean Claude Gandur  who has been very active for years in Kurdistan  He s an interesting character  He names his companies after obscure African antelope 
His last venture  Addax  sold to Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Ltd   SHI  in 2009  My readers made money on that deal  so we were very interested in this one 
Oryx has an oil field named Demir Dagh  Its projected recoverable oil from this is about 250 million barrels  250 MMbbl   and its projected production once it gets the wells in by 2015 is about 25 Mbpd  It is definitely one of the draft choices 
When I wrote about this company  it had plenty of cash  no debt  and it s still drilling  It s supposed to be in production sometime this summer  and it has three other targets that it will be drilling this year  We re waiting on drill results  It takes a long time to drill holes in this part of the world because the equipment is just not as good  If you break a drill rod or a bit in Kurdistan  it takes a long time to airfreight one of those suckers from Houston 
TER  Any final advice for our readers 
MB  You re going to hear a lot of negative information about shale  It s new  It s different  I see a lot of negative sentiment  People are trying to poke holes in the process  All you have to do to reassure yourself that you re investing in the right place is go to the oil production chart on the   Take a look at the amount of oil that we re producing today versus the amount of oil we were producing in 2005  Our ability to crack shale is the equivalent of the creation of the Internet for energy  It s that big a deal  Those folks who embrace it and get on board have the potential to make a lot of money 
TER  Thank you for your time Matt
