179848,401364,TSN,Why Tyson Foods Stock Soared 70 5  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  climbed 70 5  in 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  as the protein focused food leader became a primary beneficiary amid the fallout of an African swine fever outbreak in China  Tyson also launched a new plant based food offering under its  Raised   Rooted  brand 
So what
To be sure  the bulk of Tyson Foods  gain last year came in the first half  when shares steadily sizzled more than 50  higher amid an African swine fever epidemic that    according to recent USDA estimates    decreased Chinese pork production by 14  in 2019  which in turn sent pork prices soaring more than 60  

In a company blog post in May  Tyson Foods CEO Noel White called the outbreak an  unprecedented event   noting that each of Tyson s pork  chicken  and beef businesses was poised to benefit from the event    with the latter two primarily gaining ground as consumers turn to substitute protein sources 
Tyson only further fueled its momentum with the introduction of the Raised   Rooted plant based food brand in June  But unlike some newer market entrants like Beyond Meat  Tyson management cautioned that the move wasn t part of a broader effort to eliminate its real meat products  but rather a supplemental offering to meet alternative protein demand 
Sure enough  Tyson Foods stock only continued to rise in the second half    including a nearly 8  single day gain in August as the company posted better than expected third quarter earnings  At the time  White suggested the impact of the China s hog and pork supply losses would likely turn into a  multi year event  
Now what
As it stands  Tyson most recently told investors it expects to meet or exceed its longer term earnings target for high single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2020  
We ll see whether Tyson Foods remains on track to achieve that goal when it releases first quarter 2019 results early next month  But given the tailwinds and product diversification Tyson enjoyed last year  I think the top consumer staples stock responded appropriately in 2019 ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phwlx,2059076

And yet  Tyson is laying off 500 workers  Why 

One easy explanation is the fact that    however the CEO feels about his company s quarter    Wall Street isn t especially pleased about it  Sales of  10 8 billion  which produces such well known brands as Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm in addition to its own namesake Tyson  were up 6 1  in comparison with Q1 2019  but Wall Street analysts had hoped Tyson would report even better growth    and more than  11 billion in sales   
At the same time  Tyson s earnings may have beaten estimates    but they were nothing to write home about  Net income for the company rose a bare 1 3  year over year to  1 52 per share  And even the number that Tyson  and Wall Street  emphasized   adjusted net income per share attributable to Tyson   a very non GAAP number   grew barely 5 1     slower than revenue growth  and indicative of weakening profit margins at the meat maker 
Tyson is also continuing to spend heavily on capital investment this year  with capital expenditures expected to be approximately  1 3 billion in 2020  up from  1 26 billion last year    and nearly twice the  695 million Tyson as spending as recently as 2016  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  That money s got to come from somewhere  Tyson  it seems  has decided to take it out of payroll ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps2g3,2078257

The U S  has moved closer to resuming lucrative chicken exports to China after more than a hundred American processing plants were given approval to ship to the Asian nation 
China authorized poultry imports from 172 facilities in the U S  effective Friday  according to a notice on the nation s customs website  Chicken giants  Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN    Pilgrim s Pride Corp  and Sanderson Farms Inc  were among the companies making the list  according to a document published by the U S  Department of Agriculture s Food Safety and Inspection Service 
The move comes after China lifted its ban on U S  poultry shipments earlier this month as part of trade negotiations taking place between Washington and Beijing  The Asian nation banned U S  poultry imports in 2015 following an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza  and kept the prohibition even after nearly all other nationwide bans had been removed

American poultry exports to China are projected to top  1 billion a year  said U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue  At their peak  annual poultry exports to China were worth  722 million for chicken and  71 million for turkey  according to the National Chicken Council  National Turkey Federation  USA Poultry and the Egg Export Council 
The resumption of exports would be a boon for U S  chicken companies at a time when a deadly pig disease cuts pork output in China  boosting demand for protein imports by the world s largest consumer  Even though the pig virus doesn t affect humans  many Chinese people have opted to switch to chicken

179874,401390,TSN,Going whole hog  U S  tells exporters to report pig carcass sales as China buying soars,news,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO  Reuters    The U S  Department of Agriculture said on Monday that commodity exporters must disclose sales of hog carcasses  giving officials and traders more insight into a surge of Chinese pork buying that has roiled global meat markets 
China s pork imports have nearly doubled this year as a fatal pig disease has decimated its herd and pushed prices of the country s favorite meat to record highs  Its beef and chicken imports have also climbed as China is seeking to replace millions of pigs killed by African swine fever 
The USDA published a rule to specify that exporters must report sales of pork and beef carcasses effective immediately because pork sales to China were rising and there was  an apparent lack of commensurate reporting   according to an emailed statement 
Previously  the USDA told exporters to report sales of  muscle cuts   Traders said it was unclear whether that included different types of carcasses 
China  the world s largest pork consumer  is buying U S  hog carcasses from companies like WH Group s  HK 0288  Smithfield Foods because Chinese meat processors need entire animals  not just certain cuts  during the disease outbreak  according to analysts 
 These changes will help to provide transparency and eliminate confusion for the industry   U S  meat packer  Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  said 
The USDA publishes export sales data each week that can swing agricultural futures prices  The data was previously incomplete because of uncertainty over reporting carcass sales  said Dennis Smith  commodity broker for Archer Financial Services in Chicago 
Now  exporters know they must disclose sales of whole carcasses  divided carcasses  and those that are boxed 
 The rule is pretty clear now   Smith said   It ll give us a better perspective on the carnage in China   how much pork they actually need  
U S  carcass shipments to China began in June after Smithfield Foods  the world s biggest pork processor  retooled a slaughterhouse to slice hogs into thirds for export to China in boxes  Shipments reached a total of 78 390 tonnes by the end of September  according to USDA data  topping 676 tonnes shipped in 2017 
 Timely reporting and publishing of agricultural export sales data is key to effectively functioning markets   the USDA said 
Smithfield did not respond to a request for comment

179875,401391,TSN,Tyson Foods cleared to ship poultry to China from all U S  plants,news,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO  Reuters     Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN  received approval from U S  and Chinese authorities to export American poultry to China from all 36 of its U S  processing plants and expects to begin taking orders early next year  a chief supply chain officer for the company said 
U S  chicken companies are eager to resume sales in China after Beijing last month lifted a nearly five year ban on imports as Chinese consumers seek pork alternatives  A deadly hog disease has killed millions of pigs and raised meat prices in the pork loving country 
Increased Chinese purchases of products like chicken feet  wing tips and legs would help increase U S  agricultural exports to China as the two countries negotiate a trade deal 
 There s an extreme amount of interest across all those parts from multiple buyers in China   Bernie Adcock  Tyson Foods  chief supply chain officer for poultry  said in an interview on Friday 
The U S  Trade Representative last month projected more than  1 billion in annual poultry shipments to China 
Beijing banned U S  poultry and eggs in January 2015 over a U S  outbreak of avian flu  closing a market that bought  500 million worth of American poultry products in 2013  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  
China is scouring the globe for meat and poultry after African swine fever killed about half of the world s largest hog herd 
U S  meat companies have faced a disadvantage for pork exports to China  compared to other suppliers  because Beijing imposed tariffs of up to 72  on American pork as part of the countries  trade war  Tyson  the largest U S  meat producer  expects China to import more U S  pork and poultry to compensate for African swine fever s toll 
 My gut is they re going to buy a lot of both   Adcock said 
China is an important market for chicken parts that many U S  consumers do not eat  During China s ban  companies including Tyson and Sanderson Farms Inc rendered some feet for products like fertilizer and pet food  instead of exporting them for higher returns 
Tyson is working to win U S  approval by the end of the year for labels on poultry exported to China  the final step  It received its first label approval on Friday  Adcock said 
Processing plants run by Sanderson  Pilgrim s Pride Corp and other companies also have been cleared to ship U S  poultry to China  according to USDA

The imports may be part of China s efforts to ease tensions with the U S  as they strive to reach a trade deal  They also come at a time when the Asian nation  the world s biggest pork consumer  desperately needs more of the meat  China has already boosted pork imports from the U S   with July imports at the highest in two years  as the government also makes purchases for its state reserves 
China s commerce ministry didn t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment  U S  and Chinese officials held working level negotiations earlier this month and are aiming for a high level meeting around Oct  10  Beijing will continue to exempt U S  farm goods including soybeans and pork from additional tariffs  state run Xinhua cited the commerce ministry and National Development and Reform Commission as saying on Tuesday 
Prices of pork have surged more than 70  this year in China due to the spread of a deadly pig disease  prompting Beijing to become increasingly concerned about its potential to mar celebrations for the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct  1 
China s seen an almost 40  plunge in hog numbers as the impact of African swine fever worsened  Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua has warned that the supply situation will be  extremely severe  through to the first half of 2020  and that the country is likely to have a pork shortage of 10 million tons this year  more than the roughly 8 million tons in annual global trade

179899,401415,TSN,Chicken Producers Soar as China Signals End of U S  Ban,news," Bloomberg     Shares of America chicken processors surged Monday after China said it s prepared to lift a ban on U S  poultry that s been in place since 2015 
 Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN    Pilgrim s Pride Corp  and Sanderson Farms Inc  are all poised to benefit as China may seek to import more protein in the wake of a deadly pig disease that s wiped out a significant percentage of its hog herd  Chicken is the cheapest substitute for pork  which is the country s preferred protein 
 This could be a significant positive for the U S  chicken industry given China s historical prominence as a chicken import partner  and because of the country s current need for additional protein imports in the wake of African swine fever driven supply challenges   analysts at Stephens Inc   including Ben Bienvenu  said in a note Monday 
Sanderson Farms shares gained as much as 16   the biggest intraday jump in more than a decade  while Pilgrim s Pride and Tyson rose as much as 8 3  and 5 1   respectively 
African swine fever is spreading through Asia and may cut Chinese production by 60  by the end of this year  according to researcher Global AgriTrends  China produces and consumes about half of the world s pork  and the damage from the fever is widely expected to create a protein gap that suppliers won t be able to fill  Pork costs have skyrocketed in the country 
China is already importing more chicken from Brazil  the U S  s main competitor in poultry exports  including parts and whole chickens  Sanderson Farms Chief Executive Officer Joe Sanderson said Oct  18 during an investor presentation 
In the event of access to China  the quantity of U S  exports may not necessarily see significant increases  according to Global AgriTrends President Brett Stuart  China may just displace exports to smaller markets  which would push up prices  especially for chicken leg quarters 
 To see that leg quarter price get another bump  that would go right to the bottom line of U S  producers   Stuart said  which would be  great news  for the industry 
Sanderson has  the most quantifiable benefit   according to the Stephens report  as it sold 74 9 million pounds  34 000 metric tons  of chicken for  62 1 million to China in fiscal year 2014  before the ban 
Rising American poultry shipments can help ease a U S  protein glut  In the first nine months of 2019  U S  chicken slaughter climbed 1 4  from a year earlier and animal weights also increased

179926,401442,TSN,Wall St  rises as strong Chinese data eases growth worries,news,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
 Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Wednesday as upbeat data from China s services sector eased concerns about a global economic slowdown  while Hong Kong s withdrawal of a controversial bill supported sentiment 
Activity in China s services sector expanded at the fastest pace in three months in August  providing a boost to the world s second largest economy that has been struggling to reverse a prolonged slump in its manufacturing sector 
Sentiment also got a lift after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam withdrew an extradition bill that had triggered months of often violent protests in the Chinese ruled city 
The three main indexes had come under pressure on Tuesday after the United States and China imposed new tariffs on each other s goods and data showed a contraction in U S  factory activity in August 
 The positive economic news out of China is offsetting the weak manufacturing data from the U S  yesterday and diminishes the fear of an economic downturn   said Shawn Gibson  chief investment officer at asset management firm Liquid Strategies 
 Global growth and not just U S  growth is a very important narrative for investors because a strong Chinese economy is important to our economy as well   Gibson added 
Markets struggled last month as escalating trade tensions and the inversion of a key part of the U S  yield curve  often seen as a sign of recession  drove investors away from risky assets and pushed the S P 500  SPX  to log its worst August in four years 
Further easing concerns of a slowdown were comments from New York Federal Reserve President John Williams  NYSE WMB  who said he is ready to  act as appropriate  to help the United States avoid an economic downturn but so far the economy appeared to be in a good place 
Ten of the 11 major S P sectors were higher  with a 1 05  rise in technology stocks  SPLRCT  providing the biggest boost 
Trade sensitive chipmakers accounted for a major portion of those gains  with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index  SOX  up 2 18  
Bank stocks  rose 2 18   bouncing back from a selloff on Tuesday when the 10 year U S  Treasury yield  US10YT RR  hit its lowest since July 2016 
UBS slashed its forecasts for global growth and government bond yields  predicting 10 year U S  yield  the benchmark for global borrowing costs  would end the year at just 1  
Gibson said the nonfarm payrolls report due Friday will be very critical  because any sort of weakness in data could push Treasury yields even lower and signal that bond investors are concerned about an upcoming recession 
At 10 17 a m  ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  was up 148 56 points  or 0 57   at 26 266 58  the S P 500  SPX  was up 16 88 points  or 0 58   at 2 923 15 and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  was up 57 02 points  or 0 72   at 7 931 18

 Reuters    A Bayer  DE BAYGN  executive on Thursday said the company was closely watching the plant based meat market which has seen booming demand in recent years  adding that Bayer could potentially enter the market as an alternative protein source provider 
 They are sourcing different types of crops and that also could create opportunity for us  being a company that is a plant breeding company   Bob Reiter  Bayer s head of research and development at the company s crop science division  said in reference to plant based meat companies 
Reiter made the remarks at an investor event in St  Louis  Missouri in response to a question by an analyst who wanted to know what impact the growth of plant based meat substitutes would have on the company s business 
Meat alternatives have seen booming demand as consumers are looking to add more plant based protein to their diet  amid growing concerns about health risks from eating meat  animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming 
Companies including Beyond Meat  O BYND  and Impossible Foods  and even traditional meat producers including  Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN    Maple Leaf Foods Inc   TO MFI  and Perdue Farms are cashing in on the trend  selling sausages  burgers and imitation ground beef largely made from pea protein or soy

179958,401474,TSN,U S  cows and pigs gorge on bakery rolls  pet food as corn prices surge,news,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  farmers are feeding their livestock everything from outdated pet food and leftover bakery rolls to crops imported from South America after unprecedented spring planting delays boosted prices for locally grown corn 
Corn is typically used to fatten hogs  cattle and poultry  but its high price has farmers in the  150 billion U S  meat and dairy industry looking elsewhere to keep down costs 
Agricultural cooperatives  equipment dealers and plants that process corn into ethanol have already been strained because farmers were unable to plant millions of acres this spring due to widespread flooding 
Meat producers are now turning to substitutes in an attempt to keep production costs down and stretch out supplies of corn held in storage  Many expect corn prices will climb even higher once harvesting starts this fall because yields are expected to be weak due to springtime flooding 
Feed is typically the biggest cost of raising farm animals  so adjusting diets has become critical for producers who are also grappling with a U S  China trade war that has hurt exports of American agricultural products including pork 
Higher corn prices could raise costs for meat producers like  Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN   which reports earnings on Monday 
CAKES AND CANDIES  ANYONE 
Ohio farmer Jim Heimerl  who sells 700 000 pigs a year  swapped out corn for dry pet food  which he acquires through a broker and can be outdated or mislabeled  Heimerl is also feeding his hogs more wheat middlings  which are a byproduct of the flour milling process 
 We re already starting to ration our corn out   he said 
The U S  Department of Agriculture predicted in July that farmers will harvest the smallest corn crop in four years  Many grain traders and analysts expect the agency will lower its harvest estimate after surveying farmers again about plantings 
Most active corn futures  Cv1  hit a five year high in July and are now trading around  4 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade  up 7  from a year ago  Farmers have seen prices climb even more in cash markets in areas where rains washed out plantings 
 It s only going to get worse and it s all because of the weather   Heimerl said 
In Minnesota  farmer Randy Spronk is using recycled bakery byproducts such as breads  cakes and candies for 10  of his hogs  rations to reduce his need for corn 
 The bushels that are here are precious   he said   We re trying to make them last as long as we can  
Spronk buys the crushed bakery goods from ReConserve  which says it is the country s largest recycler of bakery  cereal grain and snack food byproducts 
The bakery goods are safe and nutritious for livestock but do not meet manufacturers  packaging or quality standards for human consumers  said Bryan Bergquist  ReConserve s vice president of feed sales 
 In times like this  when your main input in feeding livestock goes up  you start looking for best cost alternatives   said Omarh Mendoza  nutrition director for The Maschhoffs  the largest U S  family owned pork producer 
CORN FROM BRAZIL
North Carolina based Prestage Farms has been feeding distillers  dried grains  an ethanol byproduct  to hogs in Iowa and has also imported corn from Brazil  said John Prestage  whose family owns the company  North Carolina farms use corn from Midwest states including Ohio and Indiana  where cash corn prices will be strong  he said in an email 
 We are looking everywhere to minimize the impact of high priced corn   Prestage said  
Smithfield Foods  SFII UL   a Prestage Farms partner  books the corn imports and is looking to bring in more  Prestage said  Smithfield  owned by China s WH Group Ltd  HK 0288   declined to comment 
The USDA last month also increased its estimate for the amount of wheat that will be used for feed and residual purposes in 2019 20 by 7  from June to 150 million bushels  That is much smaller than corn feed and residual use of 5 175 billion bushels  but up 65  from the previous year 
Poky Feeders  which raises about 125 000 cattle on three feedlots in Kansas  changed its grain rations to be half wheat from all corn in July  said Chief Executive Joe Morgan  Cattle gain weight well when they eat wheat  he said

179959,401475,TSN,Tyson Foods hits record high after beating estimates  prepares for China profit boost,news,"By Tom Polansek
 Reuters     Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  reported better than expected quarterly earnings on Monday and reaffirmed expectations it will profit from the spread of a fatal hog disease in China  sending shares to a record high 
Tyson has not yet reaped major financial gains from the deaths of millions of pigs in China s outbreak of African swine fever  Chief Executive Noel White said  China is still working its way through frozen meat supplies  but could begin to increase imports of U S  pork to fill a shortfall as soon as October  he said 
Shares hit a record high of  87 27 
African swine fever is fatal to pigs but harmless to humans and has not been found in the United States 
China could also ramp up total imports of beef and poultry meat as Chinese consumers look for other sources of protein  That could help Tyson  which produces beef and chicken as well as pork 
 I think that all of the proteins will benefit   White told analysts on a conference call 
Tyson has already held discussions with meat buyers in China  the world s largest hog producer and pork consumer  White said 
But China s purchases so far have fallen short of industry expectations so far after Beijing last year imposed retaliatory duties on imports of American farm products including pork as part of the escalating U S  China trade war 
 As China depletes its frozen inventory and starts tapping into the global pork supply in a more meaningful way  we expect Tyson to start realizing meaningful upside  likely in early FY20   Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said 
Higher corn prices could limit profits for Tyson  which buys the grain to feed chickens  The size of the American crop is uncertain after farmers suffered unprecedented plantings delays this spring due to widespread flooding 
Tyson expects a year over year increase of  150 million to  200 million in the cost of grain  Chief Financial Officer Stewart Glendinning said 
The company recorded a  40 million gain in its chicken unit in the third quarter ended June 29 as corn futures rose  benefiting the company s position in the grain market  However  much of that profit is likely to be reversed in the fourth quarter as corn prices have pulled back  Glendinning said 
Net income attributable to Tyson rose to  676 million  or  1 84 per share  in the quarter  from  541 million  or  1 47 per share  a year earlier 
Excluding items  the company earned  1 47 per share  beating analysts  average estimate of  1 42 
Total sales rose 8 3  to  10 89 billion  Analysts on average had expected revenue of  11 05 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
The Justice Department said in June it launched a criminal probe related to price fixing allegations against Tyson and other poultry processors  which the companies have denied

179974,401490,TSN,U S  farmers look past trade fears to cash in on China s hog crisis,news,"By Tom Polansek and Nigel Hunt
WALCOTT  Iowa LONDON  Reuters    It might seem an unlikely time for U S  farmers to look to China for more business but the devastating impact of African swine fever on the Chinese pork industry is trumping concerns about trade wars and tariffs 
Experts estimate the disease will wipe out about a third of China s pork production this year  or 18 million tonnes  That s twice the amount of pork exported worldwide every year and enough to feed U S  consumers for almost two years 
The U S  trade war with China initially forced U S  pork exporters to scour the world for new markets but as the swine fever crisis deepens they re gearing up for new opportunities to supply the Chinese market later this year and next 
The catch for U S  hog farmers is that if they want to take advantage of the surge in Chinese pork demand  they can t feed their pigs with the growth drug ractopamine which is widely used in the United States but banned in China 
In recent years  the European Union has provided roughly two thirds of China s pork imports  excluding offal  with Germany  Spain  the Netherlands and Denmark the main suppliers  according to Chinese customs data 
Potential demand is so huge  however  that the EU alone can t satisfy it  U S  producers of ractopamine free pigs could benefit  either by supplying China or making up shortfalls in other regions targeting the Chinese market 
Sixth generation Iowa hog farmer Mike Paustian would certainly like to benefit from producing pigs without ractopamine  even though it helps pigs quickly build lean muscle instead of fat 
Paustian said his buyer at  Tyson Foods  Inc   N TSN   the biggest U S  meatpacker  was considering paying a premium for pork free of ractopamine  which is also banned in the European Union  and that could push some farmers to stop using it 
 That might be enough enticement   Paustian said at his farm in Walcott  Iowa  that sells about 28 000 pigs a year 
Citing competitive reasons  Tyson declined to comment on whether it pays farmers more for pigs raised without the feed additive or if it was offering premiums  The company told Reuters it was looking at diversifying its pork supply to include ractopamine free hogs as demand expands 
 GRAPHIC   Symptons and transmission of African Swine Fever 
 
 A LIFEBOAT 
Rival U S  pork producer Smithfield Foods  which is owned by China s WH Group  HK 0288   already raises all of the hogs on its company owned and contract farms without the drug 
Traders and analysts said Smithfield was reconfiguring its U S  processing operations to direct meat to China  which produced half the world s pork before swine fever decimated the industry 
Diana Souder  a Smithfield spokeswoman  declined to comment on the specific changes but said the company upgraded a plant in Smithfield  Virginia as  part of a broader initiative to better organize our production to meet demand  
 Not just Smithfield  but every U S  pork processor will be shipping more product to China and the demand side is just expected to be strong  certainly into 2020   Smithfield CEO Ken Sullivan told analysts on a call 
The ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington hit U S  pork exports to China last year when its market share halved to 7  from 14  a year earlier  according to Chinese customs data 
But as African swine fever swept across China during the second half of 2018  expectations for demand started to pick up   even though duties on U S  pork going to China were raised to 62  from 12  last year as part of tit for tat trade sanctions 
According to data from the U S  Meat Export Federation  U S  pork exports to China and Hong Kong rose 33  in May from a year earlier to 45 442 tonnes   though exports for the first five months of 2019 were still 7  lower than in 2018 
David Williams  head of strategic sourcing and commodities risk management at U S  company CTI Foods  said U S  hog farmers had already benefited indirectly from swine fever as it had driven up pork prices generally 
The price rises were sorely needed because many U S  farmers had expanded output to supply a string of new U S  processing plants  just as separate U S  trade disputes with Mexico and China hit trade volumes 
 They got a lifeboat   said Williams  adding that increasing demand from China could be an added bonus 
 They re going to have to get this pork from somewhere   said Williams  who formerly led export sales and futures trading for Cargill s meat business unit   The U S  is going to benefit  so is Brazil and Europe  
He said monthly U S  pork exports to China could treble by the end of 2019  assuming the two countries strike a trade deal 
WAREHOUSES EMPTIED
Demand from China is expected to remain strong next year as a plunge in the number of breeding sows means it will take time to rebuild the country s pig stock  As many as half of China s sows may have died  according to industry estimates shared with Reuters 
Pork prices in China have already risen substantially since March and the agricultural ministry has said they could surge by 70 percent in the coming months as a result of the outbreak  Pork accounts for more than 60  of Chinese meat consumption 
 The rebuilding of China s sow herd could also take several years given the potential recontamination risk   ratings agency Fitch said in a July 9 report  which noted swine fever was having a positive impact on Smithfield s debt ratings 
China is not the only country hit  There have been outbreaks of swine fever in Vietnam  Cambodia  Mongolia  North Korea and Laos  It has also already spread across parts of central and eastern Europe and even been found in wild boars in Belgium 
EU export prospects would suffer a massive blow if the disease  which does not harm people  reached top European exporting nations such as Germany or Spain 
European industry sources said a surge in Chinese buying earlier this year had largely emptied warehouses and the flow of pork exports  while still steady  was not quite as strong now due to limited supplies 
ANYONE FOR CHICKEN 
Given the potential for a protracted trade war  U S  farmers may still be wary of being overly dependent on Chinese trade  Canadian pork exporters initially benefited from the surge in demand by exporting more ractopamine free pigs 
But Chinese officials found ractopamine in a Canadian pork shipment in June  Three Canadian exporters have now been banned from selling to China and Beijing has called for all Canadian meat imports to be suspended 
Canada s share of China s pork imports ranged from 11  to 14  in the 2016 2018 period  Chinese customs data shows 
Relations between Canada and China have become strained since the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co  was detained in Vancouver in December on a U S  arrest warrant and charged with wire fraud to violate U S  sanctions against Iran 
Another major pork exporter  Brazil  is expecting to increase shipments by more than 20  in 2019 to almost 800 000 tonnes thanks to Chinese demand  producer group ABPA has said 
Brazil allows the use of ractopamine but has been exporting pork free of the growth drug for about six years  Rui Vargas  a director at ABPA said  More companies are adopting ractopamine free protocols to export pork  he said  declining to name any 
The magnitude of lost pork production in China  however  means some Chinese consumers may need to change their diets 




 Consumers will need to shift part of their pork consumption to other products  This should result in a higher demand for other proteins  particularly poultry meat   the European Commission said ",2019-07-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-farmers-look-past-trade-fears-to-cash-in-on-chinas-hog-crisis-1931015,1931015
179977,401493,TSN,Beyond Meat shares crumble on stock offering surprise  demand for meatless burgers soars,news,"By Tina Bellon and Uday Sampath Kumar
 Reuters    Beyond Meat Inc s  O BYND  shares tumbled on Monday on plans for another stock offering just three months after its IPO while demand for its plant based burgers and sausages prompted an increase in its full year sales forecast 
Trading was volatile and shares fell more than 12  after hours on news of a 3 25 million share offering that includes 3 million shares from selling stockholders 
Proceeds are earmarked to raise funds to expand its manufacturing facilities that are being stretched by booming demand for its meat alternatives  Executives on a call with analysts declined to comment on the offering 
Beyond Meat s shares have surged over 780  since the IPO in May as the company s meat alternatives entered the menus of restaurants such as Carl s Jr and on shelves of grocers including  Kroger Co   N KR  
Plant based meat alternatives have seen booming interest from consumers and restaurants  supporting startups like Beyond Meat and its competitor Impossible Foods  and even sparking interest from veteran meat companies such as  Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  and Perdue Foods  which now offer meat protein products mixed with plants 
 For another growth stock  the top line beat and raises would be enough to see a post market rally  but there are a lot of Beyond Meat investors out there looking for any excuse to sell a stock that has rocketed so much since its IPO   said Kamal Khan  analyst at financial markets platform Investing com 
Beyond Meat products are now sold at more than 53 000 retailers and restaurants worldwide  with demand boosted by the grilling season underway  Beyond Meat s CEO Ethan Brown said on Monday 
At supermarket chain Morton Williams  NYSE WMB   which owns 16 locations across New York City  some customers are buying Beyond Meat burger patties and sausages by the case  according to Victor Colello  the chain s director of meat and fish 
 Beyond Meat is really flying off the shelves  My business with it has almost doubled and we re sold out at times   Colello said  The latest version of the burgers is made from peas  brown rice  sunflower seeds and mung beans 
Net revenue rose nearly four fold to  67 3 million in the three months ended June 29  above Wall Street s estimate of  52 71 million  according to Refinitiv IBES data 
The company said it expects net revenue to rise over 170  to  240 million in 2019  up from the prior  210 million it had forecast just last month 
The El Segundo  California based company reported a net loss of  9 4 million  or a loss 24 cents per share  compared with a loss of  7 4 million  or a loss of  1 22 per share in the year ago period 
NO SIGN OF SLOWING
Karen Formanski  an analyst at Mintel who authored a consumer research report on plant based protein  said there were no signs of the meat alternatives market slowing  with 38  of U S  consumers trying to add more plant based protein to their diet 
 But with growing competition  criticism over processed food and clean eating getting more important  companies will have to adapt and offer more variety than just burgers  Formanski said 
Brown on Monday rejected growing criticism over Beyond Meat s products being overly processed and unhealthy  saying it was not a question of whether they were processed but how 
The company seeks to further diversify its protein sources without relying on genetic modification  Brown said 
 There are an almost endless amount of crops you can pull from   and it is really important that Beyond is leading the effort of bringing new proteins into the market   Brown said 
The CEO said he was confident his company could take on competition from Impossible Foods  which relies on genetically modified soy seeds to produce its burger patties  because of consumers hesitancy surrounding those technologies 
Impossible Foods initially planned to roll out to retail stores this fall  but has continuously pushed back plans due to supply shortages 
Analysts during Monday s call pressed Beyond Meat executives for details on looming supply chain bottlenecks as demand continues to surge 
Brown said the company would expand its in house manufacturing facilities in Missouri  buy new equipment  while continuing to outsource the packaging of its products by adding new partners 
 That s not to say we won t have some periodic disruptions that may create temporary shortages   the CEO said 
Brown said the company currently had a sufficient and continued supply of the protein it needs for its burgers  also thanks to the entry of larger players  including DuPont  N DD   into the pea protein market

The El Segundo  California based company said proceeds from the 250 000 shares offered will be used to expand Beyond Meat s manufacturing facilities and pay for marketing investments 
Beyond Meat s shares have surged more than 780  since its May IPO as the company s meat alternatives entered the menus of restaurants such as Carl s Jr and hit the shelves of grocers  including  Kroger Co   N KR  
Analysts at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in a note on Monday said Beyond Meat s growth opportunity and strong management were already reflected in the company s valuation 
Beyond Meat on Monday beat Wall Street s estimate for revenue in the three months ended June 29  reporting  67 3 million in second quarter sales  It expects  240 million in 2019 net revenue  up from  210 million it forecast just last month 
Alexia Howard  an analyst at Bernstein  said plant based meat alternatives had significant growth potential  with Beyond Meat being well positioned as one of the industry s frontrunners 
According to a research report by Mintel  some 40  of U S  consumers are looking to add more plant based protein to their diet  amid growing concerns about health risks from eating meat  animal welfare and the environmental hazards of intensive animal farming

The rally in crop prices    as wet weather keeps U S  farmers from planting    signals higher feed prices for the animals that the meat companies raise 
Top U S  meat producer Tyson dropped as much as 5  on Wednesday  the most since November  Chicken producer Pilgrim s sank as much as 7   the most since December  Brazilian giants JBS SA and BRF SA led declines in the benchmark Ibovespa equity index 
The selloff may present buying opportunities  said Rebecca Scheuneman  an analyst with Morningstar Investment Service  Crop price gains  will not overcome the margin improvement we expect to see in protein businesses  because pricing will be so much better with the massive protein shortage  coming due to African swine fever in China  she said 
Companies with significant U S  production such as JBS  Pilgrim s and Marfrig Global Foods SA are most impacted in any scenario of tighter feed supplies  according to a report by BTG Pactual analysts led by Thiago Duarte 
 We still think the African swine fever impacts may offset all that   the BTG analysts said 
To be sure  meat companies are still among the best performing stocks this year  JBS is up 84   Pilgrim s Pride has climbed 63  and Tyson has gained 44   China  the biggest hog producer and consumer  is projected to lose 10  of its pork production this year due to the disease  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  The nation s imports are forecast record high in 2019 
That could result in an unprecedented shortfall of pork that will lift global protein prices  Chicken producers are in particular expected to benefit  as a cheaper substitute for pork  China s beef imports are already touching new records  The disease is spreading to other Asian countries  like Vietnam

180001,401517,TSN,Tyson enters crowded plant based meat market with blended proteins,news,"By Tina Bellon
 Reuters    U S  meat processor  Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN  on Thursday launched its first vegetarian and mixed protein products as it joined a growing number of companies catering to rising demand for plant based meat products 
Tyson will sell vegetarian nuggets  blended protein burgers made from beef and pea protein  and sausages and meatballs that combine chicken with plants including chickpeas  black beans and quinoa  the company said in a statement 
The products  under Tyson s new Raised   Rooted brand  will be sold through its customers  sales outlets and foodservice operators  Justin Whitmore  head of Tyson s alternative protein business  said in an interview  declining to elaborate 
The nuggets will be launched in the summer  and burgers in the fall  he added 
The largest U S  meat processor  known for its Ball Park hot dogs and Jimmy Dean sausages  believes the company s long experience in protein product development  manufacturing and distribution puts it in a unique position to enter the plant based market and drive sales across all segments 
Whitmore said it was too early to estimate revenues  calling Tyson s plant based business highly incremental  but he noted that that could change 
 The double digit growth in the sector is largely driven by meat eaters who want the health and nutrition that they perceive to come from plants along with the taste they ve always had from animal protein   Whitmore said  adding that the company was working on additional plant based products 
Tyson Chief Executive Noel White said in a statement the company remained firmly committed to expanding its traditional meat business  but is shifting toward becoming a protein company 
The change comes as many companies are trying to carve out a space in the U S  alternative meat market which analysts estimate to be worth  100 billion by 2035 
California upstarts Beyond Meat Inc and Impossible Foods Inc each sell 100  plant based meat alternatives to retailers and fast food chains across the United States 
Tyson sold its 6 5  stake in Beyond Meat in late April  just days before the company went public  to focus on the development of its own plant based products

180015,401531,TSN,Tyson Set to Profit From Swine Fever Though Timing Uncertain,news," Bloomberg      Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN   says it s poised to take advantage of a hog disease in China that s set to transform the global protein industry  although it can t say for sure when those benefits will start or how big they ll be 
In an earnings release Monday  the top U S  meat processor kept its previous guidance because of the uncertainty over when African swine fever impacts could occur 
Key Insights

Tyson sees swine fever as having  the potential to impact the global protein industry on a level that we have never experienced  

Any impacts probably will occur in late fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 and beyond  as pork prices aren t currently keeping pace with hog costs 


Still   chicken margins disappointed  and this is a key focus for investors   said Heather Jones  managing director at The Vertical Group 
While Tyson s chicken business is set to benefit indirectly from China s woes as consumers there look for cheap protein alternatives  higher pork prices may squeeze margins in Tyson s pork and prepared foods segments given the company buys hogs 
Beyond swine fever  the company delivered a sales forecast that exceeded the average estimate and also beat on quarterly earnings  Tyson has invested in prepared foods and value added items and expanded overseas  That s been helping cushion it from high pork and chicken supplies and costs 

Market Reaction

Tyson shares were down 2 1 percent at 8 39 a m   before the start of regular trading in New York  in a market wide selloff fueled by trade war concerns  The stock has gained 41 percent this year as part of a rally by protein producers 
Some investors expected raised guidance  and President Donald Trump s recent tariff threats are likely pressuring shares  according to Jones

180020,401536,TSN,Veggie Burger Mania Hits Corporate America After Beyond IPO,news," Bloomberg     As hot corporate trends go  crypto and pot are so yesterday  Now  the rush is to get in on anything that smacks of vegetarian meat products 
OK  well  maybe the frenzy isn t quite as intense as those have been  but a few days after  Beyond Meat Inc   s  NASDAQ BYND  stock price was frantically bid up by investors in its trading debut  food companies are rushing to get their veggie burgers to market 
 Tyson Foods  Inc  NYSE TSN   on Monday confirmed it will introduce a meatless protein product in coming months  Tyson  to underscore the announcement  is the biggest meat processor in the U S  McDonald s  NYSE MCD  Corp  just began selling a veggie burger in Germany  Burger King said last week that its Impossible Whopper would go nationwide this year  In July  Whole Foods will start selling a burger made by Lightlife  a competitor to Beyond Meat  Bloomberg Intelligence predicts the Beyond Meat success will push companies like Kellogg Co   Conagra Brands Inc  and Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  Co  to spend more on plant innovation 
The stampede could  of course  turn into a bubble and end up looking like the dot com bust  But after years of being the province of startups and tinkering by Silicon Valley biologists  fake meat has now gone mainstream 
 All the big guys are looking  and everyone is saying  crap  we re already three years behind   said Chris Kerr  co founder and chief investment officer of New Crop Capital  a venture firm with stakes in vegan companies 
It s happening because imitation meat makers like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods Inc  are engineering veggie burgers that are more acceptable to the masses  but it s also about the masses changing their tastes and trying to eat less meat  Indeed  there are signs of a shortage of elite veggie burgers to satisfy consumers at the moment 
Tyson Foods  rapid move from investor to player in the alternative meat space is  a good indication that the hot market of vegetable based proteins will see additional players in the sector   said Will Sawyer  lead animal protein economist at CoBank  The meat giant sold its 6 5 percent stake in Beyond Meat just before the initial public offering 
 That s a very quick evolution for a company that has had a very traditional animal protein business for decades to now expand their products in a way that we wouldn t have expected 10 years ago   Sawyer said   They won t be the last meat company in the industry that will try to participate  
Tyson s timing happens to be perfect for summer grilling  So it is with the new Lightlife burger  which is owned by Canadian meat giant Maple Leaf Foods Inc  According to a release Monday  Lightlife will be available in the meat aisles of thousands of U S  grocery stores  and is coming to Whole Foods starting in July 
McDonald s began selling a veggie burger in Germany    the heart of meat consumption    that s made by Nestle SA  SIX NESN   In its home market  the world s biggest restaurant company s plans for a beef alternative aren t quite as clear  While Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook says McDonald s teams are taking a look at plant based proteins  they could create complications in the kitchens 
 We ll stay close to consumer demand   he said on April 30 in a conference call   Our teams there are paying close attention and discussing this amongst each other  
Kellogg s Morningstar Farms unit  which already makes veggie burgers  will roll out more chicken imitation products  and recently hinted at other innovations  too 
 It s a space where we feel like we have the right to win   Chief Executive Officer Steven Cahillane said on an earnings call   We ll continue to innovate in that space  
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Consumer trends  including health and wellness  animal protection and environmental concerns  continue to gain traction  aiding sales growth prospects for plant based meat substitutes  Millennials are driving this trend  and growing disposable incomes allow them to spend in support of their beliefs     Jennifer Bartashus and Diana Rosero Pena  analysts Click here to view the research 
In the U S   there s a shortage of Impossible burgers  which uses a genetically modified concoction from soy plants and yeast to imitate cattle blood    all to more perfectly mimic the taste of flesh  They re sold at thousands of locations including at White Castle and Burger King 
While veggie burgers have long existed  the ones that are garnering much of the investment are highly engineered alternatives that aim to taste as good as meat  But there s also a flourishing of the lower end stuff as retailers offer their own private label plant burgers 
Grocer Aldi is getting into plant based proteins with vegan burgers under the Earth Grown brand that are much cheaper than Beyond s burgers  which cost  6 to  7 for two  4 ounce patties  The Aldi Earth Grown vegan burgers were introduced last year  and are just  2 79 for a 10 ounce package of four patties  the company says 
To be sure  alternative meat is still tiny compared with animal protein markets    less than one percent of animal protein sales  according to Sawyer  But some people see the makings of a bubble 
 It s crazy  there are companies like in a one car garage to large companies that see the markets changing by the attitude of the millennials   said Henk Hoogencamp  a board member and adviser for several food companies  including the alternative dairy protein startup  Perfect Day   Some of them will succeed  and most of them will fail  
Not every vegetable based burger has succeeded  Wendy s Co  a few years back tried selling a black bean burger  but it never really took off  There was substantial customer interest in some areas  but not in others  said spokeswoman Heidi Schauer 
Big food companies are  setting up investment arms and emerging company areas  but it s too little  too late  and they re still trying to catch up with the curve   said Lou Biscotti  national food and beverage practice leader for Marcum LLP  an accounting firm

The company s pork sales volumes and prices decreased in the first quarter  according to a statement Thursday on earnings  While chicken volumes rose after acquisitions  sales prices still fell  Shares dropped in pre market trading 
The meat giant has been battling lackluster market conditions for some time as a boom in American meat production has dragged prices lower  Tariffs from key trading partners  including China  further added to the glut amid pressure on U S  exports  To combat the volatility  the company has pushed to expand its global presence while also focusing on offering more value added products  like chicken nuggets  Earlier Thursday  Tyson said it is purchasing six facilities from Brazil s BRF SA for  340 million  including operations in Asia and the U K 
Commodity companies have struggled to boost profits as changing tastes and a fast paced lifestyle mean consumers prefer specialty items and easy to cook meals  That s pushed Tyson and its rivals to focus on products such as pre cut meat  In 2017 and 2018  Tyson spent more than  7 billion on takeovers  including a  2 5 billion deal to buy chicken nugget maker Keystone Foods 
Earlier this week  CNBC reported Tyson held talks to buy closely held meat company Foster Farms for about  2 billion  Foster Farms sells poultry products like seasoned chicken cuts  ground turkey and frozen chicken nuggets and strips  according to its website  It also produces deli meats and frozen corn dogs 
While Tyson s sales missed estimates  earnings per share were  1 58  compared with  1 56 forecast by analysts  The company affirmed its guidance for the full fiscal year

 We re going to be making significant investments in the space   Whitmore said in an interview with Bloomberg   The companies and ecosystem that are in place to provide protein to the world can do the same thing for alternative protein    the mechanics of the supply chain all the way from the farm to your plate don t necessarily change  
Food giants have been investing increasingly in vegetarian and vegan brands this year  as plant based food sales grew 20 percent to  3 3 billion in 2018  according to data from Nielsen and the Plant Based Foods Association 
Through its ventures unit  Tyson has already made deals with vegetarian burger maker Beyond Meat and mushroom protein company MycoProtein  But Whitmore said it s now ready to develop its own products and expects it to be a  material part of the business  going forward 
Farming Evolution
The company hasn t decided on brand names  whether to target food service or retail  or what kind of protein it will use  But it says the move is part of a necessity for agriculture to evolve  Agriculture    as one of the world s biggest sources of global greenhouse gas emissions    faces significant supply threats in a warming world 
Whitmore said the company  which largely relies on independent farmers  wants to help its supply chain diversify and expects consumers in the future will be open to all kinds of protein    even from a large meat company

180124,401640,TSN,Trade war puts the hoof into U S  pig part exports to China,news,"By Tom Polansek CHICAGO  Reuters    Before the U S  China trade war  American pig processors exported nine out of every 10 pigs  feet and heads they shipped overseas to China and Hong Kong   for prices higher than they would fetch anywhere else  Those parts and others that most Americans won t eat   hearts  tongues  stomachs  entrails   have a special place in Chinese culinary culture and  consequently  in the profit margins of U S  pork exporters   You often hear that the products are what keep the plants running   said Erin Borror  economist for U S  Meat Export Federation  a trade group  The pipeline for these profitable pig parts  known collectively as offal  is closing fast after China slapped two tariffs on U S  pork totaling 50 percent  That s forcing U S  processors to sell an increasing amount of such parts for pennies to be rendered into food for pets and livestock  U S  shipments of byproducts affected by the duties fell by about a third in April and May combined  after China imposed the first 25 percent tariff on American pork in April  according to the latest data from the U S  Department of Agriculture   On July 6  Beijing implemented an additional 25 percent duty as the world s two largest economies slapped tariffs on  34 billion worth of each others  goods  U S  President Donald Trump has said the U S  tariffs   which have provoked equivalent Chinese retaliation   aim to close the  335 billion annual U S  trade deficit with China   The USDA declined to comment on the drop in offal exports  Exporting pig offal to China has been a money maker because consumers there enjoy its strong flavor  Stewed pigs  feet with white beans  for instance  is a famous dish from Sichuan province  one of the country s culinary capitals  At least one product exported to China has almost zero value anywhere else  hind pigs  feet  Rear feet are nearly impossible to sell elsewhere because they have holes in them from where hogs are hung upside down in packing houses  which turns off consumers in other countries  said Dermot Hayes  an agricultural economist at Iowa State University   They go from zero value outside of China to a significant value when the Chinese market is fully open   Hayes said  ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIES OF STOMACHS  LIVERS China will likely have little trouble finding supplies to replace U S  pig offal  analysts said   An expansion of its domestic hog industry had already made buyers less dependent on American pork before the trade tensions   Chinese buyers could also import more from Europe  where hog prices have been trading at their lowest levels in at least two years  analysts said    The Chinese aren t going to get hurt by this   said Ken Maschhoff  chairman of The Maschhoffs  the largest family owned U S  pork producer   Chile or Europe or somebody else is going to say   Well  we ve got a bunch of stomachs or livers or feet that we re not using      The slowdown hurts major processors in the United States  such as WH Group Ltd s  HK 0288  Smithfield Foods Inc  Seaboard Foods  a division of  Seaboard Corp   A SEB   and the JBS USA unit of Brazil s JBS SA  SA JBSS3   Such companies benefited from record total U S  offal sales of more than  1 1 billion in 2017   Smithfield  the biggest U S  pork processor and exporter to China  declined to comment  The company  owned by China based WH Group  sells offal  jowls and lard  according to its website  Meat processor  Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  also declined to comment  Seaboard and JBS did not respond to requests for comment  Margins for U S  pork processors are under pressure due to the impact of the trade fight and last month slipped to their lowest level in three years  WH Group s stock price has tumbled 28 percent so far this year  Tyson shares are down 19 percent and Seaboard shares have dropped 13 percent   860 MILLION IN LOSSES The average value of U S  offal exports to China was about 76 cents per pound in 2017  according to the U S  Meat Export Federation   If packers do not sell them elsewhere for human consumption  the byproducts will be rendered in the United States for about 18 cents per pound   a decrease equating to a loss of  1 55 per hog for the volume exported to China  the federation said  Overall  it estimated lower offal prices could translate into losses of  860 million for the U S  pork industry over the next year  Processors will try to pass on losses to farmers by paying less for live hogs  Hayes said   It is the pork farmer who suffers   he said  Lower demand also has processors rendering more offal into animal feed  according to the federation  Prices in that segment could come under pressure  however  as more processors try to grab market share  Ohio based JH Routh Packing Company sells most of its offal to feed animals at less than 20 cents per pound  sales manager Tony Stearns said    Everybody who can sell the stuff   he said about offal   they re pretty much selling everything they can   Pet food makers could use more offal in their products in response to an increase of supply  said Dana Brooks  president of the Pet Food Institute  an industry group that represents the pet units of companies including Nestle SA  S NESN   which sells Purina  and Mars Inc  which sells the Pedigree and Whiskas

180149,401665,TSN,As U S  shrinks refugee operations  new arrivals in Kansas town lose a lifeline,news,"By Mica Rosenberg GARDEN CITY  Kansas  Reuters    In his first whirlwind weeks in the United States  Wimber Htoo  23  racked up a list of accomplishments  He learned to use the bus  applied for a social security card and obtained a state ID  all new experiences for Htoo  a member of the Karen minority who fled Myanmar as a teenager for a refugee camp in Thailand  But the most daunting challenge facing Htoo as a resettled refugee in Garden City  Kansas still loomed  finding work  Through all the confusing experiences since they arrived in February  Htoo  his wife Htoo Say and their 2 year old child had been guided by a refugee center run by the non profit International Rescue Committee  IRC   one of nine designated resettlement agencies in the country  Now  on an overcast March morning  staff members were eager to help him land a job quickly   They were up against a deadline  in September the office will close  leaving Htoo and other recent refugees in the area without a key source of support as they start their new lives  Across the United States this year  two dozen resettlement offices  which are partially funded by the federal government  will be shuttered  Dozens more are being downsized  The closing of offices receiving fewer than 100 refugees per year  first reported by Reuters  were directed by the U S  State Department in response to sharp cutbacks in the number of refugees accepted by the United States under President Donald Trump   The closure of the offices will make it more difficult for recently arrived refugees to become productive members of their new communities  refugee advocates say  This runs counter to the Trump administration s stated desire for refugees to assimilate quickly  both to promote national security and to hasten self sufficiency  Generally  refugees are eligible for at least a month of intense case management and about  1 000 in cash assistance from the government  After that  they can receive up to five more years of services at the centers  including help navigating immigration matters  healthcare  and school enrollment  Half a dozen Garden City refugees interviewed by Reuters said the assistance made their transitions far smoother   Critics of the U S  refugee program  including Trump  say government resources are better spent helping refugees abroad  nearer their original homes   The closure of the center will remove support for more than 250 people the IRC has resettled in Garden City since opening in 2014  as well as for hundreds of refugees who initially landed in other states and moved to the region   Amy Longa  the center s director has been scrambling to quickly assist new refugees like Htoo and his family  organizing their important records in three ring binders for them to keep when the center closes  helping them spend their cash assistance as quickly as possible so they don t lose it and scrambling to make sure job placements are completed    I am trying to get the message across that we are not going to be here  so you better get your act together fast   she said  RISKS  COSTS Trump campaigned on a promise to reduce the number of refugees  citing security risks  Soon after his inauguration in January 2017  he temporarily suspended refugee admissions   The program was restarted in October with new guidelines and a sharply reduced cap of 45 000 refugees  the lowest level since 1980   A State Department official said the agency said closing about 15 percent of the nation s resettlement centers was appropriate given the lower number of refugees   We are really trying hard to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars   the official said   Our responsibility here is to continue to manage program that remains nationwide in scope even if that doesn t necessarily mean in every state and every town   Between 2015 and 2017  the Garden City office resettled about 90 people per year  In the first months of the 2018 fiscal year  the number dwindled to 12   In late March  just five weeks after Htoo s arrival  Longa helped him fill out an application for work at the nearby Tyson  N TSN  meatpacking plant  where many area refugees have found their first jobs   When she asked about his work history  he shyly explained that his only experience was as a volunteer runner in his refugee camp  delivering messages and recruiting other volunteers   Speaking through an interpreter  Longa was encouraging  She told him she  too  had been a refugee after fleeing Uganda and understood the work he described    Those skills are transferable   she said   You can put it down as your past work history    PITCHING IN  Employers  local businesses and government offices in the area say one reason the refugee program has worked in the town of 26 000 residents is that the center pitches in when problems arise   When a Somali woman become inexplicably upset during a gynecological examination  her doctor called Longa  who learned from the woman that she was concerned about revealing she had undergone female genital mutilation in her home country  Officials at the Department of Motor Vehicles have called Longa to confirm that identity documents refugees provide are valid  A local pastor said he called her for advice about comforting grieving refugees in his congregation  Teachers call for help communicating with refugee parents about their children    I don t know what we are going to do without them here   said Kayte Fulton  director of community health at St  Catherine Hospital  echoing concerns also voiced by the police chief and the superintendent of schools   No one has the skill set that the IRC does    Even with the center in place  tensions over the refugee influx in the town have occasionally boiled over   In 2016  the Justice Department uncovered a plot by an anti Muslim militia group to blow up a Garden City apartment complex where many Somali refugees lived  After news of the plot broke  Longa said she fielded calls from nearly a dozen anxious refugees  many of whom had fled their home countries because of violence directed at them  Longa participated with police and local leaders at a community forum for refugees and other town residents to calm tensions   Janette Uwimana  28  who fled the Democratic Republic of Congo with her family when she was 14 and grew up in a camp in Uganda  has leaned heavily on the center    Uwimana said she comes to the office at least four times a month  getting help with confusing forms or picking up donated clothing and furniture for her and her new baby   They have helped me with everything   Uwimana said through an interpreter   It s like losing my own parents   
Htoo  meanwhile  is pushing ahead  grateful for the help he has gotten from the center since his arrival  On April 20  he started a job butchering beef at the Tyson meatpacking plant where the starting salary is  16 30 per hour ",2018-05-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/as-us-shrinks-refugee-operations-new-arrivals-in-kansas-town-lose-a-lifeline-1457117,1457117

180233,401749,TSN,U S  chicken processor profits fatten on cheap feed,news,"By Tom Polansek and Jo Winterbottom CHICAGO  Reuters    U S  meat producers are earning some of the highest profit margins in more than a decade  a bright spot for investors in agriculture  where grain farmers and trading companies are struggling to make money after years of massive oversupply  Profits have soared and share prices are close to record highs for chicken processors such as Sanderson Farms and Pilgrim s Pride  With another bumper grain harvest expected this year  prices for feed should stay low  That  combined with robust demand for protein  could keep profits strong well into 2018  Cheap grains are also boosting profits for companies that fatten up cattle before slaughter and even for the big meat processors  such as Cargill  which buy the animals but not the grain to feed them   Margins are excellent   Joe Sanderson  chief executive officer of Sanderson Farms  told Reuters last month   Grain prices are similar to a year ago  and prices for our products are higher than they were a year ago   It has been nearly 10 years since the corn and soybeans used in animal feed were so cheap for so long  with prices languishing under a glut of grain from four bumper harvests  At the same time  U S  per capita consumption of chicken is expected to hit a record high this year  according to National Chicken Council annual data that runs from 1965  Consumption of red meat is forecast to be the highest since 2009  Consumers  increasing appetite for protein and improvements in the U S  economy have driven up meat consumption  Chicken sales have benefited because it is cheaper and considered healthier than beef and pork   Soaring demand means retail prices have not fallen substantially  even though feed prices are low  Retail chicken prices in 2016 were just 11 cents off the 2014 high of  1 53 per pound  Prices hit highs for beef in 2015 and for pork in 2014  and they remain close to those levels  But as beef prices have come down  consumers have bought more  according to Cargill Inc  one of the world s largest suppliers of ground beef  The privately held company swung to an operating profit in the quarter ended May 31 from a loss a year ago on the back of strong demand for poultry and beef   If you have low grain prices for a sustained period of time  ultimately that translates into lower beef prices   Chief Financial Officer Marcel Smits told Reuters  High profit margins in meat production stand in stark contrast to the fortunes of crop producers and grain merchants such as Archer Daniels Midland Co and Bunge Ltd  These companies are struggling to profit from international grain trading due to the global glut  CHICKEN CHAMPIONS The clearest winners among meat producers are poultry firms  which get a direct benefit from cheap feed because they own and feed the birds that they slaughter  Sanderson Farms  the third largest U S  poultry producer  is so confident grain prices will stay low that it is buying small amounts of feed to cover short term needs  Chief Financial Officer Mike Cockrell told Reuters  Last year  in contrast  the

dividends totaling  8 52 per share in 2015 and 2016  FAT PROFITS In beef production  the privately held companies that fatten up cattle on feedlots  are seeing record profits for 2017  according to Jim Robb  an analyst at the Livestock Marketing Information Center  Gary Vetter  a farmer who raises cattle and corn in Iowa  put it this way  corn growers are  subsidizing the feedlot   Smithfield Foods  the world s largest pork producer  said feed makes up over 65 percent of the cost of producing hogs and that the company s ability to source high quality grain at low cost gives it a competitive advantage  It buys grain for farmers who raise hogs for the company under production contracts   Low grain prices are good for the pork industry   Smithfield spokeswoman Heather Houston said in an emailed statement  Smithfield  bought by China s WH Group Ltd in 2013  no longer makes financial information available to the public  John Prestage  whose family owns Prestage Farms which

180245,401761,TSN,Tyson Foods  TSN  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This meat producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 6  
Revenues are expected to be  11 11 billion  up 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tyson 
For Tyson  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 37  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Tyson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tyson would post earnings of  1 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 21  delivering a surprise of  1 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Tyson appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tyson-foods-tsn-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200503308,200503308

Heading into today  shares of the meat producer had lost 7 28  over the past month  lagging the Consumer Staples sector s loss of 1 53  and the S P 500 s gain of 1 18  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from TSN as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 6  2020  The company is expected to report EPS of  1 70  up 7 59  from the prior year quarter  Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  11 11 billion  up 9 04  from the year ago period

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for TSN  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Within the past 30 days  our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant  TSN currently has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Looking at its valuation  TSN is holding a Forward P E ratio of 12 51  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 12 6  so we one might conclude that TSN is trading at a discount comparatively

180248,401764,TSN,This Is Why Tyson Foods  TSN  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  in Focus
Tyson Foods  TSN  is headquartered in Springdale  and is in the Consumer Staples sector  The stock has seen a price change of  9 24  since the start of the year  The meat producer is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 42 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 03   This compares to the Food   Meat Products industry s yield of 0 01  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 81  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 68 is up 12  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Tyson Foods has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 40 16   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Tyson s payout ratio is 27   which means it paid out 27  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
TSN is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is  6 75 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 23 63  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  TSN presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2020-02-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-tyson-foods-tsn-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200504008,200504008

180250,401766,TSN,Simple Secrets Anyone Can Use To Reach Early Retirement   February 05  2020,opinion,"Accomplishing the financial cushion to retire early is a fantasy for most  Bringing the fantasy to reality is not as difficult as it sounds  The key is straightforward  Save significantly more every month  Sounds simple  correct  One moment 
Usually  advisors advise 15  to 20  of total income saved every month as an objective   yet in the event that you want to retire earlier  you likely need to tighten that number up to 40  or half of your pay  Not a discipline easily practiced when you review or consider that a substantial segment of your paycheck goes to basic  non  negotiable lifestyle needs  But if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle adjustments and trade offs  it s achievable 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration 
The first point is to adhere to the key principles of long term investing  including developing a diversified portfolio that includes stocks with various styles  sizes  sectors and regions 
To accelerate the retirement investment cycle  you can construct a portfolio designed with more risk   and the potential for higher returns   but it should still be appropriately diversified to protect against larger than average market drawdowns that can be difficult to recover from and ruin any chance to accomplish your early retirement goal  There are numerous ways to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should depend on your age  your risk tolerance  your growth and income needs  and your long term goals 
Once you have accelerated your savings and put an ongoing plan in place  invest your savings into your portfolio as soon as possible  Don t try to time the market  Leave your portfolio alone  and let the compounding nature of the markets do its magic to help grow your retirement nest egg exponentially over time 
You may want to look at growth stocks with attributes acceptable for retirement investing like low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth 
The Zacks Rank routinely recognizes lower risk growth retirement portfolio picks  and here are a few that may be worth considering  Summit Financial  SMMF   Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  and Cambridge  CATC   These growth stocks have strong Zacks Ranks and a beta of 1 or lower  with earnings and sales growth of at least 5  over the past 5 years

180262,401778,TSN,U S  farm lobby turns up heat on Trump team as NAFTA talks near,news,"By Richard Cowan WASHINGTON  Reuters    With talks to renegotiate the NAFTA trade pact just weeks away  U S  farm groups and lawmakers from rural states are intensifying lobbying of President Donald Trump s administration with one central message  leave farming out of it   Trump blames the North American Free Trade Agreement   the  worst trade deal ever  in his words   for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in America s favor  But for U S  farmers the 23 year old pact secures access to stable  lucrative markets in Mexico and Canada that now account for over a quarter of U S  farm exports   Graphic    Now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for U S  manufacturers   Perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced   said Joe Schuele  a spokesman for the U S  Meat Export Federation in Denver  Colorado  Another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open ended trade talks could drive Mexico to alternative suppliers of grains  dairy products  beef and pork  Mexico became even more crucial after Trump s pullout from a vast Pacific Rim trade pact negotiated under Barack Obama dashed farmers  hopes of free access to more markets   Next week  U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to outline the administration s goals for the NAFTA talks to Congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make Lighthizer s list  Operating under the umbrella of the U S  Food and Agriculture Dialogue for Trade  more than 130 commodity groups and agribusiness giants since Trump s inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters  public comments to USTR and face to face meetings with top officials who have Trump s ear   Our first ask is to do no harm   said Cassandra Kuball  the head of the umbrella group  Lobbyists said that Lighthizer  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been receptive  but the wild card is how Trump ultimately will come down on the talks  They also wonder what concessions Mexico will seek from Washington in the talks due to start in mid August  Among the groups involved are the American Soybean Association  Corn Refiners Association and National Grain and Feed Association and firms such as Land O Lakes  Inc    Tyson Foods   N TSN   Inc   Louis Dreyfus Company North America  Archer Daniels Midland Co  and others  For example  U S  cotton producers  marketers and shippers in mid June warned the Trump administration that any weakening of NAFTA  would threaten the health of the U S  industry and the jobs of the 125 000 Americans employed by it   QUADRUPLING EXPORTS Annual U S  farm exports to Mexico have grown from about  4 billion in 1994  when NAFTA began  to an estimated  18 5 billion this year  With Canada included  that number is forecast to reach  40 billion  quadrupling under NAFTA  Republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed Trump in the 2016 election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers  case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices  Pat Roberts  Republican senator from Kansas  who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee  said he used an unexpected invitation for a private White House meeting with Trump to plug in agriculture s cause in NAFTA and beyond   He  Trump  wanted to know what was happening in farmland   Roberts said   I told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong  robust  predictable trade policy  it s going to make life much more difficult in farm country   Roberts said of the 45 minute meeting in late June  In May  18 Republican senators  mainly from pro Trump farming states  wrote the administration about the  tremendous growth  in U S  trade with Mexico and Canada as a result of NAFTA   Efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences   they warned  Trump s pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with Mexico also vex farm state lawmakers    What I really need is a good  solid immigration system   South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said  Given his state s low unemployment rate of just around 2 8 percent  farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor  he said   STORM OVER SUNNY SLOPE Agriculture Secretary Perdue got a taste of farmers  angst when met cattle ranchers in Nebraska on May 20  The event was held shortly after Washington agreed with China to resume beef exports  but some 60 ranchers who gathered at U S  Senator Deb Fischer s Sunny Slope Ranch quickly turned to NAFTA    If the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in Mexico and Canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out   said Pete McClymont  executive vice president of Nebraska Cattlemen  summarizing the discussion  While lobbying in Washington  some Republican lawmakers have also met with Mexico s ambassador and U S  farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by Trump s  America First  mantra   The common comment is   why are you here  The problem is not with us  The problem is in Washington  Why are you talking to us    said Tom Sleight  president and CEO of the U S  Grains Council   The new normal is that feed buyers  millers  grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources   he said  It will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was  Meantime  some are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt  Daryl Haack  a corn and soybean farmer from Primghar in northwest Iowa  like others fears retaliation from either Canada or Mexico  but is optimistic it will not come to that

180277,401793,TSN,Is Tyson Foods  TSN  A Suitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tyson Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 72  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 08  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Tyson Foods  current PE ratio somewhat above its midpoint  which is 13 51  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 60  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Tyson Foods has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 50  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Tyson Foods  stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tyson Foods has a P S ratio of about 0 79  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 47 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms     Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tyson Foods currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes TSN a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Tyson Foods might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A  This gives TSN a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter consensus estimate has risen 5 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has nudged up 1 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tyson Foods  Inc  Price and Consensus    Even though Tyson Foods has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTyson Foods is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 39  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act

180278,401794,TSN,Powerful Proof Anyone Can Invest For An Early Retirement   January 28  2020,opinion,"Accomplishing the financial cushion to retire early is a fantasy for most  Bringing the fantasy to reality is not as difficult as it sounds  The key is straightforward  Save significantly more every month  Sounds simple  correct  One moment 
Typically  advisors peg 15  to 20  of total income saved each month as a goal   but if you want to retire earlier  you probably have to ratchet that number up to 40  or 50  of your income  Not a feat easily accomplished when you review your take into account that a good portion of your paycheck goes to essential  non negotiable lifestyle items  However  if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle changes and sacrifices  it s possible 
A generally new development called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been created around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  idea  FIRE supporters create exacting savings plans  up to 75  of income  and make related compromises like living in small homes  walking to work every day  prohibitive weight control plans  etc  This way might be unreasonably prohibitive for many  yet the mentality offers a few takeaways that may merit consideration

180301,401817,TSN,U S  farm heartland lobbies to steer Trump away from Mexico trade war,news,By Jason Lange and Alexandra Alper GARNER  Iowa MEXICO CITY  Reuters    Farmers in the U S  agricultural heartland that helped elect Donald Trump are now pushing his administration to avoid a trade dispute with Mexico  fearing retaliatory tariffs that could hit over  3 billion in U S  exports  The value of exports at risk is based on a Reuters analysis of a tariff list which Mexico used in a trucking dispute six years ago and which Mexican officials have said could serve as a model if President Trump sets new barriers to Mexican goods   Pork producers contacted Trump s transition team soon after the Nov  8 election to stress that tariff free access to Mexico has made it their top export market by volume  said John Weber  president of the National Pork Producers Council  The council has sent the administration multiple letters  including one signed in January by 133 agricultural organizations  and is arranging for several hog farmers to fly to Washington next month to talk to officials   We just keep pounding them on how critical trade is to us   said Weber  who fears Mexico could revive the list of mostly agricultural products it successfully used to push Washington into letting Mexican truckers on U S  highways in 2011   Pork products topped that list and  if revived  the tariffs would apply to over  800 million of annual pork exports  according to data compiled by IHS Markit s Global Trade Atlas   We ll be the first to take the hit   Weber said   The lobbying effort by U S  businesses which rely on the Mexican market shows how Mexico can press its case in Washington despite having an economy 1 17 the size of America s and relying on the U S  market for nearly 80 percent if its exports  In Iowa  where pigs outnumber people seven to one  hog and grain farmer Jamie Schmidt voted for Trump in part on his promise to cut regulatory burdens for businesses  Now he and others who farm the flat  rich land around Garner  Iowa  worry about trade  Schmidt gets about half of his income from hogs  earning  4 5 for each of the 425 pigs he sells per week  usually to a  Tyson Foods   N TSN  packing plant in nearby Perry  Iowa   Tariffs from Mexico could depress U S  wholesale prices and wipe out his profits  Schmidt said   It would be devastating    IN THE CROSSHAIRS In December  after fears of a trade dispute fueled a deep peso  slump  Mexico started mapping out U S  states that are most reliant on its market  replicating the strategy it used in the trucking dispute  said two senior Mexican officials  Mexican officials also prepared briefs  seen by Reuters  on Mexico s own risks in a dispute  including losing much of its cost advantage in building cars  such as the Ford Fusion  N F  made in Hermosillo  Mexico   Reuters could not verify a complete list of products and states Mexico considered targeting this time around  But the country s foreign minister said last month tariffs could target Iowa  which raises a third of U S  hogs and exports about a quarter of its pork production   100 million of which went to Mexico last year  The minister also said tariffs could aim at Wisconsin  the center of U S  cheese production  and has singled out Texas for its  notable  trade surplus with Mexico  All three states voted for Trump in the 2016 election  with the president taking Iowa and Wisconsin by slim margins  Trump has accused Mexico of destroying U S  jobs and has vowed to leave the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate better terms with Mexico  United States went from running a small trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a  63 billion deficit in 2016  Besides pork  cheese was also a top target in the trucking dispute in which Mexico retaliated with tariffs against rules that banned its trucks from U S  roads  Some  200 million in current annual exports of cheese would be targeted if the tariff list were revived  according to the IHS database  which the U S  government uses to measure the impact of trade disputes  The full tariff list would apply to  3 25 billion in current U S  exports  John Holevoet  the director of government affairs at Wisconsin s Dairy Business Association  said he has attended multiple meetings with Wisconsin federal lawmakers this year where risks of Mexican trade were discussed  Weber of the pork producers group said he believed the Trump administration  gets it  when it comes to the vulnerability of U S  farm exports  Republican Congressman Steve King  who represents Iowa s agriculture focused fourth district  also pointed out that Iowa s role as the first state to hold presidential primaries helps keep farm interests in Washington s view  But King told Reuters he was worried the White House is still not taking trade risks seriously enough   A possible 20 percent tax on Mexican imports  which White House spokesman Sean Spicer has said could also pay for Trump s proposed border wall  would cause a trade war  he said  King said he has been in contact with the White House on the matter but has yet to secure a one on one meeting with the president   I m making sure that here in Washington they know what this means

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a crackdown on Chinese shipping companies and tanker firms for continuing to carry Iranian crude after sanctions waivers ended in May  President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced completion of an agreement that will greatly improve access for U S  red meat imports to Japan  There was also more progress on U S  China trade  This came even as President Trump laid out his case for his tough stance on China trade  Trump said that   For decades the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith  Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms  it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers  heavy state subsidies  currency manipulation  product dumping  forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale   Trump said  China apparently listened and despite his tough talk on China  President Trump said there would be more Chinese purchases of U S  agricultural products   That came quickly as China reportedly bought close to 100 000 tons of pork from pork exporters including Smithfield Foods Inc   owned by China s WH Group Ltd   and  Tyson Foods   NYSE TSN  Inc 
Crude oil  for its part  filled the gap that was left after the gap opening after the drone and missile attack on the Saudi oil facilities  The reason why we had the opportunity to fill the gap was due in part to the dollar or more impeachment crude price drop  Oh sure  there was talk about the quick return of Saudi oil production  yet no one is telling us how they plan to process that crude with their processing plant that will be down longer than expected  There are claims that Abqaiq is back at pre attack processing capacity levels of 4 5 million barrels of oil per day but there are many who doubt that  The 1 45 million barrel a day Khurais oil field reportedly is producing 1 3 million barrels a day   That puts the market in a vulnerable technical situation  That allowed the market to get close to the gap  The gap was filled within seconds of the release of the Energy Information Administration  EIA  status report that was bearish  based off expectations  but not as bearish as the price action that came because of the impeachment price drop 
The EIA reported that U S  commercial crude oil inventories increased by 2 4 million barrels from the previous week most of that in Cushing  Oklahoma  At 419 5 million the EIA says that put supply at the five year average for this time of year  Gasoline inventories increased by 0 5 million barrels last week and are about 4  above the five year average for this time of year  Yet a 3 million barrel drop in distillate supply was supportive even as supply is 7  above average for this time of year  Once the gap was filled the crude oil market closed back above a key moving average but not higher on the day  A strong close today should solidify a bottom and we more than likely then have set the low for the year  That is barring any major breakdowns in stocks or China talks  
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  also reported that U S  gasoline prices saw the biggest one week spike since Hurricane Harvey   As of Monday  September 23  2019  the U S  average retail gasoline price increased by more than 10 cents per gallon  gal  from the previous Monday  based on data in the U S  Energy Information Administration s  EIA  Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update  This weekly increase was the largest since early September 2017  when the national average gasoline price rose 28 cents gal in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey  EIA surveys retail gasoline and diesel fuel stations each Monday morning  In its Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update  EIA estimates that slightly more than half of the regular retail gasoline price in August 2019 was based on the price of crude oil  Other components  such as taxes  18  of the price  and distribution and marketing costs and profits  17    tend to fluctuate less than refining costs and profits  12   and crude oil prices  53   
As we have said before  the most important fuel source for the next 50 years is going to be liquefied natural gas  Today Reuters reported that   Record investments of  50 billion have turned 2019 into a banner year for liquefied natural gas  LNG   with Canada and the United States being the main drivers  the chief of the International Energy Agency  IEA  said on Thursday  The industrial sector is Asia s biggest driver of LNG growth  with China expected to overtake Japan as the world s top importer of the fuel in five years  said Fatih Birol  the agency s executive director   This year  2019 already broke the highest amount of  final investment decisions  for the first time ever   50 billion   he told the annual LNG Producer Consumer conference in Tokyo  More than 170 billion cubic meters  bcm  of natural gas liquefaction capacity is due to take a final investment decision this year  a record far surpassing the previous high in 2005 of 70 bcm  according to the IEA  The recent boost in contracting activity and project sanctioning follows the growing adoption of the equity offtake marketing structure  where companies have access to LNG volumes according to their equity stake  reducing the need for long term sale and purchase agreements  the agency said in a report released this month ",2019-09-26,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-phil-flynn-energy-report-09262019-200468286,200468286

180350,401866,TSN,Tyson Foods  TSN  Matches Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 47 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  1 50 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this meat producer would post earnings of  1 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 20  delivering a surprise of 7 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Tyson  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Meat Products industry  posted revenues of  10 89 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 01   This compares to year ago revenues of  10 05 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Tyson shares have added about 49 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17  
What s Next for Tyson 
While Tyson has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Tyson was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

180351,401867,TSN,Global Stocks Struggle  Bitcoin Rebounds ,opinion,"Forex Market Overview


The Australian and New Zealand dollars both saw major declines to a fresh multi month low and down for a twelfth consecutive day  The devaluation of the Chinese yuan weighed on the Australian currency alongside with dismal data 

But in the U S   despite the Federal Reserve decided to lower interest rates  the US dollar still managed to enjoy a relative value increase last week  There aren t going to be any major reports coming up this week  but we ll keep a close eye on how the ongoing trade war is reflected in the currency market 

The Canadian dollar had an up and down week last week  largely attributed to ongoing trade tensions  Meanwhile  a conservative future forecast along with possible easing measures caused the euro to struggle 

Elsewhere  we saw the pound have yet another negative week  which was mostly due to the increased likelihood of a hard Brexit  Additionally  pessimistic forecasts from the Bank of England are causing many forex traders to look elsewhere 

In Asia  the Japanese yen enjoyed a positive week  indirectly benefiting from trade disputes within the region  
Stock Market Overview


The stock market opened the week with a very bearish dive  watching the DOW fall by more than 800 points  Until the trade issues with China can be dissolved  most American stocks can be expected to struggle 
 Among some of the biggest losers from this week s stock plunge were Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   arms manufacturers  and large scale miners  Foods and agricultural products also experienced a major downturn something that is notably rare for this time of the year 

There will be a lot to pay attention to over the course of the next week  Companies tied to the yuan  luxury items  agricultural goods are expected to have a volatile couple of days  We ll also pay attention to the actions of the Federal Reserve and see how its policies are reflected throughout the stock market 
Crypto Market Overview

While global stocks have been struggling  Bitcoin has been able to turn things around  In fact  after falling from  13 000 to around  9 000  the coin has rebounded and is currently trading over  11 700  If the other global markets cannot correct themselves  investing in the crypto market may seem like a comparatively less risky option 

Taking a Closer Look at BTC USD

After breaking above the neckline of the double bottom chart pattern we identified last week  Bitcoin has also confirmed above the daily   However  as it normally happens with the Ichimoku theory  the pair is now pulling back towards the upper band of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo 




BTC USD   Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis based on Ichimoku
As China continues to soften its stance on crypto and take measures against the Yuan  we can expect Bitcoin to continue its impressive value increase  Elsewhere in the industry  Litecoin s decision to half its payments to miners will likely cause it to decrease in value 
Samsung s commitment to offering a series of new crypto apps will likely benefit both the company  along with the industry as a whole  Other companies we ll keep an eye on this week include MasterCard and Nokia  HE NOKIA   Amid ongoing tensions in most other markets  the world s top crypto players are hoping to have a productive August 

On top of this  Bitcoin has generally been inversely correlated to the US stock market as many institutional investors have been using it as a hedge  With a potential rate cut by the Fed this week  the US stock could see further gains  Double down on that if the Fed hints on more cuts in 2019

180358,401874,TSN,U S  launches second WTO complaint in China chicken trade dispute,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Obama administration on Tuesday brought a fresh challenge to China s anti dumping duties on U S  broiler chicken products at the World Trade Organization in an effort to bring the long running trade dispute to a close 
The U S  Trade Representative s office said it is making claims that China s anti dumping and countervailing duties violate WTO rules  partly because China failed to properly calculate U S  poultry production costs 
China also failed to conduct transparent investigations and breached WTO rules in its finding that U S  poultry exports have injured Chinese producers  USTR said 
The complaint is the 12th challenge brought by the Obama administration against China at the WTO and marks its second objection following China s 2010 imposition of anti dumping duties on U S  broiler chicken products of up to 105 4 percent and anti subsidy duties of up to 30 3 percent 
It comes at a time of increasing U S  China trade tensions as China s economic slowdown has flooded markets worldwide with exports of manufactured goods 
U S  steel and aluminum producers have filed several major anti dumping complaints against China in recent weeks with the U S  Commerce Department and International Trade Commission 
 Today s action holds China accountable for unfair taxes that they are imposing on American exports of broiler chicken products   U S  Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement 
China re examined and lowered the duties on U S  broiler chicken products in 2014 after the WTO accepted U S  arguments that they violated WTO rules  Current anti dumping duties are up to 73 3 percent and anti subsidy taxes up to 4 2 percent 
However  USTR said it believed the China s revised duties  which affect producers such as  Tyson Foods  Inc  N TSN  and Pilgrim s Pride Corp  N PPC   were still not in compliance with WTO rules 
U S  senators from poultry producing states cheered the new challenge 
 The United States has been the only country that has been willing to challenge China s compliance at the World Trade Organization   said U S  Senator Johnny Isakson  a Republican from Georgia 
 Trade works when the rules are followed  and it is imperative that China  the world s second largest economy  lives up to the rules it agreed to when it joined the WTO in 2001   Isakson added ",2016-05-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/u.s.-launches-second-wto-complaint-in-china-chicken-trade-dispute-401044,401044

180379,401895,TSN,Where Is The Gold Price Heading ,opinion,"What happens to the gold price this week will likely set the trend for the foreseeable future  While many precious metals investors disregard technical analysis and key chart formations  you can bet your bottom dollar that large traders and institutions are watching the price action of the yellow metal quite carefully  And if you think that these large traders and institutions don t believe in market intervention  then you are sadly mistaken 
The entire market is rigged  so we should get past the notion that only the gold and silver prices are controlled  Furthermore  one of the reasons that the gold and silver prices have languished over the past 5  years has to do with the  Grand Trading Market Casino   For example  one of the new trendy stocks is ROKU 
ROKU  a TV streaming platform company  has seen its stock price surge from  26 to  105 over the past six months  That s a 300  increase from the December 2018 lows  Why would anyone want to mess around with gold  that may go up or down 5 10   when you can make triple digit gains on Roku Inc  NASDAQ ROKU  

As we can see  ROKU enjoyed two extensive BREAKOUTS during the days of positive earnings release  When these positive earnings releases occurred at key technical levels  the stock price shot up 15 20  in a single day  You will also notice how ROKU is trading off the upward blue channel  blue dashed lines   There is no coincidence that ROKU is trading this way 
Moreover  ROKU is trading close to 10 million shares a day  the same as the GLD  NYSE GLD  ETF  So  traders  hedge funds  and institutions are focusing on stocks like ROKU because the share price action is providing excellent returns in a very short period of time  It doesn t matter that the markets are rigged  or that central banks are providing trillions of dollars of liquidity  What matters to those who play in these markets  are the NICE RETURNS that can be made in the  Grand Market Casino  
While ROKU s stock is certainly hitting all time highs  the company still hasn t made a profit in the past four years  Of course  Wall Street analysts say not to worry because it will take the company 5  years to be profitable  But what if that fifth or sixth year takes place during the next big recession   Just look what happened to ROKU s stock from October to Dec 24th  2018  Do you honestly believe ROKU s financials and revenues fell that much to push the stock down by 65  in three months   No  ROKU s share got BUSHWACKED because the entire market was in freefall  That is until the central banks came to the rescue 
Unfortunately  for many investors  ROKU is just another high tech over valued stock that will crash along with the markets when the lousy economic fundamentals finally kick in 

And what about the recent IPO of Beyond Meat Inc  NASDAQ BYND   The stock price opened at  25 on May 2nd and reached  200 on June 19th  less than two months later   Talk about a COOL 700  return in a lousy seven weeks  Again  why on earth would investors pay attention to the precious metals market when they can get rich on stocks like ROKU and BYND  
These crazy stock prices become even more insane when we compare them to  Real companies   How does Beyond Meat s present stock price of  154  based on Q1 2019 total revenues of pitiful  40 million compare to Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  trading at  79 a share with  40 billion in Q1 2019 revenues  Where is the fundamental logic behind Beyond Meat s valuation     There isn t any  But  the flow of funds focused on high flying stocks in the market keep investors from paying much attention to gold  up until now 
So  getting back to gold  The problem with many precious metals investors is that they don t believe technical analysis works in a rigged market  What they fail to understand is that most participants in the market realize that central bank intervention is taking place  It s not a state secret any more 
However  there is some METHOD to the MADNESS when it comes to the gold price action over the past 40 years  Here is a monthly chart of the gold price going back until 1981 

Now  there is no coincidence that gold enjoyed a nice BREAKOUT in 2007 when it finally surpassed the long term  700  resistance level  And then when gold surpassed the  1 000 level  it had another BREAKOUT to  1 400  Of course  there were important  Fundamental factors  that pushed gold above that  700 level  but when it finally surpassed it  it shot up to  1 000 quite quickly 
If we look at the 20 year gold monthly chart  we can see some interesting trends 

After gold surged to  1 900  like with all stocks  it experienced a typical correction  Normally  stocks will correct back down to prior support resistance levels  After gold fell back to the  1 350  1 360 level in 2013  it continued lower to  1 050  Now  once again  there is no coincidence that the gold price bottomed at  1 050 in late 2015 right at the very same level it that peaked in 2008  You can see that black dashed line at  1 050  Furthermore  the Ascending Triangle baseline  blue dashed line  was another bottoming area for gold when both key technical levels converged 
However  the technical  1 050 level where gold bottomed was also based on fundamental data on the gold production cost  At that time  the top gold miners were producing gold at  1 025  1 100 an ounce  The declining production gold cost was due to the oil price falling to a low of  26 from a high of  110 in 2011  So  technical analysis in the chart also provided a clue as to the bottom in the gold price 
If we look at the weekly gold chart  we can see the Key Technical levels 

It has been more than five years since the gold price reached  1 400  So  it s an important milestone  According to gold s price action  the important technical levels are  1 050   1360   1 550  or  1 600   and  1 800  There is a reason the gold price has traded off these technical levels  Traders and institutions are trained to use these technical levels as a guide 
So  are the central banks using these technical levels to control the gold price  Likely  However  when the fundamentals of the market get to the point where the central banks are no longer able to keep the gold price capped under a certain level  like the Fed announcing interest rate cuts  then the traders  hedge funds  and institutions in the market take over  And when the gold price surpasses certain key technical levels  then BREAKOUTS occur 
IMPORTANT NOTE   Years ago  I did not pay attention to Technical Analysis  so I did not understand the value of these key technical levels or how to spot them  Even though gold will become one of the best assets to own in the future  its price rise will likely take place at these key technical levels  regardless if precious metals investors believe it or not 
For gold to continue a BULLISH TREND  it will need to close above the  1 360 level at the end of the month  shown in the top two charts   If it closes below that  1 360 level  then it will just take more time for the trend to push above that level for an extended period  But  if we do see continued buying of gold next week  then we will likely be in a new Bull Market for gold 
The last chart is the Gold Daily Chart  It clearly shows how gold shot above that critical  1 360 level 

While gold is overbought on the Daily chart  shown at the top right part of the chart  81 RSI   it isn t on the first Monthly gold chart above  Even if the gold price falls to the  1 370  1 380 range by the end of the week  that could still be a positive sign  because it s still above the key  1 360 by the end of the month 
If we continue to see more  Iran War News  in the media this week  the gold price may head to the  1 410  1 425  level  Regardless  for gold to finally break above its 5 year  1 360 is a crucial milestone for traders and investors  A significant close above  1 360 for June could be very Bullish for the yellow metal 
Lastly  if we do see gold close above the key level and move higher in July  it will likely retest the  1 360 level before doing so  Then look for the next technical level of  1 550  1 600 for gold to find serious resistance 
In conclusion  technical analysis provides traders  hedge funds  and institutions  key levels to focus on  When these technical levels are breached  either to the upside or downside  then we can see significant movement in the price action  So  for gold to head to  2 000 and higher  it will likely do so in and around these key technical levels

180380,401896,TSN,Should Value Investors Consider Tyson Foods  TSN  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tyson Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 10  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 18 53  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Tyson Foods  current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 13 46  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 22 40  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Tyson Foods has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 85  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Tyson Foods  stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tyson Foods has a P S ratio of about 0 74  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 35 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tyson Foods currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes TSN a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Tyson Foods might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C  This gives TSN a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen two downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen 4 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dipped 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tyson Foods  Inc  Price and Consensus    This somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTyson Foods is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  top 11  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trend to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors

180395,401911,TSN,Beyond Meat Soars  But Competition  Lofty Valuation Leave Shares Vulnerable,opinion,"The rally in Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  shares doesn t seem to be showing any sign of peaking  The most successful initial public offering of 2019  the producer of plant based  meat  is continuing its upward march  and proving many naysayers wrong 
The latest upswing in its share prices came when the El Segundo  California based maker of plant based burgers released its debut earnings report last week  crushing analyst expectations and giving upbeat guidance for 2019  Its stock surged more than 39  on Friday  a day after the company told investors that it could break even this year as more and more restaurants and grocery chains buy its meatless products  such as burger patties and sausages 

Before the Friday rally  Beyond Meat had already jumped about 300  from its  25 a share IPO price  It closed at  138 65 on Friday and rose a further 21  yesterday  to  168 10  Let s take a closer look at their quarterly numbers and try to make sense of this remarkable run in their stock prices 
Beyond Meat Break Even Coming Sooner
The 10 year old company is gaining traction much faster than many analysts had expected  Its quarterly sales more than tripled in its first financial report since going public on May 2  The company s revenue climbed to  40 2 million for the quarter ended March 30  versus  12 8 million for the year ago period 
Beyond Meat reported a net loss of  6 6 million  or  0 95 a share  versus a loss of  5 7 million for the first quarter of 2018  Analysts anticipated  38 9 million in sales and a  6 7 million net loss for the quarter  according to FactSet 
Though the company continued to lose money  the management now expects to break even in 2019 on the adjusted EBITDA that takes into account interest payments  taxes and some other factors  Its sales for the year are likely to jump 140  when compared with last year  exceeding  210 million 
 Our strong first quarter financial results  we believe  demonstrate mainstream consumers  desire for plant based meat products in the U S  and internationally   said Ethan Brown  Beyond Meat s President and Chief Executive Officer in the earnings statement   Our team continued to scale our business in both retail and foodservice as we benefited from broad based growth in the first quarter  
With this upbeat management stance  there are good reasons for investors to feel excited  Over the past 18 months  Beyond Meat has struck deals to supply burger patties to chains including TGI Friday s  Del Taco Restaurants Inc  and Carl s Jr   the burger chain operated by CKE Restaurant Holdings Inc  Tim Horton s  the Canadian breakfast spot  is also testing breakfast sandwiches that contain Beyond Meat products 
Outside of these top food chains  Beyond Meat products have also been popular in more than 11 000 U S  grocery stores where its burger patties and sausages are occupying the shelf space where mainstream customers look for their meat  The company s growing revenue suggests that meat consumers in the U S  are likely the company s customers 
Lofty Valuations and Upcoming Competition
But Beyond Meat s eye popping rally is also raising questions in the minds of cautious investors who try to justify these lofty valuations  After Friday s 39  surge  the faux meat supplier s market valuation is nearing  8 billion  putting it in the league of established food companies with billions of dollars in sales 
Just to provide a context  Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   the largest U S  meat producer  has a  30 billion market cap with  43 billion in expected sales for the current fiscal year  Before last week s earnings report  Beyond Meat was trading at the enterprise to 12 month forward sales multiple of 19   a huge premium when compared to other packaged food companies which are trading at the low single digit valuations 
Of course  these comparisons don t make much sense when we are dealing with a high growth company like Beyond Meat  but investors should take into account the threats which might damage this highly ambitious growth scenario 
After seeing Beyond Meat s success  for example  some major players are just getting ready to enter the plant based food market  Nestle SA  SIX NESN  has already announced that its plant based Awesome Burger will debut in the U S  later this year  Tyson   a one time investor in Beyond Meat   also plans to introduce its plant based product later this year 
Bryan Spillane  an analyst at Bank of America  wrote in a research note that the extrusion process used to manufacture Beyond Meat products is fairly common in the making of other packaged foods  keeping the entry barriers quite low for other aspirants  especially big food giants 
According to the same analysis  cited by a Bloomberg report  the higher price for Beyond Meat burgers could provide a ceiling for future growth  The average retail price for Beyond Meat burgers is  12 per pound  compared to  4 per pound for regular beef patties 
Bottom Line
Beyond Meat has grabbed the attention of a market which was left open by the big food companies  But that space is about to become more crowded  with many established players joining the fray in the next 12 months 
We don t believe Beyond Meat has a big economic moat to defend its turf once the competition heats up  Investors who have made a killing in this trade should trim their positions and book profit  Those on the sidelines should wait for a better entry point ",2019-06-11,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beyond-meat-lofty-valuations-threats-of-competition-make-the-stock-vulnerable-200430337,200430337

180402,401918,TSN,Bird flu  probable  in Iowa chicken broiler breeding farm,news,"By P J  Huffstutter
CHICAGO  Reuters    An Iowa based chicken broiler breeding farm has initially tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5 bird flu  the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship said on Thursday 
The facility in Kossuth County  Iowa  houses an estimated 19 000 birds  state officials said  Birds were dying in greater than normal numbers at the breeding farm  which is a typical sign of influenza infection in a flock 
This is thought to be first time the avian influenza virus has affected a broiler breeding farm in this outbreak  Such breeding farms are traditionally known for having extremely tight biosecurity systems 
Though the operation is small compared to some of the other poultry farm sites in the Midwest that have been affected by the current outbreak  the probable breach of a chicken broiler breeder s biosecurity underscores the potential for the country s poultry meat industry supply chain to be affected 
Typically  such facilities  chickens lay fertile eggs  which are sent to a hatchery to produce chicks that are later raised and slaughtered for meat 
Additional testing to confirm the finding is underway at the federal Agriculture Department of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services   APHIS  National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames  Iowa 
The National Chicken Council  the industry s leading trade group  declined to comment  saying it was waiting for the results of the additional tests 
Officials with the three top broiler breeding companies that supply the U S  chicken industry  Aviagen Group  Groupe Grimaud  and  Tyson Foods  Inc s  N TSN  Cobb Vantress  could not immediately be reached for comment 
Tyson Foods spokesman Gary Mickelson said in an email the company does not have any chicken breeder or broiler operations in Iowa 
Two bird flu strains have been found in the United States this year  The H5N2 strain has been reported in Arkansas  Idaho  Iowa  Kansas  Kentucky  Minnesota  Missouri  Montana  North Dakota  Oregon  South Dakota  Washington and Wisconsin  It has also been identified on farms in Ontario  Canada 
The H5N8 strain has been identified in California and also in Idaho  according to the Agriculture Department ",2015-04-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/bird-flu-infection-'probable'-in-iowa-chicken-broiler-breeding-farm-339728,339728

180410,401926,TSN,Tyson Beefs Up Consumer Offerings With Hillshire Buy ,news,"By    Tyson Foods Inc  NYSE TSN  outbid rivals and sealed a deal to buy Hillshire Brands Company  NYSE HSH  for about  7 billion in a transaction that gives the buyer a bigger market share in packaged meat products  which provide higher margins than sales to institutional operations like restaurants and other businesses 
The deal values Hillshire  which makes Jimmy Dean sausage and other retail brands  at  63 a share 
According to the Wall Street Journal the deal is likely to be the largest ever in the meat industry  and marks a victory for Tyson over Brazilian rival JBS SA  the parent company to Pilgrims Pride Corp  NASDAQ PPC   Pilgrim s pride had started the bidding for Hillshire last month 

Just last month  Hillshire agreed to acquire Pinnacle Foods Inc  NYSE PF  in a cash and stock deal valued at  6 6 billion  including debt ",2014-06-09,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tyson-beefs-up-consumer-offerings-with-hillshire-buy-288553,288553
180412,401928,TSN,Biggest Meat Industry Deal Ever May Not Be Great For Consumers,news,"By    The news that Tyson Foods Inc  NYSE TSN  is poised to purchase Hillshire Brands  NYSE HSH  for more than  8 billion has sparked concerns among analysts and on Capitol Hill about the potential for the food production industry s ongoing consolidation to hit consumers in their wallets 
The blockbuster deal  which is contingent on Hillshire s being released from a  6 6 deal to acquire Pinnacle Foods Inc  NYSE PF  by Dec  12    which will likely earn Pinnacle a  163 million breakup fee    is just the latest in a string of high profile acquisitions in the food industry 
The planned takeover has industry insiders chattering about its potential impacts on consumers  producers and other major food companies 
Louis Biscotti  partner and national director for the food and beverage Sector at the New York accounting firm WeiserMazars LLP  which has more than 500 firms in its food and beverage portfolio  says that the deal will be good for Tyson and its shareholders  as it broadens the company s offerings  brings Tyson new top level brands  and increases the company s market share  But according to Biscotti consumers may get the short end of the stick 
 Prices will increase because if you re paying a huge premium to buy a company it will have to result in increased selling prices to consumers down the road because you need to recoup that investment   he said   While they re touting synergies of hundreds of millions of dollars  that doesn t make up the billions that they re investing in the acquisition  
U S  Sen  Charles Grassley  an Iowa Republican  has spoken out about the ills of increased consolidation in the food production industry in the past  particularly the concept that it could drive prices upward 
 Meat processing is already highly concentrated  and the companies trying to acquire Hillshire are two of the largest processors   Grassley  who serves on the upper chamber s Agriculture Committee  said last week  according to USA Today   If an acquisition becomes final  the Justice Department ought to scrutinize the details on behalf of both consumers and family farmers with the goal of a competitive marketplace   A spokeswoman for Grassley declined to provide further comment Monday afternoon because the deal has yet to be finalized  
However  some analysts say that the deal could end up being a net positive for Tyson and Hillshire shareholders  as well as consumers 

James Gellert  CEO of Rapid Ratings  a New York based ratings company  says the addition should be a boon for Tyson shareholders   Tyson benefits from buying a company with stronger financial health and should see a strengthening in various metrics due to the combination   he said 
Bruce Cohen  a senior partner with 30 years of grocery industry and private equity experience who heads the private equity and strategy practice at Kurt Salmon  a global management and strategy consulting firm  said the deal should not affect prices   The great thing about the food industry is that there are so many choices out there that in no way do I see that it s limiting choice  We don t see this as being a price concern to consumers   he said 
Chad Hart  an associate professor of economics at Iowa State University  told USA Today that only time will reveal what the end results of the acquisition will be 
 Looking back over time  typically the fewer players usually does mean a little bit higher prices  but there are cost savings involved here as well   Hart said   It is something the government will be watching to see if there is a enough competition in the market to allow these mergers to go through  
Hillshire said Monday that it still recommends that its shareholders vote for the Pinnacle acquisition   There can be no assurance that any transaction will result from the Tyson Foods offer   Hillshire said in a statement  according to the Chicago Tribune 
 Tyson right now does not have a very strong position in branded products  they re trying to make themselves better known beyond as a meat processor  and that s very important for a food company   Biscotti said   A meat processor is just delivering processed meat as opposed to a ball park frank  Tyson is looking to get into branded products in a larger way  as well as to increase market share  
The deal is likely to be the largest ever in the meat industry  and marks a victory for Tyson over Brazilian rival JBS SA  the parent company of Pilgrims Pride Corp  NASDAQ PPC   which started the bidding war for Hillshire last month the Wall Street Journal reported ",2014-06-10,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/biggest-meat-industry-deal-ever-may-not-be-great-for-consumers-288901,288901

Tyson outbid Pilgrim s Pride Corp with its  63 per share offer for Hillshire  valuing the Jimmy Dean sausages maker at  8 55 billion

The Cherokee factory will close on Sep  27  while the other two are expected to stop operating in the first half of 2015 
The U S  Department of Labor s Occupational Safety and Health Administration had cited the Buffalo factory for workplace safety hazards last November and proposed fines of about  122 000

180420,401936,TSN,Tyson wins U S  Justice Dept antitrust nod for Hillshire deal ,news,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Tyson Foods Inc  N TSN   the largest U S  meat processor  on Wednesday won U S  antitrust approval for its  8 5 billion purchase of Hillshire Brands Co  N HSH  
To win approval for the merger  the companies agreed to sell Heinold Hog Markets  the U S  Department of Justice said  The attorneys general of Iowa  Illinois and Missouri  all big hog producing states  joined the settlement 
 Today s proposed settlement will help ensure that hog breeders in the United States will continue to receive the benefits of vigorous competition when selling sows   said Bill Baer  assistant attorney general for DOJ s antitrust division 
The two companies combined buy about 35 percent of all sows sold in the United States 
Tyson s share price rallied on the approval  rising as much as 2 percent before closing at  37 71  up 1 5 percent  Hillshire closed near steady at  62 96 
But about 10 minutes before the Justice Department announced the deal  the share prices of both companies dropped sharply and there was a large increase in stock and options volume  suggesting that traders were bracing for bad news 
Trading volume for Hillshire totaled 8 07 million shares  compared with the 50 day average of 2 54 million  of the total  trading volume  almost 5 5 million came several minutes before and after the DOJ s release  according to Reuters data 
Springdale  Arkansas based Tyson is a massive seller of chicken  beef and pork while Chicago s Hillshire sells packaged meat brands such as Jimmy Dean  Ball Park and State Fair as well as bakery products like Sara Lee 
The companies overlap in the business of buying sows when they are too old to breed  the Justice Department said 
Heinold Hog Markets  which had revenues of  270 million and has operations in Illinois  Iowa  Indiana  Michigan  Minnesota and Nebraska  buys the animals from farmers and resells them to manufacturers  Hillshire buys them to make sausage for its Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm brands 
 Although the sale of sows constitutes a small percentage of overall revenues  farmers rely on this source of income as an important contribution to their earnings   the Justice Department said in a competitive impact statement filed with the U S  District Court for the District of Columbia 
That court must approve the proposed settlement 
The deal had came under fire from some farm  consumer and rural organizations  as well as lawmakers like Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa  who worried that a larger Tyson will have power to push down the prices paid to hog farmers and drive up the prices paid by consumers at the grocery store 
 Because Tyson can align its pork slaughter business with Hillshire s branded processing business  Hillshire products will have a leg up on competitors  who will likely have to raise prices   said Wenonah Hunter  executive director of Food   Water Watch 
In a statement  Grassley said that requiring the sale of Heinold showed the Justice Department  took my concerns into consideration in regard to the slaughter sow market

180423,401939,TSN,This IPO Notched The Best 1 Day Pop Since 2000,opinion,"With shares of the highly anticipated ride sharing company LYFT  NASDAQ LYFT  trading lower by nearly 20  from its late March IPO price  there was little to suggest investors had  irrational exuberance  heading into Thursday s IPO of Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  
Beyond Meat  a provider of plant based meat alternatives  initially priced its IPO in the  19  21 range before raising both the offering range   23  25  and number of shares  by 1 million  on strong demand earlier this week  Even that elevated price point failed to satiate investors  demand  as shares rocketed higher by more than 160  in their first day of trade  followed by a bullish gap higher in Friday s U S  session 
BYND s surge represents the largest one day rally in an IPO since 2000 among companies with a market capitalization of at least  200M 

Source  Dealogic
Below  we outline both the bull and bear cases for the stock moving forward 
The Bull Case
BYND sits at the crossroads of several major secular trends  including fears about climate change  a focus on healthier eating  and the growing popularity of veganism vegetarianism  The first company to create a tasty  affordable alternative to traditional meat sources will capture a substantial portion of the massive global meat market  which is estimated at  1 4T annually 
Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  is currently one of the leaders in the space and sports a market capitalization of more than  22B  Even after BYND s surge yesterday  the company s market cap is less than a fifth of TSN s  and some analysts suggest BYND should eventually trade at a premium  given its stellar 20   gross margins 
The Bear Case
The bear case for the stock comes down to valuation  At just  88M in global revenue  the company trades at an astronomical 43X its current sales  While those sales are growing rapidly  170  from 2017 to 2018   the company nonetheless saw  19M post tax operating loss last year 
Though the global meat market is massive  as we noted above  competition is heating up  Impossible Foods recently announced a deal to bring non meat burgers to Burger King  and even Tyson is developing its own plant based meat products 
After yesterday s surge  BYND looks like it may be priced to perfection  The meat of the matter is this  while the stock could certainly grow into its lofty valuation  the company s successful IPO will ironically draw even more competition into the space  potentially planting the seeds for disappointment moving forward

180424,401940,TSN,Tyson Foods  TSN  Beats Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 20 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 12 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 27 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 14   A quarter ago  it was expected that this meat producer would post earnings of  1 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 58  delivering a surprise of 1 94  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Tyson  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Meat Products industry  posted revenues of  10 44 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 12   This compares to year ago revenues of  9 77 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Tyson shares have added about 40 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17 5  
What s Next for Tyson 
While Tyson has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Tyson was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  1 60 on  10 97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 93 on  42 52 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Food   Meat Products is currently in the top 40  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-05-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tyson-foods-tsn-beats-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200417343,200417343
180425,401941,TSN,Tyson  TSN  Soars To 52 Week High  Time To Cash Out ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  77 47 in the previous session  Tyson Foods has gained 44 3  since the start of the year compared to the 16 3  move for the Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the 24 4  return for the Zacks Food   Meat Products industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on May 6  2019  Tyson reported EPS of  1 2 versus consensus estimate of  1 12 
For the current fiscal year  Tyson is expected to post earnings of  5 99 per share on  42 76 billion in revenues  This represents a  2 76  change in EPS on a 6 77  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  6 5 per share on  44 48 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 8 55  and 4 01   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Tyson may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Tyson has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 12 9X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 8 8X versus its peer group s average of 8 8X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 1 43  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Tyson currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Tyson meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Tyson shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term ",2019-05-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tyson-tsn-soars-to-52week-high-time-to-cash-out-200418002,200418002
180426,401942,TSN,Beyond Meat s Post IPO Rally Sparkled  But Can It Survive Looming Competition ,opinion,"Beyond Meat Inc  NASDAQ BYND  investors who bought shares in last week s initial public offering  IPO  have every reason to feel pleased with themselves  The stock has jumped almost 200  since the maker of plant based burgers raised  240 million in the highly successful IPO on May 2 
The demand for its shares has been so strong that its debut on the NASDAQ last Friday was the best among IPOs that raised  200 million or more since before the 2008 financial crisis  according to Bloomberg data 
Beyond Meat s initial public offering was priced at  25 a share  the top end of the  23  25 range  valuing the company at just under  1 5 billion  At its  68 84 opening price on Monday  the company s market cap had soared to  3 97 billion after just three days of trading  The shares closed up 12  yesterday  at  74 79 

Clever Marketing Push
What s unique about the El Segundo  California maker of plant based burgers and sausages that attracted investors like Bill Gates and Leonardo DiCaprio in its early days  Beyond Meat is targeting consumers who are seeking a meat substitute that looks and tastes good  Beyond Meat s biggest attraction is that its products come surprisingly close to real meat in taste  smell  texture and appearance 
Luckily for Beyond Meat  the  878 million a year and growing market for meat substitutes was left open by big food players for startups like Beyond Meat and privately held Impossible Foods Inc  to fill the gap  To capture this broad market opportunity  Beyond Meat developed three plant based products that align with the largest meat categories globally  beef  pork and poultry 
But what made Beyond Meat products tick in 11 000 U S  grocery stores was the company s clever marketing strategy that sought shelf space where mainstream customers looked for their meat  instead of just going after vegans who make up less than 5  of the U S  population 
The company s growing revenue suggests that meat consumers in the U S  are likely the company s customers  From just  8 8 million in 2015  Beyond Meat s net revenue rose to  56 4 million in the first nine months of the fiscal year 2018  according to the company s prospectus  That number was 167  higher when compared to the same period a year ago 
The story looks great and very reassuring for those who got hold of Beyond Beat shares during the IPO stage  or on the first day of its public debut  But going forward  that upward growth trajectory isn t going to be entirely straightforward  in our view 
Risk of Competition
First  Beyond Meat s market doesn t have very high barriers to entry  Learning from its success  more large and small food players will inevitably enter the market and fill the shelf space with more choices 
Tyson Foods Inc   NYSE TSN   the largest U S  meat producer  is probably the first big threat to Beyond Meat  The company sold its stake in Beyond Meat just before its IPO  signaling its intention to play hard in the vegetarian protein market 
The company plans to accelerate and develop its own alternative protein business line  and every kind of protein is on the table from legumes and peas to mushrooms and insects  Justin Whitmore  Tyson s chief sustainability officer said in March 
 We re going to be making significant investments in the space   Whitmore told Bloomberg   The companies and ecosystem that are in place to provide protein to the world can do the same thing for alternative protein   the mechanics of the supply chain all the way from the farm to your plate don t necessarily change  
In an environment that s shaping up to be pretty cutthroat  this means that Beyond Meat will have to spend a lot on R D and marketing  That spending will make it harder for the company to achieve profitability sooner  In the first nine months of 2018  the company lost more than  22 million on the sales of  56 million 
Bottom Line
Beyond Meat has grabbed the attention of a market in which a lot of money is chasing very few good ideas  But in that process  its stock has become too expensive and risky  We don t think Beyond Meat s rally justifies its 44 times 2018 sale multiple over the long run  given the competitive threats from large players  The stock has run its course and is vulnerable to a correction ",2019-05-07,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-beyond-meats-175-postipo-rally-fake-just-like-its-meat-200417756,200417756

180440,401956,TSN,The Plague Of Pigs  How I m Playing China s Hog Crisis,opinion,"As a macro speculator   I keep my eyes open for trade ideas from all over  Whether its commodities or currencies or even foreign equities 

And   if you remember   near the end of 2018  I mentioned the potential of a  pork play  building 

Well   it s time I share with you more about it   and why it s now a big opportunity  and how I m playing it  

Here s what you need to know     

To put things simply  there s a harsh virus   known as African Swine Fever  ASF    that s crippling the global supply of pigs  Especially in China   the world s largest buyer and producer of pork   which has already culled  aka selectively slaughtered  more than one million hogs due to this virus 

 Note that up to 200 million pigs in China could be culled   or die   from being infected with ASF  This would greatly reduce the nations hog supply  

Now   because of this sharp drop in China s hog population   meat processors worldwide are selling greater amounts of pork to China to make up for the shortages 

 Remember   China s favorite and principle source of dietary protein is pork  

As Bloomberg notes    Some meat that used to go to the U S  is now going to China because it pays more   Jens Munk Ebbesen  director of food safety and veterinary issues at the Danish Agriculture   Food Council  said via phone call 

The blow back from this is even tighter pork supplies in the U S and Europe   which has pushed prices up significantly since the beginning of the year 

For instance   US retail prices for  boneless hams  hit  4 31 per pound in March   the highest since 2015 



And in the European Union   wholesale pig prices have soared nearly 20  in just the last two months 

And   according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME     lean hog  futures are up roughly 30  since February lows 



But the real impact of this  great pig culling  will be felt in China     

For starters   due to this spreading virus   China s hog population is plunging to  historically low levels  as farmers slaughter pigs left and right in attempt to prevent further contamination 

And making matters worse   according to a report by Rabobank International  a Dutch firm that specializes in agriculture financing    Chinese pork production may sink 30  by the end of this year 

To give you some perspective of that number  a drop of that size   30    would be roughly the same as Europe s entire annual pork supply     

Thus   due to this serious supply destruction   the price of pork in China could surge by more than 70  over the next 12 months 

But it won t stop there     

Because of this  sick pig  crisis   Chinese consumers will be forced to eat less pork  And instead  turn to other proteins  aka  substitutes     like chicken  beef  fish 

This shift in Chinese demand may cause further meat supplies  chicken  beef  etc  worldwide to tighten  Especially as pork substitutes flow in to China to satisfy the country s lacking protein 

Christine McCracken   an analyst at Rabobank International   said   the price of all proteins is set to rise pretty substantially  It would be our expectation that as China imports more pork  supplies in other countries will get tighter and prices will go up  not just for pork  but for other proteins as well  

Also   keep in mind   there s been three large swine virus outbreaks before this one  aka  hog cycles   

All of which lead to pork prices soaring 

But this time   prices may soar higher than ever before     

There are three reasons I believe this 

First   although an increase in pork prices should entice Chinese farmers to herd more pigs   they may be increasingly cautious this time around with concerns of  African swine fever  lingering about 

For instance   it will take at least three years to rebuild the hog population without any risk of ASF re infecting the herd 

This puts farmers in a fragile position over the next few years as they re build their hog herd  Because a single ASF contaminated hog could ruin their entire young herd 

It may be less costly  and less risky  to instead focus on herding other animals 

Second   signs of this negative farmer sentiment is showing up through the plunging  hog to corn price ratio    a key metric indicating that the feeding costs versus the sale price of hogs has become unprofitable 

And Third   most of the China s breeding herds  aka  sow pigs    the females  have thinned out  This means less pig births   leaving a deficit that will lower the future domestic hog output 



All this   and more   is why I expect pork prices  and other meats  to rally for the foreseeable future 

More hogs will be slaughtered as the Chinese attempt to contain the virus from spreading   further straining an already tight  and fragile  hog supply 



So   as speculators   we need to ask ourselves  is there any upside from this horrible pork culling 

I believe so   and this is how     

By purchasing shares of meat suppliers   such as JBS SA  OTC JBSAY   a Brazilian based producer of animal protein   which will see higher margins on their pork  and other meat  products as global supplies tighten 

Even major investment bank   Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS    raised their recommendation on JBSAY to  overweight  

That s because JBSAY has beef  chicken  and pork operations all across North America  Europe  and Australia   Far away from the incurable virus 

JBSAY   according to Morgan Stanley analyst Rafael Shin   has a solid  combination of category  meats  and geographic exposure  scale  capacity utilization  and existing access to the Chinese market   sets it apart  

Thus   the Brazilian meat powerhouse is perfectly positioned to benefit from the swine virus upside     

Note that shares of JBSAY are up significantly over the last few months  But still far behind behemoths like Tyson Foods  NYSE  NYSE TSN  on a USD market cap basis 



So   in summary   JBSAY offers significant leverage to rising meat prices as the pig plague continues and meat prices rally 

I believe JBSAY shares have further upside   and I have been buying on the sharp dips 

But   I warn you though   there are some risks 

For instance   there isn t much of a margin of safety  downside protection  with JBSAY  The balance sheet isn t the cleanest 

Also   Brazil s currency   the Real   is in decline against the U S  dollar  This could put pressure on share prices 

And true   the fear of the ASF virus could be pushing hog prices higher than they should be 

That s why   once I see the current supply and demand for meat reversing  falling prices   I will exit this play 

But   for now   I still see a longer term deficit in the hog supplies which will keep prices up for some time 

Of course   although I feel bad for the poor hogs   the job of a speculator is to find an opportunity and exploit it 

This is why I own shares of JBSAY and am holding for now 

Because the rally has only just begun

180442,401958,TSN,Pre IPO Coverage  Beyond Meat  BYND ,opinion,"Beyond Meat Inc  NASDAQ BYND   provider of plant based meat alternatives  is expected to IPO on Thursday  May 2  After initially announcing a price range of  19  21 per share  the company raised its price range to  23  25 per share and announced it would sell  1 million more shares  At the current price range the company plans to sell up to  240 million of shares with an expected market cap of   1 4 billion  At the midpoint of the IPO price range  BYND currently earns our Very Unattractive rating 

More than any of the other recent IPOs we ve covered  BYND looks to be a highly speculative investment  The company s market cap looks unrealistic based on its  88 million in annual revenue and mounting losses  On the flip side  the opportunity could be large  given the  1 4 trillion size of the global meat industry and the  22 billion market cap of major meat producer Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  

This report aims to help investors sort through Beyond Meat s financial filings to understand the fundamentals and valuation of this IPO 
Losses Are Growing
Beyond Meat was founded in 2009 with the goal of developing plant based products that would  in the words of its S 1   look  cook  and taste  like meat  The company uses pea proteins that are processed  woven  and combined with various flavorings to produce a variety of meat substitutes 

While BYND produces a variety of products  it is best known for the Beyond Burger  which is sold in  15 000 grocery stores and  12 000 restaurants  including Carl s Jr   TGI Fridays  and BurgerFi  Overall  BYND earns 58  of its revenue from grocery stores and other retail channels and 42  from restaurant and foodservice customers 

The widespread availability of the Beyond Burger is impressive considering that the product was only launched in July of 2016  BYND is growing rapidly  with revenue increasing by 170  from 2017 to 2018  However  as Figure 1 shows  that revenue growth has been accompanied by rising losses  Net operating loss after tax  NOPAT  increased from  13 million in 2017 to  19 million in 2018  a 48  increase 

Figure 1  BYND Revenue and NOPAT  2017 2018



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

BYND may be growing rapidly  but that growth is coming at a high cost 

Evidence of Economies of Scale

The good news for BYND is that  while the company is still relatively small  it s already showing signs of achieving economies of scale  Gross margins turned positive for the first time in 2018  More impressively  at 20   its gross margins have already surpassed Tyson Foods  TSN   the largest meat producer in the U S 

Figure 2  BYND vs  TSN Gross Margins  2016 2018



Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings

The positive gross margin trend shows no sign of letting up either  BYND has tripled its production capacity over the past year  and while it doesn t have audited Q1 numbers yet  it estimates that its investment in production led to gross margins of 25 26  in the first quarter of 2019 

BYND s high and rising gross margins raise the possibility that it could become an even more profitable business than existing meat producers if and when consumers accepts its meat substitute en masse 

How Big is BYND s Market 

Like many recent IPOs  BYND s grand ambition is to disrupt and take over a massive industry  Rather than marketing itself as a niche product for vegans and vegetarians  BYND wants to compete directly in the meat industry  which it estimates at  270 million in the U S  and  1 4 trillion globally 

To this end  BYND has made a point to market its products as meat rather than as a vegetarian alternative  Its products are sold in the meat section of grocery stores  and it has long resisted the labelling of its products as  veggie burgers  

This strategy of marketing their products towards meat eaters appears to be working so far  The company claims in its S 1 that 93  of customers that bought a Beyond Burger at Kroger  NYSE KR  in the first half of 2018 also purchased animal meat products during that timeframe 

However  there are still major question marks as to how large the potential market for plant based meat products really is  Several states are considering adding labelling rules that would restrict BYND and other companies from marketing their products as meat if they don t contain any animal products  These rules would make it much harder for BYND to make inroads among meat eaters 

The biggest question facing BYND over the next few years is whether its products will gain mainstream acceptance as a form of meat  or if they will always be treated as a niche  alternative product 

Competition is Increasing

While BYND is the largest company in its category  it faces serious competition from both smaller startups and traditional meat producers 

Most notably  Impossible Foods made headlines recently with the news that Burger King will launch the  Impossible Whopper  nationwide by the end of this year  With 7 300 locations nationwide  Burger King will be the largest restaurant chain to sell a plant based burger 

In addition  Tyson Foods is working on its own plant based meat products  TSN also recently sold its 6 5  stake in BYND  indicating that it plans to compete with BYND rather than partner with it  If TSN successfully develops a product with comparable taste texture to the Beyond Burger  its superior scale and distribution channels should give it a significant advantage 

Public Shareholders Have Rights

Encouragingly  BYND will actually allow public shareholders to exercise a role in corporate governance  The company is bucking the recent trend and going public with a single class of common stock  meaning all shareholders will have the same voting rights 

High Expectations  But Still Potential for Upside

Our reverse discounted cash flow  DCF  model shows the expectations implied by BYND s IPO price are high but achievable 

In order to justify the high point of its IPO range   25 share  BYND must grow revenue by 43  compounded annually for 10 years and achieve NOPAT margins of 6   which would be equal to TSN 

In this scenario  BYND would earn  3 billion in revenue in 2028  just 1  of annual U S  meat industry sales  and just 8  of TSN s 2018 revenue  40  annual revenue growth is ambitious  but it s by no means impossible  especially considering BYND grew revenue by  300  year over year in Q1 2019 

As noted above  there s reason to believe that BYND may be a higher margin business than TSN as well  If we assume BYND can grow revenue at a slightly faster rate   45  annually rather than 40  for 10 years   and achieve 8  NOPAT margins  the stock is worth  41 share today  a 64  upside to the high point of the IPO range 
Of course  there s also a potential scenario where BYND s products fail to gain mainstream acceptance  get squeezed out by their competition  and never turn a profit  Ultimately  investing in BYND is a high risk  high reward proposition

180447,401963,TSN,FACTBOX Sino U S  trade disputes pile up,news,"BEIJING  Sept 14  Reuters    The United States has decided
to impose special safeguard duties on Chinese made tyres 
opening the door to complaints from a host of other industries
that claim harm from rising Chinese imports 
 China on Monday requested World Trade
Organisation sanctioned consultations with the U S  over the
duties  It is increasingly turning to the WTO to solve such
disputes  and keep markets open to its products 
 Here are some of the key disputes dogging China U S  trade 
 TYRES
 The Obama administration imposed safeguard duties on
Chinese made tyres  after a complaint by unions that low priced
Chinese imports are forcing American factories to close   China
has requested consultations on the duties  a preliminary step
towards a WTO complaint 
 The new duty of 35 percent will take effect on Sept  26 and
adds to an existing 4 percent duty  The extra duty would fall
to 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the third
year 
 POULTRY
 China said it would conduct anti dumping and anti subsidy
investigations into imports of U S  chicken parts and
automotive parts  in an apparent response to the U S  tyre
duties 
 U S  breeders like Tyson Foods Inc sell chicken feet and
wings  which Americans don t eat  to China where they are
delicacies  helping pad their profit margin on each chicken 
The parts sell for about 40 U S  cents a pound in China 
compared with about 2 U S  cents pound in the United States 
 China launched a WTO case in April over U S  legislation
that forbids the U S  government from beginning the process of
certifying Chinese cooked poultry exporters 
 The House of Representatives appropriations bill extends
the measure for a fourth year  while the Senate version orders
the government to begin the certifying process 
 STEEL PIPES
 The United States on Sept  9 imposed duties ranging from
10 90 percent to 30 69 percent on Chinese made steel pipes used
to transport oil  The Chinese Ministry of Commerce denounced
the move as protectionist and the Chinese firms involved said
they might appeal 
 Separately  China has filed a WTO challenge to U S 
anti dumping duties on certain types of steel pipes  pneumatic
off road tyres and woven sacks 
 BLANKETS  BRICK
 A U S  trade panel in August approved an investigation into
whether imports of electric blankets made in China materially
injured or threatened to injure U S  manufacturers 
 On Sept  11  the U S  International Trade Commission
decided  in a 3 3 vote  to recommend the U S  Department of
Commerce conduct a countervailing duty and anti dumping duty
investigation into Chinese made magnesia carbon brick  a
steelmaking material  Preliminary duty recommendations are due
in October and January 
 RAW MATERIALS
 The European Union and the United States are arguing to the
WTO that Chinese export restrictions  including taxes and
quotas  on several raw materials unfairly elevate the
international price  while keeping input prices cheaper for
manufacturers in China  
 DISTRIBUTION SERVICES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 In August  a WTO panel found in favour of the United
States  which claimed that Chinese curbs on importing and
distributing foreign publications and audiovisual products
violated its WTO commitments  China may appeal 
 Both the U S  and China claimed victory earlier this year 
when a WTO panel found that China had failed to protect and
enforce intellectual property rights  but rejected the U S 
contention that China sets the threshold for prosecuting piracy
so high that it is ineffective  China noted the findings did
not challenge its right to censor content 
 GRANTS  LOANS AND OTHER INCENTIVES
 The United States  Mexico and Guatemala requested WTO
consultations regarding certain grants  loans and other
incentives to encourage exports of Chinese brands 
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 China in November settled on a complaint by the EU  the
United States and Canada against China s requirement that
foreign financial information suppliers  including Thomson
Reuters  must operate through an entity designated by the
Xinhua news agency  rather than dealing directly with
subscribers

 NEW YORK  May 12  Reuters    Defensive shares led a rebound
in U S  stocks on Thursday as investors weighed mixed economic
signals and recent volatility in commodities as they searched
for direction 
 The Dow industrials fell nearly 100 points in the morning
but recovered later after a lackluster auction of 30 year U S 
bonds and headlines suggesting negotiations to raise the U S 
debt ceiling had intensified 
 The strong performance by defensive shares  such as health
care and consumer staples  suggested investors were still
attracted to stocks while other asset classes made them more
nervous 
  Fixed income investments don t seem very attractive at the
current yield  There s some concern about commodities  The
volatility has scared a lot of people away  so I think a lot of
investors are sitting back and saying   Where can I put my
money   and the stock market is that   said Channing Smith 
co manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund in Tulsa 
Oklahoma 
 The Dow Jones industrial average  was up 65 89
points  or 0 52 percent  at 12 695 92  The Standard   Poor s
500 Index  was up 6 57 points  or 0 49 percent  at
1 348 65  The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 17 98
points  or 0 63 percent  at 2 863 04 
 YIELDS UNATTRACTIVE
 Bond yields have been declining  making them less
attractive compared with stocks  particularly those that pay
dividends such as utilities  The S P utility index  rose
0 9 percent on Thursday and has gained 5 8 percent since April
8 when the recent decline in bond yields began 
 Commodities have been under pressure in recent sessions 
although oil ended the day higher 
 Defensive stocks typically have more predictable revenues 
which makes them attractive during volatile markets

in  311 5 million of new money in the week ended Wednesday 
data from Lipper showed  That followed record redemptions of

180474,401990,TSN,Vegan Company Beyond Meat Is Getting Hungry Ahead Of Its IPO,opinion,"Animal rights activists around the world are jumping with joy thanks to recent reports that Beyond Meat  an aspiring vegan company aiming to make traditional meat and beef products obsolete  is revving up for a blockbuster IPO that could be one of the most interesting forays into the market in recent years  Plenty of companies making their market debut bring something interesting to the table  but Beyond Meat s innovative business model and boundless ambitions to replace meat with healthier  more humane options is garnering plenty of buzz for the company 
Here s everything you need to know about Beyond Meat and its quest to change the food on our plates as it prepares to make its market debut 
Imagining a world without meat 
Beyond Meat  NASDAQ  BYND  has quite a lofty dream   the company aims to pioneer a plant based meat revolution that it hopes will render traditional options like beef and pork obsolete  Some of the details behind the company s forthcoming market debut are hazy  but recent reports indicate that Beyond Meat is looking to garner some  100 million in its IPO  though that number could very well be a placeholder figure while executives determine their debut strategy  Producing plant based hamburgers  sausages  and chicken  the company is hoping to ignite a green revolution that will upend how modern consumers enjoy their meals 
While bacon lovers around the globe may find themselves in despair  Beyond Meat s focus on the sustainable production of plant based alternatives to such things as beef has garnered it an impressive reputation amongst health gurus  Beyond Meat has already garnered an impressive financial backing for itself  too  with Bill Gates and Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  being amongst those backing the ambitious company ahead of its market debut 
Many investors see Tyson Foods  obsession with plant based meat as a strong indicator of how there will be a large market for such products in the near future  With consumers around the globe finding themselves hooked up health food diets  too  and with a rapidly changing climate forcing industries to consider more sustainable production methods  many consider Beyond Meat to be laying the groundwork for what could become a new global industry 
Beyond Meat may have to convince investors to hop onboard before it can truly takeoff  however  and for that it may need to pay more attention to its finances 
Still posting net losses
Despite the hype surrounding Beyond Meat  the company still isn t profitable  According to S 1 filings made with the SEC ahead of its IPO  the company has been hemorrhaging money thus far  Beyond Meat posted net losses of more than  25 million in 2016  for instance  Furthermore  the company s losses extended the next year  with Beyond Meat posting net losses of  30 4 million in 2017  The company s revenue has been steadily inflating  however  and they brought home an admirable  32 6 million in net revenue in 2017 after their transition to a digital customer experience  nearly double their 2016 figures 
Despite the fact that Beyond Meat is weathering some losses right now  however  the company still has plenty of potential  agricultural and animal husbandry experts around the world are increasingly warning that the largely unsustainable methods of meat production relied upon by contemporary society isn t only harmful to the environment  but will grow more expensive in the future  too  Lab grown meat and the plant based meat alternatives that companies like Beyond Meat are offering could thus be incredibly lucrative products in the near future  With lab grown meat now being cheap enough for literally anyone to buy when it was ludicrously expensive just a few years ago  there s clearly plenty of potential in this industry  As Beyond Meat prepares to make its market debut  it will doubtlessly be garnering plenty of investor interest ",2018-11-25,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/vegan-company-beyond-meat-is-getting-hungry-ahead-of-its-ipo-200362177,200362177

180493,402009,TSN,Analysts Estimate Tyson Foods  TSN  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  reports results for the quarter ended September 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 13  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This meat producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 33 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7  
Revenues are expected to be  10 15 billion  up 0 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tyson 
For Tyson  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tyson will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Tyson would post earnings of  1 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 50  delivering a surprise of  12 78  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Tyson doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-tyson-foods-tsn-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200355487,200355487

180510,402026,TSN,Should Value Investors Pick Tyson Foods  TSN  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tyson Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 7x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Tyson Foods  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Tyson Foods has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 10 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tyson Foods has a P S ratio of about 0 7  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tyson Foods currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Tyson Foods a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Tyson Foods might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F  This gives TSN a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to none higher  while the full year estimate has seen one up and three down in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 2 8  in the past month  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tyson Foods  Inc  Price and Consensus   This bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTyson Foods is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Also  with a good industry rank  top 13   the company deserves attention right now  However  over the past year  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like

180549,402065,TSN,5 Stock Picking Strategies To Beat The Market,opinion,Wall Street witnessed brutal trading last week  with the major indices suffering the worst weekly fall in more than two years  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500 tumbled 5 7  and 5 9   respectively  while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 6 5   The Facebook   NASDAQ FB   led tech selloff  Fed rates hike  and a trade war brewing between the United States and China were the major culprits However  the worries seem to be abating  thanks to the news that the Trump administration has agreed to exempt South Korea from steel tariffs and start negotiating with China to avert a global trade war  which has threatened economic growth and hammered financial markets around the world Last week  Trump signed an executive memorandum to impose tariffs of up to  60 billion on Chinese imports targeting the technology  telecommunications and apparel sectors  In response  China has proposed a list of 128 U S  products worth  3 billion as potential retaliation targets  The list includes wine  fresh fruit  dried fruit and nuts  steel pipes  modified ethanol and ginseng  with a potential 15  duty  and pork and recycled aluminum goods with a possible 25  tariff Global trade tensions are likely to threaten the nine year bull market in the weeks ahead  as talks between the two countries are yet to unfold and thus  keep volatility alive  As a result  most investors  are still cautious as to how the negotiations will take place and what its impact on the financial world will be  Further  Washington turmoil and geopolitical tensions will continue to weigh on the stocks Bulls Remain IntactAside from trade war fears  long term market fundamentals remained bullish  Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals  strong corporate earnings and the new tax legislation are the biggest catalysts for the stock market this year  Additionally  growth in the U S  economy has been solid  buoyed by an impressive labor market  higher wages  increasing consumer spending and record consumer confidence In particular  the massive  1 5 trillion tax cut is expected to provide a huge boost to stocks  This is because it will create an economic surge  boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors  increasing inflation and interest rates  Additionally  it would lead to higher earnings  increased buyback activities and fat dividends Earnings estimates for Q1 and the following quarters have gone up  with tax law changes being the most notable reason for the positive revisions  These revisions are broad based  with estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors going up  Total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  on 5 6  higher revenues for 2018  For 2019  earnings and revenues for the index are expected to be up 9 5  and 4 1   respectively Given the bullish trends  we have highlighted some stock picking ideas from the top ranked cohort for investors that could prove extremely beneficial in the current market environment  reducing the risk of a downside Low Beta StocksLow beta stocks exhibit greater levels of stability and usually lose less when the market is crumbling  Though these have lesser risks and lower returns  the stocks are considered safe and resilient Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN   having beta of 0 20 seems a good bet in this category  Based in Springdale  AR  it is one of the world s largest producers of chicken  beef  pork and prepared foods  offering a wide range of protein based and prepared foods products  It has an expected earnings growth of 25 24  for the year  ending September 2018   The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has a VGM Score of B  You can see  Value StocksValue stocks have proven to be outperformers over the long term and are less susceptible to trending markets  These stocks have strong fundamentals   earnings  dividends  book value and cash flow   that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued  These have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with their growth and blend counterparts The Missouri based Centene Corporation   NYSE CNC   is a diversified  multi national healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs  focusing on under insured and uninsured individuals  It has a Value Score of A and an estimated earnings growth of 40 95  for this year  The stock has a Zacks Rank  1 Small Cap StocksEven though small cap stocks were victims of the broad market selloff last week  they hold up much better than the larger ones  This is because small cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market  These pint sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump s protectionist stance Texas based Conns Inc    NASDAQ CONN   could be an intriguing choice given its projected earnings growth of 174 62  for the year  ending January 2019   This is a specialty retailer engaged in the selling of home appliances  including refrigerators  freezers  washers  dryers and ranges  and a variety of consumer electronics  including projection  plasma and LCD televisions  camcorders  VCRs  DVD players and home theater products  The stock has a Zacks Rank  1 and VGM Score of A Quality StocksQuality investing also seeks safety and protection against volatility  Quality stocks tend to outperform as these are rich in

Zacks Rank  1 and VGM Score of A Dividend StocksThe dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk  This is especially true as these stocks offer the best of both these world s   safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices  The companies that pay dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis While there are several top ranked options available in the space  Virginia based Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII   having a strong history of dividend growth seems to be a good pick  The company designs  builds and maintains nuclear and non nuclear ships for the U S  Navy and Coast Guard and provides after market services for military ships around the globe  Though the yield is lower

strategy seems meaningful when the market is bullish  But investors should also be ready to accept lackluster returns when the market turns bearish With intense research  we have developed a strategy which clearly shows that less risky assets can also provide investors with impressive returns only when some parameters are considered Meaning of BetaBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market Building a Low Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria For

180598,402114,TSN,Technical Analysis For Cattle  November 15  2017,opinion,"Holiday in the US may reduce demand for beefThe demand for beef is expected to decline in the US on the eve of a long weekend before Thanksgiving  Will the Cattle quotes drop 
The US meat processing factories may be partially closed on November 23 24  2017  during the Thanksgiving celebration  Traditionally  these days  the US residents have turkey  The beef price reduction may also be contributed by relatively low grain prices  used for fattening  In particular  the US company Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  reported an increase in overall profitability in meat production  However  grain is mainly used in poultry farming  The US Department of Agriculture announced an increase by 14  in beef exports from the US in January September 2017 compared with the same period of the last year 

On the daily timeframe  FCATTLE  D1 is dropping and moving to the support level of the rising trend  A downward correction is possible in case of a decrease in the demand for beef and an increase in its production 
The Parabolic indicator gives a bearish signal 
The Bollinger bands have narrowed  which means lower volatility  They are tilted down

The gives a bearish signal 
The bearish momentum may develop in case FCATTLE drops below support line of the rising trend at 155  This level may serve as an entry point  The initial stop loss may be placed above the last fractal high  the 20 month high and the Parabolic signal at 162  After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal high following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level at 162 without reaching the order at 155  we recommend cancelling the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

180643,402159,TSN,Tyson Foods  Great Earnings Guidance,opinion,"Tyson Foods  Inc   NYSE  NYSE TSN 
Shares of Tyson Foods are living up to the first part of their title name  TYSON   Just like professional boxer Mike Tyson used to knock out boxers  it seems that Tyson Foods is knocking out sales and earnings growth better than were being expected by analysts and investors alike 
The company announced that their upcoming earnings for the fiscal 2017 year will now be between  5 20 to  5 30 per share  It had previously been from  4 95 to  5 05 per share  The company narrowed down the reason for the increased guidance  indicating that their beef sales segment is performing better than expected 
Shares closed the day at  65 45 which was down  0 73 on the day  However in the after market trading session  shares Rose 6  closing at  69 38 which was up  3 93 as of 8 p m  eastern Daylight Time 
Being that shares have a 52 week high range of  76 38  it appears that with this increased guidance  shares may possibly retest those highs and if momentum and investor interest is strong enough may actually create new 52 week highs on the year  Another reason why investors may find Tyson attractive is their Hefty dividend  The company pays a dividend of   1 37   annually 
Company Comments

180731,402247,TSN,3 Consumer Staples Stocks With Strong Growth Prospects,opinion,"The consumer staples sector has been performing well of late  Lower oil prices and declining unemployment along with a resurgent housing market suggest that the economy is on a recovery mode  Domestic economic progress and a boost in infrastructure spending under President Trump s administration bode well for the sector 
Consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   had increased sharply in February and March  However  it declined in April due to less optimism in the labor market  Despite the decline  we expect consumers to remain confident regarding the economy in the near term  This positive sentiment is hence likely to translate into higher consumer spending  which accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic growth 
While estimates for GDP growth increased marginally by 0 7  in the first quarter 2017  overall growth for the year is expected to improve from last year  GDP is expected to increase 2 3  in 2017 compared with 1 9  last year  The recent improvement in financial conditions is expected to contribute to the upside 
This above trend pace will further tighten the labor market  with solid job growth expected in the coming months  That will help bump up inflation to 2  or higher over the next two years 
This is also evident from the 6 4  year to date  through May 16  2017  rally in the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF  NYSE XLP    Year to date  shares of Consumer Staples sector were up 9 1   compared with the S P 500 s 7 5  gain 
These factors signal at growth in the economy  which will boost consumer spending   a key driver for the staples sector  However  a few disruptive trends are likely to persist  which in turn are expected to influence investment approach  Headwinds like unfavorable currency  food deflation  declining volumes  potential price wars  a competitive environment  slowdown in international markets and other global issues have been hindering the sector 
Nevertheless  the economy is rebounding and investors seem to be happy with the way the quarter has shaped up till now  For the 458 S P 500 companies that have reported Q1 results  as of May 17  72 3  have beaten estimates  while 65 9  exceeded the same  as per  report  The reported figures show a stark improvement from the preceding quarter  At present  sectors like energy  finance  technology  industrials  basic materials look promising  Interestingly  the pace of growth is likely to be maintained in the second quarter as well 
Few consumer staples stocks in the S P 500 cohort like Church   Dwight Company  Inc    NYSE CHD   topped earnings and revenues expectations in its recently reported quarter  On the other hand  companies like The Kraft Heinz Company   NASDAQ KHC   and Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   lagged their earnings and revenues estimates

180732,402248,TSN,Is Tyson Foods  TSN  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Tyson Foods has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 14  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 40  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Tyson Foods  current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint of 13 57 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands much below the highs for the stock  highlighting that it could be a great entry point Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks classified Consumer Staples sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 25 66  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Tyson Foods has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 56  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Tyson Foods stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Tyson Foods has a P S ratio of about 0 58  This is way lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now   indicating that the stock is undervalued from this aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Tyson Foods currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Tyson Foods a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for Tyson Foods is 11 30  a level that is lower than the industry average of 16 52  Clearly  TSN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Tyson Foods might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives TSN a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go lower in the past thirty days compared to no upward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen three downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 3 2  in the past one month  while the full year estimate has inched lower by 0 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Tyson Foods  Inc  Price and Consensus    In light of these bearish trends  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicating why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineTyson Foods is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 22  out of over 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Further  the Zacks categorized Food   Meat Products industry has underperformed the broader market over the last one year  as evident from the chart below    So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside  Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana  Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021

180734,402250,TSN,Tyson Foods  Focus On Protein Brands Helps Propel Stock,opinion,"Shares of meat processor Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN    which have declined around 2 0  in the past one year  have been rising higher since past one month  During the said time period  Tyson Foods  shares have jumped 4 8   outperforming both the Zacks categorized  industry and the broader  sector 
While the industry grew just 1 1   the broader sector increased 1 0   We believe the company s efforts to expand protein packed products and offer nutritious products to health conscious consumers have been driving the stock lately 

Let s peep into the factors driving the stock 
Focus on Protein Packed Brands
The acquisition of AdvancePierre  completed on Jun 8   divestment of non protein businesses  Sara Lee Frozen Bakery  Kettle and Van s   and focus on growth categories and channels are in line with the company s strategy to expand its protein packed brands  Further  the acquisition will enable Tyson Foods to grow in the fastest growing portfolio of protein packed brands and expand its fresh prepared foods offering for both out of home and in home eating occasions 
Of late  consumers are shifting away from high priced beef and processed foods  Meanwhile  chicken nuggets  chicken sandwiches  wings  meatball sandwiches and bone in chicken have been witnessing higher growth  which shows that consumers are increasingly becoming health conscious and opting for chicken instead of red meat 
Tyson Foods seems to be well equipped with the categories that are currently in high demand at the national foodservice chains  Further  the company is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food service channel 
Introducing Nutritious Breakfasts
Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up  As an increasing number of health conscious U S  consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts  Tyson Foods considers it a high potential category  Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas and Stuffed Hash Browns  Tyson FoodService Fully Cooked Drumsticks  and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers 
In addition  the company remains on schedule to transition all of Tyson Foods retail branded chicken production to No Antibiotics Ever by June end  The company will also be launching organic chicken under its 100  antibiotic free NatureRaised Farms brand in July  Moreover  the company is striving to eliminate the use of human antibiotics from its U S  broiler chicken flocks by the end of Sep 2017 
Focusing on Meat Substitutes
Tyson Foods is foraying into meat substitutes as per the growing demand of the category  The company set up a venture capital fund worth  150 million to invest in companies that develop meat substitutes  The company also bought a 5  stake in a plant based protein producer  Beyond Meat Tyson Foods  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Bottom Line
Though we note that sluggishness in beef segment and increasing costs of prepared foods business have been denting the company s profits since past many quarters  we remain optimistic about Tyson Foods  efforts to aid boost profits  going ahead 
Tyson Foods currently holds Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in food stocks in the industry can consider SunOpta  Inc    NASDAQ STKL    Aramark   NYSE ARMK   and B G Foods  Inc    NYSE BGS   as valuable picks 
SunOpta has long term earnings growth rate of 15 00  and sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
Aramark and B G  both carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   have growth rates of 12 00  and 10 0   respectively

	Chicago  IL   May 11  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Merck  NYSE           Barclays  LON BARC   NYSE           Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   NASDAQ           Blackstone  NYSE BX   NYSE          and Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   NYSE          

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  

Top Research Reports for Activision  Merck and Barclays 

	Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Merck  NYSE           Barclays  NYSE         and Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ          

Merck shares have performed largely in line with the Zacks Large Cap Pharma industry in the year to date period   8 3  for MRK vs   7 6  for the industry   but the stock has handily outperformed the peer group over the past one year   17 4  vs   2 7    This favorable momentum should continue following the company s better than expected Q1 results when it beat top  and bottom line estimates and guided higher  The Zacks analyst likes Merck s new products  especially Keytruda  which should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line while management s cost cutting initiatives should help the bottom line  The company has also made significant progress with its pipeline and is working on bringing new products to the market  However  generic competition and pricing pressure will likely remain headwinds as are rising competition in the immuno oncology market   You can     

Barclays have underperformed the Zacks Foreign Banks industry this year  with BCS shares down  1 2  in the year to date period vs   9 3  gain for the industry  Questions about the British bank s capital position  regulatory questions and the strong Pound have all been contributors to this underperformance  The bank s recent quarterly results were fairly strong  reflecting impressive underwriting performance and substantial drop in losses in Non Core division  The company s efforts to restructure and simplify its operations should help outlook in the long run  but the aforementioned headwinds coupled with Brexit related uncertainties will likely remain issues for some time   You can     

Activision Blizzard shares have been strong performers this year  with the stock up  55 3  in the year to date period vs  the Zacks gaming industry s  29  gain in that same time period  The strong earnings reports for this quarter as well as the preceding one have added to the stock s momentum  The Zacks analyst likes Activision s enviable product portfolio and increasing digital revenues  both of which should continue to drive growth  Moreover  the company stands to benefit further from the acquisition of King Digital  The company s attempts to become a broad based media company are also prudent  Apart from launching a movie studio and consumer products division  the company is strengthening its presence in the lucrative e sports market  However  the hit driven and competitive nature of the video game industry begets caution   You can     

	Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Blackstone  NYSE          and Tyson Foods  NYSE

180779,402295,TSN,Is Tyson Foods  TSN  Poised For A Beat In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   is set to report second quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on May 8  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this meat producer will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  The company s earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average beat of 6 79  
Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model shows that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks Earnings ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  3 77   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is  1 10 per share  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  1 06  This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Tyson Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2 and 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Tyson Foods  Zacks Rank  2 and an Earnings ESP of  3 77  makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat 
Which Way are Estimates Treading 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 for the second quarter has declined in the last seven days and reflects a year over year decline of 1 25   However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 05 for fiscal 2017 has increased over the same time frame  reflecting a year over year growth of 15 1   Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  9 10 billion for the said quarter  down 0 76  from the year ago period Tyson Foods  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors Influencing the Quarter
Tyson deals in beef  pork  and chicken as well as processed foods  Chicken nuggets  chicken sandwiches  wings  meatball sandwiches and bone in chicken have been witnessing higher growth for the past few years  as an increasing number of health conscious consumers are opting for chicken instead of red meat due to the associated health risks Moreover  with consumers choosing to avoid high priced beef  demand for chicken is scaling higher  The company is also focusing on providing meat based snacks to consumers who are refraining from purchasing candy and overly processed foods  Tyson s food categories are in high demand at present at the national foodservice chains  Further  the company is set to make significant investments in order to improve the supply network within the food service channel  The investments are expected to translate into improved efficiency and volume growth in the near term  though it will also increase the company s costs 
Tyson has also been focusing on acquisitions to expand its portfolio  The recent acquisition of AdvancePierre Foods will enable Tyson to grow in the fastest growing portfolio of protein packed brands and expand its fresh prepared foods offering for both out of home and in home eating occasions 
Though the strong performance of Core 9 categories and foodservice top tier offerings continue to outperform the industry  the sluggish beef and pork segment remains a concern  Moreover  the company s exports have been hurt in the past few quarters due to macroeconomic headwinds 
Tyson Foods  stock declined 9 7  in the past six months wider than the  industry s decline of 2 1   Notably  the industry is part of the top 8  of the Zacks Classified industries  22 out of the 265   The broader Consumer Staples sector is placed at bottom 38  of the Zacks Classified sectors  10 out of 16  

Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat 
Energizer Holdings  Inc    NYSE ENR   has an Earnings ESP of  5 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see 
Dean Foods Company   NYSE DF   has an Earnings ESP of  5 88  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Post Holdings  Inc    NYSE POST   has an Earnings ESP of  1 67  and a Zacks Rank  3 
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research 
It s not the one you think ",2017-05-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-tyson-foods-(tsn)-poised-for-a-beat-in-q2-earnings-200187164,200187164
180780,402296,TSN,Should You Sell Tyson Foods  TSN  Before Earnings ,opinion,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   may be one such company  The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon  and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report That is because Tyson Foodsis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late  which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat  After all  analysts raising estimates right before earnings with the most up to date information possible is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TSN in this report In fact  the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at  1 10 per share for TSN  compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 06 per share  This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TSN  giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 3 77  heading into earnings season Tyson Foods  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise 
   Why is this Important A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises  and outperforming the market  Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better show a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and have returned over 28  on average in annual returns  see more   Given that TSN has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and an ESP in positive territory  investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings  You can see  Clearly  recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Tyson Foods  and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report Zacks  2017 IPO Watch List Before looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four others are a little less obvious but already show jaw dropping growth ",2017-05-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-sell-tyson-foods-(tsn)-before-earnings-200187398,200187398
180781,402297,TSN,5 Consumer Staple Stocks Set To Beat This Earnings Season,opinion,"As the earnings season picks up pace  investors seem to be happy with the way the quarter has progressed  The reported figures show stark improvement from the preceding quarter s reports  At present  sectors including finance  technology  industrials  basic materials and business services look promising and are delivering improved growth  Interestingly  the pace of growth is expected to persist in the second quarter as well  Hence  investors need to replenish their portfolio with stocks that are likely to trump estimates this season In today s discussion  we are focusing on the  sector  which is placed at bottom 25  of the Zacks Classified sectors  12 out of 16   We note that the sector has gained 7 6  so far in the year and has outperformed the S P 500 index that advanced 7 0  Factors Affecting the SectorLower oil prices and reducing unemployment rate along with a resurgent housing market  hint that the economy is on a recovery mode  Domestic economic progress and a boost in infrastructure spending under Trump s administration bode well for the sector U S  consumer confidence  which had increased sharply in February and March  declined in April due to less optimism in labor market  Despite April s decline  we expect consumers to remain confident regarding the economy in the near term  This positive sentiment is hence likely to translate into higher consumer spending However  we cannot escape the fact that many consumer staples stocks are still suffering from continued pressure in the face of foreign exchange headwinds  competitive pressure  food deflation  sluggish growth in the emerging markets  declining unit volumes and other global issues  which could limit growth  Despite the uncertainties  the Consumer Staple sector still holds some promise  given the favorable economic indicators The Season So FarOn summarizing the performance of the 358 S P 500 members that reported financial results as of May 3  we see that total earnings of these companies were up 12 9  on a year over year basis  74 3  of the companies beat EPS estimates  while total revenue increased 7 9   65 9  beat top line expectations  Per the Zacks   overall first quarter earnings for the S P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 11 9  from the year ago quarter on 6 2  rise in revenues About 62 5  of the S P 500 companies in the Consumer Staple sector have reported their results  wherein 65 0  beat earnings estimates  while 25 0  surpassed revenues estimates  While earnings rose 3 8  year over year  revenues inched up 0 1   The Consumer Staples stocks appear to be struggling in terms of revenue beating estimates  Notably  Consumer Staples is currently the last of all 16 Zacks sectors  probably due to a difficult sales environment  According to the report  the sector is expected to record top line growth of 4 0  and is likely to witness earnings growth of 4 2  this season 
A Guideline to Make Prudent ChoicesThough we know that the Consumer Staple sector has not been an outstanding performer and thus identifying winners is definitely a herculean task in such a scenario  Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one s stock picking prowess  the Zacks methodology could offer some relief Our research shows that stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  have the chance of a positive earnings surprise as high as 70   You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

180782,402298,TSN,April Jobs Bring May Highs,opinion,"The major indices had a delayed reaction to this morning s strong jobs report  but they eventually rallied into the close to give investors a great end to the week 
The S P climbed 0 41  to 2399 3 and the NASDAQ increased 0 42  to 6100 8  both of those results were new records  The Dow didn t hit an all time high today  but it did reclaim 21K with an advance of 0 26  to 21006 9  All indices were up for the week with the NASDAQ climbing 0 9   the S P up 0 6  and the Dow ahead 0 3  
To use Fed Chair Yellen s term  last month s alarmingly soft jobs report looks like it was  transitory   The economy blew past expectations in April and added 211 000 jobs  Furthermore  the unemployment rate ticked lower to 4 4   Now the market s attention will shift to the final round of the French presidential election on Sunday 
The portfolios saw several big winners today  TAZR Trader had two sells with double digit returns  while Zacks Counterstrike and Value Investor each had one  VI also bought twice today while Large Cap Trader added to two existing positions  See more below Today s Portfolio Highlights TAZR Trader  The portfolio went to the bank on Friday with two big 20   winners  First up  Kevin decided to trim a third of the FireEye  FEYE  position  as this cyber attack security company has rallied strongly to just below  15 and might consolidate around that level for a while  That small piece brought a return of 28  in less than two months  and he s still holding on to two thirds of the original position 
Meanwhile  analysts aren t responding to MasTec  MTZ  raising its guidance as enthusiastically as Kevin would like to see  which is making the editor wonder if this is as good as it gets  So he decided to sell this E C services provider to the energy and telecom sectors  Kevin bought this stock less than two months ago under  40  and it has reached the higher end of his expected target between  46 and  48  That accounts for a return of just over 20  Value Investor  There was a lot happening in the portfolio on Friday  including a double digit sell and two buys 
  BP  LON BP     This oil giant had a very solid earnings report  but most analysts are revising estimates lower since crude has remained under  50 for a lot longer than expected  So Tracey decided to sell this stock on Friday for a more than 10  return 
  Occidental  OXY     This big cap oil company is way oversold right now  especially after reporting a first quarter earnings beat and big revenue growth in its chemical division  It also has a solid balance sheet and currently has a dividend that yields just over 5   Since crude won t be under  50 forever  Tracey decided to add OXY to the portfolio 
  BanColombia  CIB    Latin America is poised to be one of the winners of a global economy that s really heating up  and yet the portfolio had no exposure to international lending  The editor changed that today with CIB  which is the largest bank in the quickly growing country of Colombia  Furthermore  earnings estimates are on the rise  making this stock a Zacks Rank  2 
The full commentary has a lot more info on all these moves Zacks Counterstrike  Shares of Applied Optoelectronics  AAOI  are nearing Jeremy s price target of  60  but the editor decided to take some profits now because the optical space is rather volatile  He sold a third of the position today and banked a nice 36 8  profit Large Cap Trader  The portfolio added 2  allocations to its positions in Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  and Chemours  CC   John is confident enough in TSN s report next week to increase his exposure  especially since the chicken giant beat expectations by 25  last time  CC reported last week and once again beat estimates  The editor felt that the solid performance and its low PEG ratio warranted a bigger position in this chemicals company  See the full write up for more Momentum Trader   Another all time high put in by the NASDAQ Composite today  Surging higher has been the name of the game for the NASDAQ and it s not showing any signs up letting up any time soon  The breakout from the previous ATH hasn t really met any resistance whatsoever   One concern for the bulls is the gap up but there s no reason that gap has to be filled in the near term  In fact  it s a level that will probably remain untouched until the next correction   The bullish trendline from the November lows remains intact  now sitting just below 6 000  The real big tech earnings are already behind us for the most part  That doesn t mean that we can t see some volatility coming up with the slew of reports due out next week  Tech has been very strong coming into last week and really didn t disappoint much this week      Dave Bartosiak

180783,402299,TSN,Align Technology  Community Health Systems  Ultra Clean Holdings  Tyson Foods And Huntsman Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   May 08  2017   Align Technology  NASDAQ        as the Bull of the Day  Community Health Systems  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Ultra Clean Holdings  NASDAQ         Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN   Inc   NYSE        and Huntsman Corporation  NYSE        

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

Align Technology  NASDAQ       is one of the strongest medical technology success stories of the past year  with 27 8  sales growth in 2016 and an expected 25   top line ramp in 2017 
	First quarter company earnings  reported on April 27  confirmed that the growth story for the  11 4 billion maker of the revolutionary dental technology Invisalign is well intact 

	In 1999  Align Technology pioneered the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the Invisalign system and by 2001 had manufactured one million unique clear aligners 

Smiles All Around for a Record Quarter
	In its quarterly report  the company delivered adjusted EPS of 85 cents  up 71  from the year ago quarter  Earnings were higher than the company s guided range of 64 67 cents and thus clobbered the consensus for a 27  beat 
	More importantly  the sales growth continues to surprise too as Align delivered its strongest quarter of Invisalign case shipment growth since early 2010  with worldwide shipments  27 1  year over year including international shipments  41  and North America up 20  
	Overall  revenues grew 30 0  year over year to a record  310 3 million in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  297 million Clear Guidance for Straighter Teeth
	For the second quarter  this growth is expected to persist  with management guiding to 25 27  case shipment growth and 26 28  revenue growth next quarter  And for full year  management is now calling for case shipment and company wide revenue growth of 25   all above analyst estimates prior to the company conference call 
	Here were comments from Align Technology President and CEO Joe Hogan  courtesy of the company press release on April 27   
	 2017 is off to a great start with first quarter revenues  volumes  gross margin and EPS above our expectations  For the quarter  net revenues were up 30  year over year  driven by strong Invisalign case shipments of 27  year over year to a record 38 9 thousand doctors shipped to during the quarter  These results reflect growth from both our North America and International regions  and higher than expected teenage cases across the board  which increased 32  year over year  

	Since the report  Wall Street analysts have moved quickly to raise their earnings estimates  bumping the full year 2016 consensus from  3 00 to  3 25 and taking 2017 profit projections up 8 4  to  3 89 

  

Community Health Systems  NYSE       has been in a slow recovery since plunging from  50 to  5 from August of 2015 to October of 2016 
	But earnings estimates still don t appear to have bottomed 
	Since the company reported last week  full year 2016 estimates have fallen further from  0 57 to  0 48 
	And 2017 profit projections dropped as well from  1 11 to  0 99 Quarterly Update
	Here were some updates from the company s recent report   
	Community Health Systems reported adjusted earnings of 8 cents per share in the first quarter of 2017  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents by 33  
	In the first quarter  net operating revenue of  4 5 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 3  but decreased 10 3  year over year 
	Total admissions of 2 1 billion decreased 11 5  and adjusted admissions of 4 5 billion declined 12 5   both on a year over year basis  On a same store basis  admissions dipped 1 5  and adjusted admissions were down 1 4   both on a year over year basis 
	In the reported quarter  total operating expense declined 6 2  to  4 4 billion  primarily due to lower salaries and benefits paid to employees  depreciation   amortization related expenses and other operating costs Financial Update
	As of Mar 31  2017  the company s total assets declined 13  year over year to  21 7 billion  Cash and cash equivalent grew 38  year over year to  247 million 
	The company paid off a substantial portion of its debt through divestures  It now has a long term debt of  14 7 billion as of Mar 31  2017  down 0 7  year over year 
	Total shareholders  equity was  1 43 billion as of Mar 31  2017  down 11 5  from year end 2016 
	Cash flow from operations was  242 million at the end of the first quarter  down 17 7  year over year from  294 million

Info Tech Leads Q1 Earnings Upgrades

	S P 500 earnings could record  12 5  y y growth in Q1 2017  the best since Q3 2011  What s hot  Info Tech  In Q1  it is clocking  15 8  annual earnings growth 

And what is HOT within Tech  Semis

Range bound Oil Prices

	NOTE  OPEC meets again  on May 25th 

	Look back to look ahead  Booming global share markets after the U S  election  in part  reflected hopes of an oil production deal  A deal eventually came to pass in late November when OPEC met in Vienna  A subsequent agreement between non OPEC producers also cut supply in December 

	That helped deliver a significant boost to crude prices 

What does this tight oil trading range portend for global markets  

	The tight range means there is neither excessive fear nor greed available to oil producing countries in 2017  It also explains why Mexico recently sold off hedges on oil prices recently  They don t want to suffer from any downside risk if this oil price story goes south 

	The rise in U S  rig count looks ominous  but this recovery to above 800 rigs is off a low number 

	1 400    That s the number of rigs seen in 2014

Tax reform is  pretty close  and it s NOT tied to getting something done with healthcare  That message from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was exactly what the market wanted  or needed  to hear  Sprinkle in a few solid earnings reports  and stocks had a solid session of gains 
The S P increased by 0 76  to 2355 8  while the Dow advanced 0 85  to 20 578 7 and the NASDAQ jumped 0 92  to 5916 8  Hopes for President Trump s pro growth agenda have been dwindling since Congress failed to pass the healthcare bill  Needless to say  stocks would take off if the administration could reignite those expectations and  eventually  get the legislation passed 
It really felt like earnings season on Thursday as several portfolios made moves based on recent data  Stocks Under  10 and Reitmeister Trading Alert each sold a position for double digit returns to lock down profits amid possible challenges  John  fine tuned  the Large Cap Trader by adding to three positions  while Tracey bought a stock for Insider Trader that enjoyed three insider buys earlier this month  Learn about all this activity in the highlights section below Today s Portfolio Highlights

But that wasn t all  John also sold the rest of BCS and swapped it with more shares of Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   DB   He thinks the portfolio will benefit more from DB if the centrist candidate  Macron  is successful in the French primary over the weekend  Read the complete commentary for more on all these moves Insider Trader  Winnebago  WGO  has a  Grand Design   but we re not talking about a new business strategy  It s the name of a popular new  towable  that dealers are finding hard to keep in stock  As a result  earnings are expected to soar 35 4  in fiscal 2017  Earlier this month  the VP   GM of Motor Homes and 2 directors bought shares of their own company  Given strong industry and company trends  Tracey thinks this is a good sign for the future and picked up WGO with a 10  allocation  By the way  the editor also sold MUSA on Thursday for an approximately 5 5  return  Read more about these moves in the full write up Surprise Trader   U S  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin gave markets a boost today when he said that the Trump administration was  pretty close  to bringing forward  major tax reform   More importantly  Mnuchin said that  whether health care gets done or health care doesn t get done  we re going to get tax reform done  
 I think the second statement is the real key  as people are growing concerned that the focus on health care reform as of late is bogging down the rest of the Trump agenda  Mnuchin s comments today have signaled that the administration hasn t forgotten about taxes  and will still be looking to make changes in this key area this year 
 This might be a bit of the market being too hopeful  but the fact that this is still on the radar for the White House is definitely helpful  Let s see what they propose in the near term before getting too excited though      Eric Dutram

Leverage Momentum Strategy with These 5 Picks

	About two decades ago  academics honed in on what we today call the  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing 

	It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future 

	At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  

Momentum versus Other Styles

	It is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares to the other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has also declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  become known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes 

	However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s 

Why Does Momentum Strategy Work 

	There is a simple reason to this  It works because we are humans 

	There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their previous highs  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early 

	Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the herd and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions 

	These behavioral issues prolong trends  and thus open up a huge opportunity for momentum players to make profits  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future 

	Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again 

Chase the Alpha

	Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no mean feat 

	Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you rake in gains from both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the stock 

Screening Parameters

Percentage Change Price  52 Weeks    Top  100    This item selects the top 100 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks  This parameter ensures that we get stocks that have appreciated the most over the past one year

Momentum    of B or better    A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers  It indicates when the timing is best to invest in a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success  Stocks with a Momentum Style Score of  A  or  B   when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2  Buy   handily outperform others  You can see   

Current Price greater than  5   The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 

Market Capitalization   Top  3000   We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value  to ensure strong liquidity

5 Consumer Staple Stocks with Long term Growth Prospects

	Backed by an improving economy and increasing consumer confidence  the consumer staples sector has been performing really well among most product categories over the past few months 

	Consumer confidence  which has been on an uptrend  is now at its highest level since the recession  The consumer confidence index surged for the second consecutive month in September  signaling that the economy is improving  Stepped up economic activities  better business conditions  housing market recovery  a buildup in inventories and improving labor market are some favorable economic indicators that play a key role in raising buyers  confidence 

	However  several events like the debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton for the U S  Presidential election 2016  along with a sudden surge in oil prices and uncertainties surrounding the Fed rate hike  are expected to spur market volatility and unnerve investors in the near term  Further  with the stage all set for the third quarter earnings season  investors  anxiety is at its peak as to how the quarter will unfold amid mixed economic data  thus fueling market speculations 

	In such a scenario  the consumer staples sector   normally defensive in nature   appears quite reliable  In fact  market experts also believe the economy is not in bad shape and these worries are short lived  as economic activity is gradually picking steam  This makes the consumer staples sector attractive 

5 Consumer Staples Stocks with Growth Potential

	To arrive at the best value picks  we first shortlisted stocks that either have a Zacks Rank  1 or  2 with a Value Style Score of  A  or  B   From among them  we selected stocks with long term growth of over 10  and finally zeroed in on five stocks that have a market capitalization of over  100 million 

	The Ridgefield  CT based The Chefs  Warehouse  Inc   NASDAQ       which is a distributor of specialty food products in the United States and Canada  has a long term earnings growth rate of 12 50   Adding further to its inherent strength story  this Zacks Rank  2 stock currently possesses a Value score of  B  and has a market cap of about  300 million 

   

	You can also add Rosemont  IL based US Foods Holding Corp   NYSE      to your portfolio  This Zacks Rank  1 company markets and distributes fresh  frozen  and dry food and non food products to foodservice customers in the United States  The stock has seen positive estimate revisions for 2016 and 2017 over the past two months  US Foods currently possesses a Value score of  A   long term earnings growth rate of 18 59  and has a market cap of about  5 billion  which make it an attractive pick 

   

	Investors can count on Aramark  NYSE       which provides food  facilities  and uniform services in North America and internationally  This company has a market cap of more than  9 billion  beta of as low as 0 57 and a long term growth rate of 11 87

180863,402379,TSN,Here s Why Tyson Foods  TSN  Stock Fell Today,opinion,"Shares of Tyson Foods   NYSE TSN    the largest processor of meat in the U S   fell about 8 9  Friday after a brokerage firm said that a class action lawsuit against the company over price manipulation was  powerfully convincing  
The lawsuit claims that Tyson  Koch Foods  and several other major players in the chicken processing business colluded to reduce production over the past several years  Other companies implicated in the lawsuit  including Pilgrim s Pride   NASDAQ PPC   and Sanderson Farms   NASDAQ SAFM   were also down on Friday 
Today s price action comes as Pivotal Research Group downgraded Tyson stock to  sell  from  buy  and cut its price target to  40 from  100  The bearish shift comes as the firm claims that the class action lawsuit may just be a serious problem for Tyson 
 Our thesis is that the class action suit has merit and will lead to intense scrutiny of the broiler sector   said Pivotal Research analyst Timothy Ramey 
Ramey continued by attempting to connect some of the dots of the case 
 We have long wondered how an industry marked by such volatility and lack of discipline could morph to a highly disciplined industry where production remains constrained and pricing remains high   he said 
Over the past several years  public perception of the food production industry has certainly taken a turn for the worst  and we re seeing many customers move away from giants like Tyson Foods in favor of organic meats 
Will this lawsuit add to this trend  Only time will tell  but it certainly doesn t look like a great PR situation for any of the companies involved right now

180864,402380,TSN,What s In Store For Philip Morris  PM  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,"Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM   is slated to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 18  Last quarter  the company posted weaker than expected results 
The tobacco major delivered positive surprise in one of the four trailing quarters  negative surprises in two and in line results in the remaining one quarter  with an average negative earnings surprise of 1 24  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Improved volumes  positive pricing  a strong brand portfolio and product innovation have been bolstering the company s results over the past few quarters  The company anticipates the trend to continue in the third quarter as well PHILIP MORRIS Price and EPS Surprise

   Additionally  Philip Morris is focusing on less harmful tobacco products in order to cater to growing demand for low risk  smokeless tobacco products  The company has considerable presence in the unconventional tobacco products category and several of its potentially less harmful products have gained popularity in the market 
In this regard  Philip Morris launched a set of Next Generation Products  NGPs  in early 2015 to attract adult consumers while reducing the risks related to tobacco products  The company has also enhanced investment in research and development for the category in 2016  These initiatives are expected to bode well in the yet to be reported quarter 
However  Philip Morris is under pressure from the anti tobacco campaigns that are rampant worldwide  Governments across the world have imposed higher excise taxes on cigarettes  forcing tobacco companies to raise prices which  in turn  are lowering volumes  Further  fake versions of top branded cigarettes sold by local retailers are denting volumes  This trend is likely to continue in the third quarter as well  thus straining both top and bottom lines 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Philip Morris is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Philip Morris is 0 00  as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at  1 22 
Zacks Rank  Philip Morris carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Although the company has a favorable Zacks Rank  its 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Some stocks in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include 
Coty Inc    NYSE COTY    with an Earnings ESP of  2 94   It sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Sanderson Farms Inc    NASDAQ SAFM    also sports a Zacks Rank  1 and has an Earnings ESP of  8 37  
Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN    also sports a Zacks Rank  2 and has an Earnings ESP of  9 48

In the trailing four quarters  the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two quarters and posted in line results in the other two quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 2 23  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Headwinds like the shift in consumer s preference away from tobacco products amid increasing cigarette prices  as well as the rise in anti tobacco campaigns globally  are likely to weigh on Reynolds  third quarter volumes 
However  product innovations should help Reynolds maintain its market share in the tobacco industry  Moreover  the company is increasing its focus on the e cigarette category that is gaining popularity  especially among young people  This is expected to contribute more toward top line growth in the yet to be reported quarter REYNOLDS AMER Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Reynolds is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to surpass earnings estimates  However  that is not the case here due to the following factors 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Reynolds is negative 3 08  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 63 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 65 cents 
Zacks Rank  Reynolds  Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some consumer staple stocks that investors may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Coty Inc    NYSE COTY    with an Earnings ESP of  2 94   It sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
Sanderson Farms Inc    NASDAQ SAFM   also sports a Zacks Rank  1 and has an Earnings ESP of  8 37

180866,402382,TSN,SUPERVALU  SVU   What Will Q2 Earnings Release Unveil ,opinion,"SUPERVALU Inc    NYSE SVU   is scheduled to report second quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 19  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 9 52  
In the trailing four quarters  the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two quarters and posted in line results in the other two quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4 66  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
SUPERVALU posted weaker than expected sales in the Retail and Save A Lot segments in second quarter fiscal 2017  Higher competition in the grocery business as well as a challenging sales and retail environment led to the decline in sales in the retail business of the company 
Further  the Save A Lot segment is affected negatively due to deflationary environment as well as unfavorable comparisons with the previous year  The company also expects the comparable sales in the second quarter to be lower than the first quarter SUPERVALU INC Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Apart from this  SUPERVALU is experiencing lower revenues due to declining fees from the company s Transition Services Agreements  TSAs  with Albertson s LLC and New Albertson s  Inc  which may result in lower profits in the future  Additionally  pharmacy headwinds owing to lower managed care reimbursement rates may put pressure on margins  This is expected to continue in the yet to be reported quarter as well 
However  SUPERVALU has undertaken several sales and margin initiatives  which have helped it to counter persistent weakness and deliver solid results in the past few quarters  The company s recent focus on retail business expansion is also expected to boost top line in the yet to be reported quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that SUPERVALU is likely to beat earnings this quarter  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to surpass earnings estimates  However  that is not the case here due to the following factors 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for SUPERVALU is 10 00  as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 11 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 10 cents 
Zacks Rank  SUPERVALU has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum

Tyson Foods Inc   NYSE TSN  
Tyson Foods is the world s largest fully integrated producer  processor and marketer of chicken and poultry based food products   It s worth noting that Tyson is also the second largest maker of corn and flour tortillas in the US  through its Mexican Original brand   TSN stock is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and it has a beta of just 0 26 
Tyson s stock is 17  higher than it was three months ago  but it still looks like a fairly priced stock   This can be seen through its forward PE and PEG of 16 81 and 1 53 respectively   TSN also has a price to sales of 0 75   When a company s price to sales is under one  there may be value present   This year  while sales are expected to slow down  EPS is actually forecasted to rise by 43 3    With a current ratio and debt to capital of 1 8 and 0 38 respectively  it is clear to see that the company is pretty liquid and that it also has a decent capital structure   Tyson has beaten our EPS consensus in three of the last four quarters   Its next earnings report is expected to be released in late November  and its Strong Buy rank shows that it has a strong chance of beating EPS expectations 
Ulta Salon  Cosmetics   Fragrance Inc   NASDAQ ULTA  
Ulta is a massive beauty retailer that provides a one stop shop for prestige  mass  and salon products and services in the US   The company offers a unique combination of over 21 000 prestige and mass beauty products across cosmetics  fragrance  haircare  skincare  bath and body products  as well as salon haircare products   ULTA is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and it has a beta of just 0 59 
Ulta s valuation is not the cheapest when looking at fundamental metrics  but the premium price tag on the stock is warranted   The company has advantages over its fellow peers  and also enjoys much larger profit margins than the rest of its industry peers   Indeed  ULTA has a trailing twelve month net margin of 8 35   while the industry s average net margin stands at only 4 32    Sales growth also exceeds the industry norm  with revenues expected to pick up by approximately 20 6  this year   EPS is forecasted to grow by 25  this year  but Ulta could surpass this mark since it has a history of consistently topping our EPS consensus estimate   Ulta is expected to deliver its next quarterly earnings report in early December

180889,402405,TSN,Leverage The Momentum Strategy With These 5 Picks,opinion,About two decades ago  academics honed in on what we today call the  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares to the other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has also declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  become known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason to this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their previous highs  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too

4 Dividend Growth Stocks for Quality Investing

	The hunt for dividend in the equity market is always steady irrespective of how the market is behaving  After all  who doesn t like a steady stream of current income along with capital gains 

	But investors should note that not all dividend stocks will give them the same protection or serve the same purpose  Yes  stable  mature and profitable companies are normally known as dividend destinations  These companies are usually good for value investing and are in demand when volatility flares up 

	Still  investors should note that companies consistently raising dividend appear safer options over the long term than companies offering higher payouts 

Inside Dividend Growth Story

	Notably  stocks with dividend growth point to quality investing   a pre requisite to making money in this volatile environment  These companies are usually strong  which allows them to increase dividend constantly  Even if the broader market nosedives  these companies are likely to stay afloat 

	Plus  if the Fed hikes interest rates  safer investing options such as government bonds are likely to start yielding higher  This in turn will mar the appeal for high yielding stocks  But the Fed s policy tightening is less threatening to stocks with consistent dividend growth 

	Also  in most cases high yielding stocks are not safe  These even may cut down their payout in an ensuing period  if the operating environment turns sour 

The Winning Strategy

	In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting a dividend growth trend  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 

5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero   This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history Most Recent Payout Ratio less than M Industry  This is the measure of dividend payment as a percentage of earnings  A relatively low payout ratio indicates the company s ability to increase dividend even during tough times 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero   This selects stocks with a strong record of revenue growth 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero   This parameter shortlists stocks with a solid earnings growth history 

Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments 
	In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers Zacks Rank Less than or Equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment VGM Style Score of B or better   This is simply a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum Market Capitalization greater than  2 billion  We have eliminated small cap stocks to ensure better flexibility and tradability 

52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Median    This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year and helps us to pick some market beating stocks 

	A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to four 

	Here are the four stocks 

Tyson Foods Inc       This is a producer  processor and seller of chicken and poultry based food products  It has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM score of A 

EnerSys      The company is into the stored energy solutions for industrial applications  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of A 

EMCOR Group Inc       The company is into the designing  operating and maintaining of mechanical and electrical systems  It also has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of A 

Convergys Corporation     It is into the provision of outsourced  integrated billing and customer care services  with a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of A

180906,402422,TSN,4 Consumer Staples Stocks Ideal For Value Investors,opinion,"The consumer staples sector has been performing well over the past few months buoyed by rising consumer confidence and improving economy  Strong recovery in the housing market and an improving labor market played a crucial role in raising buyers  confidence  Cheaper gasoline prices have also increased household wealth  which eventually boosted consumer spending 
However  August turned out to be a dismal month  weighed down bydisappointing ISM manufacturing and services index readings and soft jobs data  Further  uncertainty over the timing of the interest rate hike by the U S  Federal Reserve remains another major cause of concern 
Performance in August
Per The Wall Street Journal  the U S  factory sector showed contraction in August  highlighting manufacturers  struggles and a broader drag on the economy from weak business spending and an uncertain global outlook  The U S  service sector index also sank to its lowest level in August in more than six years  Additionally  the U S  economy created a total of 151 000 jobs in August  considerably lower than the consensus estimate of 179 000 
Another disappointment was the Department of Commerce s second estimate for second quarter GDP  Though GDP growth of 1 1  in the second quarter improved from first quarter s 0 8  growth  it was down a tenth of a percent from the initial reading 
However  despite sluggish GDP  household consumption increased 4 4  on an annualized basis  higher than 4 2  estimated earlier 
Hence  there is enough evidence that the economic picture may improve in the third quarter and the worries are short lived 
The Winning Strategy
Surging consumer confidence and indications of a stronger economy in the second half of the year make the consumer staples sector attractive  Investing in consumer staples stocks is safer because of their defensive nature  In fact  consumer staple stocks have the potential to counter headwinds from Brexit aftershocks  the Federal Reserve s still pending decision over the rate hike  impact of currency fluctuations and other global growth issues

180909,402425,TSN,Altria  MO  Shows Bright Growth Prospect Despite Macro Risks,opinion,"Marlboro owner Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO   seems to be steadily progressing on its growth trajectory despite market volatility and ongoing headwinds in the tobacco sector  The company has seen its stock price surge of almost 10  in the past twelve months and has a long term earnings growth rate of 7 38   The stock has a high dividend yield of 3 9  and a low beta score of 0 48 
The Fire Behind the Smoke of Altria
After posting negative surprises for the last two quarters in 2015  Altria made a strong start to 2016 recording both higher earnings and sales driven by strong pricing power and better than expected volume growth in first half 2016  The company even raised its full year 2016 outlook based on robust first half 2016 results 
Supported by a lower excise tax  the company witnessed a year over year increase in gross profit and operating income during the period  The company has an average positive surprise of 1 09  for the last four trailing quarters 
The core tobacco segments yielded decent results with Marlboro achieving its targeted market share in the first half  Brands like Copenhagen and Skoal also gained share during the period ALTRIA GROUP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
 

   Further Altria puts a lot of focus on developing and tapping the growing market of low risk  smokeless tobacco products like e cigarettes  Its MarkTen e cigarette brand has gained popularity after its launch in Aug 2013 
The tobacco maker expects an earnings growth of 7 5 9 5  from the adjusted diluted earnings per share of  2 80 posted in 2015  Its objective is to achieve adjusted earnings of 7  to 9  in the long term  Analysts expect earnings for 2016 and 2017 to grow 8 9  and 8 8  year over year respectively 
Altria also regularly rewards its shareholders with dividends and has recently hiked its quarterly dividend by 8   The company has a target of maximizing its shareholders return and achieving an 80  dividend payout ratio with its cash 
Concerns Remain 
Altria is facing declining volumes for last several quarters largely due to general shift of consumption away from tobacco products  Widespread anti tobacco campaigns are mainly responsible for this shift of preference 
Governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies which  in turn  are lowering cigarette consumption  The U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking 
In May 2016  the FDA expanded its restrictions to e cigarettes alongside traditional tobacco products  The FDA had announced that tobacco makers must seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15  2007  The law was extended to include e cigarettes  pipe tobacco  cigars and hookahs  also

180940,402456,TSN,A Value Investor s Stock Market,opinion,"A recent  I was reading the other day mentioned how the current stock market is confusing day traders  These traders are having a difficult time spotting trends because  there are no trends to spot 
Since the beginning of 2016  traders have been able to point to at least one particular factor responsible for driving the stock market  Stocks closely tracked the price of oil beginning back in January which was then followed by Brexit and interest rates  And now  they seem adrift as these momentum traders are unable to find any meaningful correlation between stocks and any other macro indicator 
A good time for value investors
This is welcoming news for all the value investors out there  These low correlations suggest that stocks may actually track their fundamentals as opposed to the broad macro environment  This left me thinking about an article I wrote about Warren Buffett   probably the best value investor of all time 
In   I discuss Buffett s investing strategy which is basically buying companies with strong fundamentals and trading at a reasonable price  I then use the finbox io screener to search for undervalued companies based on the following criteria 
7yr Net Income CAGR   6 
3yr Net Income CAGR   7 
ROE   9 
ROIC   6 
Capex Margin   4 
Net Income Margin   4

But now with stocks more likely to track their underlying fundamentals  earnings  growth  margins  etc   I decided to re run the screen and found 38 undervalued stocks  Pearson PLC  NYSE PSO   Tesoro Corporation  NYSE TSO   Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD   Brocade Communications Systems Inc  NASDAQ BRCD   Tyson Foods Inc  NYSE TSN  and United Technologies Corporation  NYSE UTX  are just a few of the names I found 
Value investors may want to take a closer look at these companies  With no particular factor driving the market  these stocks will likely start trending closer to their intrinsic values ",2016-09-01,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-value-investor’s-stock-market-200151442,200151442

Though we remain apprehensive about the negatives hampering this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stock s results in the near term  we expect certain favorable developments to partially offset such adversities  For instance  greater product portfolio diversification is anticipated to shield the company from variable industry specific headwinds  At present  Pilgrim s Pride is trying to capture the growing market demand for natural food products such as organic and ABF chicken  Improved sales of natural food products are estimated to boost the company s revenues in the near term  Moreover  it expects to accrue  185 million of operational improvement through cost savings and effective generation of cash flow by the end of 2016 Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks within the industry include Sanderson Farms  Inc    NASDAQ SAFM    Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN   and Activision Blizzard  Inc    NASDAQ ATVI    While both Sanderson Farms and Tyson Foods sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Activision Blizzard currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy    Confidential from ZacksBeyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-09-06,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/pilgrim's-pride-faces-macroeconomic-perils,-prospects-bleak-200152041",200152041

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research These 5 Stocks Exhibit Solid Relative Price Strength 

Earnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine whether a stock has the ability to offer considerable returns  But these are also imperative to determine whether a stock s price performance is ahead of its peers or the industry average 

If the stock s performance is lacking that of the broader groups despite having impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples  then something must be wrong 

It s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks  This is because betting on a winner always increases the odds of winning 

Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth  and are the best ways to go about this strategy 

Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains 

Screening Parameters

Relative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0

Relative   Price change   4 weeks greater than 0

Current Price greater than or equal to  5 and Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000   A minimum price of  5 is a good standard to screen low priced stocks  while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity

181007,402523,TSN,What s In The Cards For Unilever  UN  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Unilever  LON ULVR  NV   NYSE UN   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 21  Last quarter  the company delivered organic sales growth of 4 7   in local currency  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider 
Unilever has been delivering weak results since the past few quarters due to continued slowdown in the emerging markets  which account for about two thirds of the company s total revenues  Though emerging markets offer strong long term growth prospects  they are generally volatile 
Despite these challenges  Unilever has delivered organic sales growth of 4 7  in the first quarter of 2016  which was toward the upper end of the 3  to 5  range expected for the year  This was driven by pricing gain of 2  and volume growth of 2 6   Organic sales growth was weaker than 4 9  growth recorded in the preceding quarter 
Emerging markets growth improved from the preceding quarter   backed by higher volume  However  many emerging markets continued to remain weak with currency devaluation pushing up the cost of living and squeezing disposable incomes  Developed markets declined 0 3  in the quarter as against 0 3  growth in the preceding quarter with volume growth offset by widespread price deflation in Europe UNILEVER N V Price and Consensus   In the coming quarter  Unilever is likely to benefit from weak commodity prices  which will help improve its operating margins  Also  irrespective of economic conditions  consumption of personal care and hygiene products like soaps are recession proof 
Encouragingly  the company has managed to accelerate its cost containment measures to remove unnecessary costs and simplify the business  Though there are deteriorating trends in Europe  Brazil and Russia and sluggish consumer demand overall  Unilever is consistently focusing on improving its products through innovation  accelerating its cost containment measures to remove unnecessary costs and simplifying the business 
Unilever has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Stocks to Consider
The following stocks in the consumer staples sector are likely to beat earnings this season  That is because these have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 
Post Holdings  Inc    NYSE POST   with an Earnings ESP of  12 77  and a Zacks Rank  1

181021,402537,TSN,Why Philip Morris  PM  Stock Tumbled Post Brexit Decision ,opinion,"Post Brexit    Great Britain s exit from the European Union  EU     the global market is in a roller coaster ride due to a spike in volatility 
Market analysts believe that Brexit would lead to a weaker currency  owing to worries about Britain s trade with the EU  which could suffer if new trade barriers are raised  This would lead to a negative impact on Britain s Gross Domestic Product  further hitting several sectors like retail and financial services among others and therefore have an unfavorable impact on British equities 
Post Brexit  investors have become jittery and are resorting to safe haven stocks like tobacco and gold  Further the addictive nature of these stocks helps them maintain a stable share and revenue even in times of downturn  In this scenario majority the tobacco stocks have performed well  Companies with an all American exposure like Altria Group Inc    NYSE MO   and Reynolds American Inc    NYSE RAI   are insulated from the Brexit turmoil that is rattling the whole of Europe 
Shares of cigarette manufacturer Altria hit a new 52 week high of  68 00 on Jun 24  recording a healthy year to date return of 8 33   Further  Reynolds with a major exposure to America  also gained almost 1  following the Brexit decision 
Philip Morris in the Eye of the Brexit Storm
Philip Morris International Inc    NYSE PM    however  took a hit post Brexit mainly due to its significant exposure to the European market  Its share price plunged 4 1  on Jun 24  2016 after Britain decided to exit the European Union PHILIP MORRIS Price
   Philip Morris generates a significant portion of its revenues from European sales  Net revenue from the European region amounted to  26 6 billion in 2015   more than 35  of its total sales  Hence  any economic disruption affecting European consumers  ability to buy cigarettes and other tobacco products can affect the company

181038,402554,TSN,Why Is Tyson Foods  TSN  Stock Down Today ,opinion,"On Monday  shares of chicken producer and marketer Tyson Foods Inc    NYSE TSN   are down over 3 5  in afternoon trading after BMO Capital Markets downgraded its stock on a valuation call 
The firm reduced its rating on TSN stock to  Market Perform  from  Outperform   as well as lowering its price target to  69 from  78  BMO analysts said that the  overarching view  on Tyson Foods remains intact  but the  case for aggressively investing in TSN is less persuasive at current valuations and as expectations continue to build despite a surge in feed costs particularly soybean meal  
BMO Capital also warned investors that they should stay away from the company because of higher feed costs and valuation  Tyson Foods  is unlikely to grow much in the near future as any earnings per share growth this fiscal year will be driven by non operating items  analysts continued 
 The greatest risks to our downgrade are that TSN continues to exceed expectations and the market rewards TSN with a higher valuation reflecting its greater earnings power from its chicken business transformation  momentum in prepared foods  and recovery in beef packer margins   BMO analysts added in a note

This week s domestic economic front is poised to be headlined by data pointing to the health of the key U S  consumer  with the releases of April retail sales and the preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for May  Data on retail sales and consumer confidence suggest a still cautious shopper  but we think these reports underestimate what is actually occurring  as some services and experience type items aren t included in those numbers  The trend may also be shifting as consumers appear to have slowed paying down their debt balances  potentially a positive development for spending  but still seem reluctant to increase their borrowing 
However  the week s economic docket will begin tomorrow with the release of the NFIB Small Business Optimism Index  forecasted to tick higher to a level of 93 0 for April from the 92 6 posted in March  as well as wholesale inventories  with economists predicting a 0 1  month over month increase during March following the 0 5  decline in February  while the JOLTS Job Openings report will round out the day  expected to show 5 45 million jobs were available to be filled in March  matching the prior month 
Europe mixed on data and energy weakness  Asia higher
European stocks finished mixed  amid some weakness in basic materials stocks on the heels of a disappointing Chinese trade report  Energy issues also fell with early gains for oil prices reversing after an initial boost on production disruptions in Canada due to the massive wildfire and reports that Saudi Arabia replaced its long time oil minister  Also  weakness in the Italian banking sector on capital increase concerns and an analyst downgrade in the sector weighed on the markets  However  the global markets continued to digest Friday s softer than expected U S April nonfarm payroll report that appears to be dampening Fed rate hike forecasts  while Japanese stocks snapped a losing streak as the yen weakened 
Moreover  sentiment may have found support from a stronger than expected read on German factory orders for March  which rebounded from February s drop  The euro was little changed versus the U S  dollar while bond yields in the region traded lower 
Stocks in Asia finished mostly higher  despite a disappointing trade report out of China  as Friday s softer than expected U S  April labor report appeared to dampen expectations of future Fed rate hikes  Also  oil prices gained ground to lend some support to the energy sector on production disruptions in Canada due to the massive wildfire and reports that Saudi Arabia replaced its long time oil minister  Japanese equities rose  gaining ground for the first time in seven days  aided by some weakness in the yen  Mainland Chinese stocks dropped solidly following an unexpected decline in the nation s exports for April  which appeared to cause concern that the recent uptick in economic activity may be fading 
The report comes as the nation is set to deliver this week a plethora of key economic data for last month  Meanwhile  Australia s markets advanced with oil   gas and financials showing some strength to overshadow a decline in basic materials stocks  while Indian equities jumped on the dampened Fed rate hike expectations and on optimism regarding progress on the country s economic reforms  per Bloomberg  Finally  listings in Hong Kong moved to the upside  while those traded in South Korea declined 
Tomorrow s international economic calendar will offer CPI and PPI from China  trade data from Germany  industrial production from France and Italy  and import prices from the Eurozone

181142,402658,TSN,3 Stocks That Can Help Cut The Pentagon s  20 Billion Energy Bill,opinion,Can you guess what single organization consumes the largest amount of fuel in the world    more than any airline  more than any shipping firm and more than dozens of small nations  I am talking about the U S  Department of Defense  DoD   which has really felt the pain of  100 oil as it conducts missions around the globe A convoy or army vehicles traversing Afghanistan is just one example  A whole raft of extra fuel guzzling vehicles must line up at the front and the end of these moving supply chains just to provide extra security  Or think about a fighter pilot going up in the air to log his weekly practice hours  Each time  he s burning dozens of gallons of pricey jet fuel The various U S  missions really add up  Consider that the DoD burns 135 million barrels  4 2 billion gallons  of oil every year  To keep the lights on and run the computers  the DoD also must spend scarce dollars to generate 30 million MegaWatt hours of electricity each year  The total annual energy tab   20 billion  Thankfully  Washington has woken up to the problem  During the past decade  a series of programs have been launched to help find ways to sharply cut the DoD s fuel bill  A handful of companies stand to benefit  and there is a clear opportunity for investors to profit  Key goals of these programs include    Sharply boosting energy efficiency at the DoD s 300 000 buildings by installing lower power lighting  and better Heating  Ventilation and A C  HVAC  systems Identifying and implementing clean energy sources at both fixed and mobile locations  Advanced building automation that controls light and temperature more precisely Implementing micro grids  which are self contained islands of power generation and transmission  This is especially important for mobile camps where soldiers are far from the nearest base and any power grid  Supporting research to find ways to make jet fuel from biofuels  that at scale  promise to be cheaper that crude oil based jet fuel  You haven t been hearing a lot about these efforts in recent years because the DoD has mostly been laying the groundwork to make these major changes  But in the next few years  as the DoD s budget sharply shrinks  look for energy savings programs to scale up quickly    Here s a broad  buy by no means comprehensive  look at the types of efforts underway  and the companies that stand to benefit    Solazyme  Nasdaq    There has been a raft of companies looking to create fuels out of abundant organic materials  instead of crude oil   Solazyme s approach is getting the attention of the U S  military because it s algae based approach can be modified to produce gasoline  diesel and jet fuel  all of which are used on base and in battle    As an example  the U S  Navy has been testing the company s  Soladiesel   The Navy and other branches of the military are coordinating their efforts to help test and develop the biofuels industry under its  green strike  initiative  Perhaps of greatest importance  Solazyme has partnered with a range of firms  including Tyson Foods  NYSE     Chevron  NYSE     Bunge  NYSE     Unilever  NYSE    and others  These partners are expected to cultivate a range of end market opportunities for Solazyme that complement the current pursuit of military contracts    Oshkosh  NYSE    Shrinking defense budgets have pushed this stock down from  60 in 2007 and  40 in 2010 to a recent  23  The army is looking to shrink the number of rugged trucks in its fleet  which pushed Oshkosh s sales down 23  in fiscal  September  2011 to around  7 6 billion  Analysts don t expect sales to rebound in fiscal 2012 or 2013  either    Yet Oshkosh is working to break out of the rut by developing vehicles that carry fully developed power systems onboard  enabling troops to plug into it when deployed in the field   Most military trucks these days  including the ubiquitous Humvees    function as makeshift command centers  weapon launchers  ambulances  electronic jammers  and perform other roles  all of which require loads of electricity to run a smorgasbord of hardware   notes a blogger for National Defense Magazine    Oshkosh has already upgraded many of its vehicles to handle 400 amp alternators  and current research is aimed at delivering 1 000 amp units  Oshkosh focuses on medium sized trucks  known as 7 ton trucks  and not the Jeeps and Humvees that most people recognize  Meanwhile  shares have been oversold on the impact of near term defense spending cuts  according to Merrill Lynch  The firm suggests shares will rebound back to  30 as investors start look out beyond 2012  Ultralife Batteries  Nasdaq    This provider of mobile communications and power systems for soldiers in the field struggled in recent years in the face of erratic sales and profits  The arrival of GE  NYSE    veteran Michael Popielec at the end of 2010  however  should help stabilize results and  eventually  garner rising sales  His cost cutting efforts have already taken root  and it appears to boosting results  Gross margins rose nearly three percentage points in 2011  to 30   That gain came despite a pullback in sales that would normally impede margins from reduced manufacturing efficiencies    A delay in battery orders was a key setback  though the military has resumed its purchasing  and Ultralife expects sales to rise by double digits in 2012  Based on management guidance  this should help operating profits rise 50  this year  To back up the bullish outlook  Popielec recently bought roughly 40 000 shares at an average price of around  4 80  Risks to Consider  If Washington gets gridlocked again in the next year  then defense spending may take even deeper hits than are currently anticipated  That would hamper the military s ability to support these energy efficiency programs  Action to Take     These companies are pursuing projects that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in annual contracts  As these contracts take shape  investors are likely to seek the most investable angles in these key programs  You should keep tabs on these programs yourself and be ready to invest in your favorite angles whenever you think the time is right by David
