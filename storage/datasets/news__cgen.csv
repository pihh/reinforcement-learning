Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog 5 Biotechs Up More than 100  This Year  So Far The Zacks  industry has outperformed the broader Medical market so far this year  gaining 6 1  compared with an increase of 5 1  for the Medical market The Zacks Medical Biomedical and Genetics industry consists of several large as well as small pharma companies  The larger companies  which hold the majority of the industry s market capitalization  have a strong portfolio of commercial drugs and pipeline candidates  These companies also boast a strong balance sheet and a steady stream of revenues  However  the majority of the companies in the sector are small with a few to no marketed drugs  Most of these companies are in development stage especially with focus on diseases  which are rare to treat or have significant unmet need like fatty liver  uncommon cancer indications and others Some of these clinical stage biotech companies are dependent on just one pipeline candidate  Consequently  the success or failure of their key pipeline candidates in clinical studies affects a stock s price  These stocks are also affected by a partnership deal or the loss of one with a big pharma company as the latter provides significant funding for research These smaller innovative companies  in general  have been witnessing a strong 2019  driven primarily by merger and acquisition deals in the biotech sector  Several large pharma companies acquired small biotechs by paying a hefty premium to add innovative or next generation therapies to their pipeline  The large cap pharma companies are looking to add new drugs to their portfolio pipeline to offset the loss of sales from legacy drugs and avoid time  costs and uncertainty related to the development of new and innovative therapies from scratch  These deals were led by biotechs with gene therapies or cancer candidates in their pipeline Collaboration deals between large pharmaceuticals and smaller biotechs and new drug approvals have also contributed to the upside in stock prices Recently  Merck offered to buy ArQule for  2 7 billion and Sanofi  PA SASY  offered  2 5 billion for the acquisition of Synthorx  Both ArQule and Synthorx are developing therapies targeting cancer indications  Significant mergers this year included the ones between pharma behemoths namely Bristol Myers Squibb Celgene and AbbVie Allergan

111270,332785,CGEN,5 Biotech Stocks That Have More Than Doubled This Year ,opinion,It has been a roller coaster ride for the biotech sector so far this year  after a dismal 2018  While 2019 started with a bang with the announcement of the mega merger of Bristol Myers   NYSE BMY   and Celgene  NASDAQ CELG  that significantly perked up prices of quite a few stocks  these gains were partially offset due to the overall weakness in the global market  Nevertheless  the sector has again picked up in the past couple of months  primarily owing to the recent spree of mergers and acquisitions and positive pipeline readouts Overall  the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index has risen 24 7  year to date The sector has been in the spotlight since the onset of the year as a slowdown in mature products due to increasing competition and rise of biosimilars forced most pharma biotech behemoths to target lucrative buyouts in the space to bolster their pipelines  In particular  the biotechs  both small and big   which have a dominant position in the lesser competitive arena of rare diseases  gene therapy and NASH and are well equipped with path breaking technology  are acquisition targets  A slew of licensing and buyout deals is struck by most companies eyeing smaller entities with impressive pipelines  Novartis recently announced that it will acquire The Medicines Company   NASDAQ MDCO   and add a potentially transformational investigational cholesterol lowering therapy to its portfolio  Roche is finally set to acquire Spark Therapeutics after a prolonged delay  while Japanese company Astellas Pharma is taking over gene therapy company Audentes Therapeutics  Inc Meanwhile  new drug approvals and label expansions of blockbuster drugs boosted investor sentiment  Key approvals include Vyondys 53  Oxbryta  Givlaari  Reblozyl  Trikafta  Inrebic  Vyleesi and Evenity  among others Quite a few biotech companies have done well in 2019 so far  Moreover  the  industry is placed among the top 22 of the 256 Zacks ranked industries  Approval of a key drug  positive data readouts  encouraging pipeline progress and favorable regulatory updates can lead to a massive surge in the share price of a biotech company  Given the recent wave of the ongoing consolidation in the pharma biotech sector  companies with attractive portfolio pipelines witnessed a significant rally in their share prices As the year is coming to an end  let s do a quick recap of the outperformers in the biotech sector  Here we list five companies  which have seen their prices double over the year  These stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ ACAD   is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of drugs for nervous
